<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I touched the box I knew right then and there that something doesn&#x27;t feel right. It didn&#x27;t feel like a brand new box and when I opened it up my suspicion was confirmed. I have received a used or return product when I paid for a new one. The hair dryer had marks on it from previous use. I&#x27;m not happy about this.  UPDATE: I decided to use it anyways but it wouldn&#x27;t even work. I tried resetting and testing it but it won&#x27;t even turn on. The buttons are very cheaply made. When I moved the buttons it felt like it would fall apart. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer worked great...for about two months of infrequent (maybe once or twice every two weeks) use. Then it simply stopped working. Nothing. Simply wouldn&#x27;t come on when I plugged it in. I am very disappointed in its short lifespan. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it, it&#x27;s a big step up from her mothers 1960&#x27;s, THE HOTS little blue Hair Dryer that has nearly burned down the house at least 3 times already.</li>
    <li> Replaced an expensive Conair so I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be the exact same; however this one is decent in terms of drying. But the attachment on the front keeps falling off and you have to re-attach it several times when drying.</li>
    <li> This review won&#x27;t add anything new to the other positive narratives, but I thought I would contribute emphasis on how great this hair dryer is. I bought this hair dryer after my old one of 6 years started having inconsistent temperatures burst out of it. Until I started using this new one, I didn&#x27;t realize that the old one I had was so lousy. I always assumed my hair was just frizzy and prone to split ends and bending at weird angles. I suppose that might actually be true, but either way, this hair dryer leaves my hair so smooth and tight at the ends. I look forward to using it in the morning. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This dryer works very well - especially considering the low cost. All of the settings work well, the controls feel solid, is fast &amp; not crazy loud.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, works just fine. It heats up fast, has enough power, drys my hair pretty quickly. The finishing on it feels nice in my hand. Very decent product for its price.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest feeling product of any category that I have ever purchased. The air flow is minimal at best, the buttons are absolutely terrible both in design and in material quality (they are almost falling off), and the whole thing feels so cheap that continued use of it frightens me due to possible safety hazards.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer functions properly and is light enough to maneuver, but the buttons are a challenge (and I&#x27;m a middle-aged person). You need to slide them up to manipulate the heat level and another parallel set of sliding buttons to turn it on. It&#x27;s a struggle every day.</li>
    <li> I would have given this hair dryer five stars when I first got it, but it literally broke the day after my window for returns was closed. There are many options for temperature, which I adore. You can choose from cool, warm, and hot and choose high and low for each of those options. Unfortunately, the high/low option has stopped working on my dryer and I only have the high option now. The option sliders are somewhat flimsy and it suddenly just switched from low to high in the middle of drying my bangs and never switched back. With a better switch system in place I would recommend it, but now I&#x27;m stuck with a new hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t have what I paid for. It will do, but I wish I had chosen a higher quality dryer!</li>
    <li> Since switching to this hairdryer, my drying time is significantly less. It has good air power, without over heating your hair. Plus the attachments are great since I like to switch between curly and straight.</li>
    <li> My wife really like this dryer, it&#x27;s not as loud as her last dryer.</li>
    <li> My daughter says that it is easy to use and is fine.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer takes a lot longer to dry my hair with compared to the one I had in the past. I don&#x27;t notice any difference like it claimed in the description to help ease flyaways and tame hair.</li>
    <li> I usually do not like to buy something like this online but I am very pleased with this blow dryer.  It is very light (compared to my old one) and very quiet.  I have very thick, wavy hair and it dries it quickly.  My only con on this blow dryer is the cord is short compared to the extra long cord on my previous blow dryer but I think the lighter weight and quieter motor make up for this.  Good price and a good blow dryer.</li>
    <li> The honest truth is that I haven&#x27;t used this dryer. My son did use it to speed dry a project and say that it&#x27;s the best dryer ever! guess I will soon find out .</li>
    <li> I love how quickly this hair dryer works - it has cut my hair dryer time in half.  My only complaint is that it is heavy and the cord is very thick.  I would recommend it to a friend but I would warn them about the weight.</li>
    <li> Burned out about 4 months after I bought it. Total bummer. I have used Conait hair dryers for years and never had an issue before. This one was a bust :-(</li>
    <li> Lightweight and effective.  I&#x27;d give five stars if the cord was retractable or had some easier mechanism to keep it tidy, but as a hair dryer it is a great deal for the price.  Thanks Conair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Pros **&lt;br /&gt;- Low cost&lt;br /&gt;- smooth grip&lt;br /&gt;- Does a good job (constant heat, strength of fan)&lt;br /&gt;- lots of attachments&lt;br /&gt;- little loop to hang inside a cupboard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Cons **&lt;br /&gt;- The switches are flimsy. This makes it difficult to switch on or off. I feel like I&#x27;m going to break it every day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute and small and it&#x27;s just the way I like it so I can easily put it in my bag when I&#x27;m planning to go on a sleepover. It&#x27;s also quiet so it doesn&#x27;t wake my mother up whenever I dry my hair early in the morning, my old one used to wake her up from slumber and we end up arguing. So, for me this is a good one.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Speedy delivery.  Product seems good.  No problems at all thus far.  Had for about a week, so will keep watch.</li>
    <li> I havent written a review before, but wanted others to know how well this dryer works. I was on vacation and typically hate hotel dryers they take forever to dry my hair. Well, in San Diego the Hilton we were staying at had this dryer and I fell in love! I came home and used my own dryer and was so disappointed! I ordered this dryer that day, I received it in a few days and I am one happy girl! It used to take me 10 minutes to dry my hair with frizz so bad I had to flat iron. This one it takes maybe 3-5 minutes and barely any frizz at all, love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a recommendation from a freind. I think its a good haridryer, I have had no issues. My last one that just stopped working was considerably  more expensive than this one so just comparing the two this one comes out on top for sure. Lots of air flow and a large handle thats comfortable in the hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace a 15 year old Conair dryer that finally died. This one is more powerful and comes with different air flow  attachments. I have had it for about a year now. It works really well. Great product.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer was a Conair 1875 that I purchased about 10 yrs ago and still works but started to make noises. So I figured it was time to look for a new hair dryer. I purchased this Conair 22NP Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875 and it is even better than my old one. It&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold while styling and drying my hair. It dries my hair in 1/2 the time of my old one and my hair looks a lot better. I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone who is looking for a new hair dryer. It&#x27;s a great product and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re in the health care industry, often times after our patients undergo MRI and other brain imaging procedures, they need to shampoo their hair. This product is just right! Works fast!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer! It is fast and relatively quiet. I have had great hair days ever since I bought this. Since my hair dryers only seem to last a year or so, I am buying a couple extras as backup. I think this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I have two teenage girl&#x27;s and we have really put this blow dryer through the test. It works great and dries our hair quickly without the frizz. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer for the price.  Dries my hair quickly, is lighweight, and easy to use.  I bought two - one for my wife and one for me.  She likes it as much as I do.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer drives me crazy. The funnel fixture does not stay on - it falls off an average of 6 times every time I dry my hair (clearly it was not fitted properly) which makes drying my hair longer, more frustrating and less effective. I wish I could return this but unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had it too long. The dryer is otherwise average.</li>
    <li> This is for all you Dog Bathers. I wanted a dryer that would  match  some of the over-priced professional pet dryers.  This is perfect. It  blows very fast or slow. It&#x27;s also very lightweight. On cool and warm it&#x27;s not  too hot.  And it&#x27;s very quiet compared to  all of the dryers I&#x27;ve ever used. So if you&#x27;re looking for a dryer for your dog or cat, you won&#x27;t be  disappointed. And if you happen to  need it for you&#x27;re own hair it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 5 years and still working.</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting more with all the great reviews.  I had a hair dryer that finally broke after about 2 years recently.  I bought this one online because of the reviews, but I haven&#x27;t been impressed so far.  It doesn&#x27;t get as hot, takes longer to dry my hair, and seems to leave my hair feeling more brittle and easily tangled than my old dryer.  It&#x27;s fine and I&#x27;ll keep using it for the time being, but it&#x27;s nothing special in my opinion.  Save a little money and get my old one - Revlon Rvdr5034 1875w Turbo Dryer, 2 Speed, Black.  Half the price and works much better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> What company makes the same product year after year, and in doing so delivers reliability, performance, and value? Conair! This is a simple excellent product, unchanged going on 10-20 years, and well worth buying again and again.</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations in every way.</li>
    <li> ordered this because my previous dryer, the conair infiniti--smaller green one-- started having a weird smell every time i used it that I could not get rid of. Same wattage as my other one, but this one is definitely quieter. Not anything near being silent, but I was impressed with how well it dried and how hot it got for the little noise it made. At first I thought it had less power than my other one all because it wasn&#x27;t as loud, but it works great! I think the tourmaline helps make my hair shinier as well. it&#x27;s also not a slippy/glossy plastic material. Its soft and a slightly grippy, like a light velvety-suede almost. Feels nice. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> In my rush to get ready for work in the morning, it is nice to have this extra strong dryer to blow on my balding head after my shower for 90 seconds in the early morning light and make it appear that I actually have more hairs than I do. I like the ability to choose a cool as well as a hot air setting. The filter unhinges from the back for easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> This has the power I like to use to get my hair dry fast. It&#x27;s also got the low settings for really setting a curl or straightening hair. This has some force to the blow dry.</li>
    <li> This dryer did not meet my needs for a lightweight ceramic travel hair dryer; it was not lightweight enough for me, and I returned it. I ultimately I purchased a lightweight Revlon travel hair dryer from Ulta - 1875 Watts, Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Travel Hair Dryer; it is a wonderful, light weight hair dryer that I now use for both travel and home. It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and more manageable than it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
    <li> It functions all right. I do not like the speed settings design. It is not easy to push them up and down and it feels loose and not well designed.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for ionic dryers. My hair is fine and gives a flat feel.</li>
    <li> Really hard to turn on the switches. Otherwise it would be a great hair dryer.</li>
    <li> As with what the other 1* revers state this is not a good device at all. The problem I had with it however was not issues with quality of the overall products but more with the heat element! This thing couldn&#x27;t heat up and when it got there it could not hold its temperature! I found this astounding considering! I sent this back on got this babyliss http://amzn.to/1FCEgBH It is of much higher quality!</li>
    <li> Very good unit that I gave my wife for a birthday gift &amp; she loves it.  (yeah I know, cheap husband).</li>
    <li> I have always felt that Conair makes the best dryers.  It is quiet and drys your hair quickly.  Nice black color.  Lightweight.</li>
    <li> Less than two months after buying this dryer, I dropped it on the floor and a part popped off. The part is the screen on the back of the dryer (the gray part in the picture). It has a neat feature: you can remove the whole piece and the foam filter inside (that is easily cleaned) it keeps the inner parts of the dryer clean. The problem is that the filter assembly is poorly designed and cheaply constructed it should snap right back on and stay on but it is always falling off. My previous Conair dryer had just a screen in back that would get clogged and it was difficult to keep it clean but hey, it was simple and sturdy and worked for over 10 years. If you get this dryer don&#x27;t drop it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The current product has a new filter assembly that fixes the problem I described. Kudos to Conair for the update.</li>
    <li> light weight and dries my hair really fast, and you can adjust temperature to hot, warm and cold, which I like a lot</li>
    <li> Very light dryer, and has a nice grip and feel to the handle.  I have very long hair and it dried my hair very fast with very little frizz.  I would highly recommend this dryer.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly but the diffuser is a bit small.</li>
    <li> I use it quite often..Very good for this price. I hardly used the attachment that came with it..</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace an \\&quot;old\\&quot; Conair 1875 watt one.  The old one was at least 12yrs. old and was still working, but making strange noises so I decided to look for its replacement before it died at an inopportune time!  This dryer is great.  It has a lot more &#x27;wind&#x27; power than the old one did but it does not seem to get as hot, which with the power is not an issue...it does not burn my head if I stay in one place too long as the old one did.  The case is easy to hold, the dual controls are different, but better than the one it replaced.  I would recommend this hair dryer without any negative issues.  I did not want to spend a lot of money for an ion dryer and this one is perfect.  It leaves my hair much softer and manageable and does a good job of drying hair fast.  The Amazon statement did not mention &#x27;ion&#x27;...but on the box it states it is an &#x27;ion&#x27; dryer.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Conair products and used them for years. I had an old Conair hair dryer since early 2000&#x27;s and it finally took a dive. What I loved about my old dryer was how lightweight and powerful it was. I searched on Amazon for the same and/or similar style and came across this. The Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic hair dryer is as good or better than the older version, which had the same wattage. It is lightweight, powerful, and so comfortable to use. The switches were an important part for me. I love the slide switches because you can grab it by the handle and not accidentally turn it off while you&#x27;re using it. I have very long and thick hair and this gets the job done! If you&#x27;re the type of person who doesn&#x27;t want sore arms when drying your hair, this is perfect for you!</li>
    <li> Great dryer, quiet, dries hair fast, lightweight and very strong cord from unit.  Although, between the cost of the dryer and shipping it was a bit more than I wanted to spend.  Just as good as the folic dryer that cost 75.00 that died after 1 year.</li>
    <li> This is light weight, inexpensive, and was a great improvement from the travel hairdryer that finally broke after 10 years of use.  I could definitely feel the soft and smoothing effects of the tourmaline.  In fact I loved it so much that I bought another one when I was able to find it at Target for $13.  Plus it&#x27;s soft material does not scrap your walls or furniture when they rub against each other.    Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Pros: good quality, comfortable to hold in hand.   Cons: the plug is bulky (seems to be true for all hair dryers though) and the switch is a little difficult to operate.</li>
    <li> The Conair 225Comfort Touch is just that...nice and light.  It also has a rubber- like finish which makes it easy to hold.  The controls are situated well in comparison to other dryers...no danger of accidently turning it off.  The heat is GREAT!  It dries my hair quickly but doesn&#x27;t burn.  My hair has no static and looks shiny too!  And the price is attractive too.  The only thing that stopped me from giving it five stars is the short cord length.</li>
    <li> I love my dryer.  I had a Conair that lasted years and it started to slow down.  I made the mistake of purchasing another brand and used that dryer around 8-10 times.  I hated it and it actually started to melt at the opening. Horrible and took forever to dry my hair.  So, I went online and found another Conair 1875 watt like my first one.  This one is a bit heavier but it is FABULOUS!  I don&#x27;t need to put it on high, the low level works very well.  It is pretty quiet and just a great dryer which I expected after going back to the brand I should have purchased from the beginning.  If you want a lighter dryer there were other Conair to choose from, but if you don&#x27;t care about that, then get this dryer.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It looks good, light in weight, very powerful, makes my hair shine.  These new tourmaline ceramic dryers are not always what they advertise to be, but this dryer is everything it says it is and more.  It cost a little more, but it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> wife loves it and no issues</li>
    <li> I really like this blow dryer!  Doesn&#x27;t frizz hair!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Just got it about 3 months ago and have been traveling with it with a converter and it is still working well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too frizzy.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the old dryer that caught fire on my wife hands, another Conair that lasted forever until it died spectacularly, fireworks included. It was overheating before so shame on my wife for keep using it; thankfully nobody was hurt. The reviews from my wife are in: This is better, lighter, dries faster and is more ergonomic than the model she had, and the rubberish finish makes it very comfortable to handle, but it shares two fundamental flaws with its predecessor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First is the #$%#@ attachments that keep flying off the air exhaust (my wife language...sorry!) when in use, it seems the heat causes the plastic to expand, losing its tight grip with the body of the drier and becoming loose. This is a very simple thing to fix, just make it a slide and rotate slightly mechanism with a couple of plastic tabs, not rocket science and not expensive to redesign/implement. This is annoying, and I&#x27;m surprised to find Conair hasn&#x27;t fixed this for many, many years. My mother in law uses blue masking tape to keep it in place on her Conair, not an elegant but good solution (it looks terrible by the way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is cable management. The instructions (yes, I read them but believe me I&#x27;m a normal guy) is full of warnings and indications on how to use, do not misuse, handling, treating and taking care of the cable, yet Conair offers NO solution for handling the cable for storage. It cannot be rounded around the handle, it cannot be coiled, it cannot be bent at the point it connects to the handle, etc, etc there seems to be no other way to store this drier safely but with the cable in straight position, meaning you need to hang it from the ceiling or buy a very large drawer... really? It seems Conair is trying to protect itself from lawsuits by forbidding any reasonable way to handle what appears to be the weakest and more prone to damage section of the drier, with the worst consequences if it fails. This is OK, but please, give the users a solution, do not only present us the problemsa solution, do not only present us the problems</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people with fine, normal-to-thin hair and this is great. I rarely use straightening or curling irons on my hair and I try to avoid most heat because breakage is such a problem. This had just enough power that I can reasonably dry my hair while the tea pot is on the stove (2 minutes) and I still don&#x27;t have to use heat. I love it.</li>
    <li> It works great but it&#x27;s a little heavy so blowing your hair can be a little bit of a workout for your arms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned other ionic hair dryers before but none have lived up to the claims of being better than other products.  This hair dryer REALLY dries my hair in half the time of my other Conair, etc., dryers, and does so without using hotter air.  I read how ionic hair dryers work and that they&#x27;re controversial.  This one is truly amazing and worth double the price.  I wash and dry my shoulder-length hair daily and this shortens the time considerably and leaves my hair in great shape.  If in doubt -- BUY THIS HAIR DRYER!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer seemed to perform ok for a few months, but then it caught on fire.  Seems like manufacturers of electrical appliances could prevent fires.  Just good thing my wife didn&#x27;t get burned in the process.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice hair dryer, has a cool setting 3 diff temp settings and 2 diff speed settings. I knock off one star because after a month one of the points broke off on the diffuser.</li>
    <li> One of the best dryer for this price range. I like cold wave.</li>
    <li> It looks like a nice hair dryer. My hair is rather long and thin. I only used it twice and both times it knotted the ends of my hair so much. It also doesn&#x27;t have a very long cord. And it wasn&#x27;t as hot as my last hair dryer which I missed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a blow dryer practically every day for the past 30 years so I consider myself a bit of an expert.  This is one of the best blow dryers I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s light but powerful and does a great job.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight so I don&#x27;t end up with cramped arms after using these. The buttons are also placed away from my fingers so I don&#x27;t accidentally turn them off.</li>
    <li> I already owned this blow dryer, but purchased a second one for travel. I really like this dryer for it&#x27;s ease of use, temperature and air settings.  I like that the operating buttons are a slide up and down. This is a great feature since you don&#x27;t accidentally turn the blow dryer off or change the settings while you are drying your hair, like other dryers with elevated buttons. I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s thick and this blow dryer, drys it very quickly. The heat is not overly hot, it&#x27;s just right! The lower settings are perfect for styling. The dryer is also light weight. The price is lower than anywhere else and it arrived quickly and no shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Conair dryers, but this is the best one that I have ever owned.  I really like the easy open lint catcher and the super strong air flow.  It takes no time at all to dry my hair and the frizziness is greatly reduced.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This dryer has had daily use from two teenagers and their mother for eight months and still works fine. I even used it to spot-defrost a clogged drain in our freezer!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and I&#x27;m quoting her here - best hairdryer I&#x27;ve had!  For the price you can&#x27; beat it</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older Conair that finally died after about 20 years of daily use.  The new unit is impressive: it has significantly stronger airflow yet is much quieter -- in particular, it doesn&#x27;t have the high-pitched whine you expect from a blow drier.  The airflow is very well focused, not diffuse -- although it comes with a diffuser attachment if you prefer that.  My only quibble is the on/off switch, which relies on friction between your thumb and its surface in order to slide it.  You&#x27;ll quickly develop a feel for it, but a more traditional switch would have been better.  That said, it&#x27;s a minor thing; overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> i am glad that i bought this product.its powerful and if you want you can reduce the power as you wish.its the perfect thing i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for almost 2 years, and I love it. It has strong air output and is not too loud. It dries my hair quickly and is not heavy. It has low/high and cool/warm/hot settings along with a cool shot button. I find all the settings useful.     I also like the comfort touch coating on the dryer, which gives it a silky feel. After every other day use, however, some of the coating has worn away on the handle, but I consider this normal wear and it doesn&#x27;t effect the hair dryer&#x27;s function.    You will not be disappointed with this hair dryer. It is powerful, relatively lightweight, with good features and a nice design. It&#x27;s also a great price!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer replaced my old conair, which was at least ten years old (the brand tends to be durable). I like that they&#x27;ve innovated and as well as a &amp;#34;cold shot&amp;#34; you can simply set the normal temperature to cold. This is very convenient for people who are trying to take care of their hair and not fry it, or hair dry their dog without worrying about burning them.</li>
    <li> I use the medium/high setting. It&#x27;s warm enough and blows plenty of air.</li>
    <li> I rarely bother to write reviews on amazon.com but I used this hairdryer for the first time last night and I can tell it made a WORLD of difference from my previous archaic hairdryer. My hair is shiny, frizzless and it&#x27;s staying that way for a long time now--I naturally have curly and sometimes frizzy hair, this feels like a miracle. Oh and I must mention I used this hairdryer along with the conair ininiti ionic brush and my hair was dry in about 5 minutes!!! I&#x27;m very happy with the dryer. :)</li>
    <li> excellent dryer, good quality</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is the best I&#x27;ve had yet.  Its not too noisy, its not too weak or too strong and is very lightweight.  I blow dry my hair with a brush and it takes about 15mins and because its so light my arms never get tired.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is just amazing. Not only does it cut my blow drying time by more than half, it makes my hair feel softer and smoother. The hot air isn&#x27;t too hot, frying my hair like hair dryers usually do. It&#x27;s light-weight, not heavy and a really good buy.</li>
    <li> My previous hairdryer was a holdover from the Jurassic Age.  It was heavy, took forever to dry my hair, was difficult to position due to its bulkiness, and had never heard of trying to make your hair shiny let alone decreasing the summer frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted when it finally died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately jumped on Amazon and checked out the reviews.  This sounded like a decent enough dryer especially at the price.  Using it the first few times was like a visit into a parallel universe I could not believe that hairdyers have come such a long way.  Lightweight, dries my hair quickly and easily, and shine, shine, shine. Since it is the middle of summer in the middle of an Illinois cornfield my hair was resembling a not so cute brillo pad prior this purchase, but this hairdryer really cut down on the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This dryer was not only inexpensive, but also very powerful. I also like that it isn&#x27;t too heavy to hold. I have always had thick hair so this was a great purchase for me.</li>
    <li> This dryer does everything I want.  The only negative is that it is a little bigger than I had hoped.  It dries quickly, and my hair looks really good.  It does not make my hair frizzy at all.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best l have ever used.  Can see and feel the difference in the way my hair styles after drying.  Not too heavy and the controls are placed conveniently to enhance changing the temp and air velocity.  Reasonably priced and with Amazon Prime-----no tax and free 2 day shipping....hard to go wrong.</li>
    <li> The dryer is really good but came with a missing part (diffuser) but as it is not really needed, am not bothered by it. Arrived early and well packaged. Would recommend it. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a pro at blow drying my hair, but I do like two things with this hair dryer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The Concentrator - I leave this on all the time and I like how it blows air in a flat pattern across my head.  I use it after my hair is dry to flatten it out on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Reduces Fizz - My hair seems to be electrically charged with static electricity 24/7.  However, unlike my old cheap hair dryer, this one reduces all fizz to almost nothing.  I guess the science works afterall although I am not sure if tourmaline or whatever it is called actually does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the hair dryer is cheap and it blows air.  Not sure why people are complaining about the exterior of the hair dryer flaking or doing who knows what.  Coming from a 1 setting hair dryer I paid nearly nothing for to this is like a huge upgrade.  Multiple temperature settings and air speed settings - I felt like I went from a Honda Civic to a Lambo!</li>
    <li> Really like the multi temperatures and multi fan speeds.  Excellent for drying long thick hair.  I would highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> As far as temperature, this is not the hottest hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, but I do appreciate that it does the trick without me feeling like I&#x27;ve fried my hair. And, it dries my hair faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve used so it&#x27;s powerful enough. Actually, your hair suffers more damage for every minute that you have to dry it, so I personally think that the lower heat/high power combo is kind of nice. I do also notice a difference in how my hair shines afterward...so much better with this. Not anything remarkable, but noticeable. It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, as it seems to be made up of low-end materials. But it&#x27;s built well and I like the size of the concentrater attachment (I haven&#x27;t tried the diffuser yet). As far as noise, it&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect from a blow dryer. Good buy for the money, and definitely a break from overly damaging, clunky hair appliances.</li>
    <li> It drys my hair, does what it&#x27;s supposed to, pretty much says it all. If it&#x27;s alive a few years from now I&#x27;ll be impressed</li>
    <li> Conair is a great brand for hair dryers. My previous one was still going after 8 years but figured it was just time for an upgrade! This hair dryer is GREAT: heats up quickly, dries hair fast and really does have a comfortable grip. The cool air button gets cold fast too, and it&#x27;s not very loud, even on high. Great quality product for the price!</li>
    <li> I love the attachables combs and brush as a Afro American it really straighten your hair</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s lightweight and can dry your hair quickly, I&#x27;d buy this product! I generally don&#x27;t purchase Conair but after reading reviews, I was convinced. I use this blow dryer occasionally when traveling because it&#x27;s not heavy, and it gets the job done.  Con: Cord isn&#x27;t that long - would prefer a longer one especially since I like to blow dry my hair and walk around the room (I&#x27;m a multi-tasking expert).  UPDATE: It&#x27;s been 4 years since I purchased, and it&#x27;s still going strong!! I seriously recommend this product</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer over three years ago and it is still working just fine for me.  I have extremely thick hair and this dryer is able to get it dry in 15 minutes which is great.  The only issue with it is that the outside coating of the dryer did start to flake a while ago making the dryer looking a bit shabby and older.  I don&#x27;t use the styling attachment which I guess some other people had trouble with. Functionally though it has performed great over the last three years, and has withstood many many drops.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer after I got tired of using a much out of date dryer (I had been using a small travel size one that belonged to my mom -it was probably bought in the 90s XD )After that one sucked up my hair in it, i knew it was over due to buy a new one. I&#x27;ve had this one a few weeks and really like it. It&#x27;s not too loud (course i might have a different definition of &#x27;loud&#x27; after using my mom&#x27;s dryer). It has a warm, hot, cold setting and has setting of low and high. Overall Im very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> it has useful function to me. Good product at an affordable price,I do not regret buying it， like it, love it</li>
    <li> Great product for $22. I like the mat plastic touch, feels like a salon model. Kind of quiet, and comes with two extra attachments. A bit big for my taste though.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer does what it is supposed to. I like the fact that you can control the level of heat and the amount of air it blows independently.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to buy a product that actully performs exactly as it was described in the marketing materials. There&#x27;s definitely some valid technology that keeps your hair from frizzing out. Very happy with this unit. So far, this is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My favorite. Easy handling.</li>
    <li> I have only had it for a month, but it seems to be working fine. I like the fact that you have independent  temp settings and blower settings.  The rubberized grip is also a plus.  As with most products you find today, it is too early to tell about reliability...these things can crap out at any time.</li>
    <li> Lightweight.  Rubberized which makes it easy to grip.  6 possible settings, which I love.  Powerful but not overdrying.  Quiet.  Will definitely buy one of these again.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Did not have problems so far and work as expected.</li>
    <li> It works ok but it&#x27;s not the easiest drier to use. It has an odor to it and I wish it was just a little smaller in size</li>
    <li> Hair dryer is ok but the attachments are snap on and do not click in. The hair straightening attachment falls off  due to it getting so hot. A little annoying but it does the job. The hair dryer is light weight which is nice. This is not meant for people who straighten their hair often.</li>
    <li> I tend to have frizzy hair.  I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between this hair dryer or any old regular hair dryer making my hair less frizzy.  I ordered this one because my old one broke.  I&#x27;m not noticing any difference.</li>
    <li> Very well made. Perfect amount of heat and blow. Doesn&#x27;t burn your hair. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Arrived when it was supposed to. Dries my hair super fast. Nice feel to the dryer. Great price. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> After realizing that I was using a hair dryer than was easily 15 years old, I set out to find myself a new one that was up-to-date technologically but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune. My sister bought an expensive dryer and the heating element died after just a few months. I chose this Conair based on the number of positive reviews and price.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now and so far, it&#x27;s a great dryer.  It&#x27;s hot but not too hot to burn my scalp when it&#x27;s pointed at it. I like that it has 3 temperature settings and two for speed. It&#x27;s also lightweight and easy to handle.  I have very fine hair that can get dried out easily and this blow dryer has helped immensely with it - I have to blow dry my hair daily unless I put it up so its essential for me to have a dryer that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. This one has been doing a great job and my hair feels great every day!</li>
    <li> I got this as a second hair-dryer for traveling and to leave at my boyfriend&#x27;s house so I didn&#x27;t have to lug my Conair 213X Infiniti Pro (about $40, and much heavier than this one) back and forth every weekend.  This was a great choice.  The dryer is much much lighter than what I&#x27;m used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn&#x27;t feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5\\&quot; below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn&#x27;t stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.  Either way its not a problem for me since high heat hurts my head and ears and makes me feel as if I&#x27;m destroying my hair!  All-in-all its a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I needed a dryer with a diffuser attachment to dry my permed hair, so after looking at a bunch of different ones on Amazon I chose this one. I think it&#x27;s a great dryer for the cost. The diffuser works well and keeps my hair curly without making it too frizzy. It also dried it fairly quickly. I didn&#x27;t like how long the cold shot button took to work. It would also be nice if it got hotter for the lower setting. Overall, for the price, I think this was a great buy and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> so powerful and yet compact, love it!</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer, particularly for the price. Lightweight and easy to use. The air concentrator stays on even when the dryer is very hot.I know some people have mentioned that the controls are a little awkward but I really have not had a problem with that.</li>
    <li> This Hair Dryer is not powerful at all, not very hot. It does not work for me</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is efficient and easy to use.  It has enough power to dry one&#x27;s hair in a very short time without being too hot to bear.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer after using the same one at a Sheraton hotel. Who knew you could love a hairdryer! It saves me about 15 minutes drying my hair and leaves my hair smooth and not frizzy ! Don&#x27;t hesitate buy this today !!!!</li>
    <li> Got this a day earlier than expected, which is always nice.  I&#x27;ve had this model before and really like the way it dries.  I have short hair, so it takes no time at all; and with this new blower, it&#x27;s an even faster dry time!  Very good product that I recommend to anyone thinking about buying it.  Update after 4 years of daily use:  still works as good as on day one!  Cold shot button and slide work perfectly.  I clean the mesh every so often and the only sign of its age is peeling of the outside layer on the handle and body of the unit.  I needed to replace the dryer in my mother&#x27;s house for my visits and will buy this for that purpose.  I continue to highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair dryer overall, I like a lot  of hot air since I have curly, thick hair and this work well to help straighten it with a round brush.</li>
    <li> i love this dryer!&lt;br /&gt;dries the hair quick...powerfull....i love it!&lt;br /&gt;i definelly  recommended!</li>
    <li> impressed with this item. dries hair fast. feels like a gentler version for hair of those TURBO hand-dryers u can find in bathrooms that feel like they&#x27;ll blow ur skin off. only reason i&#x27;d give 4/5 star is b/c the loose cord gets kinda annoying when putting it away.</li>
    <li> Well made, dries my hair quickly. Doesn&#x27;t get overly hot to dry out my hair and give me fly aways. A lot quieter than my old hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Light, easy to use, good price, I&#x27;m very happy with this hairdryer.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my Conair hairdryer, which I had for years. I was not sure what I was going to get as a replacement and was expecting to have to pay $50 or more for a good hairdryer. One night I came on Amazon to start looking and get something in mind and head to the store.  When I saw this one, I read the reviews and decided that this was the one that I wanted. I also decided that I would order from Amazon and save myself the hassle of trying to locate this in a store. I am very happy that I decided to get this hairdryer. It is very light and I love that I have options on the settings. My old hairdryer was a lot heavier than this one and I found that my arm would get tired half way through. Not the case with this one! Plus I can get my hair dry in less time.  Another thing I really like is that it is quiet! If you are looking for a good hairdryer at a reasonable price, I highly recommend getting this one, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I hardly post any reviews but this product forced me to place one. The packaging was not in order. The attachments of the dryer were left opened in the box. It seems to me that the product is used before as there were signs of use. I never expect open box shipments from Amazon but this is an exception. The product is in working condition so I don&#x27;t want to enter into the hassles of returns. I will keep the product but not satisfied with the Shipping and handling.</li>
    <li> Very powerful! Dries my thick, wavy hair quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife to replace a really old travel size hair dryer. It&#x27;s a pretty decent hair dryer and seems to do the job without getting the hair frizzy and charged with static electricity. Overall, if this one goes out I would be looking at different brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It&#x27;s a nice looking unit with a very smooth and comfortable texture to it. The cool button is a nice feature so you can temporarily control the level of heat coming out. It&#x27;s not too loud as hair dryers go and the cord is a good length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The two slider switches that control the heat level and fan speed feel really cheap like they are going to break at any time. Also, the switches don&#x27;t have enough texture which makes them difficult to manipulate with one hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer as a gift for my girlfriend.  She really seems to like it.  I can attest that it blows hard and hot ;-)  Is there anything else you need from a hairdryer?  Oh yeah, it has widely adjustable temperature and speed...</li>
    <li> Great, quick delivery</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a wrist injury and the dryer I had was too heavy. This is super lightweight.  The plug in box thing is heavier than the dryer itself. It does a great job drying and doesn&#x27;t hurt my wrist as much. I love it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer not hot enough and the motor was slow.  I have fine hair and when using this it made my hair freezy</li>
    <li> Total bang for buck: works well and the lowest price I could find for a quality item. My last Conair lasted 10 years &amp; I hope this one is a quality item too. BTW, this is a MUCH better item than my last one...maybe I should upgrade BEFORE items break?&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the 2-way control for heat &amp; speed/flow. Confusing &amp; likely to be inadvertently switched.</li>
    <li> This has a nice rubber feel so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand. It has three settings of heat and three settings of power and gets the job done quickly. It is lightweight and small enough to store in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I bought my Conair 225NP Comfort Touch Hair Dryer nearly five years. Although I use it just about every day it has worked flawlessly. It is extremely lightweight, which makes it easy to handle. At the same time, it&#x27;s also durable. The settings are perfect. High is high and low is low. Hot is hot, warm is warm, cool is cool. (This sounds trite, but it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve suffered through hair dryers in the past where, despite a variety of settings, it always seemed the temperature was practically the same.) Even if it were to break tomorrow (and I don&#x27;t think it will) it has been more than worth the cost. I would highly recommend the Conair 225NP to anyone who wants a durable, easy to operate, and simply great hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer! It&#x27;s very lightweight and has good power. It came with two attachments. One that directs air through a more narrow rectangle, and a diffuser. It&#x27;s quieter then the model it replaced and heats up fast. Although I don&#x27;t use this daily, so far it has held up and performed well. I would recommend this. It&#x27;s a great price and IMO just as good as the one I purchased at a much higher price from the beauty store.</li>
    <li> I have had my dryer for over a year now and have had no problems with it. It works as well now as it did when I received it. It is not too noisy and it is light weight enough for me (I hate a heavy dryer). It is a full size dryer , not a travel size, and it dries my hair quickly.  I like that it has 2 blow settings and 3 heat settings.  It is easy to change settings while drying.  I use it everyday....so it has had a real workout..</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to; haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet, but the sliding switches seem really cheap. Better quality switches would have pushed it to 5 stars; shame they cut corners on the only moving piece that you actually have to manipulate to use the thing; reminding me how cheap it feels when I use it every time.</li>
    <li> I bought this Conair hair dryer to replace my old Conair, which I had for 4+ years. Unfortunately, it looks like the quality of Conair&#x27;s products has gone downhill since my previous purchase. This hair dryer has a \\&quot;Comfort Touch\\&quot; coating, which I initially thought was very nice. It feels soft to the touch rather than the slick plastic of the older models. But after just a couple of weeks of use, the coating started bubbling and peeling off in the area where I hold the hair dryer. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month and a half, and the outer coating looks positively pathetic already. I also don&#x27;t like the settings on this model--there are only two speed settings, with the lower one being barely on. The high setting is okay, but it does make me feel like I&#x27;m in a wind tunnel at times.  This hair dryer has some pros: It gets quite hot, and it&#x27;s fairly lightweight. So if you don&#x27;t mind your hair dryer looking like it&#x27;s constantly recovering from a bad sunburn after a month of use, perhaps you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This dryer is very lightweight, quiet and it dries hair quickly. The three heat settings are great.&lt;br /&gt;So why not 5 stars? I have a couple gripes.&lt;br /&gt;First, the matte effect of the dryer is produced by a plastic coating over the shiny black plastic of the dryer. After a couple months (if that), this started to flake off, and now it&#x27;s a patchwork of matte/shiny. I guess it&#x27;s just an aesthetic thing, but the words next to the controls (high/med/low) are gone entirely.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the concentrator nozzle is not very secure. It pops off with a light bump. So while I&#x27;m drying and straightening my hair, the nozzle pops off at least one or two times. I use the concentrator every time I blow dry, so this gets annoying. The diffuser, too, doesn&#x27;t stay on well. I think it&#x27;s because the attachments are made so that they click in place inside the end of the dryer rather than going over the end of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you never use an attachment and don&#x27;t care about flaking plastic, then this is otherwise a decent hair dryer. I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity because I have owned it for less than a year, but it seems to work well and doesn&#x27;t overheat.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what the attachments were for so I threw them out.  I turned it on and it blew hot air.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> My hair is a bit thick so its takes longer time to dry than usual. When I bought this dryer I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much of a difference, but it dried my hair pretty quick than the one I used to own. Good buy!</li>
    <li> I shopped around to compare prices on this Conair hairdryer and this was a steal!.  It is pretty good and it is a tourmaline ceramic hairdryer with the standard attachments. There might be more efficient more powerful hairdryers out there but you will also pay at least 4 times this price.</li>
    <li> Plastic junk.  The speed and heat setting buttons are flimsy and hard to operate. Also the smell of the motor is awful.  On most dryers the smell abates after a few uses.  This one smells as if it&#x27;s burning.</li>
    <li> Good quality, it is very light compared to the older model my wife had, seems to do the same job without the extra weight.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair and blow dry my hair straight when I have a chance. I have two children and this dryer cut my drying time to almost half! It usually takes me 45 minutes to an hour to dry my hair straight. The first time I used this one it took me a half hour! I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Trina from Staten Island</li>
    <li> I like this hairdryer. It is powerful and lightweight. Smaller, more powerful and lighter than my previous one. I was looking for the power mostly. My old one worked well for a long time but seemed to be fading so I decided to try a new one. I have pretty short hair and it&#x27;s relatively thin but it&#x27;s stubborn too and needs high power to style it the way I like and this provides that. Only 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know yet how it will hold up.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer.  When I first got it, I thought it might not be as powerful as my previous hair dryer, because it is so much quieter.  But it actually is more powerful.  It dries hair more quickly.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! I live in a college dorm and share this dryer with my roommate and it&#x27;s working perfectly!</li>
    <li> Light in weight , super fast hair dryer that dries hair in a nano second. I would recommend this great product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer for its price. Does the job, but the downside is that it can get a little heavy when you hold it up for too long.</li>
    <li> The matte finish was the first thing we noticed when we opened the hair dryer.  It is great - looks good and has a great - soft texture.  The temperature settings are low, med and high and it has a cool button for when you need a blast of cold air.  The fan can be set to low and high.  The fan moves lots of air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even an 80&#x27;s era, big hair band could save time with this product.  That kind of hair needs to be washed, rinsed, washed again and then heavily conditioned.  The conditioner softens the hair and forces it to accept massive amounts of water.  This increased water volume must be removed prior to styling or the hair will just sit there flat - like a poorly tuned guitar.  Pull the Conair 225NP from the holster, point it at the hair and get started.  The powerful DC fan moves lots of air to force its way into that mop head of hair and push the water out.  The three heat settings provide complete control over the speed of the drying process.  The entire band can share one 225NP and still be on the stage in time to rock the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medium heat and high speed fan gets hair dry fast with no friz.</li>
    <li> I saw the mixed reviews and hesitated to replace my old dryer.  But this is great.  I have really fine hair, but that is fine with this one.  I use the hot setting only for a minute to speed the process up, then switch it to warm for the rest.  I only lose body if I don&#x27;t switch it in time, which only took a few tries to get right.</li>
    <li> Wife uses it everyday. It&#x27;s pretty loud, and when it&#x27;s on high, it&#x27;ll make some houses&#x27; lights dim. But that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair dryer. It&#x27;s easy to hold. It gets super hot and I don&#x27;t like too much heat so I use the warm setting. I&#x27;m African American with super thick hair that&#x27;s hard to dry, and the warm setting gets my hair dry in minutes. I am going to buy the Conair universal comb attachment from Sally&#x27;s and see how I like it. It comes with a diffuser but I wish the dryer came with a comb attachment. Regardless it does very well. It is also a lot quieter than other hair dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it, so I&#x27;m happy. Anything to keep that nag off my back. Loud, which is a good thing, can&#x27;t hear the ball and chain complaining about the bathroom walls, sink, toilet, mirrors, lights, outlets, shower. Safe, - unfortunately. :~)</li>
    <li> Into my first month of use. There were plastic burning smells when we turn on med and high levels. Disappointed how other reviews set my expectations high only to not experience what was written.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I have ever purchased!  I have always bought the high end expensive hair dryers, but this one far exceeds any dryer I have bought!  Not too hot, light weight and my hair is dryer in 5 minutes less than my last hair dryer!  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this Hair Dryer</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old hair dryer thinking it would be a good investment but was I disappointed.  I have naturally curly hair and this dryer made it very frizzy and very dry.  Needless to say, I have gone back to my old dryer.</li>
    <li> I had first seen/used this hairdryer at a Hampton Inn and was impressed with how well it performed: quiet, powerful, and solid.  Not too heavy, with a \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; handle.  So...I bought one for myself and love it!</li>
    <li> I really am very pleased with my purchase of the Conair 225RX tourmaline Ceramic 1875 Watt hair drier.  It dries my daughter&#x27;s long thick hair much faster than my old drier.  It produces a nice strong hot breeze, yet it doesn&#x27;t get too hot that she complains of it \\&quot;burning her\\&quot; (on lower heat seting).  Her hair seems shinier too.  Whole family loves it!!!  Highly recommend it.  The price was reasonable also!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK product but I wish the on/off was a simple up &amp; down switch instead of a two part slider. The focus nozzle falls off easily. The button that allows you to lower the heat is well positioned and works quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after her old one broke.&lt;br /&gt;My wife seemed to think that price and quality were correlated with hair dryers, but after seeing the price of some of the &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; hair dryers, I decided to do a bit more research.  I bought this one because it it highly rated and reasonably priced.  I&#x27;m happy to say that my wife enjoys it and noticed no difference from her previous device which was probably over $100.</li>
    <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can beat this. It&#x27;s very similar to professional hair dryers. The diffuser is a little big, but still does the trick. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My family was traveling and was staying at a hyatt place; they provided this dryer for use in the room. My wife like it a lot, so we got one for our self to use. It drys fast, but its loud like all dryers.. so unless its quiet, its not getting that last start</li>
    <li> Whoa...amazing what a difference this hair dryer makes ! Ive owned many, none that compare to this ! No more uncontrollable or fly away hair !  Its like magic ! The best ive owned !!!</li>
    <li> I returned this. The main part of the dryer seemed high quality. The buttons and fixtures extra cheap.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Babyliss (Conair&#x27;s high-end line) and it started giving me problems roughly 4 weeks into having it. After a while I got fed up with the Babyliss and decided to purchase this well-rated hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are three temperature settings, good air flow, and two attachments for channeled or diffused air. I have curly hair, so I use both attachments and are happy with their performance. Another great thing about this product is that I can feel safe that the intake side won&#x27;t suck up my long hair and result in unfortunate hair loss. The mesh is good quality and in a tight configuration. The intake is also very easy to ope/close, which makes it easy to clean out any dust that may accumulate overtime. Whenever I clean the intake, I feel like my hair dryer is new since the air flow is so good after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I have had this hair dryer for over a year and would repurchase it for the price and functionality.</li>
    <li> Despite trying many hair conditioners and smoothers, my hair remained dry and frizzy.  Finally, someone advised me it might be my hairdryer.  I needed the concentrator attachment.  I checked Amazon&#x27;s reviews, and noted that this dryer did not work well on thick or long hair.  So, it seemed perfect for my short, thin hair.  And I am satisfied.  Even at the same 1875 Watts as my old Conair dryer, this one does not seem to get very hot and it does take longer to dry my hair, about 10-15 minutes longer. (I&#x27;ve had two \\&quot;ion\\&quot; dryers that claim to dry hair faster, and I don&#x27;t believe it.)  But, I am better able to style my hair while I dry it, and am pleased with the results.  My hair looks shiny and has almost no frizz, even in the dry air of a heated house.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. Don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer did not hold up well.  The attachments do not stay on very well and the plastic around the handle is peeling off.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> i like it alot but it does not have the airflow force that my last 1875w from another manufacturer had</li>
    <li> My hair is curly, so I think this dryer is not so stronger for my hair.</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s cute and it has strong wind that can makes my hair dry quickly. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer! Not too heavy, or bulky and does a great job of drying my long/fine hair. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is great.  Really leaves my hair soft, shiny &amp; frizz free.  Great value for the price.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  My hair is so soft and smooth.  The price is so low, and my hair turns out almost as good as it does in the salon.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and the low heat setting is definitely low heat... most blow dryers low setting seems to be more hot than low.</li>
    <li> How long it lasts will be the final determining factor in whether or not this is a good product.  I have had it for about a month.  It appears to work great.  I like the different heat and speed settings and it seems a bit gentler on my fine hair than other dryers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons are a little tough to slide up and down right out of the box, but I am sure they will loosen up with use.</li>
    <li> Provides lots of hot air to dry your hair.  It works as you would expect.  It is not quiet but it is no louder than other dryers.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this dryer based on the reviews, but it&#x27;s marginal at best.  The heat setting is pretty weak, and if you have a ton of hair, forget about it.  For me, I&#x27;ll keep using it, but my wife said she&#x27;d never be able to use this on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Love it. Not to hot, drys my hair quickly and my hair looks fab. What more could I ask for. I&#x27;m glad I did not get one of the more pricey dryers.</li>
    <li> I liked the dryer while it lasted, but it died after 8 months.  My hair dryers used to last years. What a rip-off.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer based on other reviews that I read.  It&#x27;s not heavy and it does a great job.  However, I should have read the product description in more detail--I did not notice it did not have a retractable power cord and it does not have a folding handle for easy storage.  I feel the design of the controls to be a bit flimsy--haven&#x27;t had this style in the past.  Overall,  it does the job and it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> I wanted one that blows hard and I could control the temperature too..this one works and the price was fair.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair dryer was old, crappy and the cable was starting to short out. Because I didn&#x27;t want her injured or the bathroom on fire, I decided to get her something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know much about hair dryers, but to keep this short:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked a hair stylist what makes a good hair dryer. She wasn&#x27;t sure, but she said &amp;#34;something about ions.&amp;#34; This is ionized and high-wattage. It is silky-smooth to the touch and comes with some nice attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, my wife says her hair dries in nearly half the time, her hair feels less damaged and the dryer is half the volume of her old one. Oh, and it&#x27;s an awesome price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer overall. It drys your hair quickly as promised. I should have listened to the other reviews though. I use a concentrator every use and this one is horrible. It is very lose and falls off very easy. In my 10 minutes of drying my hair the attachment fell off 7 times. I was not pleased and returned the product!</li>
    <li> This is only my second hair dryer that I have purchased in the past 13 years, and the last one I owned was a Conair.  I was skeptical about buying this hairdryer because of the reviews that the finish on it started to peel after a few months.  It works well, and it leaves my hair much more sleek and smooth than my last dryer.  I wish I had bought this sooner!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product - excellent service.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Conair dryers since college (okay, over 40 years, but did we have to go there???).  I wanted to replace my current Conair since it was starting to smell like burned hair.  This model is okay.  The positives - it is much quieter than my supersonic old dryer that sounded like a C-5A flying over head.  The negatives...the plastic coating on the black surfaces is cracking and peeling off to show a shinier black surface; the two slide controls for power and heat are hard to use, especially if you are at all arthritic.  You could break a nail and I don&#x27;t even have long fingernails!  It seems to take longer to get up to heat and I don&#x27;t know if it is really blowing as much air as powerfully as my old model.  Overall, I was kind of disappointed by Conair this time.</li>
    <li> This is a quality item for a resonable price. It is not too bulky or heavy and is well designed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer to replace one that had fewer watts and it did not have a \\&quot;cold\\&quot; function on it.  I think it does a great job, and the \\&quot;cold\\&quot; function is very nice.  It is not as loud as my old one (which was like a 747 landing in the bathroom).  The only problem that I have with it is that it is hard to turn on and off with one finger.  It might just be me but, if a person had arthritis or RA, this would not be the dryer for them.</li>
    <li> I do not like Conair products but my wife insisted to get this since the price is low. It will break, it&#x27;s just a question of when. I recommend looking at a BaByliss.</li>
    <li> i bought this hairdryer and when i came home and plugged it in, it began to smoke.  i brought it back to ulta, and they graciously replaced it after seeing the smoke for themselves.  loved the second one (same hairdryer), but it comletely died within 6 months.  would not turn on.  works well, while it works.  otherwise - a cheap hunk of plastic.  i&#x27;m not going back for round 3!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is OK, but nothing special.  It is not terribly powerful and seems to take a long time to dry my hair.  Sometimes it seems to take few minutes to actually get hot, but other times it heats OK.  I would not purchase again, but it works for now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light weight but powerful. It dries my hair without burning it. It&#x27;s a joy to use and is perfect for every day use.</li>
    <li> Bang for the buck. Bought this for my wife, since she was struggling with a spaced out hair dryer that she&#x27;s been using for many years. This worked perfectly, would recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t like a change, although it long overdue. Lives up to the expectations</li>
    <li> The fiance was complaining that her blow dryer wasn&#x27;t working....across the house I could hear her. 2 minutes later I had one ordered and then 2 days later it was at the door. The best part, after I ordered it she was complaining about me ordering it online, because &amp;#34;what if you ordered the wrong one&amp;#34; and then 2-3 days later, after she used it and told me how nice it was, I was able to finally say &amp;#34;boo ya b******&amp;#34;. So for that, I say thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great size and powerful air.  The tools that come with it are very useful and for me don&#x27;t have a problem staying on.</li>
    <li> This dryer is hard to turn on and off</li>
    <li> Happy happy happy.  Great air dryer (as per my wife).  This thing can blow some air.  Great product and feels good.</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer I have ever used.  Large impellers really put out some air which speeds drying.  Can be very powerful or not depending on the setting you choose.</li>
    <li> it doesnt damage the hair like the other dryers ive tried and its very lightweight</li>
    <li> The hand controls seem very flimsy and there are only two heat setting and when I set it at hot, it give me warm air at most.  I&#x27;d return it but I aready threw the box away.</li>
    <li> Mom was desperate for a new dryer even though she doesnt use the old one she has now.&lt;br /&gt;But besides that this was a perfect upgrade.</li>
    <li> I saw this hairdryer and i look for the comments and all of the were really good. I can say that for me this item works excellent! .. i can do my hair very fast! its not very noisy and not heavy at all.. i used it every day. The cost, i think is not expensive at all ..</li>
    <li> I had an older model that had a couple more settings.  Dries faster than old dryer and air seems cooler.  The sliders that change the heat and speed settings feel cheap and are difficult to switch when you are drying your hair.  Usually have to stop what I am doing to make a change in setttings</li>
    <li> I ve had this for about an year now, I wanted to wait some time before i posted a review. IT WORKS GREAT. I ve had no problem with it till date. Me and my 2 roommates use it on almost a daily basis, it blows really fast and we love it. The slower setting is perfect for styling and as long as you clean out the dust mesh once in 2 months, its the perfect hair dryer.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to throw a holiday fondue party, but we don&#x27;t own a fondue set. But who needs some ritzy expensive contraption just to heat up cheese? This is the 21st century; we have the technology. I decided to build a fondue set better than before. Cheaper. Faster. *Meltier.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used one of these hair dryers and it felt like it was melting the scalp off my skull, so I figured it would make quick work of cheese. I dropped a block of aged cheddar onto a plate and blasted it, point-blank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten minutes in, and nothing happened. Twenty minutes, still no melting. An aroma I imagine to be something like the Jock Strap from the Black Lagoon made its way around the kitchen, but the cheddar wasn&#x27;t budging. After half an hour, I gave up. Or passed out from the fumes; the details are still sort of fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at the end of the day, all I had was warm cheese, a tired arm and a lingering funk that could drop a reindeer at forty paces. And now every time I dry my hair, I have flashbacks of swampy underpants. Not cool.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a 14 year old Conair sufferering from heating element failure.  The old I got for its claim that it was quiet, to use near my sound sensitive husband and hoped that this would be the same.  It is and more!  It does not claim to be quiet but it is.  It is delightfully light to hold too.  The 6 setting options work well.  I am more than satisfied, I now hope for a long lasting relationship.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it could get a little hotter, but that may be a good thing for your hair.</li>
    <li> I had my last hair dryer for 8 years, it finally burnt out on me. It was also a Conair, and so I thought i would stick with what I knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really thin hair, that dries if a breeze blows through the apartment. I just need a simple hairdryer, easy to use, with a cord that retracts. This dryer does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the On/off and low/med/high heat buttons. they arent raised, they only have bumps so that your fingers ahve to either press down hard and hope the friction works, or you use a nail to force them up. many times my hands have been oily from lotion, or even dry as the desert and they wont move. its a little frustrating.</li>
    <li> happy with my new hair dryer, dries hair fast even with warm or cool setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cord could be just a little longer, but overall excellent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow drier for over 5 years and still love it. Very powerful and love the fact that it has a cool, warm and hot setting as well as low med or high power. I like using the warm setting with high power its great! Nicely dries my long curly hair.</li>
    <li> It functions well with low noise and high efficiency! There are also several modes for you to choose, seems really humanized！</li>
    <li> So, we bought this dryer as a replacement for my wife&#x27;s old, loud unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unboxed it, and it felt nice and solidly built. And it was about mid-range, volume wise. Also a good selection of heat and fan-speed adjustments. But, the first morning of use, it ran for about 3-4 minutes, then the breaker-plug began to buzz loudly, and emit smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All use was discontinued, and was returned for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I award it 2 stars for it being a potentially good unit, but subtract 3 for failing. This seems like a fluke, as most of the reviews are positive, but I&#x27;m going to be searching for a different dryer anyway.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune like so many others out there.</li>
    <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;Strong&lt;br /&gt;Still working, so reliable 2 years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Can be hard to switch on when your hands are slightly moist. It really annoys me, but it really does work fine, one you get it on. I wish the switch had ridges that were more raise. zoom in on the picture and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Does the job, and a good price. Could be more powerful.</li>
    <li> Gets my hair dry faster than my old dryer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think that they made a better hair dryer than the one I had previously, but I was wrong. This is hands down the BEST hair dryer I have ever had. It has a variety of settings, works fast and is light. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> a bit oversized, but just the dryer my women were looking for. Has a soft rubbery surface, very good construction, blows hard and dries fast. Made me remember when I used to have hair... Buy with confidence. Can&#x60;t go wrong with this one</li>
    <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t used it long yet. I&#x27;m still using it. It works well. But hard to put in all those extra feature to blow dry my hair. We&#x27;ll see how good/long it will last me...</li>
    <li> For what you pay for... BUY IT. Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. Threw my $70 blow dryer under the sink and only use this one!</li>
    <li> I lowered one star because it does not come in the color that shows in the picture. mine was black. I know it is being picky but I liked the gray color better. Another thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that is does not come with different heat settings, only speed settings.</li>
    <li> Way better than my previous dryer. I was cheap. I was trying to save money for a while... in the worst ways possible. I ended up buying this $11 dryer because it was cheap.  And for a year, I went around with wet hair. I tried to tell myself that it was okay because of all the money I was saving. But it did not feel okay. I finally ended up getting this dryer though and it was like night and day. This dryer works so quickly. It makes you save time and time is the most precious resource of all. It will dry hair quickly and efficiently.  I do not use any of the attachments that come with it. But if you style your hair, just know, those are options too.</li>
    <li> MY second one. One for each house!</li>
    <li> Not great but not awful. I hate the buttons, which require awkward angled sliding. I find myself scraping my thumbs on the thin slider buttons, struggling to get them to slide. From a drying perspective, it gets the job done. If you&#x27;re not picky and are looking for a cheap, functional dryer, this works.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been better!!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer functions as it should and meets all expectations... however, to me, there is just one con. The fan speed adjustment slider is a bad design. I constantly like to adjust the fan speed when I blow dry or style my hair and, if not careful, the adjuster piece can pinch you palm area if it&#x27;s resting in the area where the adjustment piece slides down.... not quite sure how to describe it. Well, after getting pinched once it never happened again because now I&#x27;m aware - though it sucked the first time. Just a FYI!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the comfort touch finish.  This makes it very comfortable to use.  I am concerned about the quality of the plastic on the switches.  I am concerned they won&#x27;t last as long as the rest of they dryer.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer. It has good functions available and it blows good, quiet heat. Although it&#x27;s a bit heavy to hold..</li>
    <li> Works really well. My hair is short but it did what I wanted it to do.  Good investment.</li>
    <li> Very nice and lighter weight than previous models.  Dries well.</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer ever my only complaint is that mine cracked after a year. But it still works so I guess not a problem.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair in less than 5 minutes!  I have thick hair and it takes too long to dry my hair but with this hair dryer, it makes my life easier especially in the morning.</li>
    <li> It was OK - liked the heaviness of it but was nothing more than just a drugstore blow dryer. Was hoping for  more of a difference due to the &amp;#34;Tourmaline Ceramic&amp;#34; name but nothing special or different than my last Conair blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a great blow dryer for the value.  We bought this one and another brand from a retailer. This is definitely the better dryer.</li>
    <li> I was happy with my new dryer but totally burnt after a month use. Lucikly we have not any injuries!!!</li>
    <li> This is lightweight, not earsplitting and works reasonably quickly for a good price.  I like the variety of heat and wind settings.  The black, &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; coating has developed a network of lines that could be cracks.  This has not, as yet, caused a problem, but the regular finish might have been a better choice.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  I used a similar one at Planet Hollywood in Vegas and tracked it down when I got home.  I have wavy hair that always frizzes into a puff ball when I use a hairdryer.  I had switched from my old dryer to the Remington Wet2Straight which I thought was the greatest invention ever, but this dryer quickly replaced it.  The key is the high power motor, it gets my entire head dry in less than 10 minutes, with no frizz.  A quick run through with a straightener after I&#x27;m done is all I need.  Plus it&#x27;s lightweight and quiet.  This product saves me at least 15 minutes in the morning that I used to waste getting frustrated with my hair...try it!</li>
    <li> Decent hairdryer, but doesn&#x27;t really help my hair&#x27;s tendency to frizz. Also don&#x27;t like the placement of the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button, I&#x27;m always pressing it accidentally. Overall, fine but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> light weight and powerful</li>
    <li> Our clients love it. It has a quality look to it.</li>
    <li> good buy for the money.  Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Would be ok if it actually got hot air coming out</li>
    <li> I have used a conair dryer before and liked it.  The last one a had lasted about 13 years, so I thought I would go with the conair&lt;br /&gt;again, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this hairdryer and I almost use it everyday. The wind is strong from the hairdryer and dry my hair fast.</li>
    <li> It really seems to diminish the frizz. It has 3 heats and 2 speeding that works fine. It&#x27;s easy and light to hold. The only con is that the switch for heat and speed seems kind of cheap.</li>
    <li> My old Conair died so I read all the reviews and decided on this hairdryer.  Very satisfied.  The weight is good, the attachments are fine, and the price was right!  You don&#x27;t need anything better.  I really like the ability to open the cover to get to the mesh filter to clean it and the 3 heat settings and 3 blower settings. A winner!</li>
    <li> something I did not see in the other reviews.  Amount of air coming through it.  It moves alot of air.  Wife needed that..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had trouble with frizzy hair-- until I started going gray. My hair is fine and oily so I can&#x27;t use argan oil or anything like that to smooth it. I tried hair spray, but I hate the stiffness. When my old hair dryer died, I replaced it with this one and now my problem is solved: no more frizz!</li>
    <li> Dryer is super quiet-at least compared to my old one. Hair dries fast and soft. I love the adjustable heat and the cold shot to set my hair.  Probably if I could change anything, I would make it have a retractable cord and the buttons are a little awkward, but it runs great and dries my hair quickly and doesn&#x27;t fry it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer on Friday, and received it on Monday! Extremely fast shipper. And the hairdryer works amazing. The air heats up extremely quickly, and it dried my hair so fast without damaging it. Overall, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with how awesome this hair dryer is for the price!!!</li>
    <li> My wife tells me she loves this dryer, and rates it \\&quot;excellent.\\&quot; She owned an earlier version of this model for about 8 years, and was happy enough with that one that I purchased this one for her when the old one finally gave out. She says this one is so much better. It really works and handles like a professional unit.</li>
    <li> I have had it for about 2-3 months and its just perfect!!! I love the color love the way it works and I am so happy that it has the different heat and strength levels! It dries my hair so fast and it stays flat most of the times even when it&#x27;s humid outside!</li>
    <li> I always hate to order a hair dryer without being able to pick it up and feel how heavy it is, but I took a chance on this one.  Conair continues to produce excellent products -- hair dryer is multifunctional and lightweight...Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer the only thing it is missing is a retractable cord</li>
    <li> My hair dryer took a dump and nothing I hate more than finding another one.  After reading the reviews, I purchased the Conair Pro Styler Ionic Conditioning Hair Dryer.  It was ok but did nothing for my fine thin hair.  I was going to get another Revlon hair dryer but thought ok I will give this one a try even though it has the same wattage as the Conair Pro Styler and with a 35% Amazon Prime Member Sale Discount, what the heck, I really couldn&#x27;t go too wrong. Love it!  My hair was much smoother and the mild curl I like was put into my hair with ease. Minimal fly aways which the Revlon didn&#x27;t minimize.  Found my dryer!</li>
    <li> For the price, this hair buyer is wonderful. My hair is seriously prone to being frizzy, and with (1) being tourmaline ceramic, (2) having a warm setting as well as a cool and hot, and (3) having a concentrator, my hair has started acting much better. It&#x27;s also fairly quiet. The lack of five stars is because it isn&#x27;t particularly easy to store; it barely fits in the normal-size drawer, and including the diffuser, concentrator, and a hairbrush, it can be challenging to fit it in the drawer. Definitely a wonderful buy, though.</li>
    <li> Really like this dryer and have been using forever.  It&#x27;s time to replace mine and will probably buy same one.</li>
    <li> I love it. I have been using this hair dryer for almost two years, and had no issues with it.</li>
    <li> Dries well but difficult to change settings with one hand.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a bunch of nonsense when I read this hair dryer did all these awesome things to your hair, but it actually reduces frizz. I&#x27;m not sure if all hair dryers do this or if it&#x27;s just this hair dryer, but whenever I use it I notice my hair is a lot smoother and easier to brush through. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and no problems, definitely would buy again!</li>
    <li> i did not used it yet, but i like this color. it is so cool. and i will use it .</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair that takes FOREVER to dry, and then it is frizzy. This dryer is amazing. I can dry my hair fairly quickly on both the warm/high setting and the hot/medium one. My hair is fairly smooth at the end. I just need a quick run through the top layer with the straight iron. It is also much quieter than other hair dryers I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;m hoping it is reliable and lasts a while. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Lighter than my previous hair dryer.  And it dries faster with softer results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this dryer. It leaves my fine, thin hair soft, silky and dries it in seconds. It&#x27;s a good hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have a cheaper model from Conair and like it better.  On low speed, it isn&#x27;t powerful enough and on high, it is too powerful.  All in all, I am okay with it but do like the other one better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for about a week but I&#x27;m pretty impressed so far.  I had my old hairdryer for at least 6 years and it finally crapped out on me - it was just a Revlon that I had gotten from Walmart or somewhere.  I considered spending about $30 more on a nicer dryer, but decided I&#x27;d try a Conair first since it was cheaper and my mom has one that I love using when I go home.  So I ordered this guy (which came in two days - gotta love Amazon Prime when you don&#x27;t have a working hair dryer) and was initially kind of bummed when I opened it.  I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.  I don&#x27;t know how long this guy will last and I can see the matte casing eventually peeling off like the other reviewer mentioned, but it&#x27;s functionality is fantastic for the price.  Would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like the two gadgets that come with it.  They help keep me from burning my hair to a crisp.  The cooling down button is a bonus as well.  The length of the cord is fairly long and you can adjust the heat settings along with how high you want the air to go.  I wish there was more heat behind the settings though.  I seem to be drying my hair for a few minutes longer than I did with my previous dryer.  But all in all, good value with lots of gadgets.</li>
    <li> Dries hair relatively fast. The only disappointment would be the quality of the switches.  They seem flimsy and may not hold up well.</li>
    <li> This is a good hairdryer and worked well on my long, thick hair.  It is quieter than my previous model.  And my Border Collie likes the diffuser when she has to have her hair dried:  quieter and not as directed with the warm air.  Only awarded four stars as the slide switches are a bit difficult to use.  It would be better for me if the ridges on them were a bit larger to enable changing the setting without damaging fingernails or manicure. Happy with purchase; glad that I selected this model; would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pros - lighter and smaller than my 25+ year old blow dryer, separate controls for temperature and air, filter can be opened for cleaning, came with a diffuser, the &amp;#34;cold shot&amp;#34; is a good idea though I&#x27;ve not used it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - well, I&#x27;m a little confused/disappointed that my hair seemed to dry quicker with the old &amp;#34;relic&amp;#34; and that was my only reason for deducting a star</li>
    <li> I had a more expensive ceramic hair dryer but after taking it apart to clean hair out of it I couldn&#x27;t get it back together quite right.  So I bought this one.  I like it because it&#x27;s much lighter in weight but I&#x27;m also worried that that means it&#x27;s cheaper quality!  But so far so good.  It blows plenty of hair and gets plenty hot, but this is a good thing as long as you keep it moving.  If you want to aim it at one part of your head without moving it, just turn the heat level down a bit.</li>
    <li> I do agree that a ceramic hair dryer leaves my hair with a smoother texture as described in the other reviews, but it is not nearly as powerful as I had hoped and the black rubber texture peels off all over my fingers when I am using it. Between my three girls and myself I do a lot of blow drying and I don&#x27;t think this one is going to go the distance with us. I am disappointed because I did a little research and was hoping this one would be better than it is! After just a month or two of use I am already shopping for a new one.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and need a blow dryer that has some power behind it.  This does the trick, nice grip handle, light in weight.</li>
    <li> like the product.  I like the cold setting and would reccommend</li>
    <li> The dryer does an adequate job, but doesn&#x27;t seem to generate the same level of heat that my previous 1875 watt dryer did. The attachment to direct the air flow also doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. I have been using this dryer for about six months, so I think I have had it plenty of time to get used to, but still I don&#x27;t like it as well as my previous one.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Easy to store. Dries quickly. Nice design and fits in with my bathroom décor. I would definitely buy product again if needed or for a gift.</li>
    <li> I have been thru my shares of hair dryers? what girl hasn&#x27;t!!&lt;br /&gt; I found this one to be awesome. It is so QUITE!!!! My husband works third shift so he sleeps during the day. I shower and do my hair during the day... My old dryers use to wake him up...  :( .. but this one is awesome, so quite yet SO powerful. i have thick hair which takes forever to dry... now it seems like I&#x27;m drying half the time!!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer has been really great. The only reason I did not give it the full 5 stars is because the matte film on the dryer has begun to peel off. As far as the function, the blow dryer is really handy and useful.</li>
    <li> Came super quick (thanks amazon!) and was a good price!  This just was more convenient to me than going to my local Target and looking through their whole selection, the reviews on Amazon can be so helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its fairly light weight, not too noisy, and seems to work just fine.  My previous model was very simliar, a Revalon.  I see no difference between the two.  I&#x27;m sure the &#x27;soft touch&#x27; material will eventually peel off like my previous one did but that doesn&#x27;t really concern me!</li>
    <li> This dryer works so good. I have really coarse and thick hair and it used to take me a really long time to blow dry my hair (with an ordinary dryer). Now I bet I have cut down my drying time by at least half if not more. Can&#x27;t beat the price for this type of technology!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, I really just bought this because it looked like the manliest looking hairdryer out there.&lt;br /&gt;But I will say, my hair is nice and soft and much easier to hold its style. I&#x27;ve even used it for manly tasks such as drying primer, and glue.</li>
    <li> it dries hair well, but the attachment keeps falling off while I&amp;#34;m drying my hair. it also gets quite hot.returning it</li>
    <li> Great Hair Dryer! 3 heat settings and 3 fan speeds. Much quieter than my older model. Moves a lot of air. Light weight with rubberized coating. Detachable fan screen for cleaning. Great Product. Only con is the switches seem cheap, made of flimsy plastic.</li>
    <li> works great, no need to purchase a hairdryer with a price tag higher than this...</li>
    <li> Great dryer! Lighter weight and less damaging than my old one. This is being picky, but I wish the switched the positions of the power and heat setting buttons. I hold the dryer in my left hand and the brush in my right (do other righties do this?). My left thumb is closest to the heat setting button (that I never change) and farther away from the on/off switch (which I use between every section of hair. The result? Accidentally switching the hear setting to &amp;#34;blast furnace&amp;#34; and burning my scalp. Conair, one little change, please!</li>
    <li> The only drawback to this hairdryer is that it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;have three fan speeds.  A medium fan speed setting&lt;br /&gt;would be a real plus.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as quiet as some of the very high-end dryers, but it&#x27;s still quieter than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I like most about this dryer is the 3 position heat setting - you can get reasonably cold air without having to hold down a spring-loaded button (which gets kinda old)</li>
    <li> I love it so far!&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it has not just the cold and hot button but a warm one as well, which is great because the hot is always too hot for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got really thick hair and it gets the job done in a decent time.</li>
    <li> Hairdryer dries quickly and leaves your hair less dried out. The only qualm is the cord could have been an extra foot or two, but it still works fine.</li>
    <li> This dryer is different than any dryer I have had before. First off its very light. Second it doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair like normal dryers do with high heat. This still produces heat but not like the old dryers that will burn your hair off.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer about 14 months ago and it worked great when I got it but now it&#x27;s not blowing strong, it&#x27;s feels like it&#x27;s on a low setting instead of high. I&#x27;m looking for a new blow dryer because I know this one is about to die.</li>
    <li> It does the job. Doesn&#x27;t work magic like I was hoping for though.  It is nice an light and I appreciate that.</li>
    <li> I have owned this dryer for two and a half years and it still work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All dryers seem to be the same with a fan, a heating element a stay cool body and some controls. This one has a powerful heating element (1875 watts), and a good fan (for its size). The purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water, but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air. The faster the stream and the warmer the air, the more evaporation occurs.  Where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide. This forces a much stronger blast of air (at least on high speed) that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly, you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature. That may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly. You can adjust the fan speed and the temperature, but not the concentration of the air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have regular hair or (like me) are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly, this is the dryer for you. Put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast.</li>
    <li> After nearly 9 years my wifes hair dryer died. So this was next up from the model she had. She loves it!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works as expected.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer especially the cool setting which I use for the first week after I color my hair.  It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer, perhaps because of lint accumulating in the air vent, took FOREVER to dry my thick hair. This hair dryer cuts the time in half! It also seems pretty quiet. I don&#x27;t use the attachments, so I can&#x27;t speak to their usefulness/functionality.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is simple and useful as my second one in a downstairs bathroom.  I&#x27;m not fussy.  I just want something that works.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works fine and the diffuser is very helpful for drying my curly hair without causing frizz.  The grip is also comfortable and feels nice in my hand.  The only issue I have is the outside coating started wearing off shortly after I started using it.  Not only is this aesthetically unappealing, but the coating is also what makes the unit soft and comfortable in the hand.</li>
    <li> First discovered a similar hair dryer in a hotel.  Was amazed at how fast it dried my hair.  This unit doesn&#x27;t dry quite as fast as the model I the hotel, but in half the time of the dryer I was using.  Leaves my hir shiny, especially when I finish with tube cool setting.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot as I&#x27;d like (as I usually straighten my hair with a hair dryer), but it has a LOT of wind power. If I turn it up on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; the posters in my room go flying everywhere, so it will dry your hair pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Works well for me and has plenty of settings and attachments. I have recommended this to multiple people.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like it because it is not a noisy hair dryer. It works fine and does have a comfort touch.</li>
    <li> I was honestly not expecting that much from this blowdryer due to its low cost, but I am happy to report that I really underestimated it.  It is lightweight, has a reasonably powerful motor, and a good range of power and temperature selections.  I also like that it features tourmaline ceramic as this really does help to smooth my hair.  The lint filter on the back is also very easy to clean, which is important.  I&#x27;ve burned out several blowdryers due to clogged air intake, but I know it won&#x27;t happen with this one as the lint is so easy to remove.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving this blowdryer four stars instead of five is because it is not QUITE as powerful as others I&#x27;ve used, which adds a little extra time to my blowdrying, maybe a couple of minutes.  It really is a nice blowdryer overall and a terrific value.</li>
    <li> I use it daily. It&#x27;s good and value for money.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer.  The different settings make it easier to use.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer.  It dries my hair fast and it&#x27;s so light weight.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It is quiet, but powerful. I used it to replace a Remington hair dryer that only lasted me a couple years. I&#x27;m hoping this one last much longer</li>
    <li> It was better than expected.  I like how I can use temps and speed separately!  Like it lot! Super super!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is light weight and works awesome! I love the multiple settings and the size for travel. So far no issues.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer a couple of months ago after my old Conair died.  I like to use my dryers on low speed, but high heat.  Although the two settings should be independent, this dryer is just lukewarm on low speed.  It also made my hair fuzzy, and while it was lightweight - it felt cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quit using it two months after I started using it and invested in a better dryer.  I purchased the Elchim 2001 through Amazon, and while it&#x27;s a bit more expensive ($80), it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I would not recommend the Conair 1875, unless you want your hair to look like a fuzzy mess.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the better blow-dryers I&#x27;ve had. Worth the price. This is great, especially if you don&#x27;t have very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and frizzy hair.....I love the multiple speeds and the heat settings that it has. I wish it was a little lighter.  I can deal with that though.... I love it ....After I blow dry my hair I barely need to straighten it. Reduces the frizz GREATLY!!! Comes with the two adapters pieces which work great.</li>
    <li> It is a good quality product, I have been using it since 2013 and it is working perfectly. However, I do not blow dry my hair everyday, I only use it occasionally.</li>
    <li> Not as heavy as I expected.  Works well and the power is good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Hair Dryer for my wife.  Shipping was right on the money and packaged superbly with no damage.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it.  If she loves it then I plumb tickled!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lasted, it stays nice and new looking, easy to use etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can i say? I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments, but its a good hairdryer and I like that it has different temperatures.</li>
    <li> My woman needed a new dryer and I was on it.  This one has a &amp;#34;grippy,&amp;#34; rubber-like finish that is really nice. I only used it to quickly dry a water spill on my pants.  The woman loves it. This is a great dryer.</li>
    <li> Great, I use it to dry my hair and my toddler&#x27;s when it&#x27;s very cold. We don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis and do not do complicated jobs with it, but for us is fine. I like that it has a cold air option, that you can choose hot, warm or cold air.</li>
    <li> Open box Part missing, Not new as advertised You get what you pay for Wason the verge of returning product Hope I don&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.... MY HAIR LOOKS GREAT AND DRYS IN HALF THE TIME OF MY OLD DRYER WHICH WAS OVER 15 YEARS OLD. DIDN&#x27;T KNOW WHAT I HAD BEEN MISSING BY NOT HAVING A TOURMALINE CERAMIC DRYER</li>
    <li> LOVE this hair dryer. It has great power and dries my hair rather quickly. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I happened to notice that the base and the handle has dozens upon dozens of cracks in the finish. It looks awful. This product is less than a year old. I have had other hairdryers for years and years with no problems. Since I didn&#x27;t notice the cracks within the one month return policy, I cannot even return the product. Since I don&#x27;t dry my hair with my glasses on, I guess I lose out by not noticing this flaw within the return policy period. If you don&#x27;t care how awful the dryer looks after it has been used, this is the product for you. It&#x27;s a great product but it now looks terrible. The folks at Conair really should step up to the problem and make things right with the consumers.</li>
    <li> This dryer is very lightweight, quiet and it dries hair quickly. The three heat settings are great and the touch is nice</li>
    <li> Bought to replace the old CONAIR hair dryer. Two switch controls are made of cheap plastic. Very difficult to move the switches up and down. I plan to give it to my wife but change my mind after dealing with the switches. I don&#x27;t want her to feel uncomfortable operating this hair dryer. Now I have a second thought before buying any product from CONAIR.</li>
    <li> Great lightweight dryer.  Easy to hold.  Not sure about the cooler setting; not much difference.  This leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I use conair everything and this one is most definitely my favorite ! Leaves my hair so smooth and dries in minutes . Love it !</li>
    <li> This hair dryer functions really well. It is strong and hot enough, and it can also be cool. It is pretty light and doesn&#x27;t vibrate in hand. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer dries hair fast and is not noisy. Dries hair even on the coolest setting. Wish it came with comb attachment.</li>
    <li> Never gets hot and figured this out after the 30 day window for return closed.&lt;br /&gt;Poor form.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer does what it advertises. Great for the money</li>
    <li> Overall this hairdryer does the job well; its 1875 and powerful will dry hair quickly.  I have two issues with this dryer:  1.  the air concentration nossel is wide and does not attach well to the hairdryer therefore any slight bump with either your hand or your brush will make it fly off and it does so at least 3 times when I&#x27;m drying my hair; its really irritating and 2.  the cool shot button is right at the top of the handle where I usually hold the hair dryer this makes it akward to hold because I dont want the cool shot button on to I have to hold the dryer at the bottom of the handle.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this blow dryer it drys without getting too hot on warm, ligth weight, the attachments and size. I just dont like the buttons they seem like it going to fall off when i turn thw blow dryer on and off. But it works like a dream so i just be careful</li>
    <li> its works good..this is my 1st dryer so donno what to expect n all...works for for me..so far so good...using it from almost 1 year for now...no complaints ...</li>
    <li> I usually cut corners with this stuff. This is still a cheap dryer, but it&#x27;s very good quality. The matte look is nice, has three settings for heat and three settings for how much air is pushed. Plus the cool button! It&#x27;s worked great for half a year now. If it broke I&#x27;d buy another one!</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer. Powerful but not too heavy and bulky. Like it very much.</li>
    <li> this is the best!!! works great for hair! annnd my hubby decided to use it to take decals off our truck.... he used it for 4 hrs straight on high heat and i was a bit nervous it would die out on me pretty quick afterward but its 4 mos later and still as good as when i bought it!! very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer.  Replaced the 15 year old dryer my wife had been using until it crapped out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She advised that this dryer, although doesn&#x27;t do anything special, gets the job done at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl to keep her from buying another Walmart bargain. I can tell it&#x27;s quieter than most and she says it dries her hair faster. Nice lightweight unit, ergonomically designed. The cleanable filter on the back is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> Love how fast my hair dries with this hair dryer while getting ready in the morning. This was going to be my back up just in case my old one fizzed out. It has now become my steady go-to in the morning. I will not by another hair dryer but this line in the future.</li>
    <li> Reliable; heavy duty; cannot go wrong with this model! Nice grip; however, cord is NOT retractable.</li>
    <li> Light and great power.  I didn&#x27;t realize how heavy my hairdryer was until I received this one.  I purchased this one off the amazon reviews - they were spot on!  Great choice if you are looking.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have owned so far.  There is only one problem for me, and it &amp;#34;bugs me&amp;#34; a lot.  I have trouble turning it on and off.  Something is awkward about the switch.  Usually I end up changing the heat setting along with the power.</li>
    <li> The plug of my hairdyer had a propensity to overheat and eventually melted the outlet into which it was plugged. The outlet (on a power strip) is now inoperable and there is melted plastic on the power prong. Since the dryer was still under warranty, I called customer service and was placed on hold for 20 minutes. Then when I eventually was able to speak to someone, I was told I would have to mail the dryer back to them at my own expense. Only if they determined that it was defective would they send me a new hair dryer and reimburse me for the postage.  I would imagine a photo showing the damage should suffice or else they should send me a prepaid mailing label as other companies do. Given the low cost of the hair dryer, I&#x27;m wondering whether it&#x27;s worth my time and money boxing it, standing in the line at the post office, etc just to wait to see what happens.  The hair dryer is a little over a year old and the warranty is for two years.</li>
    <li> this is a nice lightweight hair dryer which I appreciate as I have FMS and it&#x27;s hard for me to keep my arms up above my shoulders for any length of time. Also like that it doesn&#x27;t blow my eardrums out. Satisfied with it. Got it as a gift from my daughters.</li>
    <li> Can direct flow of air very reasonably, according to my wife. Looks well made and works great.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer because it has so many settings. I have fine hair and the cooler options help keep it from getting damaged as quickly. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time, the product works as advertised. Blows air strong, is reliable, has the right amount of heat. The packaging is a little lacking but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It&#x27;s bulky, but you can hang it.&lt;br /&gt;This leaves my hair feeling like silk.  I love that you can control the temperature.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing in that it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair when you use it for extended time. It also comes with 2 attachments, looks incredibly sleek, and is a lot better for a man than having a pink Conair.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this hair dryer, and the price!  I have baby fine hair, and I&#x27;m able to dry it without leaving it all frizzy.  I clung to my 1500 watt blowdryer for years, until it finally died, since the 1800-watt dryers I&#x27;d tried had all given me dismal results.  Maybe it&#x27;s the ceramic that makes the difference - but in any event I am pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I use the concentrator every time I dry my hair. It falls off at least 10 times. It gets really hot too so it&#x27;s a pain to put back on constantly. The dryer is good. Just wish the attachments stayed in place.</li>
    <li> This is a HAIRDRYER!  It does not get too hot on the hot setting bit it dries my hair in five minutes.  My old dryer used to take 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Conair makes great hair dryers, and this in no exception. Relatively quiet, and generates sufficient heat to satisfy most customers.</li>
    <li> The dryer does it&#x27;s thing but it doesn&#x27;t try as fast as a different dryer I had previously own.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again when it breaks.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever owned - Cheap, solid, good air flow, good temperatures, and I like the rubberized exterior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gripe has to do with the screen on the back.  My last hair dryer had a removable screen, making it incredibly easy to clean.  Just take it off, rinse it under the sink, and let it dry before reattaching it.  This one, however, has a hinged screen that can&#x27;t be removed, so cleaning it is a bit trickier and I can never get it fully cleaned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;d be a minor annoyance to some, but to me it&#x27;s a pain.  Especially since my last hair dryer was so easy to clean.  Ah well, I&#x27;ll live.</li>
    <li> I have long hair which gets frizzy if I don&#x27;t use a diffuser with the drying. When I use the diffuser with this dryer, it is not very powerful, works great without it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this would leave my hair soft and shiny. My hair is extremely thick and takes forever to dry. When I&#x27;m finally done using a hairdryer I have to put on serum if I don&#x27;t want my hair to look dry. But this was the first hairdryer I can remember where I didn&#x27;t need to do that. Pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I like the feel of it. It has a rubberized matte texture instead of slippery plastic. Finally, it&#x27;s sleek looking enough that I hung it up on my wall next to the sink instead of banishing it under the sink.</li>
    <li> Daughter wanted this hairdryer.  She loves it.  Compact and easy to hold.  Color scheme is great.  Decent price compared to what is found in stores.</li>
    <li> this is good! and cheap i think! I have been using this over 5 months...it seems it works well so far~</li>
    <li> The hair dryer itself does a nice job. However, the design of the on/off switch is not good. It&#x27;s flat with small raised ribs. It&#x27;s quite difficult turning on and off especially if your hands are damp. It was delivered as promised so no problems there.</li>
    <li> This is the first hair dryer I bought here in the US and it works perfectly fine. Missus uses it everyday and there are no signs of wear and tear after a few months of usage. I will know more after a few months, but so far so good. It dries hair really quickly so I&#x27;m happy to save on some of the electricity cost with using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this is not the cheapest hair dryer you can find on the market, but Conair has a reputation for quality products.</li>
    <li> Very powerful. Dries my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I feel like it is very poorly made, because of the plastic material and the unstable button. Too too too expensive for this level of product.</li>
    <li> The drier does what it says, but the look is nothing to be excited about. It is plastic casing, so it feels cheap. But, you buy it for what it does, not how it look, right?</li>
    <li> I really like this hairdryer. I haven&#x27;t had it very long. But it&#x27;s working well for me.</li>
    <li> The styling attachment does not remain attached to the hair dryer. It falls off whenever touched and so is completely worthless.</li>
    <li> i really like this hair dryer. dries hair fast.</li>
    <li> The dryer is heavier than expected, and for the wattage, it puts out less air than it should.</li>
    <li> I think pretty much all has been said in the above reviews. It dries hair quickly, but doesn&#x27;t damage it by being too hot, nor does it make it frizzy. It is not too loud - it is not exactly quiet, but nothing dramatic. It is not too heavy either. And it&#x27;s a good deal! I have had it since a month and I actually go through the trouble of blowdrying my hair much more often now, because my hair looks so nice now. (Well, not that I was a monster before).</li>
    <li> Product came timely.  Bought it to replace another hair dryer.    Love this one, it is light, but does the job.  Like the settings and the weight of the dryer.    Would certainly purchase another one!</li>
    <li> Looks sheik, works great, and I can see this piece staying with me for a long time.  I&#x27;ve had it for a year and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> First brand new blow dryer I&#x27;ve gotten in 10 years and boy did I forget what a blow dryer is SUPPOSED to work like! My morning routine has been reduced dramatically! Does the trick, for sure!</li>
    <li> Good dryer but the buttons aren&#x27;t easy to move.</li>
    <li> This is the best little hairdryer!  I love the outside material, kind of rubber-like texture so it doesn&#x27;t scratch my bathroom sink.  The drying power is great!  It cutting my styling time in half!  and it doesn&#x27;t make as much noise as my other hairdryer which I love.  It&#x27;s very light weight as well so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired from holding it.  What a great buy.  High quality without the high price.  Cool button works very nicely too!</li>
    <li> I have another Conair unit with a regular button to power up the machine. That is what I thought this one has. But to my disappointment it has a sliding switch from high to off to low. The switch is cheaply made and it is not convenience for some one holding it in their hand and turning it on and off in durations.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this one to a friend.</li>
    <li> Really leaves hair with a nice shine. Love it!</li>
    <li> Product as described. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> It works but the coating came off the body of the dryer right off the bat ~~~~</li>
    <li> I always buy Conair Hair Dryers!  This one is lightweight...I like the different settings of the dryer..for me it works great...I have very short hair and it is fine, but you would think my hair was thicker because of this dryer and the small round brush I use.  Extremely happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I find that the heat doesn&#x27;t stay consistent</li>
    <li> The concentration attachment falls off repeatedly, and I mean every time I use the dang thing. Another deal breaker is the length of the cord, it&#x27;s way too short. This blow dryer is going to be replaced.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the good reviews. This dryer feels so cheap and flimsy. Almost break the switch on first use. You have to see it to understand what I am talking about. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine.  Not much diff between warm and hot settings.  Pretty standard hair dryer.  Dries my hair- that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice sized hairdryer and has been working for about six months with daily use. My only complaint is I have thick hair so I wish it had a little more power and ran a little more hot like some of my other hair dryers.</li>
    <li> This replaces a Revlon ionic, ceramic unit that has worked well for several years. This unit is smaller, lighter, just as powerful and much quieter. The only minor gripe is the thumb-slide switches are a little tough to use. Not insurmountable, but if the ribs on the slider were a bit taller, this would be a non-issue. I like the black finish...it is a rubber-like non-skid. This helps keep it from slipping off the counter. All in all, a pretty good unit. BTW, this unit does emit ions and they cannot be switched off.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my old dryer crapped out on me. It has high power that dries your hair quickly. I have fairly thin hair so it takes me less than ten minutes to dry my hair with this. After using it my hair is noticeably softer and silkier. WIN. I gave it four stars because the opening where the air comes out is fairly small, so if it were bigger it could dry more hair faster, but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little heavy but it&#x27;s well made and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smooth feeling of the surface.&lt;br /&gt;wish it was a little bit smaller/lighter.</li>
    <li> Great dryer causing less frizz and easy to use. Relatively lightweight with two good setting. A minute or two on high followed by brief low and shoulder length hair looks Fab!</li>
    <li> It works really good.</li>
    <li> Conair Hair products are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack. Please dont trust Conair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 2 and a half years now and it still works great. I love the price and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific unit. It has separate heat and power adjustments.  Can be strong or gentle. Dried my thick medium length hair in 3 minutes. Every bit as good as units costing 4x as much. Why would you buy anything else? My previous Conair lasted over 10 years.</li>
    <li> Only been in use for couple of months but wife is happy so far. Hope it lasts. more words ok</li>
    <li> Heavier than I expected but I like it!  Dries my hair nicely without frizzing it.  Quieter than my last hair dryer.  And this one is oddly bigger than any I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer does leave my hair soft, but it&#x27;s air flow is much too strong for styling my shoulder-length hair, even on the low setting.  Since air flow control was the primary reason for selecting this particular item, I am disappointed and use the dryer only occasionally.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer after my expensive tourmaline one was shot. I wanted to see if the price difference was justified. I don&#x27;t think it is. This blow dryer is so inexpensive and has a lot of power. It isn&#x27;t hot enough for my thick, thick hair--I can&#x27;t straighten it very well--but it has plenty of air flow to pretty much make up for it. My hair dries very quickly. I could see how someone with thin or fine hair would be overwhelmed by the volume of air. For me it&#x27;s fine; I just have to spend a bit more time with my flat iron for straightening after drying.</li>
    <li> It matched the one I replaced.  Product is what they say it is. Nothing more nothing less.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do, and reasonably priced. I don&#x27;t see any difference from my old dryer though. Dries hair fast enough, has three heat settings and 3 speeds.</li>
    <li> This dries my hair very well, and doesn&#x27;t cause any frizz. I have naturally thick, long, curly hair, so whenever I decide to straighten my hair, I need to ensure that it dries halfway straightened (I use a flat-iron after I am done drying). The concentrator does an amazing job straightening my curls while leaving my hair without frizz and fly-away hair (I also use One N&#x27; Only argan oil to help control frizz). I use the diffuser whenever I want to dry my curls, and I love the way my hair turns out after a few minutes of drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I was needing a hair dryer that wouldn&#x27;t throw the breaker when on high and this one is good although it did blow breaker one time but I had too many things going at the time but it hasn&#x27;t happened since. It is handy to hold and turn on and off or adjust settings with one hand so this is a keeper for me!</li>
    <li> I like this dryer because it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my last dryer, but still manages to dry my hair in about half the time.  It is medium sized and the quality is decent, my only gripe is that the plastic coating is starting to peel off in some places.  My hair is smooth and silky after using this, no frizz.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the Cricket Technique barrel brush.  I don&#x27;t know which item to attribute it to, but the combination of both of those have cut my hair drying time in half.  I have really thick, curly, frizzy hair. Pretty much the worst combination.  It takes me 45 minutes to blowdry my hair then another 15 min to run the straightener to get rid of the frizz.  After using this It cut my total time down to 25 minutes of blowdrying with just 1 minute of straightener to get the back of my head (user error, I&#x27;m not good at blow-drying back there).  Makes my hair smooth and silky unlike my last dryer that made it look dry and broker.  Definitely get this. You will not be sorry.  other review is right that the tip falls off really easily and I have to reattach it a couple times but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal when you look at the results.</li>
    <li> I love this nice looking hair dryer.  It&#x27;s powerful, yet sized perfectly for home use.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful dryer. Really gets my hair dry quickly. I liked it so much that I bought another one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and not too loud.  The cord is extremely short and wiggles out of the socket while in use.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Usually this type of hair dryer run about $50+.  This one was priced great and works amazing.  I totally recommend this hair dryer.  It dries my hair super fast and without frizz.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I like that there are multiple settings, high and heat are not necessarily on at the same time, you can adjust to many different settings. The cool blast button is also a great touch. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Works very well, just not as well as I was expecting. Still definitely worth the money I spent,</li>
    <li> Amazon here says I&#x27;ve been using this since September of 2011. Wow. Well, I still love it, has all the low to high, hot to cool options I need. I have no complaints about this and I would definitely buy it again if something were to happen to it.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s bulky, but you can hang it.It works, but for all of the advertising hoopla, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that different.</li>
    <li> Have had it for 8 months, works great. Don&#x27;t know how it does it, but it dries my hair 3 times faster and with less heat than my old hairdryer. Not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I defrost my freezer with it, I thawed out my car doors with itr.  I live in a humid part of the country where a towel doesn&#x27;t quite get the job done so I use it for that.  I even dey my hair with it</li>
    <li> This hair dryer performs as expected.  I have dry/damaged hair due to chemo 2 years ago.  I have never owned a hair dryer and thought that maybe blow drying my hair with a diffuser to increase wave/curl would make it look better but it didn&#x27;t.  However this is not due to the hair dryer.  The hair dryer is light, was very easy to operate and try different hair styles with especially since it includes both a diffuser and a concentrator. I tried at least 10 different hair styles with this thing and found it super easy to adjust and operate.  Feature I love the most: adjustable heat setting.  I use the warm instead of hot and I can put the fan on low or high depending on how fast I want it.  Great dryer for the price but also for all of the features.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price. Leaves hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair fast and love the cool shot button. What I don&#x27;t like is that it has a big square plug.</li>
    <li> Very affordable, reviews were accurate.  It is quieter than my old one and quick.  No need to spend a lot of money on a dryer when you have the quality with Conair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times so far, but I really love it.  I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding a dryer that 1) doesn&#x27;t fry curly hair, 2) isn&#x27;t too heavy when drying the back of my head, 3) doesn&#x27;t sound like a jet taking off, 4)has a diffuser, and 4) has separate heat and power settings - with the warm actually warm, not hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer does all that - I&#x27;m a very happy camper!</li>
    <li> Fast and easy use. I have think and very long hair (halfway down my back), and it takes no time to blow dry with the included diffuser. Also, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; my hair like previous hair dryers have.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my six year old Revlon dryer when it stopped working. I looked at some more expensive brands, but ultimately decided on this Conair due to the decent reviews (and I figured a cheap one had served me well for the past 6 years, why spend more on one now?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty horrible. I mean, does it get my hair dry? Sure, but so would standing in a wind tunnel or basking in the sun for 4 hours. But like this Conair, neither of those methods would be very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a blow and go kind of girl, I&#x27;ve never had to spend more than 5-10 minutes on my hair in the morning. Unfortunately this dryer leaves my hair a tangled mess if I don&#x27;t meticulously use careful aim and a brush when I&#x27;m drying, even with the attachment. This method takes forever on my hair type, and somehow my hair still looks limp and sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the cord is awkwardly short. If your outlets are located at counter level I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine, but mine are near the floor, and I can barely get this thing at the right angle over my head to properly dry both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d avoid this one, unless you enjoy spending a lot of time on your hair - and if that&#x27;s the case, you&#x27;re probably into fancier brands anyway.  :)</li>
    <li> my wife is very happy with her new blow dryer</li>
    <li> It gets the job done quickly and effectively, for an old man who has little hair left.</li>
    <li> On time and great conditions!!! Very satisfied!!! Highly recommended!!! Everything was alright, good timing and good conditions... I strongly recommend this distributor :)!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, not that great. Not professional but it will work for probably  a year or two.  The buttons are not good because they are plastic sliders, and will probably break first.  I notice no anti frizz with this versus what I had with a professional one that broke before.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Completely satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It has amazing power, yet is drying my hair very gently. My hair feels smooth after drying it which is a huge improvement compared to my previous hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is a bit heavier than  I expected and it doesn&#x27;t blow air as hard as I expected. Otherwise it&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best blow dryer I have ever owned and I have owned many over the last 45 years.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer.  Purchased because of the on/off and heat  &#x27;buttons&#x27; slide and wouldn&#x27;t accidentally turn on if hit.  Turned out to be a good buy b/c I love this hairdryer.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from the price but I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth. I had an old dryer and this was much lighter and more quiet. It also has dried my hair faster, even on the low heat setting. Love the rubberized exterior which makes handling easier. Great purchase and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a fantastic dryer - nice and hot, and it&#x27;s lasted me a year and a half (and counting). I&#x27;m not even bothered by the flaking on the surface. But if you dry your hair using the concentrator nozzle, STAY AWAY! That thing is the bane of my existence. It falls off if you look at it funny. I have to put it back on the dryer 8-10 times just to finish my hair. If you don&#x27;t use the concentrator or the diffuser, this is a great dryer.</li>
    <li> Stopped working two and a half months after purchase… too late to return to Amazon.  Used only occasionally, it was a very nice blow dryer, but then suddenly shorted out. Don&#x27;t know if I should trust buying another one or go with a different brand. Not happy!</li>
    <li> Dryer was delivered on time.  It is powerful, dries my short hair in 2 minutes and isn&#x27;t heavy.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Have had this hair dryer for years and love it. Gets nice and hot without burning me, speed is good, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer gets VERY hot but any extensions pop off very easily.</li>
    <li> I had a Revlon hair dryer and I bought this item after seeing the good reviews and I am really satisfied with the results. It makes my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> It is the best. The strength of the wind is amezing. It is light weight. It came at the right time and I would recommend to everyone who wants to buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer with all of the setting it is great for my hair.so if you are looking for a good hair dryer this would be it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter. Delivered as promised. So far (about 1 month later) working fine. She is extremely happy with the product. The only minor issue I see is that there is no base to secure it on the wall. It does have a loop, so I had to install a small hook on the wall to hang it from.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has a lot of power and dries my hair very quickly when I use the concentrator. Very quiet compared to my older blow dryer also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a little less than a year and a half and it just burnt out and stopped working a week ago.  I was drying my hair and heard the dryer suddenly get quieter. Then I smelled burning... And it just died. I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this as I had an older model that thankfully, I kept as a spare for travel. The older model of this dryer is still working 10 years later, sans a missing temp button that fell off just before I purchased this newer one.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Replaced a similar older model with this one.  It seems to be a bit lighter than the older one.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> A couple months in and so far so go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Light and comfortable&lt;br /&gt;- Nice attachments&lt;br /&gt;- No burning smells&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful enough&lt;br /&gt;- Long Cable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not very portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lightness can make it feel kind of cheap but I would rather it be light than unwieldy&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    <li> The external head of Hair dryer consistently comes out and does not stick in the place. the heat and cold are good, but overall it&#x27;s not made from the best quality materials. I wont recommend it to any one</li>
    <li> so strong and dries well. love it! i have been using it for ever since but had no problems. :)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get a much better hair dryer for this price. Have had no problems with it. My wife loves it and uses it all the time!</li>
    <li> This dryer has a lot of power!  3 speeds and temperatures, which I like.  Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I am not one to buy the fancy hair dryers that most women like to purchase. If it gets the job done, than I am alright with it. This one is a little fancier than the Conair I bought at CVS 10 years ago. It has multiple heat settings, however, I have found that when I am blow drying my hair the little slider tools to adjust the temperature sometimes slide and change the setting on me. It is a little annoying, but what can you expect for the price? Overall, I am glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> .....but this was the first Conair blow drier that i purchased with &#x27;Confort Touch&#x27;. i was extremely happy with my purchase for 5 months...then i began to notice the comfort touch (rubber) coating was starting to feel a bit tacky. not just when warm...in use. after time it a lot worse. everything began sticking to it...dust bunnies....hair etc. and it also left a stickiness to my hands...that would take two hand washings to remove. after dealing with it for far to long..i threw it in the trash..happy to be rid of it !! buttttt...it didn&#x27;t stay gone for very long. the following morning as i passed my son&#x27;s bedroom i saw that horrible...sticky thing on my son&#x27;s bed. when i asked him why he had taken it out of the trash and what he planned on doing with it? he said...it worked PERFECTLY in picking up years of &#x27;stuff&#x27; that had fallen behind his work-station (made on solid wood. it&#x27;s very big &amp; extremely hard to move). he said he held on to the end of the cord and let the dry drop down to the floor. after dragging it from one end to the other a few times he retrieved a &amp;#34;whole bunch of s%*#&amp;#34;. ha! ha! that&#x27;s my son! brilliant idea!! btw...it works wonders picking up socks...undergarments and sm. rags that fallen behind and on the sides of the dryer too. wellllllllll!?! i paid for it! hehehe! anyway....i&#x27;m still in love with conair blow driers though i have gone back to those made with hard plastic casings. we still have and use this blow drier. it&#x27;s now used as a &#x27;tool&#x27; to pick up things in tight spots. and.. it&#x27;s now called... &#x27;that sticky dryer whatchamacallit thingy&#x27;. :) mahalo (thank you) for reading my post. wishing you and those you love a very Merry Christmas and a Happy Always!!  Aloha &amp; God Bless you.</li>
    <li> Three speeds (noise) and two heat settings. My 4yr old no longer complains about blow dfying his hair cause of the queiter speeds. Great buy for yhe price.</li>
    <li> My old Conair burnt out after about 10 years of use. I debated spending more money on a pricier model, but saw the reviews for more costly hair dryers were hit or total miss. I decided on this dryer, it came with a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser. I&#x27;ve used both and I love this dryer. It gets the job done. I just wish that the cord was retractable (like my old Conair dryer).</li>
    <li> Powerful and has a REALLY hot setting, a warm setting and button for &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; which has no heat at all.  It&#x27;s very good and I&#x27;m very pleased.  My last Conair of a similar model is still going strong after many years and we&#x27;ve used to to defrost the freezer when it was broken for a few months (had to defrost it every week), and I used it as my own hairdryer and as a dog grooming dryer--which is now it&#x27;s exclusive use (I have a dog grooming business).  So these are workhorse machines!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t pretend that I&#x27;m the authority on hair dryers, but this one has done its job as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I always diffuse my hair.  This dryer worked quicker and nicer than my previous dryer.  Also, I have not had any issues with the diffuser falling off, which is usually what makes me retire a blow dryer.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer, fantastic price!</li>
    <li> My old Conair was great. This one is weak and the attachments fall off mid-use.  Will be replacing soon! Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> We only upgraded our hair dryer because it broke, but given the affordable price of this hair dryer I wished we&#x27;d have upgraded sooner. It has a powerful blow and works great!</li>
    <li> Teenage daughter &amp;#34;had to have&amp;#34; one of these. Reluctantly, I bought. Been a superb product without issues since purchase and she uses literally daily. Would buy again, but hope I don&#x27;t have too! Smiles...</li>
    <li> My wife and kids love it; and for that, I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I needed a new dryer with a diffuser for my perm (Yes, I got a perm for the hot, humid weather. Don&#x27;t judge. :-D) This dryer is terrific! The controls are a little stiff for one-handed use, but that may be because the dryer is new. Good heat, good speed, and the cool button is very handy. Would recommend. Even if you don&#x27;t have a perm.</li>
    <li> This dryer was more than I expected.  I had an old 1875.  It dries my hair so quickly and the settings are great.</li>
    <li> Works great - multiple speed and temps.</li>
    <li> Very good Hair Dryer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer for my sister and wasn&#x27;t sure it would be a good one. It seemed cheap but I ended liking it better than mine, which cost twice as much! It&#x27;s very light weight and not very loud at all. Since it isn&#x27;t very loud, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be very powerful but it dries my hair much faster than most hair dyers I&#x27;ve used. We&#x27;ve had it for over 6 months now and it&#x27;s still working great! It&#x27;s definitely a great hair dryer at a great price!</li>
    <li> It will seriously dim the lights in your house, but man can it dry hair!</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and it didn&#x27;t seem hot enough.  Took a long time to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Great dryer.... if you have hair.</li>
    <li> My 15-year-old 1875w hair dryer finally blew up, so I headed to Amazon to find a new one.  I chose this one, because it looked similar to my old one and had pretty good reviews.  So far, so good!  I&#x27;ll stop back to update my review if we encounter issues going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much quieter than my old one, but doesn&#x27;t seem to blow as strongly.  It&#x27;s fine, but I felt like the old one dried ever so slightly faster than this one does.  Also, the cord is shorter than what I was used to.  At this point, it&#x27;s annoying, because I feel like I&#x27;m glued to the wall while I&#x27;m drying my hair.  But I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the attachments, but they seem substantial.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble snapping the diffuser on and off when I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, no complaints.  It&#x27;s doing what I hoped it would do!</li>
    <li> Works just great!  Price is right, dries fast, I really like it.</li>
    <li> It has a good quality, I remember my daughter always on a hurry and sometimes drops this dryer on the floor and its still on one piece, that is so great, it didn&#x27;t break easily</li>
    <li> Good product.  I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great Job! No problem with product</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.. No issues yet</li>
    <li> i love this hairdryer, im no professional but it does the job and its affordable. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It works as expected. The buttons are of the sliding rather than pressing type. I prefer the latter, but other than that, I like that it is NOT heavy, the handle is neither too large or too small in diameter and has a rubber coating. Hopefully, it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love my new ceramic blow dryer. It gets my hair as straight as the hair salon. I use this along with my Carol&#x27;s Daughter Blow Drying cream and my hair comes out very straight. It&#x27;s my first ceramic and tourmaline hair dryer and I am in love. I&#x27;ve used it twice and I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it because I received great results (non-frizzy, big hair). I recommend this to all and it was for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> This is an ordinary hair dryer, and it works fine.  Not too heavy or inconvenient in any way except those switches which are kind of &amp;#34;fiddly.&amp;#34;  They have a loose, cheap feel, but it&#x27;s not really a big problem.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this blow dryer.  I work a very early shift so it&#x27;s important for me to not wake up my entire family while getting ready for work. This blow dryer is surprisingly quiet in comparison to other blow dryers I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s also really light weight and easy to use in addition to not blowing out air that&#x27;s so hot, it fries out my hair. I&#x27;ve had Conair  blow dryers before but I think they&#x27;ve finally perfected their design.  The attachments that come with it are great too. There&#x27;s one attachment to add volume and one to pin point the air stream when you&#x27;re using a round brush to curl or to straighten sections. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This drier comes pretty much as advertised: it&#x27;s lightweight, dries fast, easy to use, and comes with a good range of attachments.  I purchased it as a replacement for the same model of drier, which had quit working after less than 5 years.  While I have questions about the quality of the manufacturing of this product since I had to buy a replacement in a fairly short period of time, I couldn&#x27;t find another drier for the price that was comparable.</li>
    <li> easy to hold, and dries your you hair fast! Has multiple settings for everyone&#x27;s needs. nice size and love the hook for hanging.</li>
    <li> just okay aaa a  a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a just wanna finished this</li>
    <li> The dryer itself works great , but the attachments don&#x27;t stay on. I was spending more time picking the attachments up off the floor than drying my hair, really a piss poor design very frustrating</li>
    <li> No problems with it. Works for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple years. It&#x27;s been very good. The cord is a little short. Otherwise, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Great so far, no real complaints.  Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very nice and like the filter cover.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer works well.  I do feel I have less frizz with this Conair than I do with my older Conair.  I&#x27;m hoping it is a new item since I did not order &amp;#34;open box&amp;#34; but that is exactly what I got.  First time I have been disappointed with Amazon packaging.</li>
    <li> This replacement hair dryer blows harder and dries my hair faster than Revlon&#x27;s RV544PKF that recently died when I dropped it. The speed and heat sliders initially felt a bit awkward compared to the press on/off switch on Revlon&#x27;s, but it also doesn&#x27;t switch on accidentally when I place it in a caddy holder. The rear vent is much easier to clean with a flip out grill cover over a smooth filter that I can simply wipe off. The noise level is lower as well so I&#x27;m happy that I paid a bit more this time around for a better hair dryer.</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer ever!  We traveled to NYC over the summer.  At the Seton Hotel, these were the hair dryers they had for guests to use.  My hair was not dry.  It had a variety of settings and was not noisy.  I came home immediately an ordered one.  Wen shampoo and this hair dryer word well together.  :)</li>
    <li> ITEM AS DESCRIBED AND WORKS REALLY WELL THANKS FOR THE FAST SHIPPING!!!</li>
    <li> I was afraid that this hair dryer would not be top quality because of the price. However, everything about it seems great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister, to replace her ancient conair hair dryer. She has super thick long hair and the old one did her well for years and years, so when it finally died, it only seemed natural to ty and find one by the same brand. Well, she loves this thing, it is super light and powerful. The diffuser makes all the difference in the world. Don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this, you will be happy</li>
    <li> Bought 2 (1 for each of my teens...separate bathrooms) of these and both have worked great for a year with no issues! Will buy another for myself soon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hairdryer &#x3D;-)  Makes less noise than some. Works well and is recommended.</li>
    <li> Great heat and strength controls.  Great handling to style hair.  I have had numerous Conair hair dryers over my lifetime and will continue to purchase them due to ther great quality.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier version of this hairdryer and have to say I like the old one better.  the sliding buttons that turn it on are hard to use, they just done slide well.  I also do not like the new way of removing the back piece for cleaning.  it is conneted and can not be totally removed I this is frustrating to me.  The power is not quite as good as the old one either.</li>
    <li> We used to buy the more expensive name brand hair products.  After reading reviews of this dryer, we decided to try it.  There are three girls in my family and we all use and love this dryer!</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer, insomuch as one can &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; a hair dryer. It works just fine and dries what it&#x27;s supposed to dry.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this based on reviews.  It is not very powerful and took forever to dry my long hair.  I have already purchased a different, more powerful hair dryer.</li>
    <li> DELIVERY WAS AMAZING, SUPER FAST.&lt;br /&gt;CONDITION OF PRODUCT: PERFECT&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT DETAILS: IT JUST ARRIVED SO I CAN SAY TOO MUCH BUT LOOKS GOOD SO FAR. THE BOTTOMS TO CHOOSE THE TEMPETURE LOOK A LITTLE FRAGILE, BESIDE THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE.</li>
    <li> Got this product 2 weeks till now, everything works out fine, while the switcher is too flat and thus hard to switch, for example, you will need to push very hard to switch from low to mid wind. This might be a design problem of this product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hairdryer. It has multiple speeds and settings and even the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting doesn&#x27;t get too hot for her. It&#x27;s lightweight and not too big. Still easy to travel with also.</li>
    <li> i have fine thin hair and dont need much in the way of a dryer,this one is perfect, love the attachments, dont even need a straightner when  I use this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this over a year ago and my husband and I are very pleased with the results.Has a very professional look and performance</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer.  Has enouth power to quickly dry my long hair but not so hot as to burn the hair.</li>
    <li> Very good blow dryer for the price.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This item is a very good product. The price is right for this Dryer. Ergonimics make it easy to use and hold.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is just okay. I have another Conaig 1875 (ion ?) one that I absolutely love but can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere nowadays.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend over a year ago and it&#x27;s still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very nice soft touch coating has started to peel away pretty significantly though, but for $25 I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> This unit is quieter than others I have, and dries my hair faster--seems to have good power. I also find it comfortable to hold and the switches work smoothly.</li>
    <li> The most light hairdryer I ever had. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer, light weight and drys hair quickly. Speed and heat can be varied to suit whoever is using it.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the plug does not fit snuggly in the wall outlet, it&#x27;s a but lose, but that said it stays in! I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This thing has lots of power --- works so fast, and seems to do so without damaging the hair... I was wavering between this dryer and another that was a bit cheaper. But was glad that I chose this one, as it&#x27;s the most satisfying hair dryer I&#x27;ve used at home thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with it is that the sliding switches are annoying to use, as they are very stiff. Wish that this awesome product came with easier to maneuver switches.... Maybe next time, in the redesign, it will?</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> Not happy at the quality of hair dryer for the price I paid 28. Better version at Costco for 20. I had a previous conair hair dryer that lasted 10 yrs and was very happy with it. This one had cheap plastic on/off button and just low/high speed blower.</li>
    <li> The turn on/off switch is really hard to move.</li>
    <li> Good product and good company to order from.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I like that it&#x27;s quiet and light. The plastic on the handle seems to be melting off and I don&#x27;t really like the black flakes I find on my face and hands after using the dryer. Seems like a design flaw that the dryer cannot withstand high heat.</li>
    <li> My wife saw one of these at a nice hotel we stayed at so I bought her one. It is advertised that it will cut down on frizzy hair and she is a senior citizen and has her hair colored and the frizz gets worse as you get older. Well, she really likes this dryer and her hair is less frizzy. She is still working and used to use the hair iron and now can skip that most days or just do her bangs which saves her about 10 minutes in the morning and you know that is good. I am a hero, got to like that</li>
    <li> This dryer does a great job and would merit 5 stars if it were just a tad smaller in size!</li>
    <li> Live it  highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> The on/off and heat selector buttons are not toggle or rocker switch like other ones it seems to wobble when operated and feel it might not last as long as others.  I do not use often but others in family will.  Will have to see how it wears.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer for the price. Not five stars simply because it hot is only medium hot.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken yet. Blows hot air. Review over.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is amazing for it&#x27;s price. I wanted to buy an expensive &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; blow dryer, but my finances would not allow that and I settle on this one. I am, however, grateful I chose to buy this blow dryer. It has 3 heat settings, cool, warm and hot which is nice because i can put it on the heat setting which fits my hair the best. It is not ridiculously loud like some of the previous blow dryers i&#x27;ve own and the cord is sufficiently long. I would recommend buying this blow dryer, even over an expensive &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; one because i feel like it works just as well as some of the other more expensive hair dryers i&#x27;ve owned over the years.</li>
    <li> A BIG problem...the BUTTONS to operate both temperature and On/Off are IMPOSSIBLE to operate with one thumb (as they need to be and should be).  I have to stop holding my hair up for drying (loosing thereby the sectioning) and use both hands to simply move the button on or off. In blow drying your own hair yourself, you have to turn off the blowdryer often or run the risk of overheating it and experiencing auto shutdown.  I will give the benefit of the doubt that possibly the control buttons will loosen up over time, but in the two months I have owned this, the annoying, difficult switch with poor functioning switch makes me wish I had bought another type or style of dryer.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for wife and she loves the drying power and the way if makes her hair feel soft.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement from an older version of the same. It&#x27;s great! Exactly as I wanted.</li>
    <li> Just a great product.  The outside does  not burn your hands and that is a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer!  I&#x27;d buy it again - great value - it&#x27;s heavy and seems like a more expensive hairdryer, works great!</li>
    <li> Tourmaline is an incredible addition to a hair dryer. I no longer need to use hair conditioner and my hair is like silk after drying it. It&#x27;s really pretty astonishing.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It doesn&#x27;t get hot. It has a soft silicone finish so it is comfortable to hold and lots of settings to accommodate heat and air!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Light, powerful and practical.</li>
    <li> The Conair 1875 replace my 4-year old Conair hair dryer and has proven quieter, more powerful and easier to use than the old model.  I guess that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s designed to do, but I&#x27;m extremely pleased it does it so well.</li>
    <li> when plug in and plug out, there is always a smell of burns. But it does not effect the normal use.</li>
    <li> using for some time, i love it</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer, just leaving a quick review to state that, like others have stated, the matte rubber covering on my dryer is all peeling off on the handle (and taking the words with it...). This doesn&#x27;t affect the usability of the dryer, but it&#x27;s ugly and I have to memorize all of the settings before they disappear. It took about a week of everyday use before mine started to peel. Otherwise, the dryer dries my hair in an expeditious manner, which is really all you can ask of a hair dryer. :)</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick hair and needed a dryer that wouldn&#x27;t take forever to dry my hair.  This one is a bit loud, but it does the job and doesn&#x27;t make my hair too frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for several months now and am very satisfied.  I purchased this model as my daughter has used the same (former model) for years.  I highly recommend this purchase :)</li>
    <li> I had an older model of this same hair dryer for several years (5-7?) and it was great. Recently, it started making some funny sounds while in use, so I decided it was about time to upgrade. For the price, there&#x27;s really no better option than this one - it&#x27;s relatively lightweight, easy to maneuver, and makes quick work of drying my long, thick hair. I&#x27;ve never had an expensive, fancy hair dryer, so I can&#x27;t speak to whether this is better or not, but I&#x27;d say you can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use. The &amp;#34;barrel&amp;#34; is shorter than some of the older ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s easier to pack also.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is an excellent choice for so many reasons - comfortable and light to hold, quiet yet powerful motor, lots of setting choices, and a great price. It&#x27;s the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> powerful and very lovely to use! highly recommend! I just used it for the first time today and it dried my hair very quickly! :)</li>
    <li> It was so hard to find a blow dryer that had a lot of airflow and this one meets the price/performance ratio. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like this Conair hair dryer because: it is light and easy to use, the motor pitch does not hurt my ears, and it blows very strong.  The rubberized grip is a plus.</li>
    <li> My doctor informed me that I needed to stop using a towel to dry off with as it was causing skin irritation.  So I bought this thing.  The focused nozzle along with the 3 different temperature settings work great.  It moves water off and won&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> There are much better dryers out there but for the price, this is definitely a great purchase. It&#x27;s quite light and comes with a few accessories for different types of styling. There is a cool &amp; hot conversion and it comes with a few different levels of drying speeds. It looks relatively study but I haven&#x27;t dropped it yet so I&#x27;ll have to see. My hair is pretty long &amp; it gets everything dry pretty fast. I don&#x27;t have a problem with fizziness so I can&#x27;t comment about that but my hair does look quite shiny afterwards.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, quieter than most, and dries my hair in half the time! All dryers are NOT the same and this one is great for smoothing and straightening!</li>
    <li> Not made very well. Not easy to turn on and off.</li>
    <li> Works good, button to turn on and off are hard to use and get stuck. Annoying when you are drying your hair in sections and need to keep turning it on and off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer to replace a 3-year-old Andis dryer that stopped working, and this one feels heavier, isn&#x27;t as easy to use, and is not at all suitable for travel.  The heat and blower buttons are on two different panels, which some may like for the different possible combinations of settings but which I find difficult to adjust.  I&#x27;ll keep it to use as a spare, but it&#x27;s particularly disappointing because it was more expensive than my old dryer.</li>
    <li> Sadly enough my old hair dryer was 10 years old so I finally replaced it. This hair dryer is amazing! Dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth. I have also found that after drying, styling takes seconds and my hair stays beautiful for up to 3 days. (Just  for reference, the hair dryer is the only thing that has changed in my styling routine.) Love it!</li>
    <li> Ten stars! This is as light as a feather!! It works great, is of normal noise level, and seriously it is probably 2 pounds lighter than my last dryer of the same wattage. Wish I had ordered it a long time ago! Hopefully it lasts but so far I am quite happy.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!  I thought I&#x27;d have to pay $100 for something I LOVE, but this is great!  I have hair that soaks water like a sponge, so blow drying it always a pain and a last resort.  Now that I have this one, it does a great job in half the time as other dryers.</li>
    <li> Nice product, good speed and heat settings!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in error.  I love Conair products, but this one didn&#x27;t have the retractable cord I wanted.  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> The 5 star reviews are a bit of a stretch. I&#x27;ve had a Vidal Sassoon dryer for almost 15 years now and I thought maybe I should step into the 21st century. Honestly this tourmaline stuff didn&#x27;t make a difference in my hair. My hair is usually very shiny but this dryer dulled it for some reason. I do like the gripy texture and the color scheme is cute, it&#x27;s much darker in person.  It would&#x27;ve been better as a grey color.  I&#x27;ll probably air dry my hair mostly and finish up the rest of the moisture with this.  The worst part about this dryer really is the switch. I mean they seriously couldn&#x27;t see this design flaw and couldn&#x27;t make it more basic and sturdy? The switch shakes around and feels like it&#x27;s about to break off. Anyway, I was going to return it but didn&#x27;t want to go through all the trouble.</li>
    <li> Wow... I haven&#x27;t bought a hair dryer in 8 years and this hair dryer makes me feel like Rip Van Winkle waking up to new technological advances in hair drying. When did these things get so efficient?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My long, full hair took 10 minutes to blow dry with my old dryer. Now, it takes less than 5 minutes. My scalp does not get overly hot. My hair seems softer and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this hair dryer a try. It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
    <li> If I had only known what a difference a hair dryer can make for your hair. I admit that I love to buy beauty products, but especially hair products. My hair is colored/highlighted, fairly straight, but not thin. Lately I keep buying products to take the dry frizz that seems to appear on the ends of my hair. Little did I know that using the Conair Tourmaline Hair Dryer would solve that problem immediately. The dryer has settings for the usual hot/cold/warm settings and high/medium/low...but it&#x27;s nice to have the controls slide on either side of the device. It&#x27;s a powerful 1875 watts that dries my hair faster with ions and gives it body plus takes away the dry ends almost 100%. My co-workers noticed my hair looking better too. Ironically, I don&#x27;t always use a blow dryer because I want healthy hair, but this dryer seems to make my hair look better. For the price and function, I recommended this dryer.</li>
    <li> It works wery well but it is covered by a kind of rubber that glues dust and loose hair.</li>
    <li> bought for my wife she loves it</li>
    <li> Only negative is a stiff cord.  A swivel would make it a five star.</li>
    <li> I bought this in order to smooth out the wrinkles of the 3M Indoor Window Insulator Kit, and it worked perfectly for that purpose, especially at the highest setting and with the concentrator nozzle attachment. It did not get super hot (which was good for the window kit), though I have no idea if that&#x27;s good or bad from a hair drying perspective. I could have bought a cheaper hair dryer, but I chose this one because it is tourmaline ceramic, ionic, has several attachments, and multiple settings including a cool breeze setting -- all with the idea that after I was done using it on the window kit, I could provide it to female guests. This turned out to be a good idea, since my housemate&#x27;s younger sister is currently visiting, and she was happy that I had a hair dryer for her to use. I asked for her opinion, and she says, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s great.&amp;#34; Pressed for more details, she says, &amp;#34;I like that it has a lot of different settings.&amp;#34; As it turns out, this is in fact the first hair dryer she has ever used. So I might also recommend reading some of the other reviews... :)</li>
    <li> I needed a smaller hair dryer with a diffuser to use while traveling.  I saw this Conair and decided to give it a try.  It works great and the diffuser is a good one.  It fits well into my suitcase, taking up little room.  I can&#x27;t use hotel hair dryers because they do not have diffusers so this Conair is a great answer to my hairdo needs.  I have very wavy and thick hair and I like to have it curl.  To do this I need a diffuser and this hair dryer comes with one.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to attach the diffuser but once attached it&#x27;s stable and does not come off.  (On other hair dryers I&#x27;ve had the problem of diffusers coming off while I&#x27;m in the middle of drying my hair).  I highly recommend this hair dryer as an alternative to the larger ones, or as a second one to use while traveling.</li>
    <li> As a dude, I&#x27;m not particularly discerning about hairdryers.  That said, this gets the job done well.  Only downside, as a couple other reviewers have noted, is the rubberized texture that coats the entire dryer.  It looked and felt nice right out of the box, but after a few weeks of ownership patches bubbled and peeled off (if you&#x27;ve owned a cheap smartphone case, you know what I&#x27;m talking about).  This might be exacerbated by humidity (stored it in the bathroom) so you may want to keep it somewhere dry.</li>
    <li> They really are napkins and perform as a you would thing they should. No surprise. Color was as described. Pretty foolish to ask for a review of this type of item:)</li>
    <li> I immediately loved the soft, comfortable grip of this dryer and also the fact that it has a medium heat setting. I have an old, old Conair which has hot or cool shot only. It&#x27;s powerful enough and keeps my flyaways under control (I have fine hair). It comes with an attachment for helping add curls by scrunching hair while it&#x27;s wet which I will have to try. I will primarily use the directional attachment with a round brush to style my hair.  A wonderful, inexpensive hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Very nice...light and quiet. Drys hair quickly. This is a great, low cost blow dryer. Also comes with two attachments.  My hair looks great!</li>
    <li> I got this for a trip that I was taking and didn&#x27;t want to take my bulky dryer.  This one is lightweight, has good power selectiion and temperature control settings.  I&#x27;m very happy with Conair products</li>
    <li> the switches are surprisingly loose. i was surprised. but it works well, sooo :)</li>
    <li> Switch is hard to turn on/off.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is awesome! My goal was to find a hair dryer with a powerful blower so that it can dry hair faster, and this one has a powerful blower! The secret is its centrifugal design. This is the type of blower you&#x27;d find in a turbocharger. I don&#x27;t buy any of the marketing mumbo jumbo about ceramic and ion technology. What I like is that it has 3 heat settings controlled by its own button. This hairdryer is more powerful on low than my Revlon 1875W on high! I love this thing! Now let&#x27;s see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer. I read all the reviews before I ordered it. This is my second one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great hair dryer, light, fairly quiet.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair daily and I love this product! It&#x27;s quick and efficient. I would recommend it to my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> very powerful blowdryer but doesn&#x27;t fry my hair</li>
    <li> For the $$$, it&#x27;s a wonderful product. 3 years later and I&#x27;m just now noticing that it&#x27;s starting to die.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I just wish it had a simple on-off switch in addition to a multi-function slide switch. Just a small quibble.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it. Need I say anymore :-)</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with this hair dryer and she has very full, THICK hair!</li>
    <li> Bang for the buck very good. Good quality</li>
    <li> Buy this hair dryer. It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s powerful, and with my long hair it cut my blow time in half. Love</li>
    <li> Girlfriend and lady friend both use it.</li>
    <li> I does what it is supposed too, fast and not very noisy. I recommend.</li>
    <li> mom loves it and it works so I guess it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> So far, the hair dryer has worked great. I gave it only four stars because it is difficult to move the slide controls for the heat setting and for the blower setting, which are side by side. So, I just leave the controls set where I want and plug and unplug the dryer so that I don&#x27;t have to change the controls after I plug it in. If I remember, I will write another review in one year, if it lasts that long!</li>
    <li> The dryer itself does a great job. But the attachments don&#x27;t fit the dryer tight enough, so if you accidentally graze it, it flies right off the dryer. It&#x27;s annoying when you have to keep picking up a really hot object to reattach.</li>
    <li> OK, I never write reviews, but this hair dryer is so great, I just had to. It looks very basic, but it is everything you could want in a hair dryer and more. It is powerful, quiet, dries my hair in a flash, and from the very first time I used it, it made my hair amazingly soft and shiny. I didn&#x27;t even know a hair dryer could make that much difference! This is hands down the best hair dryer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Really comfortable to use because it is lightweight. The settings are great (3 speed and 3 temperature settings). Love that they are slide buttons not push buttons to avoid accidental presses. Heats up your hair, not your hand. Only thing I wish was that the wire was longer - it&#x27;s plugged into a knee height socket and it&#x27;s just about long enough for me to stand in front of it and dry my hair without moving from the spot.</li>
    <li> My Ginga loves this hair dryer and won&#x27;t use anything else she has long red hair that took a while to dry with other hairdryers. Not this one though, we just recently got into an argument over the amount of crap she packs and the hairdryer is one of them. Happy wife is a happy life though and I have to admit it does cut down on the amount of time it takes to get ready!!!</li>
    <li> buttons are a little tough to operate... but the machine is powerful and good.&lt;br /&gt;Should have had more attachments to go for.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is a lot quieter than my previous dryer.  I also like the variety of choices for heat/cool and strength of air.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom almost a year ago. My sister had taken her old one and so i was replacing it for her. In the item description it says it will dry your hair faster and she has been absolutely RAVING about it. The girls in my family all have really thick hair so this is a good quality to have in a hair dryer. She was drying a granddaughter&#x27;s hair after a bath and she said it took half the time that it usually does to dry her hair. I now want to buy one for myself!</li>
    <li> This is the fastest hair dryer I&#x27;ve used!!! I haven&#x27;t had an issue with the plastic melting like some of the other reviews. I set it on hot and high and just run it through my hair. It&#x27;s significantly faster than my last blowdryer. I don&#x27;t really see any decrease in frizz though which was a little disappointing. The attachments that come with the hairdryer are pretty useless in my opinion and it hinders my drying speed.</li>
    <li> Works great , does what it is supposed to do which is dry hair ..  yes the outer finish starts to peal a little bit around the handle but no big deal .. its a blow dryer not a pair of shoes.  The cost was great too!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer works well for the price. I would buy it again. Hair dries fairly quickly, but the air stream is not that strong.</li>
    <li> very good , powerful, with multi speed , good price , safe to use , my family loved it .</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT BLOW DRYER FOR THE PRICE ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE IT IF THE CORD WAS A BIT LONGER.</li>
    <li> Not too loud, toggle switch is a nice feature, and most importantly... you can hold onto the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; of the dryer without worrying about it getting too hot. I never like to hold the dryer from the designated handle region, so this was a really nice feature. Good price too. I used to use the babybliss dryers, but found they were too powerful for my hair, so I opted for this product, and I love it!</li>
    <li> Replaced an old model with this.  It is faster, quieter, and lighter than it&#x27;s predacessor.  Price the same as in stores,</li>
    <li> I got this to put in our guest room and then, comparing it to my vintage model, claimed it for myself. I don&#x27;t know how much &amp;#34;times&amp;#34; have changed since the last time I bought a hairdryer, but I was surprised at its slightly reduced output. It&#x27;s light, though, which is an improvement, and it&#x27;s easy to operate, so I like it overall.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for an affordable but fast drying dryer. This one is amazing. It gets my hair dry a lot quicker, does not overheat, and has great adjustable speeds and heating. However, I will say that the only con to this product is that it is not completely comfortable to hold. I will occasionally hit the cold button on the hair dyer because I don&#x27;t know where else to comfortably hold it.</li>
    <li> Cord is way too short.  I can&#x27;t hold it over my head when standing in my usual spot.  Also, it&#x27;s not hot enough.  The hottest setting is more warm than hot.  It is lighter and quieter than most, but I still regret buying it.  I did not tried the attachments.  They went into the trash along with the box.</li>
    <li> Overall, esp for the price, it&#x27;s ok, and while not really thrilled, won&#x27;t be returning it. Really, my only complaint (and for my slightly arthritic fingers a substantive complaint) is the almost flush-mounted speed and heat control buttons on the handle. Two narrow buttons tight into each other, and small ridges to use to push up or down. Makes it kinda clumsy to use. If I were using this daily it would be a deal breaker, but once a week or so it&#x27;s ok to put up with. And an ok price. Hope this helped.</li>
    <li> I did my research before buying a new hairdryer and this one fits the bill without having to spend $1-200.  It works well</li>
    <li> A hotel I stayed at had this model. Loved it so much came home from my trip and ordered it. Dries my hair quickly and small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> This delivers more blowing power than I have experienced before, which requires me to use the middle setting for my long, curly hair. My husband likes the high setting for a quick dry. Perfect for both of our diverse needs.</li>
    <li> It works. I just feel that the on and off switch is going to fall off in my hand one of these dats. Very flimsy!</li>
    <li> OK, but definitely a pro dryer.  Adequate for daily use.</li>
    <li> Very quiet and strong hair dryer, so far so good....but the button sides feel poorly made.  I have a feeling that&#x27;s the first part to break.</li>
    <li> Quick drying - not too loud. Surface has yet to peel as others have mentioned. Great price for a great dryer.</li>
    <li> Quality was great. Given as a gift and they loved it. No complaints.</li>
    <li> The hardest part of having your old hair dryer die on you is getting used to a new one.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is fabulous and so quiet compared to my old one!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good quality hair dryer without too many hairstyle requirements.It is a good choice. You have different choices of heat. Anyway, it meets my requirement.</li>
    <li> Good purchase for the money.  Very pleased with the product and seller. Will recommend these and the site to friends and family.  This was a gift and it goes everywhere when we travel.</li>
    <li> A little &amp;#34;clunky to hold&amp;#34; but otherwise works well</li>
    <li> I replaced a much more expensive dryer I bought at a hair salon with this one, because the expensive dryer cracked. This works just as well! It feels good to use (not too heavy or awkward), has a nice rubberized grip, works quickly, and isn&#x27;t too loud. Just what I&#x27;ve always wanted in a hair dryer! Bought it based on reviews here... thanks, other reviewers!</li>
    <li> Please do not waste your money like I did. It lasted me exactly  3 minutes. First it heated up and turned off automatically within a minute or so. I restarted it, but it immediately turned off again and this time for good. I tried to return it for a refund, but the status kept reading : we are waiting for your return or something similar. It is not the end of the world, but I certainly am a very unhappy customer.</li>
    <li> Great price of course but my wife had one of these for 8 years and it finally went craps. This was its replacment and I will say it&#x27;s pretty cheaply made. Hoping it will last as long as the other.</li>
    <li> I needed a blow dryer this works perfectly</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works well, however, after about a year or so of use, the clear plastic coating around it, has started to peel off. This speaks to the quality of the materials used. It still works and I still use it but just wanted to mention that. It is pretty light, which is a good thing when you have a lot of hair to dry! The main reason I purchased this one was because it was more affordable than the salon brands.</li>
    <li> We bought this to replace our 10 year old junker of a hairdryer. I have to say after being used to barely any airflow, this hairdryer seems pretty powerful for its size. It has a nice matte black finish that doesn&#x27;t clash with anything in the bathroom. I also really like the dual screens to filter lint, especially since you can open up the outer one and get it really clean. The settings are like any other hairdryer- cool, warm and hot but warm and hot settings are much cooler than some other hairdryers. Personally I like it that way, but if you want lava hot air you should probably find another dryer.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue (and its not a big one at all) is that the dryer came with a bunch of grease pencil markings on the body of it, probably from the manufacturer. So far I haven&#x27;t been able to get them off, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;A very nice, simple hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Conair is a good brand name so I bought this one to replace the my old Conair&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;* Strong fan. I can feel a lot of air coming out even with lower setting.&lt;br /&gt;* Light weight: My young daughter needs to use it to work with her long her for an period of time&lt;br /&gt;* Quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;* Heat/Speed setting buttons are made of cheap plastic. Compared with another Conair I bought at the local wholesale store with similar price last year, this one looks cheap and not sturdy. I don&#x27;t think it can last long.&lt;br /&gt;So far with the discount price, this dryer is OK.</li>
    <li> I really thought that it was not worth buying but the first time that i blew out my hair i was impressed.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. It works great. No problems. Good Price. I got one for every bathroom.  Good power. easy buy.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I like how it has a &amp;#34;coo/warm/hot&amp;#34; switch AND a &amp;#34;low/high&amp;#34; switch and not just one switch making you choose low and cool or hot and high. I also love the little attachment it comes with to give a more concentrated blow to a specific section of hair. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good sized hair dryer. Takes a lot of space to put away if you don&#x27;t have a large sink cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it doesn&#x27;t seem to require too much time to have your hair completely dry, however I really dislike the feel and design of the buttons (the ones to choose the temperature and the level of drying). They feel really flimsy and like they&#x27;re about to fall off.</li>
    <li> I have been raving to my friends about this hair dryer because it was so much less expensive and yet better than my last. It is lightweight, easy to use and I could not believe the price on amazon.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I really like being able to change the heat settings. My only complaint is that the controls are in the same place as my hand so I sometimes inadvertently change the settings.</li>
    <li> The first thing you notice even before use and what make it uncomfortable to use is that cord is far too short!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool air is waaay too cold and doesn&#x27;t dry your hair and the hot will just fry it. But still NOT DRY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not what I was expected from all great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning this product what made me really disappointed too. Cuz I got JUST $19.95 back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon charged me not only 5.48 for shipping back (which is fine)  but some random fees too and taxes. I bought item for $29.99, refund price was $23.99 for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with  refund of $19.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More then 10$ for waist of the time ???!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item Refund: $23.99&lt;br /&gt;  Item Tax Refund: $1.44&lt;br /&gt;  Shipping Refund: $3.71&lt;br /&gt;  Shipping Promotion Deduction*: ($3.71)&lt;br /&gt;  Return Shipping Fee Refund Deduction: ($5.48)</li>
    <li> this product is excellent, good quality, durable excellent presentation. I had no problems even with quality. thanks you for it</li>
    <li> Bought this based on other Amazon purchases.  Better than average, not great.  Pros:  Good volume of air flow, thick cord, large handle.  Cons: large, heavier than most dryers I have.  Is rather long so you have to hold it farther back in order to not blast your scalp.  Good for home use, would not travel with it.  Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in hair &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; which others commented about.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product from other customers before I purchased this dryer.  I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer! I have owned several hairdryers over the years and have even been known to burn up a few...  This dryer gets my thick hair completely dry and frizz-free in under 3 minutes.  I use product and a round brush and have been very pleased with this dryer.  It is quiet and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  I love the adjustable heat and speed settings.  I also use the concentrator attachment to channel the air.  I was unable to find this product at any local retailers (Walmart and Target are the two I checked) and i think it is better than the Conair Infinity X pro model.  If you need a dryer that gets your hair dry quickly and with minimal frizz, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> This dryer does what it is made for no more, no less. Definitely quieter than my old dryer, although it seems to take a minute or two longer to actually dry my hair. Neither of the included tips would stay on while in use, but overall I feel I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Would have been a 5-star review for drying, but unit is a little heavy and gets really HOT.  I can live with it, but these are the reasons for the lower rating.</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer for many reasons - it&#x27;s quiet, can dry my hair quickly and produces great results. It&#x27;s also pretty light weight.</li>
    <li> It dries hair quickly and it&#x27;s not to loud.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong yet, had it for a while. Handle is peeling a bit, some people might care, I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m spoiled by salon quality dryers so you get what you pay for - wish this was hotter sometimes, wish the peeling didn&#x27;t happen, but it&#x27;s not affecting the job it&#x27;s doing so whatever. It&#x27;s just a dryer!</li>
    <li> First Amazon Review... So I bought this hair dryer as my main hairdryer at home. I typically use the WARM setting. Overall, great finish and works very well. Despite me using the warm (not hot) setting, the thin film of plastic over the barrel and handle slowly started to peel off. Not a big deal, but definitely worth noting, in case that bothers you. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t look so pretty now, and I&#x27;ve had it for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great value for the money and excellent results, but the packaging I&#x27;d give a 4/10, they could have done better.</li>
    <li> Great performance and price</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement. Good dryer!</li>
    <li> So far I love this hair dryer. I was bummed that my old Conair died after 10 years. Yes you read that right. 10 years!! I loved that hair dryer and I loved how quickly it dried my hair. The new dryer works well so far. It has different speeds and heat levels on two different controls which I really like. The cold air button works great. I really have no complaints.</li>
    <li> had difficulty with switches due to reduced mobility of my hands. no problem with any other features</li>
    <li> I bought this keeping in mind that the cool shot button may not work after reading a review. I blow dry my hair at most 3 times for the year so for me it does the job. I use the cool setting which still feels a little warm to me but it helps to stretch my hair very well but without the heat damage (I still use heat protectant though). But.. the cool shot button DEFINITELY DOESN&#x27;T WORK</li>
    <li> This dryer takes a very long time to dry my fine, wavy, chin length hair (20 minutes or more). I think the problem is weak airflow. Also, the styling nozzle keeps falling off, which is really annoying. I&#x27;ve had this dryer only six months, and am already investing in a new dryer of a different brand.  I thought the problem was my hair until I blow dried my own hair at my salon with my stylist&#x27;s dryer, and it came out shiny and beautiful in so much less time. Since I use the same brush and product as her, I know it must be the dryer. For an inexpensive dryer, I preferred the Andis. I am paying a little more for my next dryer which is supposed to be of better quality.</li>
    <li> What else would you want? I bought this 6 months ago, and it&#x27;s still working great. The three temperatures settings are useful.</li>
    <li> works extremely well!</li>
    <li> nice work.i pretty love it. low price and good function. not loudly._and i recommend you to buy it and you will not regret.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> pretty good blow dryer. wish it had just a tad bit more power, but honestly, it&#x27;s not bad. (it&#x27;s not some cheap hotel-dryer)</li>
    <li> Its a good hairdryer, but it is a little too big. Also it doesn&#x27;t fold so its difficult to carry it when traveling.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I have super long thick hair &amp; this has cut my drying time down significantly. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> best hair drier I have used.  My wife figured out how quiet and powerful it is and put hers away and started using mine.  Ron</li>
    <li> This dryer cut my drying time down from 15 minutes to under 3 minutes! I have medium length hair - Great price, Love it!</li>
    <li> This is everything I need in a hair dryer. I have medium-textured wavy hair, and the diffuser really helps make the most of my curls and waves. They turn out with great volume and shine (my husband says my hair is &amp;#34;fluffy--but in a good way&amp;#34;), and less frizz than I get with letting my hair air dry. Overall, the product does its job and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This blower dryer is the bomb. It dried my hair super fast there are three heat settings and a cool down setting, very 21st centuary.  Shipping was fast too. I love the compact size it&#x27;s not too big or too small.  And as far as blow dryers go it&#x27;s not nosy at all. I can finally blow dry my hair with out disturbing the nieghbors.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair but this dryer dries my hair very quickly..it also makes my hair a lot smoother! I would definitely recommend to others for its price and quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a blow-dryer that is supposed to dry your hair (and occasionally clothes that needs a quick dry :)). And it&#x27;s great at doing that. One thing though, if you get too close to it there&#x27;s a funny smell that comes out. I don&#x27;t know, like paint or something. But still, it&#x27;s perfect for the price. Also comes with attachments which doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) low noise&lt;br /&gt;2) high airflow volume&lt;br /&gt;3) useful accessories included&lt;br /&gt;4) affordable&lt;br /&gt;5) non-slip texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) no foldable grip&lt;br /&gt;2) flimsy switch</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is perfect for long hair.  It is easy to use.  I am very thankful I got it.</li>
    <li> THis tourmaline ceramic blowdryer dries your hair without frizzing it out.  My hair actually feels softer after using this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Love it. The controls are easy to use but do not get in your way.  It runs much quieter than other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My previous hairdryer that I owned for at least 10 years was wonderful until the plug died. I probably could have taken it somewhere to have a new plug put on, but I decided to simply get a new hairdryer. I&#x27;m very happy with my new Conair 225R.</li>
    <li> My other Conair 1875 was starting to turn itself off (shorting out?) during use so I hunted Amazon reviews for a good one with Prime shipping. This one came up with the most reviews in this price range. I know I shouldn&#x27;t but I wash and dry my hair every day. I needed something reliable but under $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that bothered me was that I received an obvious return which doesn&#x27;t bode well. I&#x27;ve tried this for a couple days so the jury&#x27;s still out but right away here&#x27;s what I like and don&#x27;t like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-very quiet&lt;br /&gt;-lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-useful attachments&lt;br /&gt;-multiple speed options&lt;br /&gt;-cool shot&lt;br /&gt;-ability to clean filter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-nozzle is longer&lt;br /&gt;-matte finish makes it slippery to hold&lt;br /&gt;-cool shot button is much shorter than older Conair&lt;br /&gt;-easy to accidentally press/hold cool shot when you don&#x27;t want it&lt;br /&gt;-speed/heat button sliders very cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;-filter is hinged and doesn&#x27;t open all the way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For price and value, okay buy. If you have short arms like I do, the longer barrel makes for an awkward morning ritual. Also, since it&#x27;s slippery to hold, you have to learn how to hold it differently which can be problem, if like me, you have arthritis issues. With the old Conair, I could lazily hold it however I want. I could rest my thumb below the cool shot button since it protruded at least 1/2&amp;#34; and you really had to push it down to use it. The cool shot on this one is flimsy and depresses quite easily. I&#x27;m also worried about the settings buttons. It does not seem very secure and/or there is only a small attachment in the middle. In other words, as you slide them, the top and bottom of the buttons are not attached in any way to the unit. They actually stick out a little bit (are not completely flushed against the handle). Whether this will be a problem should they come off remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a mixed bag but it was priced fairly cheap. Will update rating if it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I&#x27;m already drying it out by repeated washings).f it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I&#x27;m already drying it out by repeated washings).</li>
    <li> The bad reviews of this product were pretty accurate but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a new hair dryer.  The attachments don&#x27;t stay on, and the sliding controls for power and heat are so difficult to move I have to use a towel to get enough traction to turn my hair dryer on.  The &#x27;high&#x27; temperature is extremely hot, which dries my hair very quickly, but I&#x27;m not convinced it helps my hair look healthy, as my ends have started to look like straw since I started using this hair dryer. I wish I had invested in a better hair dryer!</li>
    <li> So far it still working.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to handle</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is lightweight and has a nice feel in your hands. The toggle switches are great so that you don&#x27;t unintentionally turn the dryer off while in use. My only complaint is that it seems to be lacking in power compared with some dryers I have used. I have really long and thick hair so it took a little longer to dry it. On that note, my hair was smoother than it would have been using a higher powered dryer. Overall a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot of work. I hate blow drying my hair as I have very long and curly hair. This blow dryer does not make it any better or faster of a process.</li>
    <li> Really love how fast it dries my hair... It helps save me time in the morning and anything that accomplished that gets an A&#x3D; rating in my book...</li>
    <li> I have previously owned this brand, and wanted to buy the same. Great features and versatility. I also love they styling</li>
    <li> have not had it long enough to evaluate its performance over time, but so far I love it. lightweight and powerful.</li>
    <li> The Conair 225NP is a really great product. I am very happy with different temperature levels, especially useful for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw is that the switches are not easy to use. It&#x27;s a bit of annoyance as I cannot do it just with one hand. But overall I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. Not too strong. Not too weak. It dries hair as it should.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer really dries my hair! The hot air blows out one end after you turn it on, and after awhile, my hair is dry. What more could you ask for!</li>
    <li> really does blow my hair flat and shiny.. almost too flat at times. My hair has a natural wave and this blows it out straight.</li>
    <li> The dryer works great .. would be a 5-star if cord was another 18-inches longer ... also the slower speed is a tad to slow.  As for durability... to soon to tell have only had for a couple of months</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe people rated this blow dryer good.  Maybe it would be good for thin hair. But for thick hair, it sucks.  It also feels extremely cheap. I would compare this to a $15 blow dryer. definitely not worth 30 bucks.</li>
    <li> Works great, no problems.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer is good, however, I do not like the cheap plastic slide up and down tabs that you have to operate the dryer.  At times they feel so flimsy that they are going to break or just pop off.</li>
    <li> Took years for me to buy a new hairdryer and I will never wait again to do so.  This hairdryer has power, works great, on the quieter side of blow dryers and really does the job!</li>
    <li> My friend got this from me as a b-day gift, she is absolutely happy! she takes it everywhere she travels.</li>
    <li> Really good hairdryer. Purchased this one after our other Conair (who&#x27;s still going strong!) was just getting too old. Speeds are nice and it doesn&#x27;t burn you like our other one did. Also surprisingly very light!</li>
    <li> Not too hot , not cool , very good dryer , won&#x27;t destroy your hair, feel better, valuable , so I love it !</li>
    <li> causes circulate every time!</li>
    <li> button is too hard to push</li>
    <li> My wife loves it!!  She had a decent hairdryer before, and the GFI plug broke.  Decided to purchase a good quality.  The tourmaline and ceramic together is a great combination (according to her)  It has a full rubberized feel to it that is really nice.</li>
    <li> The dryer is good, but the controls are difficult to use.</li>
    <li> great dryer, but on off switch is difficult for arthritic fingers!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! best hairdryer I have ever had</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about hairstyling -- I just need something to dry my hair so I can iron it flat. This has worked pretty well, and it&#x27;s a little quieter than my old one (which was just a little cheap thing, but it lasted eight years). No complaints.</li>
    <li> This dryer is really great. It&#x27;s light weight, has all the settings you need and moves air quickly through your hair for a fast dry. My hair is very porous (lots of highlighting :-) and it dries my hair very quickly and my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many hand held hairdryers throughout the years and this may become my all-time favorite, simply because unlike most dryers the highest setting blows out warm air instead of air so hot it burns the scalp.  The handle never overheats, also a problem with other dryers and it seems much quieter.</li>
    <li> A couple of months after I purchased this hair dryer, the ceramic started peeling all over the dryer - especially around the handle and the nozzle. Not only is it nasty looking, but the material flakes all over the place, including in my hair while I&#x27;m drying it. The dryer still works fine, but I would never recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used to have a $200 dollar hairdryer but when it died after 7 years I didn&#x27;t feel that I could justify replacing it. So I bought this one after reading tons of reviews as it seemed it would have decent performance for a significantly lower price. I only wanted to review it to mention that the handle is degrading like a few of the other reviewers mentioned, after approximately 6 months of daily use. It looks like I have had it for years as it is is discolored and crackly looking. It hasn&#x27;t impacted performance which has always been fine. I did have to learn a new way to dry my long hair with this as I did have issues with causing huge tangles in my hair with the method I used with my old hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I had a hair dryer I had for years, it finally pooped out, I bought this one and used it today, It dries my hair great, I have curly unruley hair, it smoothed it out, no frizz, and it dried it fast.</li>
    <li> this hair dryer works very well ...i had no problem with it....it dried my hair quickly and easily...i was able to use my style brush as i dried my hair..</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my ancient Conair dryer. This one is much quieter and dries a lot quicker.  *Edit &amp; Update 01/31/2017  I am still using this dryer and it still works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as hot as previous dryers I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s held up for over a year, so I&#x27;m not going to pan it altogether, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend or buy it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome dryer! It&#x27;s fast and efficient with less noise than my old Conair dryer! Fast shipping was a plus!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I am purchasing this hair dryer because it has a strong quiet motor that I haven&#x27;t been able to find in other hair dryers.  It also reduces the amount of frizz in my hair when using the concentrator nozzle.  The only reason why I had to purchase it again was because the notches on the concentrator nozzle wore out on my old one and the concentrator would no longer stay on the hair dryer, so that would be one improvement to this model. I will use my old hair dryer without the concentrator to initially dry my hair, and use the new one with the concentrator only so that I don&#x27;t wear out the notches with time by taking it on and off.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot but still frizzes my hair. On-off switch is flimsy and clumsy to operate.</li>
    <li> I had been using the same dryer for probably the last 5 years or so and it gave out on me, so I went in search of a reasonably priced replacement. This one had good reviews, so I decided to try it. Wow, I cannot believe the difference! For something this price, I was expecting a duplicate of my old cheap one, but this is WAY better. My hair is naturally wavy (almost curly) and I can get it nearly straight with this dryer (keep in mind, I am TERRIBLE at blow drying my own hair and with my old dryer couldn&#x27;t get anything close to straight). The air is hot, but not to the point that I feel it is damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My only tiny complaint would be that I accidentally push the Cool Shot button sometimes due to its location, but I think almost every dryer has it in that same place.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend! A LOT of bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> I discovered this while on vacation recently.  All of the hotels we have stayed in recently have had this blow dryer available for guests.  It&#x27;s light weight, fairly quiet, and the variable temperatures sold me.  It also has a cool button which is fantastic when it&#x27;s hot.  I actually ordered this from Amazon while still on vacation so it would be at my home when I returned.</li>
    <li> Has all the functions i wanted. Like the cool setting the most. Makes drying off a hole lot more fun. Looks good too.</li>
    <li> I replaced my wife&#x27;s old dryer with this one, and it works like a charm.  She has considerably more options and even uses it on our young daughter&#x27;s hair.  Very sturdy and looks like it will last quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair that needs a lot of heat to dry and be styled. I was pretty disappointed right away by the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting - didn&#x27;t feel very hot to me. The only time the air actually felt hot, rather than warm, was when I turned the setting up to &#x27;high&#x27; - and then I had to work so fast to dry my hair that if I made a mistake, I would have to wet my hair and start over again! The &#x27;high&#x27; setting is no joke, it really moves the air. But I can&#x27;t use it every day or else I&#x27;d look like I just walked out of a wind tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t find the switches very easy to use, especially if my hands were even a little damp - was hard to get a good grip (maybe I&#x27;m just a weakling?). I much prefer switches that actually protrude from the handle that can be flipped with your thumb, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s not totally useless, I just had some issues with it. I will say the concentrator and diffuser attachments are great, but with the heat/speed settings, just not a good match for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer, not for everyday use but for occasional use and it works really good.  I&#x27;m not sure how others that use this product on a daily basis feel about it but for occasional use it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> I broke my very old hair dryer (also 1875 watts) and was looking for a good replacement. This one was surprisingly cheap but doesn&#x27;t look that way in person. The matte finish look and feels lovely in your hands, and it has some weight to it so you don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to break if you wave it around. I have shoulder-blade-length hair and it can dry my hair in 2-3 minutes flat.</li>
    <li> We were using Japanese brand Hair Dryer before this but it broke so we had to get another one. I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s all american brand or what but this thing is soooo loud!! I was watching video on my laptop in the next door and I could not hear the video even with max volume. It does dry the hair up real nice but it just really LOUD!! We were just so used to Japanese brand high quality quiet hair dryer, this thing is a monster. If you don&#x27;t care about the loudness, go for it. It does work like it advertise. As a dryer works awesome!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a few months now and love it!  Being pregnant in Arizona makes it really hard to blow dry your hair without feeling overheated, so the cool setting makes this so much easier!  When I say \\&quot;cool setting\\&quot; I mean just that.  You don&#x27;t have to constantly hold down the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button as with most traditional dryers, you just push the lever down and it blows cool air instead of hot.  I would give this a five star rating, however, there are some small cosmetic issues with this dryer.  For example, the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button lettering has already started to scratch off and there appears to be a clear coat peeling issue on the handle; however, none of these issues affect its ability to quickly dry your hair.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this dryer!</li>
    <li> Worked ok for a year and then the high setting crapped out-Also a bit in the heavy side-I guess a percentage will be lemons like mine</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is powerful and easy to use. It is exactly what I need. I like it and recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to substitute one that had less h and it did not have a \\&quot;cold\\&quot; operate on it. I think it does an excellent job, and the \\&quot;cold\\&quot; operate is very awesome. It is not as noisy as my old one (which was like a 747 getting in the bathroom). The only issue that I have with it is that it is difficult to convert on and off with one handy. It might just be me but, if a individual had joint disease or RA, this would not be the clothing dryer for them.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it for more than 5-10 minutes/week.  But works great, very comfortable to hold.  Just what I needed for my purposes.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer does its job, but takes way to long. The heat coming out of the dryer could be hotter to help get the job done quicker. I bought and use this hair dryer to blow dry my beard every morning, about half of the time I just go out into my garage and use an air nozzle hooked up to my compressor and get the job done a lot quicker.</li>
    <li> Arrived the next day and works perfect.</li>
    <li> The wife is very happy with this.  It was a replacement of a similar Conair that lasted many years.  This one has held up for a few months now and looks like it will hold up like the old one.  I am pretty sure she will buy a similar Conair if/when this one breaks.</li>
    <li> was in the market for a new one and this one works great.  I have carpal tunnel, so i can&#x27;t handle drying my hair for long periods of time.  Fast, quick, light weight.  Great product</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on other reviews.  I was not disappointed!  The price is reasonable.  It is relatively quiet, the fan has just the right amount of power - enough for styling but not so much that your hair is blowing all over.  It&#x27;s hot enough to dry your hair quickly without damaging it.  This is exactly what I wanted in a hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  Bought two of them!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas after she was telling me she was having a hard time finding a blowdryer that would really BLOW.  I have this (got it locally) and like that it has different speeds and temperature settings and that, on high, it will really BLOW your hair.  I took back like 3 different ones before I finally found this one.  It&#x27;s amazing that most of the dryers out there either don&#x27;t get hot enough, don&#x27;t come with the attachments I use, or don&#x27;t actually produce enough &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34;.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well but paint peeled off handle in a short time.</li>
    <li> This is lightweight and quiet and seems to keep my hair smoother.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thing!  The wind tunnel effect is pretty damn awesome - so much so that other blow dryers just seem inadequate whenever I use them now.  I have not experienced any of the fading or peeling of label lettering or the material itself as some other reviewers mentioned, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.  Mine works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, have an issue with the concentrator attachment that this thing comes with.  The concentrator keeps coming loose and falls off even with the slight knock when I&#x27;ve had it on for a while - perhaps because the dryer gets so hot and the plastic expands or something?  It&#x27;s not enough of a problem for me to not give this dryer 5 stars, but probably a design issue that needs to be addressed in future versions.</li>
    <li> I just bought this today at Walgreens Drug Store for 24.99, and this was not a sale price. Sorry, Amazon, I think consumers should be advised to check prices. I bought this after reading reviews on Amazon, haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it looks good, light and easy to hold, and I like the hang up loop . I will update my review after I use the dryer.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. Been using it for a few months now and no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Very quiet and light weight. I have very fine hair so I only have to use the medium setting to dry my hair.  shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> I found the Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer very hard to turn on, choose my heat selection and choose the intensity of the blower.  I think Conair should have made the ridges on the two selectors more pronounced.  I also found the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting far too powerful to comfortably style my bangs.  What I do like, compared to other hair dryer makes is that the \\&quot;cold air\\&quot; button was extremely user friendly.  The dryer itself works just fine and is comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, dries super fast with a reasonable noise-level.  Definitely dries faster than my old dryer and lacks that &amp;#34;overheated metal&amp;#34; smell even on Hot (yay!).  The only criticism that I can offer is that the Hot setting on this dryer has the same heat as the Medium setting on my old Vidal Sassoon dryer.  I&#x27;m good with that but for people who like a lot of heat, this dryer may disappoint.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail this morning along with a new round brush and an HSI hair straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I almost didn&#x27;t even need the straightener, except to calm down my bangs that have a wicked natural curl. I didn&#x27;t even have to use hairspray to keep my hair tame! That has always been part of my morning ritual.. but after using this dryer my hair was super shiny and straight (NO FRIZZ) and since I didn&#x27;t have to use any product its feather light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will use some hairspray later if its windy. But for now, I like the fact that its so soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cons, I can see people with very long or thick hair taking far more time to dry and style than mine as this hair dryer does lack the power some of you might need. However, I cannot speak for those of you that need that power. I found the dryer to be more than enough for me.</li>
    <li> This is light weight and has a lot of bells and whistles.  However, for smoothing hair, I thing the Babylis Pro BABTT5585 Tourmaline Titanium 3000 Dryer reg and travel, are much better.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is mediocre. The attachments fall off and the high/low is difficult to use while drying my hair. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dried my hair twice with it and it made my hairstyle work easier than with my old hairdryer that is losing it&#x27;s power.  Happy with the temperatures and heat.</li>
    <li> Too short cord. I wish it had little longer cord. So i dont have to bend down to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the cool setting which I use to dry my hair in order to avoid applying excess heat to my hair. I use it on a daily basis and it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied with this purchase, and I totally recommend it</li>
    <li> OK....just wish it got a little hotter.</li>
    <li> Have used Conair hair dryers for over 30 years. I liked the soft grip and the dryer is comfortable hold. Also liked the air volume produced by the fan. Unfortunately those were not enough...this model has sliding switches which are difficult to move, only using your thumb. I also found the high heat temperature was not hot enough (for me). I purchased the Professional Conair model and will be giving away the Tourmaline model.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t owned a hair dryer before because when I would use my friend&#x27;s hair dryers they would just make my hair super frizzy and huge. This blow dryer makes my hair soft and I have been getting so many compliments on my hair. People hardly believe me when I tell them the only thing I&#x27;m doing differently is blow drying my hair. Drys pretty quickly too. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived so long without it!</li>
    <li> working fine. chord a bit short but hair dryer works good so far.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer because I have naturally curly hair and the diffuser works great. The hair dryer temp settings plus I know if it last as long as my last Conair hair dryer 9 years I will be happy. This is the third Conair hair dryer I have bought</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She claims it dries her hair faster. I guess it does because it seems like I spend less time waiting on her to get out of the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Best blow drier I&#x27;ve ever owned. Light and powerful. The power button is actually 2 buttons side by side. One button controls the heat setting and the other controls the fan speed. I really like this feature because you can set it on low heat and the fan on high.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer has a high speed and low speed.  The high speed is too strong.  My long hair is tangled and blown around wildly.  The low speed is too low to use as a setting to style my hair.  There needs to be a medium speed, or the high air speed should be reduced.  If I had a &amp;#34;do over&amp;#34;, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; dryers in the past and have been very unimpressed with those, but this one really does make a visible difference on my hair. I have long, wavy hair that tends to be extremely frizzy when I blow it dry with a normal hair dryer, no matter what products or technique I use. The very first time I dried it with this hair dryer, it looked smoother and straighter than it used to look after I \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; the frizziness with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air flow is great, and even though this dryer doesn&#x27;t get the air as hot as my old one, my hair dried faster and looked much better (and also did not require any other styling - just a round brush and this dryer were all I needed to get it looking great). I haven&#x27;t tried the concentrator yet, and probably won&#x27;t use it. I did try the diffuser - sometimes I like to scrunch my hair with a diffuser and go with a curly look. I was happy with the function of the diffuser. It isn&#x27;t quite as deep of a \\&quot;cup shape\\&quot; as my old diffuser so it was a little harder to use, but it stays on the dryer better so that&#x27;s a wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that whether I use this dryer with the diffuser and some gel for soft curls, or use it with a round brush to achieve a sleek look, my hair looks and feels great when I&#x27;m done. MUCH less frizz either way, without needing do use a flat iron or curling iron after, which saves time and effort. The dryer is light weight, with well placed controls and it is easy to use. I am pleased with this purchase and would not hesitate to recommend this hair dryer to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED 5/9/13: This dryer was really great when it actually worked, but about a month ago the airflow started to vary quite a bit from day to day. Finally, this week the motor burned out. Yes, with smoke and everything. Disappointing to only get 6 months from this dryer when my previous one lasted through six years of daily use.</li>
    <li> It works great.  No complaints. It&#x27;s not too noisy and my hair dries very nicely after use.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer but have gone through two in the last year. I always use the defuser with it and the defuser attachment ALWAYS falls off (about 30 times during a blow dry). This dryer works well on frizz when the defuser is staying on, but it is extremely frustrating to constantly stop and reattach it.</li>
    <li> For the price, this one is a decent value. After 2 years it&#x27;s still going strong although it gives off a bit of a burning smell when first started on hi temp. A bit heavy, no removable filter for complete cleaning and I wish it had a folding handle but otherwise no regrets.</li>
    <li> Blows cold and hot air. The paint eventually cracks after a couple months, but it&#x27;s for blowing hair not looking nice. Works great for me!</li>
    <li> My old blow dryer just quit on me one day so I ordered this one and it works great.  It came with a curling head and a flat head and I have had no issues yet.  Has good air strength and lets you choose cool, warm or hot.</li>
    <li> Not only does this dryer dry hair quickly and quietly, it is easy to use.  There are two control switches, one for temperature (cool, medium, and hot) and one for fan speed (off, low, and high).  I have long, straight hair, and my hair is mostly dry in about three minutes on the high, hot setting - without leaving my hair feeling too hot or damaged.</li>
    <li> I only use a hair dryer occasionally, so this has done the job so far.  It has cool, warm, and hot temperature settings, as well as off, low, and high air settings.  I have not experienced the peeling other reviewers described, but that may be due to occasional usage, and the fact that I have only owned this for a month so far.</li>
    <li> The dryer as a whole is what I expected but the sleek-drying attachment does not stay on well and always at some point during the hair-drying process, falls off. Kinda annoying but that&#x27;s my only real hang-up.</li>
    <li> It works quite well. Several choices on both temperature and wind power. The noise is OK. It is a nice hair dryer!!</li>
    <li> Compact, light, not too noisy compared to others. High quality for the price. Came in perfect condition, I use it every day and it&#x27;s still perfect.</li>
    <li> Happy with my new hair dryer.  Just a minor issue....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: lightweight, durable (I have 2 teenagers that bang this thing around)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the attachment started to pop if you bumped it...however, I just bought some black electrical tape from Dollar Tree and taped the attachment on (we use it all the time) and haven&#x27;t had any issues since.</li>
    <li> Own this for a while. No problems so far. Worked as well as it did on the first day I purchased it. Some nice features for the money</li>
    <li> This review is easy.  Best damned hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Have tried expensive ionic, ceramic, high falutin&#x27; brands and this one works better at a much lower price, Enough said</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer.  Maybe it&#x27;s because ours was old and no longer did the ion thing, but this one prevents frizz and dries hair very quickly.  And its not huge.  It&#x27;s a normal size in my opinion, smaller than many in the market.  Could not ask for more in a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> My wife has really long hair that is very thick her old blow dryer would take her about 30 minutes to completely dry her hair. After looking online we decided to get this particular hair dryer and I am very happy with it. It only takes her at most 10 minutes to dry her hair completely. Been using it now for about a year and it still works just as good. It has even survived multiple falls from the bathroom sink area.</li>
    <li> A great product for a great price! I am glad I bought it. It is more than I expected. .</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer a few months ago to replace my old one (a different brand). This new hair dryer is as powerful as my last one (which I loved), but much quieter and my hair does not feel frizzy afterwards. My only complaint is that the handle is peeling a little at the bottom.</li>
    <li> Did not use this myself. I sent it to my sister who was temporarily sans hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;She loved it, said it was a very good one.</li>
    <li> Not the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. It works, but it seems to take a long time to dry my hair, which is wavy, thick and coarse. I end up straightening my hair, anyway, so now I just wash it and sleep on it wet and straighten in the morning. I don&#x27;t bother with the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This is an item that my girlfriend requested on her wishlist, and i got it for her. She loves it, and apparently it is amazing. I am bald now, so I have no need for such things, but it&#x27;s nice to know I bought her something that is great at drying the hair one might have.</li>
    <li> Super great drying ability, the heat and the power are a great combination for quick drying.  The only problem I have with this product is that I feel the power button is a little hard to slide.  When I&#x27;m holding the curling brush with one hand and operating the blow dryer with the other, it&#x27;s tough to work the off/on &amp;#34;slider&amp;#34; button with the thumb of my left hand.  If you look at the front of the picture featured, the gray area at the bottom front of the unit is the on/off and immediately beside it is another slider for low/high.</li>
    <li> its a pretty good hair dry, very light so easy to travel with. the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because it doesnt get quite as hot as i like. other than that, its a great hair dryer.</li>
    <li> have used conair products for years.  never been disappointed.  last hairdryer lasted 20 years. my entire family uses conair products</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairdryer now for less than a year but several months.  It&#x27;s adequate.  The cord is a bit shorter than I&#x27;d like making movement a bit restrained.  The slider switches for the temperature (on the left) and the speed (on the right) are cheaply made.  They&#x27;re plastic and if I don&#x27;t take extra pampering with them, they WILL break.  They are flimsy.  They act like they want to pop off sometimes but I push down on them and they snap back down.  The Cool button is in the way...period.  Whoever designed this should not have put that button where it&#x27;s located.  It&#x27;s right in the grab area on the handle making it awkward handling the dryer as you dry your hair.  The force of the blowing is pretty extreme.  Even on low, this dryer blows pretty hard.  I have to be careful where I aim it or things on my countertop will blow off...even on low setting.  The low blow setting is more like a medium blow setting.  As for making my hair silky, well, it does seem to make my hair a bit more healthy.  I can&#x27;t deny.  It has kept my hair from getting out-of-control frizzy.  I have slightly wavy hair naturally, so when I dry it, I try to straighten it as I dry.  It still sometimes turns out a slightly frizzy, but nothing a flat iron can&#x27;t finish off.  I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron as much..I will say that.  I&#x27;ve used the diffuser a couple of times and it does help to dry my hair without the direct blowing.  Not sure it does better than using my fingers though. Maybe i&#x27;m just not doing it right..who knows.  Overall, it&#x27;s an ok dryer.  I&#x27;m not liking the flimsy buttons and the awkwardness of the location of the Cool button, but I am trying to use the Cool button more now to &amp;#34;cool off and set&amp;#34; a lifted portion of hair to give it body and it seems to help.  Time will tell if the filters will do their job.  I bought this dryer because my last (Revlon brand) dryer&#x27;s filter disintegrated for some reason.  I guess it was just too old. I loved my old dryer but it wasn&#x27;t this new ionic feature type.  I decided to change to this since reviewers and ads said it would make my hair silky.  ...and it does.  So for that, I give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> have everything i want,  go ooo oo o o o o o o o o o o oo o o d</li>
    <li> When my old dryer exploded (yes literally) I was very concerned about finding another.  I had tried others along the way, but none seemed to have the variety of settings or power that my old one did.  After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to give this one a try &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I love that I can select different heat settings &amp; speeds.  My daughter hates to have her hair dried, but will allow me to do it if I set the speed on low &amp; the heat on cool, whereas I like a warm setting &amp; full blowing power so it&#x27;s great to find a dryer that suits us both.  Many dryers don&#x27;t have the choice or they just lack power.  We have very thick hair &amp; this does a nice job of drying quickly without being too loud.</li>
    <li> Only been using this for about a week now so I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the dryer but I really love it so far.  Hair dryers have always been kind of hit and miss, mostly miss for me.  They are usually not strong enough, or too hot, or not hot enough, or cheaply made (even expensive ones), etc.  I have thick long hair and it takes forever to dry.  This dryer is amazing.  It has several settings and on the hottest, strongest setting I can dry my hair faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve had.  But it doesn&#x27;t get overly hot either.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m burning my hair and scalp as I have with other dryers.  As someone who has been on the hunt for the perfect dryer for decades, I feel like I finally found one.  I&#x27;m tempted to buy a bunch so I have them for the future in case this one ever goes away.</li>
    <li> Stand back, this baby blows some heat!  I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas present.  Her old one blew out just a few weeks before Christmas and she had purchased a &amp;#34;cheapo&amp;#34; from the local drug store.  The one she bought took forever to dry her hair.  This new one does the job in half the time.  I now have a happy and we get out of the house a lot quicker, making me happy!</li>
    <li> This product dries my hair quickly if I am going for a straight look. However, when using the defussing attachment for curly hair it takes 20-30 mins before my thick curly hair is dry...this is much longer than any other hairdryer i have used.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research in order to buy a Dryer, since my wife has really thick and long hair,  i did not want a cheap one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this over a year ago, and I cannot be happier.  My wife loves it, it gives out the right temperature air.  Everything you need, you can find it on this one.</li>
    <li> Perfect for long thin hair that doesn&#x27;t need to be dry in a salon. It won&#x27;t burn your hair and will leave it with no friz</li>
    <li> I was recently traveling and borrowed a dryer.  I was suddenly reminded what a pain drying my hair used to be before I got the best hair dryer.  As attractive as it looks in the picture, and drys your hair in a flash.  If you&#x27;re shopping for a hair dryer, this is the one.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend and I have received no complaints from her.  Owned this for a few years now and it&#x27;s still going strong!  A good product.</li>
    <li> One of the best reasonably priced dryers out there. My old one made my hair frizzy and dried out, I am so pleased with my results!</li>
    <li> Nice dryer.  Has the right options for heat and speed is not too loud.</li>
    <li> Good speed and heat options. I like that the hair dryer is pretty small. My other one was huge and awkward to maneuver. The concentrator attachment is good. Every hair dryer needs one. The diffuser is scary haha! I have no idea what to do with it but whatever. It is apparently for creating volume, but I have thick, short asian hair so I don&#x27;t need any extra volume. Cord length is fine. The back opens up really easily for cleaning. The cool button and cool heat function are ACTUALLY cool. Most hairdryers take time to cool down, so going from hot to cold doesn&#x27;t work. However, on this hairdryer, if you want to go straight from hot to cool, it happens in seconds. maybe it&#x27;s just because it has cooled down here in san diego but I can&#x27;t really definitively determine that. Anyways great hairdryer! :)</li>
    <li> Works well and the speed and temperature  adjustments are easy to use.  Well worth the small amount it costs.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Works great and has nice settings. It came with two snap on extentions which both work nice on my hair.</li>
    <li> The velvety outer coating on the hairdryer started to peel off after about three weeks. It rubbed off around the handle and nozzle, flinging bits of the paint (or whatever that was) into my hair and on my floor-- one day I tried to just rub all of it off but it just made a bigger mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself was just fine, just that damn clear coating paint looked awful and got all over the place. The only thing I can liken it to is one of those clear facial masks that you can peel off. I ended up having to buy a new hairdryer a month after buying this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy another model.</li>
    <li> My husband continues to tease me because I continue to gush about how much I love this blow dryer. He says \\&quot;ooooh - it plugs in and blows air - how special\\&quot; (says the man with little hair to blow :) This is a great dryer - I have longish straight hair - and it dries it in a heartbeat without frying my hair - the variety of settings really work well - and the cool shot button is instantaneous. My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years!</li>
    <li> At first I was afraid to purchase this particular dryer. I had read tons of reviews about it being very fragile and it can crack if you drop it to the floor. I haven&#x27;t dropped mine yet (knock on wood), so I try and take special care of it so that it doesn&#x27;t crack. The main problem with mine is that the clear-coated material that is brushed over the ceramic material peels off over time and gives it a very \\&quot;used\\&quot; look. However, I got this product when I moved off to college last year and so far there have been no other problems! It does smell a bit like smoke if you don&#x27;t clean out the back of it with a small toothbrush or some other cleaning material. Overall, I like this dryer!</li>
    <li> I have thick long color treated hair. I also own Revoln RV544 and Babyliss Pro TT 3000. The Conair 225R is my favorite among the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: super lightweight (the babyliss is much heavier to my disappointment), drys my hair really fast (no going back to Revoln RV544, faster than Babyliss 3000), leaves hair shiny (which the Revoln 544 doesn&#x27;t), temperature is perfect, strength of air flow is just right, best value-priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the slider control is a bit hard to operate for me (I prefer the rocker style control in the Revoln 544 and babyliss pro3000), wish they have it in pink or red. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The babyliss pro TT 3000 actually leaves the hair shinier and smoother but it makes my hair so flat the next morning (I like to have the shine and some volume too).</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer. I have always purchased Conair products and have had good experiences with them; they last a long time. This is not what I consider to be a heavy blow dryer at all and the blast of air drys my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I can not tell you how amazing this blow dryer is!  A great price too!  A must have for every woman!</li>
    <li> Dried my wife&#x27;s thick hair in 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how, but it&#x27;s working. I have short hair that is very thin and frizzy. This dryer is perfect. I also use &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;John Frieda sleek finish&amp;#34; and my hair looks perfect. No frizz at all.</li>
    <li> Nice and compact with lots of drying power. Also not as loud as some other hair driers.</li>
    <li> This is really awesome!  When I first turned it on, I must admit I was disappointed.  I was looking for more &#x27;blowing power&#x27;.  I soon realized that the &#x27;blowing intensity&#x27;  is not necessary to quickly dry hair. The tourmaline ceramic qualities are what give you the &#x27;quick&#x27; dry.I have very thick short hair.  If my hair takes too long to dry it gets frizzy. I need to dry FAST.  This does the job fabulously!  I like the options of power and heat.  I can use it on my little dogs when I groom them. They cannot take the high heat like me. :)  I have used Conair products since I was a teenager ( a LONG time ago).  They only continue to improve.  Excellent product! Hightly recommend!</li>
    <li> Decent machine. Does its job well enough. The finish on the body is good, however the buttons seem flimsy due to the unnecessary split-to-look-cool layout. The first time I used it, i smelled something heating up. Subsequent uses have had no such problem. The overall build seems like the wire could break (it seems stiff and other reviews speak of being burned by exposed wiring). This is yet to be verified (hopefully, never).</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer my wife loves it.  She says it&#x27;s as good as her expensive high end model that it replaced and weighs less.</li>
    <li> Works very well so far. It seems like a pretty solid hair dryer! Will keep updating this as time goes by! Used it for about a month now without any issues.</li>
    <li> Dries my super thick hair faster than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> This dryer has great Hot/Warm/Cold settings and makes my hair shiny and not too dried out. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because the switch to adjust the settings is difficult to push.</li>
    <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for over a year, and it has worked fine up until now. But this morning while using it, I suddenly smelled burned hair and then discovered a giant chunk of my hair had burned off and there were hair fragments (pulverized to a burned hair dust) all over the floor. Not happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not that particular with hair dryers.  As long as it works well and doesn&#x27;t get broken quickly I&#x27;m good with it. This one meets those expectations.</li>
    <li> Works perfect! Isn&#x27;t to powerful but gets the job done. Less loud than my last dryer, and also lighter. I love the fact that it is lightweight because I have to dry a LOT of hair and this is an easy to handle dryer. The various settings are also nice - can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
    <li> it is the best hair dryer i have ever used, my wife also love it as she have brown long hair</li>
    <li> It is good but there are other products that dry hair faster with less friz. It is light and comes with 2 attachements which is nice.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is great. Multiple hear and speed options. I would have given it five stars except for that fact that the funnel tip does pop off too easily if bumped by a brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer for my daughter based off of the reviews.  Then when my $60 hair dryer died (I was a bit happy about that) I ordered this for myself.  It is a great hair dryer.  Light weight, dries well.  I don&#x27;t use it on the hottest setting. I had read that the ceramic dryers can damage hair when used on to hot of a setting because you end up over drying your hair without knowing it.  The aiming nozzle comes off a little bit too easy, but it&#x27;s not bad.  It really only comes off if I bump it on the counter or cabinet.  For the price and performance I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair drier for my girlfriend 3 months ago, expecting it to be great. The attachments do not attach to the drier! It is now useless to her and too late to exchange the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer!  I have been using it almost daily for a little over a year now and it is still like new.  It is easy to clean the intake screen and the cord and housing still look like new!  I have dropped this dryer several times with no problems what so every.  A great dryer for the whole family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned an iconic hair dryer before but this one is awesome!  Drys my medium to long hair fast. Love the fact that you can take the end off to clean.  Definitely worth the money, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> So far so good. No complaints as such. The only hassle is the grey plastic knob which is used to increase the heat of the hot air which seems very fragile to work with. Otherwise, no issues with the dryer. Works good. Easy operation and very simple!</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and purchased a new blow dryer after mine started sparking.. really pleased with the purchase! I&#x27;ve now had this for several months and no issues with the surface peeling off, which I was worried about from other reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Conair, which has to be 10 years old.  This dryer is lightweight, has good air speed, is hot but not too hot, and does a great job.  For the money, it is a fine blow drier.  The directional attachment goes on and comes off easily.</li>
    <li> Works as a hair dryer should. The only problem I have sometimes have with it is that the sliders for High/Medium/Low and Hot/Warm/Cool are right next to each other, so I sometimes accidentally slide both up/down instead of just one. Very infrequently though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft surface material takes a bit to get used to.</li>
    <li> Title says it all. I have no issues with the heat of this dryer, but the cord is very short (I need an extension cord to use it), and the nozzles fall off CONSTANTLY.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with this product because it does what it should do which is to dry your hair in a faster pace.</li>
    <li> I gave this a four because the adapter that fits on the end constantly falls off.</li>
    <li> Chose this dryer because of the good reviews. Has a few annoying features: double buttons (heat and speed) and hard not move both when one only needs to move one. Also not that strong and so doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly. Finally, sometimes the concentrator falls off. However, it was not expenssive so you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I hate this hair dryer.  It only has 2 speeds- too fast and too slow.  The concentrator constantly falls off.  I am really not picky when it comes to things like hair dryers but I hate this one so much I am going to have to buy another one.</li>
    <li> What a great buy this dryer turned out to be!!!&lt;br /&gt;When opening the package, first thing I have noticed was how light weight it is. It is slightly smaller in size than my previous one, but almost twice as light.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with controls, which work as two sliding bars on the handle, one controls the speed, the other one controls the heat. Both slide very smoothly up and down.&lt;br /&gt;I was even more pleased when I turned it on. It is pretty quiet when it is one full speed. My fiancee appreciates it, as I dry my hair early in the morning, when he&#x27;s still asleep. Next, let me mention the speed settings. When comparing to my previous dryer (Revlon 1875) medium speed of this Conair 1875 equaled the high speed of my old Revlon 1875. Needles to say, when operating on high speed, it blows twice as hard, yet remaining amazingly quiet. My hair drying time was cut from 15-18 minutes (my hair is slightly past my shoulder blades) to 5-7 minutes!!!&lt;br /&gt;And one more very important thing I have to mention. My previous dryers all died the same way. I roll the cord of the dryer around the handle when I put it away. And after about a year or so, the coating of the cord would crack at the very spot where it bends, closest to the handle of the dryer. This dryer gives me hope, as the protective layer of plastic extends about 4 inches from the handle, thus making a much smoother curve when I bend the cord to wrap it around. And although it is to soon to tell, but I will make it a point to update this post, should I experience the same problem with the cord. But so far, I am a very satisfied buyer, and would highly recommend this Dryer over some of the more expensive competition!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elena K.</li>
    <li> TOTALLY RECOMENDED!! HAIR DRIES VERY FAST, I JUST GOT MINE AND IM PLEASED USING IT EVERY DAY SINCE I GOT IT</li>
    <li> I have used it a few times and it works very well for the price. The cord could be a little longer however.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this hairdryer plus the diffuser have really brought out my curls! I love it! I use the setting below the high setting and then put it on cooler air as I am finishing up. I leave it a little bit damp. My hair is never frizzy with this hairdryer. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this hair dryer is the cord. It is not very long. I would recommend this hair dryer, especially if you have curly hair and like the use the diffuser. The price is not bad as it does include 2 attachments (the diffuser and another one to localize the airflow). I would purchase this again, but another 18 inches of cord would be nice.</li>
    <li> the hair dryer works very well I would recommend it to anyone.  it seems to help give my hair some body</li>
    <li> This definitely cuts down your drying time and it leaves your hair soft &amp; friz free. The only thing I would change is making the prongs on the diffuser longer to work better.  Other than that,  it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s designed for home use, not for travel. It&#x27;s not small, so very powerful. I use it everyday. Takes just a little bit of time to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a perfect product, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These hair dryers were used in our training labs for our courses in composite aircraft repair course.  They perform as expected.  We do not utilize all of the attachments.  The most important feature is the value which is great!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. I broke my old one (the reset button was damaged due to a fall off the counter) and was thrilled to find the exact same one on Amazon. I have long, LONG hair and this dryer is great - dries fast.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer I had since high school finally died so I bought a new one. There&#x27;s nothing special about this hair dryer, but there&#x27;s definitely nothing wrong with it. Nice, powerful stream of air with the option of cooler air, hotter air - and high and low power. It works quickly on my fine hair and on my daughter&#x27;s thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Wife says this is the best drier that she has owned to date. Loves it</li>
    <li> This dryer is perfect for the intended purpose which is an efficient, small package at a very resonable price. The air flow and heat settings are good with well marked and designed switches. The folding handle and variable voltage make it ideal for travel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is far too short for proper styling unless you are standing within 2 feet of power socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warm setting is cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the hot setting Only the inner part of the dryer blows hot hair and the outer rim is cool air which makes the hot setting basically a warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed- I would pay 15-20 for this as my local CVS.</li>
    <li> It is very noisy! I was looking for a quiet hair dryer. I would recommend to update a description. I have a old hair dryer that is much more quiet the Conair 225R Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875-Watt Hair Dryer</li>
    <li> Very light and has strong power</li>
    <li> funciona muy bien, no tiene mucho peso, perfecto para el uso en la casa y no profesional. mi hermana le gusto el regalo</li>
    <li> I am picky about hairdryers because they always make a very loud sound but I feel like the power and force just isn&#x27;t there. This Conair I have been very happy with.It is strong and take an adequate time to dry my hair. If this ever dies, I will buy this same dryer again.</li>
    <li> Works great, drys my thick hair fast, and isn&#x27;t loud.  That is what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by Conair.</li>
    <li> Been using this twice daily for over a year. Simple, effective. You don&#x27;t really need anything more than this to make wet hair dry. My dog would probably give it a 1 star review, but he is biased because he hates hair dryers in general.</li>
    <li> Great products, dries my hair fast, leaving my hair smoother. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have always bought Conair products in the past, so I never expected this purchase to be problematic.  The dryer works fine, but none of the attachments fit tightly and they fall off with the slightest touch.  It&#x27;s a huge design error and frustrating as can be.  I would never recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really light weight.&lt;br /&gt;I do have a long hair and it dry my hair really fast. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Buttons on the dryer are not user friendly, if you are planning to use often its not a good buy.</li>
    <li> This dryer replaced our old one, which finally gave up the ghost.  It is powerful and easy to control with the dual thumb-controlled switch which regulates heat and fan speed.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised when I received this hair dryer because the quality of the product~ IT IS GREAT&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is very affordable and has a great look and feel and puts out nice heat.  I would definitely recommend this product to friends and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the buttons. I&#x27;ve returned it. I&#x27;m giving 3 stars not 1 because I used to have Conair Hair Dryer and it was quite good.</li>
    <li> I always bought cheap hair dryer from Walmart since I was always thinking that it was not worth the money to spend on expensive hair dryer. Yes, I&#x27;m totally WRONG. This hair dryer is not expensive like other professional one but it really works the same. It&#x27;s quiet, lightweight, many settings, comes with 2 attachments which helps you to style your hair easier. I have silky, very soft hair, absolutely no frizzy after I use it. This is the first time in my life that I love blow drying. The warm heat is just right, and the cool heat is awesome. I rarely use the hot setting. It&#x27;s also very strong. I really recommend it for everyone. This is the best hair dryer that you should buy with the reasonable price. I will definitely buy it again if mine is broken. I have only used it for 1 month so I don&#x27;t know if it will last long though!</li>
    <li> The GFCI stopped working after one week rendering it useless.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I have a mid length hair and it dries them in 5 mins on high-warm setting. There are 2 settings: one for the temperature and the other for speed. So you can choose between cool-warm-hot on one side and low-high on the other end.  The product was delivered on the said delivery date and it is a great value for money.</li>
    <li> This is a good basic dryer.  I don&#x27;t use the attachments but find that it works quickly and is easy to hold.  I don&#x27;t think that it being \\&quot;tourmaline ceramic\\&quot; adds much to the product&#x27;s quality, but it&#x27;s still a fine product.</li>
    <li> I chose this particular dryer because of the great ratings it received.  I am not disappointed.  I like that its lightweight and compact and that does not overheat.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer with one major flaw from my standpoint. It does a great job of drying my thick, coarse and frizzy hair in a short period of time and without as much frizz as other hair dryers, even my previous Conair. I was pleasantly surprised that it is quite lightweight. My major concern with it is that the finger control to turn it on and to high, low and off is very cheaply constructed and designed. My previous Conair dryer was easy to maneuver with my thumb but this has been redesigned to look sleek but not have enough gripping surface, especially when you have hair produce on your hands. I often find myself using my opposite hand to try to nudge it upward and have almost broken the control off with my (short) fingernail in the process. I much preferred the lever control of my old dryer and will be interested in seeing how well this control stands the test of time.</li>
    <li> After months of using it every day it is just as reliable as on the first day. Can&#x27;t understand the complainers.</li>
    <li> I would give it a higher rating but the cord is just too short. Other than that, it works fine and I like the flat black finish.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully, not blazing hot on the high setting, easy to handle, and I think dries hair faster than the previous ones I&#x27;ve had by other makers.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for a few years and it still works great. It&#x27;s lightweight and powerful.</li>
    <li> bought this to replace the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer (RV544PKF) I had for a few years that was starting to fail.  The Conair is similar but now that I have it I can say I liked my older one better and wish I would have just bought the same one again.  They have the same heat intensity and dry my hair as quickly, but I don&#x27;t like how hard/concentrated the air blows out.  High is too high and the low blow setting is too low.  I also like the button configuration a little better on the Revlon compared to this Conair.  It&#x27;s not a bad dryer, I just don&#x27;t like it as well in comparison.</li>
    <li> Works great, looks great</li>
    <li> Needed a practical and decently priced hair dryer so replace the one I had that died. Working great so far. Light weight and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Works great, quiet, lightweight</li>
    <li> A wanted a blow dryer... Ordered a blow dryer... And a blow dryer was soon at my house... A lot better than my old one.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> it broke down on me after 3 weeks! not good</li>
    <li> We were looking for a replacement for our hair dryer that died. It needed to be powerful for long hair. This one does the job.</li>
    <li> This was my first Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer. I was looking for a hair dryer that would cut my drying time because I have thick hair. What a surprise, it did just that! It cut my drying time to a third of what it used to take with my old hair dryer. It proved to be as advertised. It made my hair smoother, shinier and less frizzy too!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Works very well and plenty of air velocity to dry anyones hair.  Highly recomended for anyone whio needs a good hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is typical hair drier I saw all the time at my fitness center, nothing fancy but a work horse, it works fine, and it&#x27;s reliable, that&#x27;s all I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Dryer is strong yet easy to hold and does the job in no time at all.  I would highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I am very picky with my hair. I&#x27;ve only used hair dryers $100+ so buying this one was a huge risk for me! I have very long, straight hair that without any heat comes out wavy and sometimes frizzy. This hair dryer is quieter than my old one and definitely dries my hair pretty fast. My only problem with it is that the attachment falls off occasionally and the cord is insanely short.</li>
    <li> This dryer is lightweight and powerful.  It dries my hair in half the time of my old dryer.  It is also quieter than my old dryer, which was labeled &amp;#34;quiet.&amp;#34;  I would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> very good product. Love it. 5 stars</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this for about a month now.  My wife likes it very much.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts!</li>
    <li> What can I say? I didn&#x27;t buy this for me bought it for the wife.  I haven&#x27;t used a hair dryer since 1989.  She loves this one.</li>
    <li> If I could write an ad for this product, it would say:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s like driving down the freeway with your head out the window.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The dryer has a very powerful motor, I&#x27;ll give it that. Unlike some other reviewers, I found that the hot setting was more like a \\&quot;warm\\&quot;. Most significantly, though, it left my hair oily-er than usual! It basically left it limp. I&#x27;m confused as to the reason for this, but I&#x27;m sending it back, regardless.&lt;br /&gt;(Despite hating the condition it left my hair in, it did dry it relatively fast.)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is just what i needed.  gets as hot as i need it to get and arrived on time</li>
    <li> My only complaint is I can&#x27;t seem to get my hair as curly as I could before I started using this.  It dries my hair very effectively though and is good at getting the moisture out of my hair without damaging it.</li>
    <li> It works, but for all of the advertising hoopla, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that different.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that the diffuser doesn&#x27;t prevent my hair from blowing all over the place when I&#x27;m trying to dry my curls with little air movement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of con air and ION dryers in general. However, I&#x27;m disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The styling attachment falls off 5-6 times during any blow dry. The latch or ability to attach is minimal. While blowdrying your hair, expect it to go flying and fall to the floor. Extremely frustrating and annoying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The coord is very short. Unless you have an outlet right by your mirror and from waist-level or higher, you will need an extension coord to use this dryer.</li>
    <li> So far I love this hairdryer! I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months, but it replaced my old Conair hairdryer that I had for over 10 years. It&#x27;s fairly quiet, which is kind-of a big deal, and it works really quickly. Plus, its like this soft matte finish, and it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hands. I&#x27;m hoping it lasts as long as my last hairdryer!</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this hair dryer and it has performed well for quite some time. The heat can even be too hot at times, but their are many settings and a lot of different attachments that came with it. If you are looking for something simple at a good price that is of good quality this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> okay so I&#x27;ve read what others have said and basically it&#x27;s about the cosmetics of the blow dryer. I just received this dryer 2 days ago ( it was a gift), and i must say...I LOVE IT. Now, let me tell you why :) I am a mother to an 8 year old daughter who has the hair texture of 3c and 4a for those who may not understand that is coiled curly hair loose and tight afro looking in appearance. my hair is 3a and 3b that is loose ringlets and slightly tighter ringlets. you can Google these terms for a better understanding. okay last iam afro - american, west Indian, and a spoonful of Caucasian descent these backgrounds left me with a crazy texture of hair! I cannot say i on a natural hair journey because its just my way of life to not perm my hair; but that&#x27;s what it is considered or identified with my daughter is also natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE DRYER- it works plan and simple ladies, gents and children of all ages! this dryer is the real deal i used it for my daughter who A) doesn&#x27;t like &amp;#34;Hot stuff&amp;#34; and B cant sit for more than a few minutes. natural hair takes time and that i have little of!&lt;br /&gt;usual dry time for her usually- 1.5 with all the deep conditioning, detangling  etc. conair 1875 - 45 mins yes!!! for everything hair is as straight a doll baby. and it cut down on over heating the hair because it straightened while it dried i used it on warm/ hot.&lt;br /&gt;so try it for yourself you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> The cord was far too short on this &#x27;professional&#x27; grade hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;The warm setting did not dry the hair enough, and the hot setting was too hot.&lt;br /&gt;It made my normally fine hair frizzier than normal.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing, I returned it after the first use</li>
    <li> great dryer-----love the diffuser that comes with it.  Not too expensive and it&#x27;s lightweight and compact.  very highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is just your average everyday hair dryer no bells no whistles all i have to say it does what every other hair dryer does, so far it functions properly and its been over a year.</li>
    <li> This has been one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. It works great and drys my hair super fast. The levels of heat are great, as well as the actual weight of the dryer.</li>
    <li> Have had this for a little over a year now.  It is extremely lightweight and feels very good quality.  Plenty of different settings and all of them work well.  Good airflow and it is plenty hot or cool enough.</li>
    <li> What I love about this is that it is fairly quiet, and yet seems to dry my hair quickly.  I especially like the concentrator, as it has a small opening and really works as I&#x27;m shaping my hair.  My hair is wavy, and I try to straighten it as I shape the style.  Using my round brush, the concentrator focuses on each section and dries it straight.</li>
    <li> bought it for my granddaughter, she loves it</li>
    <li> the power is NOT what the old model 1875 used to be,.  I miss my old 1875, but can&#x27;t find it anymore.  The new one has less UMPGH -and the plastic slider buttons are really awful!  CHEAP.  I guess this is as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist, and I love this dryer! It is lightweight, and it dries my hair incredibly fast. The cord is a little short for professional use, but I love it for myself!</li>
    <li> The fan and temperature seems a little weak/low on high.  I have short hair, so it&#x27;s not a big deal, but if my thick hair was still long it would be an issue.  The buttons are hard to move.  I hesitate to complain about that because it&#x27;s what drew me to the product.  My other dryer had regular rocker switches instead of these sliders and I was CONSTANTLY switching the dryer off, or to a lower speed or temperature, so I wanted the sliders.  But these are just a little too stiff.  If your hands are wet or still have a little product on them it&#x27;s really hard to turn the thing on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my vacation home.  I liked it so much I brought it home and took the more expensive dryer I was using at home to my vacation home.</li>
    <li> It dries your hair. Not much else to say.</li>
    <li> Love it. Does a good. Hot enough. Diffuser is a bonus.</li>
    <li> not sure where other reviewers are coming from ,but i do not like this low dryer..it is way too cold even on warm setting and not strong enough..if it wasnt too late i would return it..plus the knobs are cheap plastic and about to fall off after 2 mos! waste of money!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers said, it is light and quiet. These are two things that really impressed me. Plus it does a good job drying my hair.</li>
    <li> this is very good.its working properly</li>
    <li> Purchased this at the end of May. Last week my hair dryer stopped adjusting to the high speed. Now I have to buy another one. Very disappointed. Wish Amazon would replace it but the 30 day return is up.</li>
    <li> After two years, it still works and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a bit of wearing off, but that&#x27;s inevitable if you use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the toggle switch that goes between low and high.  It&#x27;s right next to another one and is really flat, just hard to use.  Also, there is a big difference between low and high.  I wish there was something more in-between.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly and I love having multiple temps and speeds to choose from. The price was comparable to other tourmaline dryers I found online.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is small and powerful, I use it every day. The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting is definitely hot and I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend using it often (I&#x27;m under the impression that is bad for your hair!), though I admittedly use it a lot when I&#x27;m running late. My only complaint is the length of the cord, it&#x27;s ridiculously too short!</li>
    <li> The dryer works very well.  Dries hair quickly. Like the choice of settings  It is rather large so not suitable for travel</li>
    <li> sorry I don&#x27;t have anymore to say about it. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Okay? If you want reviews you&#x27;re going to have to stop limiting the numbers of words.</li>
    <li> This arrived super fast and as my blow dryer had died, I&#x27;ve been using it since day one. Nice product.</li>
    <li> A great hairdryer at a great price. It&#x27;s very quiet and powerful. Arrived very fast and I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Love this blowdryer- don&#x27;t like how the nozzle on the front pops off on it&#x27;s own, but it has reduced frizz.</li>
    <li> This dryer made my hair frizzy and rough feeling, not what anyone wants from their blow dryer.  It also felt cheap and was loud, like those terrible blow dryers in hotel rooms.  This was a dud and returned.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It dries my hair fast.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have only had it for a month.  We will see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Oh the power.  Oh the fast dry.  Oh the beauty of my hair when it is dry after 5 minutes!!!  I have extremely thick hair, and it typically takes 12-15 minutes to dry completely using a hair dryer.  My hair was dry and NOT frizzy after 5 minutes!  WHAT??!!  This dryer is very powerful, and high heat setting is enough to dry the hair but not make it smoking hot.  There is a reason this is rated as Amazon&#x27;s #1 best selling hair dryer.</li>
    <li> When we got this hair dryer we wanted one that wouldn&#x27;t cause fly away hair. This certainly lives up to the claims. Also this dryer has individual controls for speed and heat. I really like that, because most of the time I don&#x27;t need high heat but do want more blowing power. It also isn&#x27;t very noisy as far as hair dryers go.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer does NOT get hot enough.  The buttons on the dryer feel cheap.  I would not  recommend.</li>
    <li> This thing blows, but in a good way! This seriously has the best air flow of any blowdryer that I&#x27;ve ever used (the heat could be increased, but seems warm enough)</li>
    <li> Nice unit. good cord retraction.</li>
    <li> Great dryer at an affordable price. This dryer is quiet compared to the older model. I would suggest to anyone. Kudos to amazon for shipping this in two days even though I selected free super saver shipping.</li>
    <li> pros: Its a basic (ceramic) hairdryer. It blows hot.&lt;br /&gt;cons: None so far.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT.  QUIET (COMPARED TO OTHER HAIRDRYERS) AND I LOVE THE ADJUSTABLE SETTINGS.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is light and easy to use.  It met my expectations for drying medium length hair.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever seen that has a cool blower setting as well as a cool shot button. I like the cool blower for finishing when the day is hot. I keep pressing the cool shot button accidentally, however, because it&#x27;s so darn convenient. The cool shot button is exactly where my thumb naturally rests and I have to keep that in mind. The cord is shorter than I&#x27;d like, and a good bit shorter than my last dryer. The sliding controls aren&#x27;t wonderful. The friction ridges are quite flat and the two slides mesh so well and are so narrow that my thumb can&#x27;t tell them apart. I have to press those flat ridges so hard that it hurts my thumb, so I use my &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; hand to slide the controls. There&#x27;s some kind of thin, plastic-like finish that&#x27;s slowly peeling off, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last dryer was a Black &amp; Decker. It was very small and compact and did the job for many years, possibly as much as 20 years. I do still wish I could have replaced it with the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this sounds like complaining, I know, but they&#x27;re trivial complaints (except the cord length). I&#x27;ve never had a diffuser attachment before but I found it worth learning to use. I used to dry and style my short, curly hair in about a minute on the hot setting, but now the diffuser and the warm setting do it just as fast and better. The Conair hot setting is pretty hot, so if you need that you&#x27;ll be happy. Best of all is that, even in the winter, my hair never gets flyaway with static electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this Conair less than a year, so I can&#x27;t comment on its durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I bought this upon the recommendation of Consumer Reports. They called it a good value and I certainly agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it almost 4 years now and it&#x27;s still trouble-free.</li>
    <li> I love the size, power &amp; settings! Also, the browdryer has a really nice look &amp; is powerful too. I feel it gets hot enough on the hottest setting, medium heat on the medium setting &amp; low heat on the low setting. I also like the cool air button too. I&#x27;m Black with relaxed African american hair and it works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> Although I did not buy this dryer here I own it and I can not find a comb attachment to fit it, please help!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife.  It dries her hair.  I have used a few times to heat up some metal a bit when applying a protective coating.  Made sufficient heat.  I say it would be just fine for your hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as I was hoping :(. With long, thick hair, it takes a while to dry</li>
    <li> Love how light it is and how quickly it dries my hair!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works well but the slide controls to turn on and off are very difficult to use, especially with wet hands.  I found myself having to use a towel to help move them to different temps, on/off, etc.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Living in the South, humidity takes it&#x27;s toll on my hair so I was excited to visit Vegas where I&#x27;d heard there&#x27;s &amp;#34;no humidity.&amp;#34; I planned to use the hotel&#x27;s hair dryer (MGM) to lighten the packing. The hair dryers they equip the rooms with were amazing and I kept telling my husband how much I loved it and how quick it dried my hair!! (I wanted to take it home but he wouldn&#x27;t let me! ha) He told me it was probably just the dry air there and didn&#x27;t understand my excitement over this hair dryer. Long story short, I got on Amazon as soon as we got home and ordered it. I AM IN LOVE! This hair dryer cuts your drying time in half and leaves hair shiny and smooth (and trust me, I have frizzy, wavy hair!) I still use the flat iron of course to finish off the job but this hair dryer has been a life saver!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this blowdryer overall. I like the smooth coating and the light weightiness that allows it easy handling.&lt;br /&gt;A couple things that do bother me; the attachment comes off easily, I knock it off at least once during my blow dry session. I&#x27;m also not cool with the cool button, it is easy to press and I end up cooling my hair off when I don&#x27;t mean to.</li>
    <li> I truly don&#x27;t understand anyone who would pay more or could want more than what this hair dryer offers.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  The settings, noise level, weight, what it does to my hair - all of it.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is great! Only preference is that the buttons were better constructed. The quality of the heat, distribution and power is comparable to dryers that are more expensive. A solid purchase.</li>
    <li> This dryer is a very basic dryer and it feels pretty cheap.  It works ok but it doesn&#x27;t blow quite hard enough or get hot enough.  If you want a cheaper basic dryer, this might work for you but if you have a lot of hair, it will take too long to dry.  I ended up sending this back.</li>
    <li> Works great. Little bit heavy</li>
    <li> The dryer works well.  However, within a week, I cannot get the attachment (the one that concentrates the air, not the diffuser) to stay on.  This is disappointing - it looks like I am going to have to return this one.</li>
    <li> Very fast drying.  No static.  Comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;UPDATE  16 MAR 2016&amp;#62; Died one year three months after purchase.  It was a nice dryer while it lasted, but it turned out that the elements were cheap and burned through in hardly any time.  My first Conair was from 1976, it was a coil element and worked for 20 years. I finally tossed it because it looked old.  Planned obsolesce: just over a year? really?.   &amp;#60;ORIGINAL 01 DEC 2014&amp;#62; Hands down the best dryer we&#x27;ve gotten. The flow is at least 2x that of the Conair Ionic. For me, it make hair dry. For the girls it is a godsend. It takes significantly less time to dry and the heat is just right. Again, the old Conair Ionic was never quite hot enough thus taking forever on long hair. When the blue one started shooting sparks, I took a chance on this one. It&#x27;s only been a week but I&#x27;m already thinking of getting a spare for travel.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s true!  this is quiet, light weight and easy to use.  love the diffuser</li>
    <li> I like everything about this hairdryer except the buttons. It has two slide buttons, one to turn it on and one to change the temperature.  They are extremely hard to slide and I actually have to use both hands and dig my fingernail into them to get them to slide. After using this for a few months daily the buttons haven&#x27;t really loosened up much as I had hoped they would. It blows hard, gets hot, and dries my hair quickly, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it to anyone else due to the switches.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  Read reviews that this was an excellent product, but that the matte finish tends to wear off after a few months.  We&#x27;ll see if that happens, but even so...if it blows hot/cold, that&#x27;s really what I&#x27;m paying for.  I would say that it appears to be a great buy.  Feature rich, functional, looks good, works great.  By far better than the one it replaced.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me. I have long hair and I always think it will get too hot (I had a dryer go on fire once) but this one is very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning.</li>
    <li> The control switch on this is so hard to slide it makes it impossible for me to use so I just put it in the spare bathroom as a back up. I&#x27;m still looking for a replacement for my original Conair. Thank God it is still working.</li>
    <li> great - quick heat, good control without hot spots, has three air flow options and three temps, and simply works without drama.</li>
    <li> great hair dryer,  love the controls on this.</li>
    <li> Splurge just a little and get the Babyliss Pro BAB2000.  The Conair felt cheap.  While the Babyliss feels much better in the hand.  The Babyliss will give a deeper heat as compared to the Conair, not necessarily hotter but a better and even distribution of heat.  I returned the Conair.</li>
    <li> Dryer itself works fine, but The on off and temperature switches are poorly designed and hard to use.  If my hands are wet or have hair products on them I can&#x27;t adjust them at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this model for one year without any problem.</li>
    <li> I have one of these myself and love it -- so, I bought one for my new daughter-in-law, who stops by my house to shower after yoga, and used mine.  She told me how much faster this dries her long hair than her own dryer.  Perfect excuse for a Christmas gift.  It&#x27;s easy on your hair, and really does cut the amount of time it takes for hair to dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this constantly when I need to air-dry quickly or just enough to get by speeding the process of drying something I use.  It&#x27;s great for cleaning.  It&#x27;s powerful and time-efficient.  I wouldn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very affordable blow-dryer for what it does,  it does a lot and makes life a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light weight, quieter than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve had, and I love the attachments. Overall it was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I thought I will never need a hair drier since my Philip hair dryer with three styling attachments lasted for almost 10 years before wearing away. I wanted something robust and dependable as my last dryer. I was in a hurry to get a new one and decided on the Conair comfort touch dryer, so far no regrets. The dryer is more than what I wanted. I have straight hair and using hair dryer turns my hair into a frizz. But Conair with its frizz free styling solutions has given me a great relief. Moreover there are two styling options one for straightening and other to give a voluminous look. Apart from 3 heat settings there is also an option to blow cold air to set my hair after styling.</li>
    <li> I just got mine a few days ago and tried it out right away being it was on featured on Allure and got rave reviews on here as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using it I was immediately annoyed at how difficult it was to change the settings. I had to use both hands to slide the buttons up and down. Both my hands are already busy with the dryer in one hand and the brush in the other so this was a bit frustrating after a while.  I&#x27;m hoping that it&#x27;s only this difficult because it&#x27;s brand new and perhaps will \\&quot;loosen up\\&quot; with more usage.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that was also annoying was that the attachment kept falling off whenever I&#x27;d put the dryer down to start on a new piece of hair.  This made everything more difficult and time consuming than necessary so i eventually stopped putting it back on and just finished my hair without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not entirely a piece of garbage though. I will say it dried my hair very quickly (when the attachment wasn&#x27;t falling off) and made my very curly hair smooth and shiny.  So I&#x27;m not returning it because I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair that often and this will be good to have when I need it.  If you can deal with those annoyances I mentioned, then definitely get it. Otherwise keep looking.</li>
    <li> THIS CONAIR IS THE BEST BLOW DRYER I HAVE EVER HAD.  IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT BUT HOT AND POWERFUL.  I GOT ON TO IT FROM A REVIEW HERE ON AMAZON.  I LOVE CUSTOMER REVIEWS!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a daughter with very long, thick hair.  She hated blow drying because it took so long.  She has absolutely loved it (and I have even borrowed it from her) because it gets the job done so quickly.  I like the two temperature settings and two blow speed settings, although we mostly just use the fastest.  It has cut her dry time to less than half of what it was taking before.  This dryer is a bit on the heavy side, but since I don&#x27;t have to hold on to it for more than a few minutes, it is well worth it!  We have only owned this for a month, so I can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s longevity, but I have owned many Conair dryers, and trust this will be also be very durable.  Some reviewers complained that it tangles hair.  This can definitely be true because it blows so hard, but the tangling can be minimized by blowing in the right direction, and hasn&#x27;t been a problem for us.</li>
    <li> It is in good quality and convenient to use. I am highly recommended this product. And I love the product!</li>
    <li> The dryer works really well, but as other reviewers have indicated, the finish on the handle starts bubbling and peeling after about a month of use. It&#x27;s annoying, but it does work. Too late to send it back and I&#x27;m not sending it to Conair with $5 to get it repaired.</li>
    <li> I used this blow dryer while staying at a Hilton and fell in love with it. I wasn&#x27;t able to find it at any local store. I am more than happy with this blow dryer and would recommend it to family and friends!</li>
    <li> Wife uses it daily....says it is much quieter and lighter than previous versions, and does a great job and it easy to use...would recommend buying this item!!!</li>
    <li> the hair drier is good in general, dry hair very fast and keeps the moisture on hair. but the diffuser really dones&#x27;t work very well, it&#x27;s too large and too hard.</li>
    <li> I purchased it to leave at a second home.  It works well etc.......it shipped and arrived as stated.  Great for that type of choice.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great and is very light. I would definitely recommend it. It dries hair very quickly and is well worth the price. I love it!</li>
    <li> Light weight yet dries hair fast</li>
    <li> There are many reviews for this dryer, and in a nut shell, it works very well and does the job. I have two small complaints, but one of them is a big deal for me. I have medium textured straight hair that is very, very long. I like to use the medium heat setting for blow drying my hair for less damage but this dryers medium heat, is almost room temperature. It&#x27;s not quite hot enough and therefore takes about 50% longer than my old dryer to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-nice feel in the hand&lt;br /&gt;-nice frizz/flyaway control&lt;br /&gt;-Low and high air flow&lt;br /&gt;-3 temp. settings&lt;br /&gt;-comes with diffuser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Medium heat is too cool causing long drying time&lt;br /&gt;-the precision diffuser knocks off the dryer fairly easily with an accidental tap of the brush, or wrapping of the chord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy the same one again, but really, it&#x27;s just a hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for 9 months and use it daily, but now am ready to give up on it and try a different brand. In the beginning, it worked pretty good, but it didn&#x27;t take long for things to stop working correctly. Today was the final straw; after blow drying my hair this morning, it smells burnt. I&#x27;m getting rid of this thing before it starts a fire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;*Comes with lots of accessories&lt;br /&gt;*Dries hair quickly&lt;br /&gt;*Back opens so that dust filter can be cleaned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;*Cool button stopped working after a few months&lt;br /&gt;*LOUD&lt;br /&gt;*Risk of fire/burnt hair&lt;br /&gt;*Did not last long</li>
    <li> I had been using the same hair dryer for 12 years.  I don&#x27;t use hair products.  I wash, condition - and then drying optional (takes too much time).  This hair dryer is fantastic.  My hair looks great.  It only takes 4 minutes to dry my hair (medium lenth and medium thickness).  If I would have known that a hair dryer could make my hair look so much better - without any effort - I would have bought one a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Light, easy to use, sufficient power and cooling/warming options. Cord is short, but I&#x27;ve had no issues with it. Color has not faded on me. I&#x27;ve had it four a couple months now and use it about 4-6 times/week.</li>
    <li> works great. abundant heat. quieter than its predecessor.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  It&#x27;s my second Conair, and I think I will enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> You have different settings for heat and air volume, and the dryer is ample on both counts.  I happen to like medium heat and lots of air.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> EVERY TIME I use this to dry my hair (most of the time I let it dry naturally, but I use a hair dryer occassionally) I receive compliments on my hair! GET IT!</li>
    <li> This dryer works well, but the outer \\&quot;soft touch\\&quot; clear layer started to peel off after only about 4 weeks after purchasing it.  It&#x27;s a shame since it looked so nice when it arrived and now it looks beat up and as if I&#x27;ve owned if for five years.  I&#x27;ve had other similar models by Conair in the past, but none ever did this.</li>
    <li> Use it every time I wash my hair. Pretty good. It&#x27;s been a while, works without problem.</li>
    <li> My major gripes with the product are the heat and speed settings (which is really all there is to a hair dryer, let&#x27;s be real): the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting is significantly cooler than the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting while the \\&quot;low\\&quot; speed is faster than the \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed of my old Revlon. Since I use the low-hot combo frequently, this dryer was the opposite of what I wanted/needed in a dryer. Felt like my head was in a lukewarm tornado.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum: probably better than your standard hotel-provided model, worse than what you could get for 20 bucks at Target.</li>
    <li> During our last vacation, one of the hotels had this dryer.  I loved how different it was and how my hair looked after using it.  I wrote down the name and model number.  When I came home, I looked it up and bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think one dryer was different from another.  I was wrong.  I use this every day and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I would have given this blowdryer a 5 star rating but the  controls for temperature and speed are on dual slide controls right next to each other.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer, it works perfectly and is not very costly. What else do u need from a hair dryer?</li>
    <li> So far so good.  The light weight and speedy dry time help me reduce stress to back and neck muscles.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer for anyone, it is light weight and dries my hair very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It does not burn my hair like the old hair dryers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about two years and like it a lot, with a couple of exceptions: The sliding switches on the handle for temperature and power are really a pain -- sometimes literally when you have to dig in your fingernail along the edge to get them to slide up or down. Anyone with hand problems should find a dryer with a better design. Also, the cord retracter can be a bit balky, but that&#x27;s minor compared to the annoying switches.</li>
    <li> So far the hair dryer I ordered works great and dry my hair in 5 minute. The power cord (as a lot of other reviewer apparently says) is not too short at all. Unless you want to dry your hair in the back yard...&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that is very light and it never get to hot from the outside and is very easy to handle. Nice product so far.</li>
    <li> My previous dryer finally died.  I really like this one.  It doesn&#x27;t collapse, but that was one of the breaking points on my previous one.  I like the  variation in temperatures &amp; speed.  I took off the nozzle because it seemed to concentrate the air too much... I don&#x27;t really like to spend too much time on my hair, just the minimum to make it look good.  The diffuser seems pretty good, but I haven&#x27;t tried to dry my hair curly yet.  I really like that the back vent can be cleaned.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. I&#x27;m not quite happy with the ceramic dry but it does the trick!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is powerful, quiet by hair dryer standards, and has a solid quality feel to it.  I spent a lot of time researching different options and am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about air pressure with hair dryers.  This one is perfect, plus the fact that you can switch from cool all the way to hot air is a nice option.  I highly recommend spending the extra money for this product!</li>
