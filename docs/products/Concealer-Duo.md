      <li>; I think this is a good quality concealer with great coverage.  </li>
      <li>I did test out their foundation and to me it was a good quality with good coverage, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay for it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it covers my purple undereye skin great, but it sits in my creases &amp; makes them look more....</li>
      <li>The color is great and I love that you can customize the color that you need.</li>
      <li>and I love that there is no perfumey, yucky odor!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing &amp; doesn&#x27;t look cakey.  </li>
      <li>Goes on very easily</li>
      <li>This gives perfect, smooth coverage and the Warm is great for fair skin-I always have trouble finding the right color.</li>
      <li>Very importantly, it does not irritate my eyes :}</li>
      <li>I tried most of the department store cosmetic brands.  </li>
      <li>The warm palette I received is great for skin with yellow undertones (I&#x27;m Filipino).</li>
      <li>I can mix the two hues to make a perfect match, whether I’ve been in the sun a little or haven’t seen sun in days.  </li>
      <li>This concealer is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Mineral Fusion Concealer is a duo palette that comes in two shades - a light and darker one.  </li>
      <li>Also, it goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>and I like it because it&#x27;s matte, dries quickly, but is still workable (blendable)</li>
      <li>Love this concealer as I have very sensitive skin since going through cancer treatment.</li>
      <li>Mineral Fusion is better by far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite opaque and would recommend adding a tiny bit of moisturizer if you want to spread it or let the warmth of your body warm it up.  </li>
      <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>A lot of “fair skin” concealers look too pink on me.  </li>
      <li>This is my very first vegan concealer and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the whole world!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been eyeing this concealer for a while and tested it out at my local Whole Foods store and quite liked it.  </li>
      <li>I apply the darker color first and then use the lighter color on the darkest areas.  </li>
      <li>In fact his eczema was a lot better the next day --</li>
      <li>I tested this at Sprouts first, but they were sold out</li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t transfer easily, and it isn&#x27;t greasy enough to make my mascara run.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like putting a bunch of layers on my face unless I really need to touch up certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this feature because you can use blending techniques to match your skin color.  </li>
      <li>I bought this at whole foods brought it home and rarley use it.</li>
      <li>It blends very well and even as I’ve had it for a month now</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to blend the two tones effectively (could just be me), so I just use one of the tones.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any problems with it so far and the plastic cover seems pretty sturdy against cracks if it were to happen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would probably mix it with a tiny tiny bit of moisturizer if you want to spread it more or let your body warmth in your hand heat it up</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, covers well, and causes absolutely no irritation.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t normally use foundation, so I would even blend the rest of the product around my face.  </li>
      <li>packaging seems solid, compact, and easy to open.  </li>
      <li>Compared to other products on the market it&#x27;s well worth the money!</li>
      <li>I only wish that the concealers came in one color in addition to the dual color containers because by the end of a month, I&#x27;ve used all of the light color, and only a small amount of the darker color, which is such a waste, since I then have to order another concealer in order to get more of the light color.  </li>
      <li>Love the two different shades; I usually use the light one under my eyes and the other shade for the rest of my skin.</li>
      <li>Whether it be tired eyes or a bright red blemish, Mineral Fusion can conceal it!</li>
      <li>Also, my eyes are sensitive</li>
      <li>I get eczema on my eyelids, so I was looking for something natural that wouldn&#x27;t irritate it it.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin (with dirty blond hair and freckles).  </li>
      <li>We bought him the medium dark one (he’s of Italian descent) and he was really worried it’d irritate his skin</li>
      <li>small size, high $$, and a bit heat sensitive.</li>

    <li> Best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used! Goes on smoothly, covers well, and causes absolutely no irritation. Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This concealer is fantastic.  Great coverage that lasts.  I tried most of the department store cosmetic brands.  Mineral Fusion is better by far.</li>
    <li> I get eczema on my eyelids, so I was looking for something natural that wouldn&#x27;t irritate it it. This formula doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients that exacerbate my eczema, but the formulation is very very dry. The color is great and I love that you can customize the color that you need. However, it is so dry under my eyes that it doesn&#x27;t blend at all.</li>
    <li> I tested this at Sprouts first, but they were sold out so I ordered online.  I&#x27;ve used this product several times now as an under-eye concealer and I like it because it&#x27;s matte, dries quickly, but is still workable (blendable), it doesn&#x27;t transfer easily, and it isn&#x27;t greasy enough to make my mascara run.  The two colors make it easier to match.  I apply the darker color first and then use the lighter color on the darkest areas.  It settles into creases a little bit, but not as much as other products I&#x27;ve used.  It also doesn&#x27;t look too dry or emphasize my wrinkles, which usually happens with a dryer concealer.  Also, my eyes are sensitive so I appreciate that this doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> I have light-colored skin with yellow undertone, redness and melasma on my face, so it&#x27;s difficult for me to find a foundation that matches my skin tone.  Even though this product is a concealer, I use it as a foundation all over my face.  It covers the redness as well as the melasma, and I like that the product doesn&#x27;t have unnecessary chemicals in it since I have sensitive skin. Also, it goes on smoothly.  I only wish that the concealers came in one color in addition to the dual color containers because by the end of a month, I&#x27;ve used all of the light color, and only a small amount of the darker color, which is such a waste, since I then have to order another concealer in order to get more of the light color.  After smoothing it on my face, I brush on translucent powder which sets the concealer and it lasts all day.  Also, I order this product on Subscribe and Save for monthly delivery.</li>
    <li> Love the two different shades; I usually use the light one under my eyes and the other shade for the rest of my skin. Goes on very easily and I love that there is no perfumey, yucky odor!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this concealer a few years ago and I have never gone back! Whether it be tired eyes or a bright red blemish, Mineral Fusion can conceal it! Compared to other products on the market it&#x27;s well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I bought this at whole foods brought it home and rarley use it.The reason I dont use it is because when I tried to use foundation after, it does blend well with my foundation.Maybe you have to buy their brand foundation but Ive tried it at the store it didnt give me coverage.I usually five away makeup that I dont use anyway</li>
    <li> I have fair skin (with dirty blond hair and freckles).  A lot of “fair skin” concealers look too pink on me.  This one is perfect and I like that I can mix the two hues to make a perfect match, whether I’ve been in the sun a little or haven’t seen sun in days.  The consistency is great.  It blends very well and even as I’ve had it for a month now, the texture is the same (it doesn’t crack or anything).  My husband had to shoot a pilot presentation and be on camera, and he had an eczema outbreak under one eye.  We bought him the medium dark one (he’s of Italian descent) and he was really worried it’d irritate his skin but it did not!  In fact his eczema was a lot better the next day -- so while I won’t claim it healed his eczema, it certainly didn’t make it worse which COULD NOT be said about every makeup.</li>
    <li> the darker color matches my skin perfectly... i have no use for the lighter color though.</li>
    <li> Quality product, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin. I&#x27;ve used this to cover up blemishes, and it seems like it almost helps them heal while also concealing them. Not at all greasy. I&#x27;m not sure how to blend the two tones effectively (could just be me), so I just use one of the tones. Comes in a durable container--it gets tossed around my bag a lot and doesn&#x27;t open.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this concealer for a while and tested it out at my local Whole Foods store and quite liked it.  I ordered it for the lesser price at Amazon (of course) because I needed it for a wedding. Personally, I am very simple when it comes to makeup.  I really don&#x27;t like putting a bunch of layers on my face unless I really need to touch up certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mineral Fusion Concealer is a duo palette that comes in two shades - a light and darker one.  I really like this feature because you can use blending techniques to match your skin color.  The warm palette I received is great for skin with yellow undertones (I&#x27;m Filipino). The consistency is thick, not runny, and opaque - which I like.  I would probably mix it with a tiny tiny bit of moisturizer if you want to spread it more or let your body warmth in your hand heat it up if that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally use foundation, so I would even blend the rest of the product around my face.  I did test out their foundation and to me it was a good quality with good coverage, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging seems solid, compact, and easy to open.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with it so far and the plastic cover seems pretty sturdy against cracks if it were to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it was quite expensive for something I hardly use.  (I don&#x27;t wear foundation or concealer as an everyday thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR; I think this is a good quality concealer with great coverage.  It&#x27;s quite opaque and would recommend adding a tiny bit of moisturizer if you want to spread it or let the warmth of your body warm it up.  Returned it because it was a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> works great.  i wish it didn&#x27;t look so cakey under my eyes though...it covers my purple undereye skin great, but it sits in my creases &amp; makes them look more....still...rather have no purple eye bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on my rosacea on my cheeks it&#x27;s amazing &amp; doesn&#x27;t look cakey.  it lasts all day too.</li>
    <li> Love this concealer as I have very sensitive skin since going through cancer treatment. This one is non irritating, non greasy, lasts all day for me and has a nicly adjustable shade with the two colors provided in the compact.&lt;br /&gt;Down side- small size, high $$, and a bit heat sensitive.</li>
    <li> I wonderful product line in its entirety ( I use the liquid foundation, blushes and lip glosses ).&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This gives perfect, smooth coverage and the Warm is great for fair skin-I always have trouble finding the right color. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out either.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every brand of concealer and this is a winner.  I use the lighter part on my upper lids as a primer and the darker tint on my dark circles.  I have medium olive skin...this is a good match and gives very good coverage.  Very importantly, it does not irritate my eyes :}</li>
    <li> Great coverage but at the same time feels featherlight on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is my very first vegan concealer and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the whole world! It does a great job with coverage and lasts all day.</li>
