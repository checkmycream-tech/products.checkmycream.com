### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>While in theory this should be an excellent choice, there are couple issues:</li>
      <li>It gives a marvelous shave.  </li>
      <li>This was a great razor!</li>
      <li>I had to experiment to find the best direction to come at them with the Panasonic.</li>
      <li>I had heard that Panasonic make excellent shavers - and I have not been dissappointed.    </li>
      <li>Great product at a great price!</li>
      <li>I used to shave with a Gillette Mach 3 razor and while it gave an incredibly close shave, it also gave me an inordinant # of ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>and this Panasonic is great.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t make the blade shavers happy</li>
      <li>, unpacking the combo, it looked great.</li>
      <li>The 7037 has a great way to clean the blades - get this - with soap and water!!!</li>
      <li>I actually loved this razor.  </li>
      <li>has good nose hair trimmer included</li>
      <li>And, again, if you just need a shaver this one does a good job.  </li>
      <li>This razor is definitely a good value.</li>
      <li>Although it isn&#x27;t as good as razer shaving</li>
      <li>My husband loved this one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had Panasonic shaver before, model #ES7003, that was good.  </li>
      <li>this model seemed like a good 1st razor.    </li>
      <li>Honestly, it shaves remarkably close.</li>
      <li>Looked great, returned it because it is made in China and will surely break.  </li>
      <li>When it arrived I thought it looked really nice.</li>
      <li>The ear trimmer was just a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;- very nice looking, quick charging</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean, keeps a charge, and gives a great shave.</li>
      <li>It works very smoothly and painlessly.</li>
      <li>It was honestly more than I wanted to spend, but I figured I could return it if it didn&#x27;t measure up.    </li>
      <li>I love the way it is cleaned too.</li>
      <li>...see how many spots were missed and try to touch them up</li>
      <li>Wet/dry shaving with an electric is actually better than using a blade.  </li>
      <li>but I find myself using it more often as it&#x27;s a lot more convenient.</li>
      <li>The wet/dry option was appealing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyway, I like the Remington better.</li>
      <li>With this Panasonic shaver, I don&#x27;t say ouch any more.</li>
      <li>He used it a couple times and then started using disposable hand shavers saying he got a better shave with them.</li>
      <li>It gives a smooth, close shave and does not burn my skin!    </li>
      <li>Best shave are using it dry.  </li>
      <li>I had an old electric shaver for a number of years and wasn&#x27;t too happy with it as it hurted my face every time I shaved.</li>
      <li>I have used this razor for a year now and just love the smooth and burn free shaves it gives.</li>
      <li>you do get this razor though, make sure you clean it after every time you use it.</li>
      <li>Overall:  Excellent shaver and trimmer package is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>This one reminds me of the product when electric shavers first came out: marginally effective even after spending 3X longer than shaving with a blade.  </li>
      <li>It was cheap; it was easy to use, and it did what it was supposed to rather well.  </li>
      <li>The shaver is easy to use, comfortable to grip and hold even in the shower, and easy to clean.      </li>
      <li>Shaving with shaving cream gets you the best possible result but still a good result using it dry.   </li>
      <li>In addition to being close and not irritating, it also does a very good job of picking up those hairs that lie close to the skin and are frequently missed by foil shavers.  </li>
      <li>The nose/ear trimmer is also easy and comfortable to use and trims with clean precision.  </li>
      <li>NiCd batteries, with their 8-hour recharge time, are a huge annoyance.    </li>
      <li>Really smooth shave</li>
      <li>The battery meter is a nice feature, but the kicker is the fast recharge time.</li>
      <li>This shaver will give you smooth stubble free results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a Remington user, but decided to try the Panasonic primarily because of the wet/dry shaving capabilities.</li>
      <li>And it gave me a great shave with the same clean feeling I had with a blade.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s very little effort involved and because the replacement razor heads aren&#x27;t cheap, it would be in your best interests to just get in the habit of cleaning it.</li>
      <li>All that rinsing under running water and the soap that I lather with, had kept the blades clean.</li>
      <li>It was a clean as a whistle.</li>
      <li>He has liked using it so far and has no complaints about it.  </li>
      <li>Tried a Braun model, but I love the wet/dry feature of Panasonic too much.</li>
      <li>The Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver Model ES7037CMB Pivot Action Linear Blade rechargeable shaver combo with bonus nose/ear trimmer package is a worthwhile purchase for anyone looking for a comfortable, smooth shave...especially in the shower.      </li>
      <li>I liked the pivot head and it gave me a nice shave dry, which is how I used it at first.</li>
      <li>Rather, the charger plugs directly into the shaver, and storing it safely and securely while it is charging can be a challenge.    </li>
      <li>It stores neatly in the medicine cabinet or vanity drawer, and is ready to use when needed, and it cleans easily as well.    </li>
      <li>I lathered up and all of a sudden, I was in love!</li>
      <li>This thing worked immediately, fresh out of the box, better than my old shaver ever could.</li>
      <li>that I&#x27;m shaving more frequently</li>
      <li>But many reported that shaving wet or with shaving cream worked better, so I held off to try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems to be well made and does a nice job on removing his facial hair.  </li>
      <li>Due to the cost of those replacements, this Panasonic (with rebate) seemed to be a great deal, especially after reading so many glowing praises.</li>
      <li>Amazon makes it easy to return items, so I did, and ordered a new Remington.</li>
      <li>It really leaves it clean.</li>
      <li>I cut all my face with this the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;You should be aware of a couple things though: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
      <li>And the Amazon price was very competative!</li>
      <li>My parents bought me an electric razor for Christmas, my first.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- not expensive</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the razor&#x27;s fault, but more likely the fact that I would shave while showering</li>
      <li>Hmm...not so hot.</li>
      <li>When I saw the relative inexpensive price of this Panasonic and the fact that I&#x27;ve never owned anything by Panasonic that I wasn&#x27;t happy with and lasted a long time, I decided to take the \\&quot;Plunge\\</li>
      <li>The god-awful razor was actually a good learning experience, because it taught me a few select things:    1.</li>
      <li>It is a real winner at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>overall, I&#x27;m really not happy or impressed with it and am now faced with paying tracked shipping back to Panasonic under their &#x27;Guarantee&#x27;, or redeeming the rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does not shave at all if you have a strong facial hair</li>
      <li>The shaver is great - dry or wet.  </li>
      <li>And with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;He says it shaves really close.  </li>
      <li>real plus.  </li>
      <li>Wet shaving, while more involved, shaves much closer while not causing as much irritation.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I really like the razor.</li>
      <li>I was only going to buy something cheap.</li>
      <li>He has used it every morning since he got it and regularly lets me know he likes the smooth shave he gets from it.</li>
      <li>With this model, you just rinse it under the faucet and that takes a whole 15 seconds.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really speak from a lot of experience.</li>
      <li>The linear blade shaver cuts close, and it glides smoothly across your face, especially when used in conjunction with a shaving gel or lotion for added lubrication.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wet-dry, charges fast and shaves well.</li>
      <li>I do not like using the voltage converters-they take up too much space when packing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They recommend using it for 30 days to really get used to it.</li>
      <li>Also, this thing really should come with some sort of stand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice shaver, well designed, and easy to use, but it just didn&#x27;t shave as close, either wet or dry, as my old Remington.</li>
      <li>The next time I won&#x27;t pinch pennies; the higher priced models from Panasonic are worth the price difference.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a pretty young shaver</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> While in theory this should be an excellent choice, there are couple issues: &lt;br /&gt;PROS: &lt;br /&gt;- very nice looking, quick charging &lt;br /&gt;- shaves both dry and wet &lt;br /&gt;- not expensive &lt;br /&gt;- has good nose hair trimmer included &lt;br /&gt;CONS: &lt;br /&gt;- Does not shave at all if you have a strong facial hair, I don&#x27;t mean long beard, but thick &amp; strong. It may work if you have a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; or thin hair. For me it works in some areas and in other it simply does not do what it is supposed to do. &lt;br /&gt;Therefore, only two stars from me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic shaver before, model #ES7003, that was good.  I tried to buy a replacement foil and cutting block but realized I can buy a new shaver for virtually same cost!  Tried a Braun model, but I love the wet/dry feature of Panasonic too much. Shaving with shaving cream gets you the best possible result but still a good result using it dry.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also considered the self cleaning model but didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the extra cost. With this model, you just rinse it under the faucet and that takes a whole 15 seconds.  And the nose/ear trimmer is a terrific bonus.  Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Won&#x27;t make the blade shavers happy but I&#x27;ve been using dry electric shavers for years and this works for me. Nose/Ear trimmer is pleasantly quiet which is a concern if you&#x27;re sticking it in your ear.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009DT3A6 Panasonic ES7037CMB Pivot Action Linear Triple Blade Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver Combo with Bonus Nose/Ear Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hated every electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I hate having to clean them, and they don&#x27;t really give me the clean feeling of a blade. I only owned one for emergencies or touch-ups. When my old one died, I went in search of another. I was only going to buy something cheap. I had, however, never tried a wet/dry razor before. When I saw the relative inexpensive price of this Panasonic and the fact that I&#x27;ve never owned anything by Panasonic that I wasn&#x27;t happy with and lasted a long time, I decided to take the \\&quot;Plunge\\&quot; (pun intended) and ordered The ES7037CMB Pivot Action razor. When it arrived I thought it looked really nice. I liked the pivot head and it gave me a nice shave dry, which is how I used it at first. Then came the morning I decided to see what it was like \\&quot;wet\\&quot;. I lathered up and all of a sudden, I was in love! This was a great razor! And it gave me a great shave with the same clean feeling I had with a blade. What really astounded me, however, was several weeks later when I opened it to clean it -- It was a clean as a whistle. All that rinsing under running water and the soap that I lather with, had kept the blades clean. I would recommend this razor to anyone. I still hate electric razors - but not this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He has liked using it so far and has no complaints about it.  It seems to be well made and does a nice job on removing his facial hair.  The ear trimmer was just a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Having owned several Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers over a 20 year period I can, with authority, say that this model is a big disappointment. The battery life is outstanding, but that&#x27;s because the motor speed is so slow it&#x27;s not using much juice. And with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor. The next time I won&#x27;t pinch pennies; the higher priced models from Panasonic are worth the price difference.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver Model ES7037CMB Pivot Action Linear Blade rechargeable shaver combo with bonus nose/ear trimmer package is a worthwhile purchase for anyone looking for a comfortable, smooth shave...especially in the shower.      Positives:  The linear blade shaver cuts close, and it glides smoothly across your face, especially when used in conjunction with a shaving gel or lotion for added lubrication.    The shaver is easy to use, comfortable to grip and hold even in the shower, and easy to clean.      Negatives:  The shaver foil segment removes completely, rather than being hinged as some are.  This, coupled with the fact that the segment only fits one way, could be a potential source for damaging the fragile and expensive foil screens and/or shaver blades, either by dropping the part accidentally, or by attempting to put the part back onto the shaver incorrectly.  The shaver does not come with a charging stand. Rather, the charger plugs directly into the shaver, and storing it safely and securely while it is charging can be a challenge.    The nose/ear trimmer is also easy and comfortable to use and trims with clean precision.  It stores neatly in the medicine cabinet or vanity drawer, and is ready to use when needed, and it cleans easily as well.    Overall:  Excellent shaver and trimmer package is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> If you want a shaver this one works well.  I feel the \\&quot;pivot\\&quot; portion is a marketing ploy versus actually helping with the shave.  However I purchase a shaver for both the shaving portion and the attached trimmer (not the ear/nose trimmer).  I have a mustache.  I don&#x27;t need much, just something that can occasionally trim that mustache.  The trimmer is a total letdown.  Maybe they forgot to sharpen mine but it is truly worthless.  Now I need to purchase a mustache trimmer or a new shaver.  I do like Panasonic shavers.  And, again, if you just need a shaver this one does a good job.  The nose/ear hair trimmer is also solid.  It&#x27;s just not large enough to do a mustache.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement razor for my husband.  He has nothing but praise for the razor.  The ability to use the razor either with or without water is a major plus.  The razor holds its charge well.  This razor is definitely a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d switched to a Mach 3 a while back after being dissatisfied with the performance of a Braun electric razor. Due to the cost of those replacements, this Panasonic (with rebate) seemed to be a great deal, especially after reading so many glowing praises. The wet/dry option was appealing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, unpacking the combo, it looked great. Charged it up according to the directions, and tried shaving dry. Hmm...not so hot. But many reported that shaving wet or with shaving cream worked better, so I held off to try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They recommend using it for 30 days to really get used to it. Coincidentally, their &#x27;Satisfaction Guarantee&#x27; is also...30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after using it for a few weeks, it&#x27;s just not doing it for me. My typical shaving routine is...shave in the shower with shaving cream. Wash face...see how many spots were missed and try to touch them up (doesn&#x27;t work so well just wet with water). Clean out razor, shake water out, let it dry for a bit...dry face, and try again to touch up missed areas while dry. Give up, pull out standard razor and finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I&#x27;m really not happy or impressed with it and am now faced with paying tracked shipping back to Panasonic under their &#x27;Guarantee&#x27;, or redeeming the rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the little trimmer in this combo that everyone seems to hate works perfectly for me. Go figure.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a Christmas present. He has used it every morning since he got it and regularly lets me know he likes the smooth shave he gets from it. I had purchased a rechargeable about a year ago for him. He used it a couple times and then started using disposable hand shavers saying he got a better shave with them.</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes high quality shavers.  This shaver will give you smooth stubble free results.  The nose hair trimmer is almost useless as others have noted.</li>
    <li> I had heard that with all razors you should allow a 30 day \\&quot;getting used to\\&quot; period. Well, I can say that after 2 shaves (one dry; one with shaving cream) I am sold.    I used to shave with a Gillette Mach 3 razor and while it gave an incredibly close shave, it also gave me an inordinant # of ingrown hairs. It wasn&#x27;t the razor&#x27;s fault, but more likely the fact that I would shave while showering and I would shave against the grain.     Anyway, I decided to take the plunge to an electric razor. I read a few reviews and dollar for dollar this model seemed like a good 1st razor.    Honestly, it shaves remarkably close. No, it&#x27;s not the same as me shaving against the grain in the shower, but it IS as close as when I would shave with the grain. And this is after only 2 shaves.     Not sure if I&#x27;ll continue to shave wet or dry (both yielded similar results).     Panasonic makes a few other razors for double and triple the price, but to me, the features they offered (blade cleaning systems) were not worth the added $. The 7037 has a great way to clean the blades - get this - with soap and water!!! What a novel idea.     Also, I like the fact that this razor has a simple cord that plugs in for charging (as opposed to the pricier models&#x27; cumbersome docking stations.    Anyway, I really like the razor. And as pathetic as it sounds, I actually look forward to shaving.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this one.  He can use it in the shower. &lt;br /&gt;He says it shaves really close.  Plus the nose trimmer is &lt;br /&gt;a real plus.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco user for several years and this was my first Panasonic.  In my opinion this blows away the Norelco triple head for comfort and closeness. It is easy to clean, keeps a charge, and gives a great shave. Look, no electric razor is going to give you as close a shave as a blade but this Panasonic comes as close as any electric razor I have ever used.  It is a real winner at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a particularly tough beard and I have used other electric shavers.  This one reminds me of the product when electric shavers first came out: marginally effective even after spending 3X longer than shaving with a blade.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price - it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for a year now and just love the smooth and burn free shaves it gives.</li>
    <li> Looked great, returned it because it is made in China and will surely break.  I wish they would start putting where things are manufactured on here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Remington user, but decided to try the Panasonic primarily because of the wet/dry shaving capabilities. It&#x27;s a nice shaver, well designed, and easy to use, but it just didn&#x27;t shave as close, either wet or dry, as my old Remington. Amazon makes it easy to return items, so I did, and ordered a new Remington. The Remington shaves much closer, however it is louder than the Panasonic, which is a very quiet shaver. Anyway, I like the Remington better.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews of similar Panasonic shavers, I was hopeful that this one would shave well.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It shaves closer AND with less irritation than any shaver I&#x27;ve owned - and I&#x27;ve owned most brands: Remington, Braun, Wahl, and Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a fluke, I went on a trip just after I ordered the Panasonic, and I forgot to bring my old shaver on the trip.  As a result I bought a new Braun while I was on the trip.  It shaved very well, and I thought I might keep it and send the Panasonic back (under their 30-day money back guarantee) if it didn&#x27;t shave as well as the Braun.  But one shave with the Panasonic, and their was no doubt that I would keep it.  It gives a marvelous shave.  In addition to being close and not irritating, it also does a very good job of picking up those hairs that lie close to the skin and are frequently missed by foil shavers.  The trimmer works well too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You should be aware of a couple things though: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  This is not a \\&quot;linear motor\\&quot; shaver despite the implication in the description. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2.  A set of replacement cutters and foil cost about $43.00, which is exorbitant in my opinion.  I don&#x27;t know yet how long the original cutter and foil will produce the terrific shave, but I think I&#x27;d be willing to spend $43.00 a year for the shave it&#x27;s giving me now.</li>
    <li> My parents bought me an electric razor for Christmas, my first. The god-awful razor was actually a good learning experience, because it taught me a few select things:    1. I have a hard time keeping a daily shaving routine. I&#x27;m always liable to skip a day.  2. Wet/dry shaving with an electric is actually better than using a blade.  3. NiCd batteries, with their 8-hour recharge time, are a huge annoyance.    The Schick (didn&#x27;t know they made electric razors, did you?) I had couldn&#x27;t shave my growth if I skipped a day, and my facial hair doesn&#x27;t even grow all that fast. In addition, in order to properly charge the shaver, I was supposed to completely discharge the shaver, then recharge (presumably to avoid the memory effect of NiCd batteries). Ultimately, this meant one or two shaves out of the week that ended halfway through the process.     I went back to using blades for a while. But some unknown force compelled me to peruse the electric shaver section at Fry&#x27;s one day. After comparing boxes, I settled on this one for $... It was honestly more than I wanted to spend, but I figured I could return it if it didn&#x27;t measure up.    The first shave with the Panasonic proved to me that the whole \\&quot;30-day acclimation period\\&quot; is crap. This thing worked immediately, fresh out of the box, better than my old shaver ever could. That was dry. Wet shaving, while more involved, shaves much closer while not causing as much irritation. The battery meter is a nice feature, but the kicker is the fast recharge time. Even if the shaver dies, 5-10 minutes is all I need to have it running again. I also don&#x27;t have to worry about the \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; with Ni-MH batteries. The integrated trimmer in between the foils actually works, and means that I actually can shave every-other-day and have it still do its job well. Cleaning involves running it under the faucet with a bit of hand soap.    All this said, there are some caveats. Hairs on my neck are still somewhat pesky, and won&#x27;t go away without a fight. I had to experiment to find the best direction to come at them with the Panasonic. I&#x27;m sure more expensive shavers might have an easier time with them.    Also, this thing really should come with some sort of stand. It comes with a cloth bag for traveling, but no stand. Get rid of the nose-hair trimmer (which I have no use for) and just give me a basic stand so I have a place to set the shaver to dry.    While I could have spent less on a shaver with similar features, I&#x27;d be hard pressed to find one at this price that did everything well, without any major annoyances. It&#x27;s wet-dry, charges fast and shaves well. The only thing I&#x27;m not looking forward to is buying replacement blades, but if it continues to work like it has in the past 6 months, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty young shaver and I&#x27;ve only had 1 other electric razor to compare with this, so I can&#x27;t really speak from a lot of experience. My old shaver was a bottom-of-the-line norelco that simply tore my face to shreds. There was none of this 30 days to adjust thing, it was just always an uncomfortable shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m shaving more frequently however I thought I&#x27;d get a decent one and this Panasonic is great. I have a fairly sensitive face but I think my beard only needed about 4 or 5 days to fully adjust. Even if the razor is dry, it shaves very close and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unless I&#x27;m running late I usually use some EDGE gel, which works like a dream with this razor.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I kind of would have preferred maybe a stand or a small cut in price instead of the nosehair trimmer, but that&#x27;s just a minor gripe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you do get this razor though, make sure you clean it after every time you use it. All you have to do is squirt some liquid/gel soap on it and turn it on and then rinse it off. There&#x27;s very little effort involved and because the replacement razor heads aren&#x27;t cheap, it would be in your best interests to just get in the habit of cleaning it.</li>
    <li> I had an old electric shaver for a number of years and wasn&#x27;t too happy with it as it hurted my face every time I shaved. With this Panasonic shaver, I don&#x27;t say ouch any more. It works very smoothly and painlessly. The trimmer works well too. Although it isn&#x27;t as good as razer shaving but I find myself using it more often as it&#x27;s a lot more convenient. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I cut all my face with this the first time I used it.  Silly me, I was replacing a Norelco which I use to press against my face to shave.  I found out in the second shave that I didn&#x27;t have to apply pressure with this one.    Really smooth shave and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  Best shave are using it dry.  With shaving cream I usually get cuts with this one.    I love the way it is cleaned too. Put liquid soap and turn it on.  It really leaves it clean.</li>
    <li> When I purchased the shaver, I was under the impression that it would work on US or European voltages.  I was wrong!  I thought all of the \\&quot;wall warts\\&quot; would work on any of the international voltages, but I guess you found one that wouldn&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s a shame since I intended to travel to Budapest with it.  I guess I will have to find another.  I do not like using the voltage converters-they take up too much space when packing.</li>
    <li> I had heard that Panasonic make excellent shavers - and I have not been dissappointed.    The shaver is great - dry or wet.  I had suffered from a lot of razor burn both wet and dry shaving. But this shaver ended that.    It gives a smooth, close shave and does not burn my skin!    And the Amazon price was very competative!</li>
    <li> I actually loved this razor.  It was cheap; it was easy to use, and it did what it was supposed to rather well.  Other than having to get used to an electric razor after only using the Gillete brand of razors, this razor was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then one little trip back home to California on a plane and the razor couldn&#x27;t handle being the trip.  When I opened up my bag to grab and shave, the head had fallen off and when reattached, it simply would not stay attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of this review? If you plan on taking trips often, don&#x27;t buy this razor, otherwise I&#x27;d actually recommend it.</li>
