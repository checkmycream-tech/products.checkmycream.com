      <li>This is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Nice light gold color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always in search of new eye shadow colors, and really this golden tone is perfect and beautiful.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, rich shade of gold and seems to stay put quite well.</li>
      <li>This color is a really warm looking gold color and can be built upon from light color to darker easily.</li>
      <li>This color is gorgeous and very versatile.</li>
      <li>These crème eye shadows  can be easily compared to MAC paint pots.</li>
      <li>It blends easily and does NOT crease.</li>
      <li>I like this formula a lot: easy to apply and control.</li>
      <li>Easily applied and controlled, lasted all night without change.</li>
      <li>It blends in really easily and evenly, not patchy.</li>
      <li>It just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations - It didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I hoped and doesn&#x27;t look like it did in the advertisement.  </li>
      <li>(The Barely Branded is much better for my cool, fair skin and blond/blue coloring).</li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shimmery and smooth to apply.</li>
      <li>I would love to slide it right on and have the pop factor.  </li>
      <li>Really smooth, great color, great price, long lasting.</li>
      <li>I was super excited when I saw that it wasn&#x27;t super sparkly ,but more of a shimmer.</li>
      <li>I really love gold and earth tones and this is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>The pigment is rich and can be built</li>
      <li>If you wear it alone, you might need to layer it to get to its true color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Compared to \\&quot;Gold Rush\\&quot; -- Gold Rush is significantly more intensely yellow-based.</li>
      <li>Wearability: Full disclosure</li>
      <li>I am very low-maintenance when it comes to eye makeup, in that I only need one (good) color, and I don&#x27;t like to use anything that needs more than just a finger to swipe on.</li>
      <li>Color looks great, very adaptable to various looks.</li>
      <li>This eyeshadow is impressive, for an everyday makeup brand it works very well</li>
      <li>I have this in \\&quot;Bold Gold.\\</li>
      <li>the Color Tattoos and the metallic ones are my new favorite things.</li>
      <li>really pretty!</li>
      <li>The color is so pretty!</li>
      <li>Overall, amazing results with this product.</li>
      <li>Just a fun products for you</li>
      <li>So for the price, If you like a cream-based shadow, this one is definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>But It was worth a try.</li>
      <li>This color does not look good on me - hazel eyes, and is not what I expected.</li>
      <li>The name of the product is written only on the lid, so if you have more than one of these, be sure to keep the lids straight.  </li>
      <li>This is super pretty.</li>
      <li>this color has the right amount of shimmer and shine...a litte water makes it makes it matte.  </li>
      <li>Application is very easy and it is a simple product to work with.</li>
      <li>The price is also very good for this high quality product, usually averaging around $6.</li>
      <li>have super oily lids and live in a super hot and humid country.</li>
      <li>It seems the only way I can achieve the boldness of this product is if I use more layers.  </li>
      <li>Can be blended out for a softer look which is really pretty</li>
      <li>Also, the color payout is nice and the color lasts long throughout the whole day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s buildable too, so you can go more sheer and natural, or build it up to its full, opaque golden intensity.</li>
      <li>Must be a great product because my college aged daughter came home for the weekend and when she left this went with her!</li>
      <li>Use it mostly as an eyeshadow base works perfectly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used this for a beach vacation, wanted something that I could wear and be able to go in the water as well. That way I always looked picture perfect. it stayed on the entire time...and if needed easy to apply a little more.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t disappoint!!! It does last for 24 hours and you only need a little so it ends up lasting longer. I would absolutely love to buy more.</li>
    <li> I would like this color to have a better pop factor.  It seems the only way I can achieve the boldness of this product is if I use more layers.  I would love to slide it right on and have the pop factor.  However, gold is one of my favorite colors in any eye shadow...</li>
    <li> It lasted all day and night! The pigment is great but it dusted more than i liked, and got a bit caked so you will need to check your make up if you sweat alot.</li>
    <li> This is super pretty. I love the Color Tattoos and the metallic ones are my new favorite things. Unfortunately, they aren&#x27;t QUITE as smooth and pigmented as the originals, but they aren&#x27;t sheer or patchy by any means. They set well and are long lasting and mostly waterproof. I recommend trying these out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The gel eye shadow is PERFECT! I didn&#x27;t actually realize it was gel until I recieved it. The creamy consistency is amazing! But, when it goes on it feels and actually looks like powder! If you know how to lightly brush it on its great. A little thick, but it looks professional.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to do fancy professional looking makeup no matter how hard I try, and this eyeshadow mixed with the gel eyeliner, it serious,y does look professional! For the gold and the silver eyeshadow I will b buying this product!</li>
    <li> Good gold but beware if glitter is not your thing! This is a glittery gold. Can be blended out for a softer look which is really pretty but glitter will still be apparent.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic! Really smooth, great color, great price, long lasting. It can be used as a lip color too.</li>
    <li> Packaging:  The product packaging is good.  It comes in a heavy glass pot.  The lid isn&#x27;t rubberized, which does make me wonder if the product is going to dry out quickly, but only time will tell.  The name of the product is written only on the lid, so if you have more than one of these, be sure to keep the lids straight.  Application:  This had decent color payoff.  I thought the color on the lid was darker than the color in the pot.  Also, there is a ton of glitter in this color.  I had all sorts of problems with fallout when I applied it.  Wearability: Full disclosure, I do not have oily lids.  That said, I had no issues with this product creasing.  It dried very quickly as well, so it wasn&#x27;t like I had to sit there with my eyes closed waiting for it to set.  Overall:  I have other gold cream shadow/bases from the drug store and I liked them a lot more than this product.  I also have the Teal color tattoo and I thought it was great.  It had significantly less glitter.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is impressive, for an everyday makeup brand it works very well and I love color, I also used it on my collar bone to make them &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and it was perfect for that too!</li>
    <li> These crème eye shadows  can be easily compared to MAC paint pots. They have great pigmentation, they are easily blendable, and are also beautiful as an eye shadow primer. The price is also very good for this high quality product, usually averaging around $6. I find that this product does not crease on me whatsoever and is great to wear in any weather and for all occasions. This product is not drying at all. It also sets at a reasonable rate, just enough time for blending. This product is good for a daily, casual makeup look as well as a smoky, sultry look. The pigmentation can be built up without looking cakey on the eyelids so one could aim for a sheer to a very opaque eye makeup look. This product is very versatile in every sense. Application is very easy and it is a simple product to work with. Overall, amazing results with this product.</li>
    <li> This color does not look good on me - hazel eyes, and is not what I expected. I love the tattoo color products, but this color is very faint and gives my eyes a sickly yellow look.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyeshadow exclusively for over a year now, and I am hooked. I am very low-maintenance when it comes to eye makeup, in that I only need one (good) color, and I don&#x27;t like to use anything that needs more than just a finger to swipe on. This formulation is so creamy that a finger is literally all you need, and the Bold Gold shade is really nice (at least for me) that the one color is all I need. For me, it lasts a while, but I think 24-hours might be pushing it a little. I think I might actually be frightened of an eyeshadow that I apply at 9 am and lasts until 9 am the next morning? I mean who really needs that? But it does last a while. Speaking of lasting for a while-- I have tried cream-based shadows from department store brands for more than 5 times the price that have dried out within months--I literally can scoop out the very bottom of this eyeshadow a year later and it is still the same consistency. So for the price, If you like a cream-based shadow, this one is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and an eye shadow fixation. So you see my problem? I was excited to try this as I especially love cream eye shadows. The coverage is decent but once it dries it feels too dry on my eyelids and as such I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day. For special occasions it would work but be prepared to re apply in a lighter color like this after a few hours.</li>
    <li> The product ability wise is fine, but I was disappointed with the color. The color was much darker then displayed, so I do not use it as often as I would have like to. It also does not go on evenly, which is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have this in \\&quot;Bold Gold.\\&quot; The quality of this cream eyeshadow is quite amazing, considering how inexpensive it is. It feels high-end. It goes on so smoothly. It&#x27;s a beautiful, warm opaque metallic gold. I like to apply it using my fingers. It blends in really easily and evenly, not patchy. It&#x27;s buildable too, so you can go more sheer and natural, or build it up to its full, opaque golden intensity. My eyelids get oily, so without a primer this creases a little bit. But with a good eye primer, this is practically bulletproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to \\&quot;Gold Rush\\&quot; -- Gold Rush is significantly more intensely yellow-based.</li>
    <li> I like the color a lot, and I do think the color tattoos are long lasting.  But I feel that all of the tattoos in general feel like they dry up quickly in the pot and would much rather prefer using the Loreal Infallible eyeshadows (which are waterproof as well).  The glitter in Bold Gold is gritty, and you will likely have fall out with the color. I loved the color when I first purchased it for the inner corner, but now, I find myself wanting to use other eyeshadows that are much easier to work with.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, rich shade of gold and seems to stay put quite well. I do apply it with my fingers.</li>
    <li> The color is so pretty! I really love gold and earth tones and this is my new favorite. I was scared it would be  hard to take off. Not at all came off like any other shadow. It stayed on all day with the same intense color.</li>
    <li> Seriously my favorite, and it looks amazing if you spray your brush with fix + then apply</li>
    <li> this color has the right amount of shimmer and shine...a litte water makes it makes it matte.  great product to have</li>
    <li> The color is very nice, but the quality... Well, you get what you paid for.  I have used Chanel before and it cannot be compared.  In about 6-7 hours, my eyelids would feel irritated, I could not wait to get it off.  So, i would recommend it for a night out, but not for every day.</li>
    <li> really pretty! stays on well until i start rubbing my eyes a ton anyways! bought a bunch more colors after trying this one!</li>
    <li> I have to say I am impressed with this product. The claim that is long wearing is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super oily lids and live in a super hot and humid country. I used it all day (early in the morning until the evening) and it did not crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I noticed is that the color got a little glossy at the end of the day (shinny because of my oily lids) but I liked the effect. I might wear them with a clear gloss to create that look again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the colors (got bad to the bronze and bold gold). I will get other colors and repurchase for sure.</li>
    <li> Love!  Great service!</li>
    <li> Nice light gold color. It&#x27;s shimmery and smooth to apply. I love how it looks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always in search of new eye shadow colors, and really this golden tone is perfect and beautiful. It applies easily and is very bright and elegant in the eyes, is perfect for a date or a night out.</li>
    <li> I love the color tattoo line.  Best eyeshadow I&#x27;ve found that won&#x27;t rub, slide or crease by end of day.  This color is a really warm looking gold color and can be built upon from light color to darker easily.</li>
    <li> First off, this whole line is a bit lighter than the pics and the bottom of the containers once on your eyes. That being said, it&#x27;s a great &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; eyeshadow! It stays put even when you rub your eyes. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is just okay - I won&#x27;t purchase it again.  It just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations - It didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I hoped and doesn&#x27;t look like it did in the advertisement.  But It was worth a try.</li>
    <li> This color is gorgeous and very versatile. You can use it as a base or blending color, with great results. If you wear it alone, you might need to layer it to get to its true color. Overall, I am really happy with this product, and the packaging is great!</li>
    <li> Love it, and it is very long lasting, I purchased this eyeshadow a year ago and I still have quite a bit left. Also, the color payout is nice and the color lasts long throughout the whole day.</li>
    <li> Maybelline 24 Hour Eyeshadow Bold Gold is a great color from the Color Tattoo line. It&#x27;s well-named, because when you put this stuff on your lids, it really stays there. You won&#x27;t come home at the end of the day and find that it&#x27;s all drifted into a crease or worse yet -- run under your eyes making you look like a racoon on prom nite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second color in this brand that I&#x27;ve tried, and I especially picked it out because I figured that it would look really excellent worked with Bad To The Bronze. They work really well together, and I also plan on using these colors along with other shadows to create special effects. You can use it sparingly for just a bit of shimmer, or layer it on for an amazing bit of glamour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color Tattoo is a great cosmetic to get creative with!</li>
    <li> Great! didn&#x27;t budge all day!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and this product was great. It is great for a base coat. I was very surprised to see that it lasted all day. I was super excited when I saw that it wasn&#x27;t super sparkly ,but more of a shimmer. This was a product that will be on my favorite list for a long time.</li>
    <li> Easily applied and controlled, lasted all night without change.</li>
    <li> This product goes on bold and has staying power, would definitely recommend.  Use it mostly as an eyeshadow base works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyeshadow. It&#x27;s more shimmery and less pigmented and I think that&#x27;s a good thing. I can layer it on top of another of the color tattoo colors just for a bit of shimmer. It certainly is long lasting, but it does settle into creases eventually. I don&#x27;t care though, I like the way it brightens up my eyemakeup.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had been trying to get the &amp;#34;Blitz&amp;#34; color from Urban Decay after she used up the last of hers and she couldn&#x27;t find it. I did some research online to check colors, and this thing matches very closely to the Blitz color and she loves it. I&#x27;ve bought her two of these already.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow should come w a warning...you&#x27;ll start having an urge to sing Spandau Ballets ,&amp;#34;Gold!&amp;#34; It looks gold and you can say its pigmented! Lol Doesn&#x27;t crease a lot but I did use it w an eye primer just in case. Just a fun products for you makeup junkies out there!</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow! It stays on all day and all night. It blends easily and does NOT crease.</li>
    <li> Nice staying power.  Color looks great, very adaptable to various looks.</li>
    <li> I like this formula a lot: easy to apply and control. It stays all day, especially over a primer and set with a bit of powder. The pigment is rich and can be built easily.&lt;br /&gt;The Bold Gold shade is not very flattering on me, however, and I have not used it as much as I hoped. (The Barely Branded is much better for my cool, fair skin and blond/blue coloring). I will use this for special occasions, but stick to the Barely branded for all over everyday color.</li>
    <li> Love these color tattoos by maybelline. They last all day. Very shimmery but looks natural since it&#x27;s creamy gel. Different colors have different levels of creaminess and sheerness. I like to use tattoo metal &amp;#34;Barely Branded&amp;#34; all over the lid up to brow. Then apply &amp;#34;Bold Gold&amp;#34;on the lid and lower lash line. &amp;#34;Bold Gold&amp;#34; reminds me of MAC rice paper. Then on half lid and in the crease I use &amp;#34;Bad to the Bronze&amp;#34;. This shadow pairs well with Missha BB cream as a foundation. Together it gives a natural health glow look. I also like the maybelline Dreamy bouncy blush. I use &amp;#34;coffe cake&amp;#34; under cheek bone for contouring and &amp;#34;Rose Petal&amp;#34; on cheek bones for color.</li>
    <li> Was really dry, hard to put on, way to glittery. Color is good and good shipping.</li>
    <li> did not like the texture. creases on eyes. very disappointed</li>
    <li> love it love it love it, this product it like the best eye shadow ever, i&#x27;m praying that there be more colors.</li>
    <li> I love the staying power and the extra color/shimmer I get from using this instead of a regular primer.  It lasts all day and does not smudge.</li>
    <li> Must be a great product because my college aged daughter came home for the weekend and when she left this went with her!</li>
