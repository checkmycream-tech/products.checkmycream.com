      <li>Tastes really good, which helps me to stay on track with my calcium consumption.</li>
      <li>Good product though just because all calcium I find has vitamin D added in, which I don&#x27;t need, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>

      <li>Chewable calcium citrate is not an easy product to find, and I appreciate that this company produces it.    </li>
      <li>Easy and tasty to use.  </li>
      <li>One tablet taste fine and is &#x27;blended&#x27; well.</li>
      <li>Barely fit in my vitamin pillpack.</li>
      <li>I usually have good luck with Solaray quality, but not this time.</li>

<li> The next one has chunks of the various ingredients in it and tastes awful.</li>
<li> tastes a little orangey and in all, not so bad.</li>

    <li> After having a gastric bypass surgery several years ago I need to take large doses of calcium citrare. This is a nice chewable source.</li>
    <li> One tablet taste fine and is &#x27;blended&#x27; well. The next one has chunks of the various ingredients in it and tastes awful. I usually have good luck with Solaray quality, but not this time. I took about 4-5 of them and threw the rest away.</li>
    <li> A great product and good price</li>
