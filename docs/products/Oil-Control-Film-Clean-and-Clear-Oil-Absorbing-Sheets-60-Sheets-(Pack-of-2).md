### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I am good to go for the rest of the day!</li>
      <li>They are definitely a great bargain considering these are about $5 each.</li>
      <li>The pack of 2 has two packages of 60 sheets each, so it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously, if you&#x27;ve never tried this kind, give it a shot!</li>
      <li>Works and good bang for the buck.</li>
      <li>I love these!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that there are 60 sheets in each pack instead of 50, though.</li>
      <li>It has 10 more sheets per packet than US ones and this is totally a good deal.</li>
      <li>Nice to use when i look like a grease ball</li>
      <li>These oil absorbing sheets are the best!</li>
      <li>Love how great it is for cheap price</li>
      <li>I got both packets of oil absorbing sheets in very good condition.</li>
      <li>Will repurchase agian and agian :)</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t even have to hunt for clean corners!</li>
      <li>Other than that, amazing !!!!</li>
      <li>and they work great whether u are bare faced or wearing makeup.</li>
      <li>So that means (1) they aren&#x27;t like those wax-paper like Japanese blotting sheets (which didn&#x27;t work that great for me) and (2) there will be no accidental ripping (which I&#x27;ve had happen with Mary Kay paper like oil blotting sheets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t know about where you live, but the shipping was quick!</li>
      <li>Honestly the beat deal I have had in a long time.</li>
      <li>Also, if you&#x27;re not careful, these can wipe some makeup off your face (the U.S. version is a lot better at not disturbing makeup).</li>
      <li>These things work really well!</li>
      <li>Especially  since you get 10 more in the pack than if you bought them somewhere else.</li>
      <li>Well, i have tried all of them, and these are hands down my favorite!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t wipe off your makeup and with just a few dabs your makeup looks as good as new!</li>
      <li>Thanks Clean &amp; Clear and Thanks to the company selling these.</li>
      <li>so they don&#x27;t absorb quite as much oil as 1 sheet of the US version.</li>
      <li>I always go back to Clean and clear cause they never fail me.</li>
      <li>but these work exactly the same as the ones you would buy at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>They work just the same, and very convenient  when your on the go and about to take a picture</li>
      <li>Love these&amp;#60;3333 went through numerous of different brands of oil sheets and it just didn&#x27;t collect enough of the oiliness outta my face or kept it matte all day long.</li>
      <li>Word of advice, though, if you use these wipes while wearing make-up &amp;#34;press&amp;#34; the sheet onto your, DO NOT drag it!</li>

<li> These are almost the exact same as those you would get in the US but half the price!!</li>
<li> The sheets are small but very absorbent (as long as you press on it).</li>
<li> Now, I know there are other brands out there that may be cheaper, and some WAY more expensive ones too.</li>
<li> /&gt;These sheets are less like paper and more like a very thin stretchy material... imagine a cross between paper and a theraband?</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought.</li>
<li> Other then that they are the same!</li>
<li> The only difference is the blue is a little darker.</li>
<li> Very similar to the US version, but a little thinner</li>
<li> I find these to be harder to use</li>
<li> - I have to press harder to make them absorb the oil on my face.</li>
<li> I have been using these for years and always will compared to any other brand.</li>
<li> I have extremely oily skin.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have terribly oily skin for the most part, but my t-zone tends to get oily half way through the day.</li>
<li> I unfortunately was blessed with extremely oily skin and no matter what type of makeup I buy half way through the work day my face is extremely oily.</li>
<li> lately they haven&#x27;t got any in.</li>
<li> Just tab the sheet on your face, no more oil, and make-up in tact!</li>
<li> Some of other oil blotting papers are just too expensive, but not these!</li>
<li> It will smear your makeup and you will look weird (like I did one day).</li>
<li> Crazy.</li>

    <li> Now, I know there are other brands out there that may be cheaper, and some WAY more expensive ones too. Well, i have tried all of them, and these are hands down my favorite! Just tab the sheet on your face, no more oil, and make-up in tact! I don&#x27;t have terribly oily skin for the most part, but my t-zone tends to get oily half way through the day. One sheet and I am good to go for the rest of the day!</li>
    <li> Nice to use when i look like a grease ball</li>
    <li> These things work really well! I keep them in my purse and they work great whether u are bare faced or wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> I love these! Especially  since you get 10 more in the pack than if you bought them somewhere else. They work just the same, and very convenient  when your on the go and about to take a picture and you don&#x27;t want your face oily and shiny. Or even just to not look like you rubbed baby oil all over your face. I have been using these for years and always will compared to any other brand. Thanks Clean &amp; Clear and Thanks to the company selling these.</li>
    <li> The service and the product was wxcellent</li>
    <li> These are a necessity for a person with oily skin. I unfortunately was blessed with extremely oily skin and no matter what type of makeup I buy half way through the work day my face is extremely oily. These oil absorbing sheets are the best! It doesn&#x27;t wipe off your makeup and with just a few dabs your makeup looks as good as new! Walmart use to keep these in stock but I have noticed here lately they haven&#x27;t got any in. I got both packets of oil absorbing sheets in very good condition. Will definitely buy from this seller again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> These left my face matte and I didn&#x27;t even have to hunt for clean corners! The sheets are small but very absorbent (as long as you press on it). The pack of 2 has two packages of 60 sheets each, so it&#x27;s a great deal. The inside of the box has a sticker area that you peel off and, upon closing and re-opening the package, the next sheet is auto-lifted for you! ^___^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sheets are less like paper and more like a very thin stretchy material... imagine a cross between paper and a theraband? So that means (1) they aren&#x27;t like those wax-paper like Japanese blotting sheets (which didn&#x27;t work that great for me) and (2) there will be no accidental ripping (which I&#x27;ve had happen with Mary Kay paper like oil blotting sheets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you&#x27;ve never tried this kind, give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has oily skin and it worked so well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for 15 yrs, and they are an essential for me for my oily skin! My go-to for on the go days!</li>
    <li> Love how great it is for cheap price</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to suppress the shine.</li>
    <li> Honestly the beat deal I have had in a long time. These are almost the exact same as those you would get in the US but half the price!! The only difference is the blue is a little darker. Other then that they are the same! And I don&#x27;t know about where you live, but the shipping was quick! It didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought.</li>
    <li> Very similar to the US version, but a little thinner so they don&#x27;t absorb quite as much oil as 1 sheet of the US version. They are definitely a great bargain considering these are about $5 each.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin. This product can be used on faces without make-up or faces with make-up. Word of advice, though, if you use these wipes while wearing make-up &amp;#34;press&amp;#34; the sheet onto your, DO NOT drag it! It will smear your makeup and you will look weird (like I did one day).</li>
    <li> It has 10 more sheets per packet than US ones and this is totally a good deal. Some of other oil blotting papers are just too expensive, but not these!</li>
    <li> These are made in Japan and have a different texture (and darker blue color) from the ones sold in drugstores in the U.S. I find these to be harder to use - I have to press harder to make them absorb the oil on my face. Also, if you&#x27;re not careful, these can wipe some makeup off your face (the U.S. version is a lot better at not disturbing makeup). Overall, these still work as intended, just not quite as well. It&#x27;s nice that there are 60 sheets in each pack instead of 50, though.</li>
    <li> Works and good bang for the buck. (I paid $6)</li>
    <li> Love these&amp;#60;3333 went through numerous of different brands of oil sheets and it just didn&#x27;t collect enough of the oiliness outta my face or kept it matte all day long. I always go back to Clean and clear cause they never fail me. I was kinda hesitant to buy these but these work exactly the same as the ones you would buy at the drugstore. Their way cheaper. For one pack of these at the drugstore is the same price. Crazy. The only difference is the color of the sheets is a darker blue. Other than that, amazing !!!! Will repurchase agian and agian :)</li>
