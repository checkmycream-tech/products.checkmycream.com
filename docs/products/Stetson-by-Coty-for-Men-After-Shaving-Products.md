<li> It has a moderate scent that reminds me of aged wood or leather.  </li>
<li> As long as it is sold I will be a buyer.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it as long as I can remember!  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have the same scent of my previous bottle purchased in a store</li>
<li> I was actually nervous ordering this because it was about 75% less than I was used to paying at CVS.  </li>
<li> If you haven&#x27;t ever used Stetson the only way to describe it as a scent is humble.</li>
<li> If I controlled a small island such as the \\&quot;Catalinas\\&quot;I would probally ban it&#x27;s sales and usage too.</li>
<li> I HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THIS SIZE IN MY AREA</li>
<li> i have to have this in at least one form in the B.R. (preferrabley both)</li>
<li> It is really scary the way they just force themselves on me be very careful not to wear this at church.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Stetson!  </li>
<li> I think it smells like a stinky crap.</li>

    <li> If you haven&#x27;t ever used Stetson the only way to describe it as a scent is humble. It has a citrusy, flowery, but still masculine aroma. I began using Stetson when my grandfather passed away and someone gave me his old bottle. I got so many compliments I decided to start using aftershave all the time. Naturally as a younger teen I didn&#x27;t really need it, and I&#x27;m sure I applied too much. I liked it. I have tried lots of other brands, and they are all pretty good. If you, like me, don&#x27;t need an overpowering and bold smelling aftershave then Stetson will make you a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance, Very unique and underrated. I  got this a s a gift once, i then got hooked. Its not to sweet nor does it have that real strong cinammon-ish typ fragrance that others have.  i have to have this in at least one form in the B.R. (preferrabley both) The after-shave or the cologne, Nontetheless i cherish it very much!</li>

    <li> I like the scent of a real man. You should try this, if you are a macho man.</li>
    <li> Ordering through Amazonia is great, beats even Walmart prices.  I do not advise this product to 1%, you might smell like 99% of USA population.</li>

    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe what a deal this was!  Our local CVS no longer carries Stetson, my husband&#x27;s favorite, so as a last measure I checked out Amazon.  I was actually nervous ordering this because it was about 75% less than I was used to paying at CVS.  Well, let&#x27;s just say we&#x27;re never buying Stetson at CVS again!  LOL  This is the real thing, not a knock off, not discontinued, and smells like it should.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as both he and I love the fragrance.  This was a good price. Just love the scent.</li>
    <li> Ever since I got this and have been wearing it I have to fight off the ladies. It is really scary the way they just force themselves on me be very careful not to wear this at church.</li>
    <li> My father wears this and was pleased to receive this bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old school and this is one of my favs-the same product from the store so don&#x27;t hesitate.It Is shipped well-packed against breakage.</li>
    <li> This is the only after shave my husband uses and this was a great deal from start to finish!  Would recommend future purchases to anyone!</li>
    <li> I was looking for Stetson cologne for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  I priced it in the stores and it was a lot higher than what I found it on Amazon for.  It is the same stuff the stores sell, but for a lot better price</li>
    <li> I received it  quite fast and my brother was really happy with the gift.  It is one of his favorites.</li>
    <li> This is the only after shave that smells amazing and the only one I wear.  All the women love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The price is very competitive and Amazon delivers quickly. This the third time I&#x27;ve bought this from Amazon and will continue to do so. Thanks, Jim</li>
