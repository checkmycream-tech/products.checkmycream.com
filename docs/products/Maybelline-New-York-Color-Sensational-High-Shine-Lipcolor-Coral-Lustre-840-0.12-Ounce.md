      <li>a woman of color cocoa complexion and this color is outstanding on me</li>
      <li>love this lipstick</li>
      <li>I just love how it looks on me</li>
      <li>Slides on so easily, has a lot of sparkle to it, more orange to it than in the picture..</li>
      <li>My ideal lipstick would be a matte that lasted all day and was extremely moisturizing, but for this price I&#x27;m quite pleased with the quality.</li>
      <li>Be sure to google the color first to make sure it&#x27;s what you want.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like that with every cheap lipstick, it even happens with mac</li>
      <li>I love how this coral color gives me a fresh look.  </li>

      <li>Pretty color and arrived in 2 days :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived right on time, by the way!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s really hard for me to find the perfect coral lipstick</li>
      <li>Maybe I just have a saliva issue, but the bright color goes away literally after about ten minutes.</li>
      <li>It glides on beautifully, its a little sheer but still very noticeable, and just simply gorgeous!</li>
      <li>So far this is my favorite coral colored lipstick.</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels on too, its shiny and sparkly without feeling gritty at all.</li>
      <li>anyone know of a lipstick that actually stays on your lips for more than 15 minutes?</li>
      <li>This is a yummy color lipstick and I really do like it.  </li>
      <li>It is very sparkly.</li>
      <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>and it turns out I have plenty of cutting and accessories that shimmery lips are perfect for.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>though I was getting a light pink</li>
      <li>but after a few hours it smells better ..</li>
      <li>It goes on nudish on my very dark lips making them look a more natural color with the hint of orange.</li>
      <li>It is subtly moisturizing, though not as much as a nice gloss.</li>
      <li>Its natural looking.</li>

<li> It has a little bit of glitters but not enough to overpower the lip color and make you look like a disco ball.</li>
<li> only complaint is it came</li>
<li> But, if you are looking for a thick deep color lipstick.</li>
<li> I love the shine of this product its not too sparkly but just enough to make your lips feel less boring.</li>
<li> Giving your lips a little pop of color and shine?</li>
<li> I usually like matte lipsticks</li>
<li> a couple days late</li>
<li> It has a subtle sheen.</li>
<li> I wish they had never discontinued it in stores :(</li>

    <li> I love the color it&#x27;s not too orange the perfect coral color. It&#x27;s great for the summer to give your lips some color.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite lip color! I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a beautiful light coral color and this is it! It glides on beautifully, its a little sheer but still very noticeable, and just simply gorgeous! It has a little bit of glitters but not enough to overpower the lip color and make you look like a disco ball. lol I recommend it!</li>
    <li> My daughter just loves this brand and colour - please do not discontinue this colour!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color and I love it. Maybe I just have a saliva issue, but the bright color goes away literally after about ten minutes. But if you don&#x27;t mind reapplying it a lot, then it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Color, price, and the container all so perfect :-)&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely cheaper and I think this has the best quality of all Maybelline Lip products.&lt;br /&gt;It might just be me, but still  :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this I ordered the coral its my go to lipstick I just love how it looks on me only complaint is it came a couple days late</li>
    <li> She said it was great and just what she wanted, do they have more. We will keep an eye on more items</li>
    <li> Slides on so easily, has a lot of sparkle to it, more orange to it than in the picture.. but it is okay.</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth moisturizing lipstick. However the color is very sheer, also I didn&#x27;t know what color it was going to be because some of the product pictures were all different. The color is a nude coral color. It is very sparkly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it , it&#x27;s very strong 😖😖😖😖 but after a few hours it smells better ..maybe u will like it maybe ur not</li>
    <li> Color does not match what is portrayed. Came in a used lip, lipstick was not sealed and seemed to be used.</li>
    <li> amazing, perfect, just the right color</li>
    <li> Very nice product - love the color!</li>
    <li> Great price, great quality and lovely color!!! coral is my favorite! it seems to suit all skin types. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I love how this coral color gives me a fresh look.  It was bright but perfect against my medium skin tone.  Grab it while you can.</li>
    <li> good color and feel of it.</li>
    <li> One of the best coral lip sticks I&#x27;ve used.  Like the consistency too.  Not drying.  Will buy again and stop looking for coral.</li>
    <li> This is a yummy color lipstick and I really do like it.  But each time I put on it disapears within 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know of a lipstick that actually stays on your lips for more than 15 minutes?</li>
    <li> Be sure to google the color first to make sure it&#x27;s what you want. That&#x27;s what I did since the thumbnail used was one i saw used for a bunch of different colors.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice color that goes on well! I like it. Here&#x27;s a photo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived right on time, by the way!</li>
    <li> Great color for all skin types!!! I suggest using a chapstick before use, as it does fall into the lip cracks and looks cakey if not. Besides that I would recommend it for a great summer look</li>
    <li> love this lipstick im a woman of color cocoa complexion and this color is outstanding on me i get so many compliments i top it off with maybelline color sensation high shine lip gloss the 2 are excellent together.</li>
    <li> Pretty color and arrived in 2 days :)</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lipstick. She says the coral colar is beautiful. Price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be all shimmer but eventually I found the color I was looking for that I thought I would get when I bought this and it turns out I have plenty of cutting and accessories that shimmery lips are perfect for. Now I love this lipstick</li>
    <li> Was not the color portrayed in picture. I though I was getting a light pink but I got a bright reddish orange color.</li>
    <li> So far this is my favorite coral colored lipstick. It goes on nudish on my very dark lips making them look a more natural color with the hint of orange. I love the shine of this product its not too sparkly but just enough to make your lips feel less boring. I love the way it feels on too, its shiny and sparkly without feeling gritty at all. Its pretty moisturizing and this line has pretty good staying power and leaves a hint of color after the lipsticky/glossy feeling is gone</li>
    <li> I was looking for a subtle, classic coral and this is it. It does not reflect the stock photo so I looked up the product title online and it does reflect the images I found. It is subtly moisturizing, though not as much as a nice gloss. Used with a gloss, the two are quite moisturizing. It has a subtle sheen. I find it lasts about two hours. My ideal lipstick would be a matte that lasted all day and was extremely moisturizing, but for this price I&#x27;m quite pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!  Its natural looking. Giving your lips a little pop of color and shine? Yet, it has to be&lt;br /&gt;applied often. But, if you are looking for a thick deep color lipstick. This one is not for you.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick!! I wish they had never discontinued it in stores :(</li>
    <li> I love this color for the summer and spring. I usually like matte lipsticks but this one was the perfect amount of shine for me and it goes so well with my olive skin color. I am middle eastern so it&#x27;s really hard for me to find the perfect coral lipstick but this one did the trick. I suggest putting Chapstick on before putting the lipstick (you should do that with all drug store brands) because it looks cakey and sits in the cracks of your lips, therefore making your lips look gross. It&#x27;s like that with every cheap lipstick, it even happens with mac (yes mac is expensive but is cheap quality), so don&#x27;t trip chocolate chip!</li>
