      <li>that is all I got, ok</li>
      <li>and I like it better.  </li>
      <li>one problem, my Grand Kids still want to know&lt;br /&gt;why</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>you cant even tell what its real purpose is, looks good in a bathroom people dont even look twice at it</li>
      <li>This is so easy to use and it looks just like a candle.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t let the kids light the wick.</li>
      <li>It not only protects my dentures but also is a great place to hide valuables when at hotels.</li>
      <li>It holds the teeth very well and screws on and off easily.</li>
      <li>And for forgetful me, the title is perfect, I don&#x27;t have wonder every morning where I put my dentures last night.</li>
      <li>This is nice and does what it was needed to do...hide a private thing that some people need to do.</li>
      <li>I used this product  yesterday for the first time</li>
      <li>It REALLY LOOKS LIKE A CANDLE!  </li>
      <li>It looks just like a real candle!</li>
      <li>It has a nice dental holder inside that is attached to the cover and as you unscrew and remove the cover the holder lowers down and raises up when the cover is replaced.</li>
      <li>I thought it would look like a more realistic candle, but it is very obvious that it is not a candle.</li>
      <li>Very clever design.</li>
      <li>I now can leave this cleaning system out on the bathroom counter since it looks like a candle which makes it very convenient for usage.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend the product and seller!</li>
      <li>Its very well made and it arrived promptly.</li>
      <li>I soaked the dentures overnight and was ready to go in the morning.  </li>
      <li>Beats the alternative of the regular baths but just a lil cheap looking.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t look like a candle to me.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>Looks like a candle sitting on the counter instead of some old grandma&#x27;s tooth cup!!</li>
      <li>As a new denture wearer, I needed a place to store and&lt;br /&gt;hide</li>
      <li>It has ample room inside for a full set of dentures or a partial like I have.</li>
      <li>Beats the old cups we used to use.</li>
      <li>I purchased this dentalvault early while waiting for my dentures to be made.  </li>
      <li>It tightens firmly and is pretty much leakproof.</li>
      <li>If no one picks it up and messes with it, they shouldnt know, but otherwise, it&#x27;s obviously not a candle and doesnt seal hardly at all, sometimes I can just lift the top and it come off.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking for something to clean my dentures,some were too small for both dentures&lt;</li>
      <li>Shipping takes a little longer but it is worth the wait.</li>
      <li>My husband needed to replace an old one in a different style.</li>
      <li>The top doesnt screw on as tight as it should go on, not sure if I got a dud or if it&#x27;s meant to be that way, but when you go to tighten it is slips off the grooves, and opens up on you.</li>

<li> Get one of these if you have false teeth.  </li>
<li> I took out the useless basket</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nobody knows where we keep our dentures. Beats the old cups we used to use.</li>
    <li> I am grateful that someone created an attractive storage container for dental appliances. It is so nice to have an attractive container on the bathroom counter top  since I have an eye for decorating.</li>
    <li> The Dental Appliance Storage system has truly allowed to have the privacy and storage system I can use everyday in my bathroom.  I now can leave this cleaning system out on the bathroom counter since it looks like a candle which makes it very convenient for usage.  I would recommend this storage cleaning system to all users that have appliances.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something to clean my dentures,some were too small for both dentures&lt;br /&gt;then I found Dentalvault it does all I needed and is a nice addition on my dresser.I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is my SECOND denture vault, being purchased ONLY because of my getting a SECOND pair of dentures!  It REALLY LOOKS LIKE A CANDLE!  The item is well made, but I snapped out the denture \\&quot;rack\\&quot; as I prefer to soak mine.  For those folks wanting a discrete way of storing their dentures, THIS is truly IT!&lt;br /&gt;The vault would also be a great way to house one&#x27;s \\&quot;daily\\&quot; jewelry in an out-of-sight way!  I just MAY have to return to purchase a THIRD!</li>
    <li> I think the biggest risk is that someone, if not warned, might actually try and light the fake wick thinking it is a candle. It looks just like a real candle! It has a nice dental holder inside that is attached to the cover and as you unscrew and remove the cover the holder lowers down and raises up when the cover is replaced. It has ample room inside for a full set of dentures or a partial like I have. Some other reviewer had a problem tightening the cover but I don&#x27;t. It tightens firmly and is pretty much leakproof. So if your looking for a more pleasant and discreet way to store/clean your dentures I would highly recommend this item. Shipping takes a little longer but it is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> very nice and roomy, attractive..i would buy them again and recomend to friends and family..that is all I got, ok</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and it looks just like a candle. Can&#x27;t tell it holds dentures. Its very well made and it arrived promptly. If your looking for a nice looking product for your dentures this is it. I highly recommend the product and seller!</li>
    <li> No problems with the seller, got product as promised. The top doesnt screw on as tight as it should go on, not sure if I got a dud or if it&#x27;s meant to be that way, but when you go to tighten it is slips off the grooves, and opens up on you. I thought it would look like a more realistic candle, but it is very obvious that it is not a candle. If no one picks it up and messes with it, they shouldnt know, but otherwise, it&#x27;s obviously not a candle and doesnt seal hardly at all, sometimes I can just lift the top and it come off.  I know people who will go into other people bathrooms, and they will sniff candles, if someone picked this up and they fell out, Id be mortified! Beats the alternative of the regular baths but just a lil cheap looking.</li>
    <li> Get one of these if you have false teeth.  You can hide those ugly things in full sight.  And the &amp;#34;candle&amp;#34; is a great touch to the top of my bathroom Vanity.  Just don&#x27;t let the kids light the wick.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dentalvault early while waiting for my dentures to be made.  I used this product  yesterday for the first time and I love it.  I soaked the dentures overnight and was ready to go in the morning.  I love the fact that no matter where it sits, it looks nice and no one but me knows whats inside!</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t look like a candle to me.  The wick is not real enough looking to fool anyone.  I took out the useless basket and I like it better.  I will admit though, it looks better on my bathroom counter than that awful denture cup.</li>
    <li> My husband needed to replace an old one in a different style. He quite likes this one and says also that it travels well.</li>
    <li> This is nice and does what it was needed to do...hide a private thing that some people need to do. Very clever design.</li>
    <li> Love these for keeping dentures. They are out of sight and out of mind. Anyone who sees it, just thinks it is another candle decorating the vanity.</li>
    <li> This product is great for soaking your dentures. I only have one problem with it.  I have a large set of dentures and the holder seems a bit small for them. If inlarged just a 1/4 inch it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I use my Denturevault vault constantly. It is indespensable at home and on the road. It not only protects my dentures but also is a great place to hide valuables when at hotels. It has an attractive shape and decorative appearance, and looks as though it holds anything but dentures. And for forgetful me, the title is perfect, I don&#x27;t have wonder every morning where I put my dentures last night. I know it is in my denture vault. Get one for home and one for the road.</li>
    <li> As a new denture wearer, I needed a place to store and&lt;br /&gt;hide my dentures at night, and not in a glass.&lt;br /&gt;Dentalvault, BOOM, just fits the bill on both counts.&lt;br /&gt;Only one problem, my Grand Kids still want to know&lt;br /&gt;why I never light the candle.</li>
    <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t look like a denture holder!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Looks good on the counter.</li>
    <li> Looks like a candle sitting on the counter instead of some old grandma&#x27;s tooth cup!! Love it! The basket was a little hard to work with but I just removed that and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
    <li> you cant even tell what its real purpose is, looks good in a bathroom people dont even look twice at it</li>
    <li> Looks great on the vanity and covers the fact of soaking.</li>
    <li> This candle holder looks very nice on the bathroom counter. It holds the teeth very well and screws on and off easily.</li>
    <li> It was a wonderful purchase and came very quickly! It is used every day and works like a charm.  Am very happy with the purchase.</li>
