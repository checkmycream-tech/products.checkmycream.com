### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very impressive product for any price.</li>
      <li>best product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>But if you are on a budget like I am in college, this is a perfect buy.</li>
      <li>Very happy with product.</li>
      <li>Excellent!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>and it works great.</li>
      <li>Also, it is cruelty-free and very cheap!  </li>
      <li>It also smells much better than this stuff!</li>
      <li>Pleasant fragrance, easy to apply.</li>
      <li>this is the best buy I have used in a long time, great for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I am also very sensitive to scents, so the light, almost nonexistance, scent of this leave-in is perfect.</li>
      <li>It smells much, much better.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>I picked this up from Whole foods, and for $8, I was happy to give it a try.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s okay, but I prefer my Pureology Hydrate Shine Max.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel so smooth!</li>
      <li>Well yes I do love this product.</li>
      <li>love love love.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This makes it easy to comb through and it helps it look healthier.</li>
      <li>Easily made greasy.</li>
      <li>I have never written a review on a product, but this is one I feel strongly about.</li>
      <li>This is not weightless and doesn&#x27;t blend into fine hair well.</li>
      <li>I had been using Kerastase Oleo Curl cream but was looking to replace it with something more affordable when, luckily, I stumbled onto the 2 Chic line.</li>
      <li>I wash my hair put this product on my damp hair and when I go to flat iron it looks beautiful.</li>
      <li>but this, in addition to it, makes a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Great item, will not go back to John Freida,it may have an oily smell...</li>
      <li>for a silky smooth head of hair, use this.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get this one, get the light spray.</li>
      <li>I use this as my pretreatment for my flat iron and works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are products such as Kerastase that are amazing, that I haven&#x27;t even tried yet.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I&#x27;ll preface this with saying if you have ethnic hair or extremely frizzy CURLY hair, you will love this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the argan oil really helps sooth curls and frizz.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>its not a bad product for your hair if you can deal with the smell.</li>
      <li>I run this serum through the lengths of my hair when it&#x27;s still damp and magically my hair is tangle free, not weighed down at all, and smelling quite nice.</li>
      <li>I was disapointed, and purchased the super potion instead.</li>
      <li>I purchase this product in error, and decided to try it to see if it worked like the Giovanni Cosmetics 2chic Ultra-Sleek Hair &amp; Body Super Potion Brazilian Keratin &amp; Argan Oi, which is what I thought I bought.  </li>
      <li>I find Giovanni products pretty good overall, sometimes hit and miss</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this product, my daughters do, but both have had very positive results with this product so we will continue to buy.</li>
      <li>I really do see a value in this product for ethnic or very curly haired girls (the weight of it will smooth your curls and make them lay nicer) but for girls with fine hair, steer clear of this one.</li>
      <li>have actually had really great luck with using the related Giovanni 2chic Conditioner product on their hair as a leave-in treatment instead, so you may want to give that a try first and see if you can get dual use out of it rather than buying a separate product.  </li>
      <li>I have fine wavy dry hair and this stuff is great when I blow dry it straight.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I am totally in love with both this leave in conditioner and the 2chic Brazilian Keratin &amp; Argan Oil shampoo in the same colored bottle.</li>
      <li>This does a great job of taming my frizzy hair on humid days, as long as I use enough.</li>
      <li>soft and comfortable finish -</li>
      <li>When I first started using this product, I had dyed hair and it really helped bring it back to life and now that I have grown and cut the color out, Giovanni&#x27;s leave-in conditioner conitues to keep my hair looking and feeling healthy.</li>
      <li>First, the pump dispenses WAAAAY too much product.</li>
      <li>My stylist is able to make it look smooth pretty easily, but after trying a bunch of expensive products that weren&#x27;t doing exactly what I wanted without layering 4 and 5 of them in, I took a chance on this.</li>
      <li>I like this product but might not be best for curls as weighed hair down a little</li>
      <li>I on the other hand have very fine, silky, bleached hair</li>
      <li>This definitely is not a winner for fine textured hair.</li>
      <li>It made my hair very soft...like a pillow.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really that fond of it for that reason.</li>
      <li>My hair seems stronger and so much in my brush.</li>
      <li>I found that it took a lot to really get it worked into their hair to a point where it was smoothing the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would rather something be healthy and show results, rather than knock it down because of scent.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My hair feels naturally soft, healthy, and not weighed down.</li>
      <li>I lost my last one and bought it again right away.</li>
      <li>A fine product, at least worth a try.</li>
      <li>The elixir makes my hair SUPER soft and shiny, and that is saying something because I have very dry very frizzy curls that require a lot of maintenance.</li>
      <li>Also made my hair soft!</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m a guy with a short hair on the sides and a little longer on top.</li>
      <li>I ended up looking like a complete greaseball.</li>
      <li>Also I have sensitive skin and this does not cause breakouts.</li>
      <li>I bought this product at a natural food store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using John Freida Frizz Serum since I was 14yrs old, I&#x27;m now 31yrs old.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and no flyaways.  </li>
      <li>its not heavy or oily.  </li>
      <li>This reminds me of the early versions of texturizing paste before they had the technology to make them weightless.</li>
      <li>After wiping some off on a towel I proceeded to add this to the ends of my freshly washed wet hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is very long, dry and fine, but I have a lot of it</li>
      <li>So this was a big change for me, after using the product my hair is more tame</li>
      <li>Someone with more coarse, curly hair this might not be heavy enough.</li>
      <li>But after using it several times, I found that it did not work on my hair like the other super potion did.  </li>
      <li>I flat iron my hair about 4 times a week and try to do less since my hair is so fragile, but using this my hair seems to be improving even with daily flat ironing (currently on vacation, want my hair to look good.)</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d rather have a natural scent instead of a fragrance especially if its natural.</li>
      <li>I use three pumps of this and sometimes a pump of the Pureology mixed in and my hair is soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I have super thick hair.</li>

<li> Smoothes down hair without weighing it down at all.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t get this one, get the light spray. This one drags down your hair. It&#x27;s a mistake to buy this one. Just saying.</li>
    <li> I had been using Kerastase Oleo Curl cream but was looking to replace it with something more affordable when, luckily, I stumbled onto the 2 Chic line. The elixir makes my hair SUPER soft and shiny, and that is saying something because I have very dry very frizzy curls that require a lot of maintenance. I can recommend this for curly girls without reservation.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Been using it for about a year, and can&#x60;t find it locally anymore. So Amazon is my go to place! My hair seems stronger and so much in my brush. I use this as my pretreatment for my flat iron and works great. Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> My hair is bleached and I have some areas that are very dry and fragile. It tends to look stiff and like hay. My stylist is able to make it look smooth pretty easily, but after trying a bunch of expensive products that weren&#x27;t doing exactly what I wanted without layering 4 and 5 of them in, I took a chance on this. I have the potion too, it&#x27;s okay, but I prefer my Pureology Hydrate Shine Max. I use three pumps of this and sometimes a pump of the Pureology mixed in and my hair is soft and silky. I flat iron my hair about 4 times a week and try to do less since my hair is so fragile, but using this my hair seems to be improving even with daily flat ironing (currently on vacation, want my hair to look good.) I find Giovanni products pretty good overall, sometimes hit and miss but this was a definite hit for me. For reference my hair is naturally mostly straight, finer texture but thick overall and bleached. Easily made greasy. Someone with more coarse, curly hair this might not be heavy enough.</li>
    <li> this is the best buy I have used in a long time, great for my fine hair. I wash my hair put this product on my damp hair and when I go to flat iron it looks beautiful. love love love. best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot....I did mean to order the spray for the flat iron but this works as well.  Came in a timely manner and I would do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> I have fine wavy dry hair and this stuff is great when I blow dry it straight.  My hair is soft and no flyaways.  I also use Moroccan oil but this, in addition to it, makes a huge difference.  Also, it is cruelty-free and very cheap!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review on a product, but this is one I feel strongly about. I am always reading reviews and appreciate solid feedback, so here goes: I picked this up from Whole foods, and for $8, I was happy to give it a try. It definitely smoothes and gives weightless condition to the hair. My hair feels naturally soft, healthy, and not weighed down. My hair is thoroughly highlighted, and this brings my hair back to life. I&#x27;m sure there are products such as Kerastase that are amazing, that I haven&#x27;t even tried yet. But if you are on a budget like I am in college, this is a perfect buy. I will say that &amp;#34;funny smell&amp;#34; is spot on. I&#x27;m not sure what the smell even reminds me of, but it distinctly smells a bit weird. But once on your hair, and after it has air dried or blow-dried, there is no trace of the smell. So I find that harmless. I would rather something be healthy and show results, rather than knock it down because of scent. So, there it is! A fine product, at least worth a try. Its a staple for me now.</li>
    <li> total miracle product! Smoothes down hair without weighing it down at all. A total winner. My hair looks like something from shampoo ad.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product, my daughters do, but both have had very positive results with this product so we will continue to buy. I also appreciate that the bottle was shrink wrapped to avoid spillage. I have had some negative experiences with other hair product shippers so definitely appreciate of this vendor for going the extra mile to ensure the product came tightly sealed, no spillage.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so smooth! I lost my last one and bought it again right away.</li>
    <li> for a silky smooth head of hair, use this.  its not heavy or oily.  soft and comfortable finish - and i&#x27;m a guy with a short hair on the sides and a little longer on top.</li>
    <li> People always say my hair looks shiny when I use this! I like how detangled it feels. I use this every time I wash my hair. I put about seven squirts into my palm and then rub it in. I have super thick hair. This makes it easy to comb through and it helps it look healthier. I always buy this and never want to run out!</li>
    <li> I purchase this product in error, and decided to try it to see if it worked like the Giovanni Cosmetics 2chic Ultra-Sleek Hair &amp; Body Super Potion Brazilian Keratin &amp; Argan Oi, which is what I thought I bought.  But after using it several times, I found that it did not work on my hair like the other super potion did.  I was disapointed, and purchased the super potion instead.</li>
    <li> This does a great job of taming my frizzy hair on humid days, as long as I use enough. At least 4 pumps for my shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a natural food store. I&#x27;ve been using John Freida Frizz Serum since I was 14yrs old, I&#x27;m now 31yrs old. So this was a big change for me, after using the product my hair is more tame and I don&#x27;t have to use half a bottle of shampoo to wash it out, since its not overloaded with heavy chemicals and other junk the other prouct has. Great item, will not go back to John Freida,it may have an oily smell...but I&#x27;d rather have a natural scent instead of a fragrance especially if its natural.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I&#x27;ll preface this with saying if you have ethnic hair or extremely frizzy CURLY hair, you will love this. I on the other hand have very fine, silky, bleached hair and I was looking for something to grab at the store to replace my morrocan oil smoother to add shine and silkiness after blow drying. This definitely is not a winner for fine textured hair. First, the pump dispenses WAAAAY too much product. My hand was covered in product with one pump. After wiping some off on a towel I proceeded to add this to the ends of my freshly washed wet hair. Disaster doesn&#x27;t even begin to explain what this did to my hair. I ended up looking like a complete greaseball. My ends are so greasy i can &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; them into various shapes. This reminds me of the early versions of texturizing paste before they had the technology to make them weightless. This is not weightless and doesn&#x27;t blend into fine hair well. I ended up with the greasiest grossest hair i&#x27;ve ever had. It looks like i haven&#x27;t washed it in months. I really do see a value in this product for ethnic or very curly haired girls (the weight of it will smooth your curls and make them lay nicer) but for girls with fine hair, steer clear of this one.</li>
    <li> Well yes I do love this product. (: It made my hair very soft...like a pillow. It took a while to get to my house though. /:</li>
    <li> I like this product but might not be best for curls as weighed hair down a little</li>
    <li> I tried this serum on my girls&#x27; hair, which is thin and silky but very curly.  It was okay but had a weird, stinky scent and it is also rather thin- I found that it took a lot to really get it worked into their hair to a point where it was smoothing the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually had really great luck with using the related Giovanni 2chic Conditioner product on their hair as a leave-in treatment instead, so you may want to give that a try first and see if you can get dual use out of it rather than buying a separate product.  It also smells much better than this stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Also made my hair soft!</li>
    <li> its not a bad product for your hair if you can deal with the smell. I wasn&#x27;t really that fond of it for that reason.</li>
    <li> My hair is very long, dry and fine, but I have a lot of it so it tends to turn into a rat&#x27;s nest if you just look at it sideways. That&#x27;s why I am totally in love with both this leave in conditioner and the 2chic Brazilian Keratin &amp; Argan Oil shampoo in the same colored bottle. I run this serum through the lengths of my hair when it&#x27;s still damp and magically my hair is tangle free, not weighed down at all, and smelling quite nice. I have even used this on my ends when my hair is dry for a little extra somethin&#x27; somethin&#x27; and it works great. It&#x27;s a very impressive product for any price.</li>
    <li> De-frizzes and de-puffs without being heavy or sticky. Also I have sensitive skin and this does not cause breakouts. Great product!</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner after I wash my hair. Pleasant fragrance, easy to apply. It is a lotion type of stay on conditioner.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my thin hair (maybe because I have a lot), but I can&#x27;t get over the smell. It reminds me of a porta-potty! If you do get an elixir from Giovanni, get the Ultra-Moist one! It smells much, much better. The URL for the Ultra-Moist elixir is down below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(http://www.amazon.com/Giovanni-Avocado-Ultra-Moist-Conditioning-Styling/dp/B009V0Z8MA)</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for well over a year now and just now had to replace the bottle! My hair is very thick, though the strands are relatively thin. I have tried over 30 different leave-in conditioners along with other moisture and curl de-frizzing products and treatments without half the result of this single product. I am also very sensitive to scents, so the light, almost nonexistance, scent of this leave-in is perfect. When I first started using this product, I had dyed hair and it really helped bring it back to life and now that I have grown and cut the color out, Giovanni&#x27;s leave-in conditioner conitues to keep my hair looking and feeling healthy. I&#x27;m sure the argan oil really helps sooth curls and frizz. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
