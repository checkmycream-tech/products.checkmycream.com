      <li>Bottle is unstable, falls over frequently and does not empty completely.</li>

    <li> Pert has proven to be the best shampoo/conditioner for my hair.  But it can be a bit hard to find around here so I was pleased to find I could get it on Amazon using Prime shipping.  A pack of four bottle lasts me 4-5 months and when I get down to the last half a bottle I can just pick up another batch.</li>
    <li> Less than $ 4 a bottle at walmart. Educate yourself</li>
    <li> I love Pert Plus shampoo, and have been a user since I was old enough to bathe myself.  No other shampoo seems to leave my hair as oil free and clean as Pert.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried others, I&#x27;ve even tried body wash in my hair.  But only Pert does the job.  I&#x27;ve noticed they have changed their bottles recently.  What used to say \\&quot;regular hair\\&quot; on the bottle now says \\&quot;happy medium\\&quot;.  Different packaging, same quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This listed price on Amazon comes out to about 8.00 dollars a bottle.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve seen it cheaper than this.  So unless your a shut-in that&#x27;s in desperate need of clean hair, you shoud be able to find this at Costco or Wal-Mart for cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say.  Good shampoo, if you&#x27;ve never used it, try it.  Period.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewer who didn&#x27;t think the smell was as nice as we remember. . .there&#x27;s something a bit &amp;#34;dirty mopwater&amp;#34; about it.  I&#x27;ll find a way to use it, but the truth is, I wouldn&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> Pert was acquired by a new company.  Since then, the formula has changed and the product smells bad to me.  It still works fine to quickly clean and condition the hair.  I am looking for a new shampoo/conditioner now.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is hard to find in Corpus Christi, Texas.. Bottle is unstable, falls over frequently and does not empty completely.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVESSSS this product. Cant find it everywhere so when I found I could purchase on Amazon.com, then I sure did and was glad I did so. No complaints, price was pretty good too. I would recommend and it has a pleasant smell and it makes the hair look so nice and gives it a lot of body and shine. Hubby is happy, so I am too.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pert Plus for years and love the way it combines a shampoo and conditioner into one product. When using, leave it in your hair for a few minutes--as you would a conditioner--to realize the maximum benefit.</li>
    <li> Huge price gouging on this item. Walmart sells the same bottle for $3.97 so 4 bottles as advertised here would be only $15.88.</li>
    <li> I grew up with this shampoo and it does everything! No need for any more separate conditioners or more shampoo because all of it comes in one lasting my family and I (there&#x27;s ten of us) two months per bottle! I switched to tresemme because pert was no longer found anywhere! And when I did find it again, OHH BOY. It was expensive! Since amazon gave me a great price, I&#x27;m stocking up!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as guaranteed. We love the smell of Pert and being on the mission field, we are glad to have such a great product here.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo, I&#x27;ve used it for years. The reason for low rating is, since I haven&#x27;t personally bought this product in a while, I didn&#x27;t realize that this vendor was charging twice what the local retailer was charging. Therefore, I love the product, not so much the vendor.</li>
    <li> Pert Plus is great because it doesn&#x27;t leave a scent on you after the fact.  This is great for us guys who don&#x27;t like smelling like flowers.  If you do smell afterwards it&#x27;s a mild smell and just smells like soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used for years and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Pert Shampoo for thye fact that it not only keeps my hair clean but helps me keep it under control.  Also, I love the gray-white sheen it imparts to my hair.  I ain&#x27;t young, and I&#x27;ve earned my white hair, junior.  I&#x27;m proud of it, too.</li>
    <li> This is my teen age son&#x27;s favorite shampoo.  His friends use this brand also.  They love the bounce and control that it gives their hair.  Who knew?</li>
    <li> I grew up using this shampoo. It was exactly what I asked for from the company and satisfies my needs at a great price.</li>
