      <li>A light floral, a hint of musk.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is fabulous.</li>
      <li>But I like sweet and strong perfumes.</li>
      <li>I got this as a sample originally and once applied</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and feminine without being too sweet or floral, with just a hint of musk.</li>
      <li>I kept thinking how unique</li>

      <li>Not too sweet.  </li>
      <li>A super sweet, feminine smell.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>The scent is just right -- a balance of flowery and spicy.</li>
      <li>Got it right away</li>
      <li>It is my absolute favorite new Eau de parfum for the year.  </li>
      <li>Funny thing, he was wearing Giorgio Armani for men.  </li>
      <li>SWEEEEEEEEET Very SWEEEEEEEET!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first perfume</li>
      <li>This is a first for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s sweet, floral, a bit musky and completely mysterious.</li>
      <li>A younger classy professional could also pull this off nicely.</li>
      <li>Wow!!!</li>
      <li>I mean, he loved it.  </li>
      <li>Just like purchasing brand new in store without the drive!</li>
      <li>Price to high</li>
      <li>Those that make me feel sexy, fresh and just a little bit mysterious.</li>
      <li>I say it in every review of perfumes I decide on using on the long run, I only wear perfumes that make me want to make love to myself.</li>
      <li>I think I have a new signature scent.</li>
      <li>Very soft fragrance.</li>
      <li>and you get the exact same product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s feminine &amp; sophisticated yet warm..very hard for me to describe.</li>
      <li>At this point, my nose was so over smelling everything, even with sniffing the coffee beans they give you to clear your nostrals, and I was not 100%</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend locating some samples and trying the fragrance out and how it mixes with your natural body chemistry.</li>
      <li>It can be worn everyday if wanted, but also on special occasions.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and subtle, not too sweet or flowery</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this fragrance! I think I have a new signature scent.</li>
    <li> This is literally the best fragrance that I&#x27;ve ever put on my body. Before, I wore Chanel Allure. I&#x27;d worn that fragrance for about 20 years and then I smelt S&amp;iacute;. I couldn&#x27;t bring my nose away from my wrist the entire time I was in the mall.</li>
    <li> I smelt this in a magazine and had to have it. It is my absolute favorite new Eau de parfum for the year.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on the scent.  It&#x27;s fresh but has a hint of cinnamon in it&#x27;s base notes.  Also, slightly woodsy or musk(just a hint).  It&#x27;s not floral at all so if you tend to like that in a parfum then this may not be for you.  I know it&#x27;s on the expensive side, however, you can&#x27;t go wrong choosing this one.... exquisite.  All I can sum up with is I feel beautiful when I wear it!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow!!! SWEEEEEEEEET Very SWEEEEEEEET! But nice.</li>
    <li> This has one of the most delectable scents ever. Only, I give it 4 instead 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as it should.</li>
    <li> Perfect as expected!  Just like purchasing brand new in store without the drive!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. Not one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> price was right received on time.wife liked it, I like it on her too , win win !!</li>
    <li> Price to high but my wife like the perfume</li>
    <li> This perfume is so wonderful. The scent is just right -- a balance of flowery and spicy. I wear it all the time</li>
    <li> OK, this perfume is absolutely amazing!  I like to read reviews whenever making a purchase so I thought others would appreciate my take on this amazing scent.  I went to Ulta and literally tried almost every woman&#x27;s scent, some on my skin, then when I ran out of skin, I started using those strips of paper for spraying fragrance.  I did not want something everyone else wears (insert Coco Madamosielle here) and I wanted to veer away from my usual spicy oriental.  I did not want something too floral nor too musky.  Not too sweet.  Well, I made it over to the Si display and tried it on the paper and thought, I like this.  At this point, my nose was so over smelling everything, even with sniffing the coffee beans they give you to clear your nostrals, and I was not 100% sure I did not make the choice out of just wanting to pick something and be done with it.  WELL, let me tell you, when I put this perfume on before a date last night, I was intoxicated!  It is perfect in every way and did not fall into any of the aforementioned categories that I was trying to avoid.  And my date- well, he just loved it as well.  I mean, he loved it.  Funny thing, he was wearing Giorgio Armani for men.  I honestly don&#x27;t know who smelled better but we were both loving Armani!  Try it- you will not be disappointed.  I honesly cannot understand how anyone would not LOVE this perfume.  I hope my review helped!  :-)</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  I love it</li>
    <li> This is the only fragrance that I can honestly say could be my signature fragrance.  I have received compliments every time I have worn it.  This is a first for me.</li>
    <li> Very soft fragrance. Good value.</li>
    <li> This perfume last all day long. A little goes a very long way!</li>
    <li> I say it in every review of perfumes I decide on using on the long run, I only wear perfumes that make me want to make love to myself. Those that make me feel sexy, fresh and just a little bit mysterious. Perfumes that people notice, and that I get compliments on. This is one of those perfumes. It&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s sweet, floral, a bit musky and completely mysterious. This is the first Armani I own and absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful fragrance. It&#x27;s light and feminine without being too sweet or floral, with just a hint of musk. My new favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and I get compliments every I go.</li>
    <li> What a beautiful scent. I love perfume and this is one of my new favorites. I get compliments and that makes it so much better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. It smells great on my skin, and it does stay on me all day. That might not be the case for everyone, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample originally and once applied I kept thinking how unique (I had other samples on my arms too)! It&#x27;s feminine &amp; sophisticated yet warm..very hard for me to describe. I own nothing similar. I think this scent is good for fall/winter but could probably be worn all year-like a signature scent. I purchased because the scent truly appealed to my senses and I ❤️ it! I&#x27;ve rcvd more compliments from men then women so maybe it triggers something for them😉. Age range for this product: mid/late 30s- 50&#x27;s or so. A younger classy professional could also pull this off nicely. Staying power is also quite good w/o reapplication and I have oily skin. A+</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely amazing. I bought some from Macy&#x27;s after getting a sample from ULTA. It lasts all day and then some. I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments. It&#x27;s well worth the money.  I&#x27;d recommend locating some samples and trying the fragrance out and how it mixes with your natural body chemistry.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it...</li>
    <li> Always get compliments when I wear! Not &#x27;Fumy&#x27; or overpowering with a little of a grapefruit/citrus overtone.  Very Refreshing! The price on Amazon is WAY LESS than the retail store and you get the exact same product.</li>
    <li> Intoxicating fun scent. Not too sweet, just real beautiful notes.</li>
    <li> When I read the mix of scents this perfume had, I was intrigued with intensity of aroma. I must say this perfume has not been what I expected. The intensity and wear of aroma is weak. I disappointed because the cost of perfume is high.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft and subtle, not too sweet or flowery which Is a plus. Receive many compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is fabulous. A light floral, a hint of musk. Does not over-power. Very sexy. Yes, yes, yes!</li>
    <li> Great perfume I love it</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world  🌍</li>
    <li> My boyfriend purchased this for me for Valentine&#x27;s Day. It&#x27;s my first perfume and it&#x27;s BEAUTIFUL. It can be worn everyday if wanted, but also on special occasions. A super sweet, feminine smell. I&#x27;m in love with it. I got the bath gel to go with it and it&#x27;s wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!! It&#x27;s sweet. But I like sweet and strong perfumes. Five star to the perfume and the seller :)</li>
    <li> I love S&amp;iacute;, and am grateful to&lt;br /&gt;Buy it online. I received it two days after placing the order</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume!!  I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time for a signature fragrance and I finally found it!!</li>
    <li> Great perfume. Got it right away</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it came in a timely fashion.</li>
