<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am so impressed and happy with this product! I could tell a real positive difference after using the product for only a few days. I have very sensitive skin, but I had no reaction, it wasn&#x27;t greasy, and the smell was very light and fresh. A little really goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of trying this cellulite cream, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. I am already seeing a change in the backs of my legs!  I bought this product in part because it came in a pump bottle instead of a jar.  I don&#x27;t like putting my fingers in the cream and contaminating it.  This way you can dispense just what you need.  This is the best body firming cream I have found and happy I found it.  It is well priced, a good size and will last a while (I&#x27;m using it 2x a day)</li>
    <li> Bought ONE BODY CELLULITE CREAM for my girl friend.  She loves it.  Says she massages it in &amp; notices the difference!!  Loves the pump because she only uses what she needs.  NOT tested on ANIMALS, PARABEN FREE, MADE in U.S.A is a big plus for me!!  She says 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This was sent as a sample product for me to review.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easily absorbs into skin with dime-size amounts. I like the fact it is not too greasy or heavy on the skin throughout the day. This product could be used on any part of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This is s little pricey since it reminds me of Palmers Cocoa Butter lotion. It was a lighter version of Palmers (not as thick).  I did not like the coconut smell. I expected a better product due to the packaging. I&#x27;ve used Revitol in the past and prefer that brand over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is the first initial review I cannot make an accurate judgement as to if the product works to eliminate cellulitis.</li>
    <li> This cream is lightweight but effective.  One of the most important things for me with any kind of lotion is the smell (I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to fragrances).. and this has a very light scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using Powerful Body Firming Cellulite Cream for a few days now and do feel like my skin already looks a little firmer.  I appreciate the quality ingredients in this formula and that it is not tested on animals!  This is a gentle and non-greasy cream with a tropical scent.  I will be using this treatment cream as part of my bathing suit ready routine this summer!</li>
    <li> I bought this anti cellulite cream as a gift for my wife after she placed it on her Wish List of gifts. She absolutely loves the smell and its natural ingredients (shea butter, caffeine, antioxidants and algae extract). Although still very early she has already said that after a couple of weeks her skin looks and feels much firmer than compared with other cellulite creams she has used in the past, which are almost 5 x more expensive and do not include as many natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I got this item complimentary to review. I have not had a chance to use this product for a long time, but for the time I have used it, it seems like it really does help. It is a somewhat thick cream and stays put for a while so that it soaks in to your skin which is nice. The smell is not horrible, but I do wish it smelled a little better. My skin feels really soft and seems to be improving, which is really nice. The ingredients are great and I love the combination! I do love that it comes in a pump style bottle and it helps keep me from getting too much at once. I hate bottles that give you so much at once that you couldn&#x27;t begin to use it all. I also love that this lotion does not make your skin feel too oily or sticky for the rest of the day. This product is soaked up within a few minutes so I know by skin is actually using it like it is supposed too. It comes in a decent sized bottle that will last me quite a while. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loved this. She liked the smell and the cream was not greasy. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product to see if it really works. And thanks to karmas reviews i can since i get a sample. I have only used for a few days and it feels good. Its hard to get something that firms cellulite. I will write an additional review once i have used it for a few weeks to let you know if it really works. But so far ok</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and started noticing my thighs becoming saggy and wrinkled. I have always had a cellulite problem on my rear and back thighs and was looking for a solution. I am not overweight, I exercise and eat healthy and still cellulite !!  Then i started noticing my front legs becoming saggy and loose. Desperate for a solution I started surfing the net.  I ran across One Body firming creme and so far I have noticed my front thighs becoming more firm. I have only used it a few days. I am hoping the real trouble area in the back becomes less noticeable within time. I have been married for 28 years and still ashamed to walk around naked in front of my husband.  Here&#x27;s hoping for the best !</li>
    <li> A girlfriend of mine got some to share since we&#x27;ve never done this before. We felt the difference and took pictures to see the difference. YUP YUP! And it feel good! And it&#x27;s safe!! That&#x27;s very important to me but my friend will use anything that works! Lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past several weeks, and I have noticed smoother skin.  I&#x27;m ordering my next bottle!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 4 days. I know it will take more time to see results, but I love the bottle in which it came in and the smell is so fresh and amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to update this review in a month!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really believed in these products but I am now quite amazed with this one. I have put on weight this winter and my thighs are terrible with cellulite. I have been using the Anti Cellulite Cream for 10 days now and I really do see the difference they are firmer and less dimpling appearance to them. Thank you so much for a wonderful product that does what it says it will do. K.M</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review for One Body Cellulite Cream to let you know that I have only been using this for a few weeks, but I do see an improvement.  It has a nice scent &amp; goes on smoothly.  You can feel it begin to give your skin a nice firm feel.  The 4 star rating is only due to the time frame I have been using &amp; am looking forward to seeing greater results as time goes on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this twice a day per instructions for just under a week, and I&#x27;ve started to see some mild improvements. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, it&#x27;s low maintenance and effective :)</li>
    <li> It was incredible !!!! I&#x27;m sold on this product ..results started in about 4 days .. I drank lots of water and watched what I ate for maximum results .. it really does work !!! I&#x27;ve had 5 kids and hate the look of my skin.. Can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few months will bring . I&#x27;m so excited for my next order to arise ..Thank you so much.. Working on a goal so I will feel good about my trip to Hawaii in December . !!</li>
    <li> I like the scent and the ingredients show promise.  Only have used it for a week, but believe results are temporary, not cumulative so will continue using. Works best in conjunction with a firming lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream on a whim after my friend told me about it. I&#x27;m pretty active and workout, but I can&#x27;t get rid of the cellulite on my legs. It would be nice to go through one summer feeling really good in shorts and my swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt; I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the smell was really nice and it was super light when I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good - I&#x27;m seeing a noticeable difference, I think my skin actually looks firmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that this company is against animal testing. I&#x27;m vegetarian and it&#x27;s important for me to support companies that are cruelty free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money, it&#x27;s a big bottle, so you get some bang for your buck! I&#x27;d buy it again for sure!</li>
    <li> In preparation for summer I purchased One Body Skincare Anti Cellulite Cream and am so happy I did! I feel in love instantly, it absorbs into my skin so easily not leaving a greasy feeling but more importantly my skin feel’s firmer. I love this cream and I will be telling all my friends about it!</li>
    <li> Found the product to work. But it does need frequent application</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days now so it&#x27;s too soon to see any result. So far it only made the skin smoother, which is promising. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and it absorbs quickly. Update: after almost 3 weeks I can definitely say that It&#x27;s working for me. I have less cellulite, the skin is smoother and firmer and as I said before, the cream smells good. I will keep using it until I make this problem disappear completely. I tried a few other lotions and creams before but none had this effect. I was starting to believe that an effective anti cellulite cream was a myth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 12 days and my legs look really good! I work out and eat clean, but still had a some dimples on my inner thighs. After using this product my legs look much smoother! I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Since I am pretty lazy when it comes to exercising, I try to find anything that will help me look and feel better. So when I was offered this Anti Cellulite Cream from One Body Skincare for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I ordered one immediately. I love that it has a pump on it and that makes it easy to keep sanitary and clean. Other products that I have tried had a jar or container with a screw off lid that you had to open and scoop the cream out.  I also like the smell of this cream.  It isn&#x27;t strong, so you aren&#x27;t overwhelmed after application. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a great cellulite cream that really works to correct the flawed skin that we have.</li>
    <li> Weight going up and down for me and leaving behind a lot of cellulite, I hate my thighs they have always looked like cottage cheese gone bad and this is making me look better to myself.&lt;br /&gt;First this is great packing from the company but I like presentation but now the product. First and far most is the pump that comes with the product. I love that right after I dry off in the mornings and can place it right on to my thighs. Yes, It is working for me but I am a difficult case but a great candidate for Anti Cellulite Cream. I don’t know which combination is doing the job for me but I know it is working and my skin is getting silkier is that a word? Well I know if you are person who does not wish to have the cottage cheese thighs try this in the battle.&lt;br /&gt;Anti Cellulite Cream gave me this cream for free for my fair and honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months and although we know nothing will completely remove cellulite, this cream definitely makes the area smooth and cellulite less noticeable. :)</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference.  Not as much as I would like however I am aware there is no cure for cellulite.  I think if I am more diligent on applying the cream I may see better results.  I am going to order another bottle and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I have cellulite on my thighs.  After two days of using this product i can already tell a difference.  It is a very light weight cream that dries very quickly.  leaves the skin feeling very smooth.  Has a very light scent to it that smells good.  I am very happy with this product.  I received this cream to give my honest and unbiased opinon.</li>
    <li> I finally found a Cellulite Cream that works and is affordable!!  As soon as I got it, I put some on &amp; did so every day.  Now, my cellulite is not that bad, just a little behind my legs, and it&#x27;s ALMOST GONE now, I can&#x27;t believe it!!  My skin also feels tighter.  The cream is really nice and light too, and I like that.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  I did receive this product on a promotion for my unbiased opinion, and completely stand by that.  I really love how they use all natural ingredients. Also they have 100% full refund guarantee, if you aren&#x27;t completely satisfied within a month.  So, you have nothing to lose, that&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> My wife bought this with my account, but I do have some feedback to relay.  She likes the smell (almost like coconut) of the product and of course it feels nice on her skin.  It is also packaged nicely.  The bottle is pretty, and it was wrapped in plastic, so there was no fear of it leaking during shipping.  Additionally, she liked that the product is made in the USA, which makes her feel more confident in the ingredients.  She also likes the pump spout and is glad it doesn&#x27;t just come in a jar.  Again, it&#x27;s a nice product that&#x27;s working, doesn&#x27;t feel or smell medicinal, and feels like a premium lotion on her skin.  She&#x27;s happy, which means I&#x27;m Happy!</li>
    <li> First off, the bottle is much bigger than I thought it was going to be - it&#x27;s going to last a while, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;One Body&#x27;s USA manufacturing is important because I have a hard time trusting some of the other country&#x27;s standards - PLUS it contains natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Last, I really like the smell AND that it&#x27;s cruelty-free.</li>
    <li> Easily absorbed into skin with small amounts. I like the fact it is not too greasy or heavy.  The cream’s texture was light and it was very easy to apply.  I’m excited to see the results so far</li>
    <li> I just recieved this a few weeks ago and since then I have been using the Anti Cellulite Cream by One Body Skincare for the last several weeks and I am finally got the positive results that I was trying to get.for years. I definitely feel the elasticity of my skin feels firmer and not as saggy when I have applied it every day for the last week.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is nice and smooth and has a nice fragrance that smells like coconuts, it absorbs nicely with out and residue. I use it twice a day once in the morning and once before bed. I apply in circular motion like the directions state and I have noticed already tighter, firmer and smoother skin in my trouble ares. The cream is made of natural ingredients . algae extract, green coffee extract, and an advanced cocktail of antioxidants to reduce the dimpling, orange peel look affecting your legs, thighs, belly, and arms. I&#x27;m very impressed with this Anti Cellulite Cream - Best Treatment for Smoothing and Firming Skin with Caffeine and Shea Butter and I am excited for my future results as I continue applying twice a day. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have used a bunch of lotions claiming to reduce the appearance of cellulite, I decided to try this product with no great expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, its a nice size, I see this lasting me for about a month, I will apply twice per day on mostly my thighs and stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not have received this at better time, it is summer and yes I plan on wearing short shorts and bikinis and no, I don&#x27;t have time to do a million squats per day to reduce my cellulite, so like most women I was looking for an easy way out and I think I found it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied day and night for one day and my cellulites disappeared, yes I know because I take note of how my body looks everyday. I used the lighting in my bathroom that shows all my cellulites and I was amazed this morning when  the difference was visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being happy is an understatement, since I will be wearing short shorts this weekend, and I love to take pictures and yes cellulites shows in pictures,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be checking to see what the results are after I  stop using it, of course I will be doing some exercise in between, but I am extremely happy with the results so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Just used this cream for 3 weeks, and I can&#x27;t believe it! It&#x27;s works. I notice much less cellulite on my thighs and stomach. I use it in the morning and night every day.  It works very fast. I&#x27;m very happy with this cream, and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is good product, i like its smell and the soft and smooth effect it causes.</li>
    <li> Good on skin. Cellulite Effect hasn&#x27;t shown yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I received it the first week of August. So far my review is that, yes I am starting to notice a difference in the appearance of my cellulite....YAY!! I noticed on a few other reviews that some people didn&#x27;t like the smell of the cream, but I find it to be a nice, light, fresh smell. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone. I work out constantly and ever since I lost all my weight and can NOT seem to get rid of this nasty cellulite on my thighs.....UGH! Thanks to this cream I am really beginning to see a difference in the appearance! I know that it can NEVER go away, but if I can reduce the appearance of it then hey, I&#x27;m happy! Give it a try and stick with it twice a day, you will begin to see a difference!</li>
    <li> The cream goes on so smoothly and I can see the results! Makes my legs look more toned. Bottle amount inside lasts for a good amount of time. Received this very quickly. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This was a big disappointment and a waste of money</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture. I&#x27;ve used other cellulite creams before but with this one, I can feel that my skin tightens and knowing ingredients here, I know it will help me diminish my cellulite. I will leave another review after I&#x27;ve used complete bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Anti Cellulite Cream by One Body Skincare for about 3 weeks now, and I am very pleased with the results.  I don&#x27;t have cellulite on my legs or thighs, mine comes in the form of a strip of fat on my abdomen that will not go away.  This cream has a very faint scent that reminds me of baby powder, but it dissipates quickly and the formula actually absorbs into my skin super fast.  I use this every day after I get out of the shower and while there hasn&#x27;t been a miracle, my disgusting strip of fat is much firmer, and the lumpy and bumpy surface has actually began to smooth out and it appears to be much more refined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment is chock full of amazing ingredients that attack cellulite with a one-two punch.  I have tried several products that claim to do the same thing, but I never had any visible results.  With this cream, I can actually see and feel my skin texture has improved.  Even my husband noticed it and I didn&#x27;t tell him I was using anything.  So, to me, that is all the proof I need that this truly works.  I am so glad I was chosen to receive this sample, gratis, during the promotional launch, in exchange for my honest opinion and feedback after thoroughly using and testing.  I am very happy with the results and I would definitely recommend this to any woman who feels as if she needs a little help with her cellulite.</li>
    <li> Did see any difference. I guess if I used it for several months then I might but not risking spending that much money on a maybe.</li>
    <li> my wife love it, After I week of using this product I noticed a huge difference. This product does work. When caffeine is applied topically,</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and have heard nothing but thank you... thank you.. thank you. Good price for a great product! Looks like I will have to buy again...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days so I can&#x27;t really report on the end result yet but I can say that it softens my skin, isn&#x27;t the least bit greasy and I absolutely the the smell!  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but I can&#x27;t yet say what it will do for cellulite or skin tightening. As a matter of full disclosure, I am writing this review so I can receive a discount on future product. Mind you, I would care in the least about the discount if I didn&#x27;t like this product enough to buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> Been using for about a week and I notice a slight change.  I&#x27;m hopeful that with further use it will be even more. Great price for it!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. I&#x27;ve used it for one week and got a good result</li>
    <li> I am 6 weeks PP with my first child and feeling extremely bad about my body. When my husband and I first got married I had a great body and then I got pregnant and.... Yeah, stretch marks everywhere! I love my little boy to pieces but I hate my body :( so I started looking for &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; creams to help get rid of stretch marks and loose skin on my tummy and found this! Love love love it! Plus it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two weeks only and have not noticed a reduction in cellulite but my skin does feel tighter in my arms and thighs. This lotion is fast-absorbing and has almost no scent and can be used as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference yet. I&#x27;m trying to watch my diet and exercise but nothing so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks, too soon to tell if it is working.</li>
    <li> The product does not help me with my cellulite after 1 month regular used ( i have fist stage of cellulit , i see my cellulite but a little bit) .&lt;br /&gt;After used this i feel like glue on my legs&lt;br /&gt;But smell is fine  because i put 2 starts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, but I have noticed a difference in my skin.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The first thing you notice about this cellulite cream is the scent.  I love it.  It is a light coconut.  The lotion is light as well and non-greasy.  Absorbs really quickly.  I will not bother to list all the ingredients that make this product work.  Others have done that and I concur with their results.  This product is slowly but surely making a difference.  It has been a week since I used it my thighs and there is a change.  I see it and so does my daughter and husband say.  In fact, she thinks it is enough of a change that she wants a bottle for herself!  The fact that it is paraben-free is a huge bonus.  I was hesitant to get this product even though it was promotion for review purposes but I am glad I did.  To find a product that makes a difference in cellulite is wonderful.  I will update this review when the bottle is empty so I can reveal the final results.</li>
    <li> This is a nice thick formula and not scented which I like. It firms me up when applied. Not sure yet how it will help long term but so far I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Could tell a difference after a couple of weeks! Definitely will be buying more!!</li>
    <li> Sucks.... Smells nice and I like the texture ..... But let me tell you what is going to help with cellulite.... WATER, WORKING OUT AND MORE WATER .... Your welcome.</li>
    <li> THIS Cream Is okay. I know a cream can&#x27;t remove cellulite, a good diet and exercise maintain the skin elasticity wanted something to assist in smoothing my skin. You cannot often see results in a week, or two with any product. Can&#x27;t see any results yet. and don&#x27;t believe I will with this product</li>
    <li> Great results so far, the cellulite &amp;#34;shadows&amp;#34; on my legs are less noticeable and my skin feels really smooth in the areas where applied.  No greasy feeling at all and the cream has a very very light pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a little while, but so far I like it a lot! I do have sensitive skin, and this has not caused me any problems so that is even better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cellulite cream for less than a week and I am already noticing a difference! Every day in the shower I use a body brush on my legs to increase boys flow to the area,  then apply this cream afterwards.  I also apply the cream at night as recommended.  My skin feels tighter, smother and I definetly notice a decrease in cellulite.  This One Body cellulite cream smells great and applies nicely.  I would definetly recommend this to anyone looking to get rid of or decrease the appearance of cellulite,  because so far it seems to be working!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 and don&#x27;t have major problems but I do have some issues plus I&#x27;m overweight so I really wanted to give this cellulite cream and try. The bottle is a decent size and I love that it&#x27;s a pump which makes it much easier to get the right amount instead of getting too much and then wasting it. The smell is very nice not too strong yet you can tell it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on my legs and while it hasn&#x27;t been a dramatic change there has been a decent amount of change. My legs feel and look better then they did before. I would definitely recommend this Anti Cellulite Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good. Im happy!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 week and have not noticed a reduction of apperance of cellulite yet, I do like the sense and the fact that dries fast too fast actually that feels like I need to apply more because of how quick it gets absorb , my skin does feel tighter so Im hoping this will help to reduce the lumps, I dont have a lot of Cellulite but I just want it to be less visible, I have tried so many products even endermology with very little sucess, this other products have made my thighs thinner wich was not my intention, Im hoping that this product wont do that, I also exercise 3 times a week and eat  very healthy, I think at the long run all of this combination will paid off. Im gonna stick to this product due  to the natural ingredients it has and how fast it dries on my skin which is a time saver for me.</li>
    <li> one bottle, zero results</li>
    <li> After giving birth, I was looking forward to summer and showing off my post partum body. This cream helped me do just that. I noticed a difference after two weeks and using it only once a day. I wore my bikini without blinking an eye and I&#x27;m  completely satisfied. I practice yoga 1-2x a week for about 30 mins and try to walk 20-30 mins 2-3 days/ week as my schedule permits. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this and will re-order for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Noticeable improvement with first use!  Nice fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I have been exercising to tone my legs but felt I needed a little extra help with the cellulite, so I was excited to try the One Body Powerful Body Firming Cellulite cream.  I was interested in trying the One Body brand because of the ingredients: shea butter, Gotu Cola, vitamin E, antioxidants, etc.  I like the pleasant scent of this product compared to others that I have tried.  I apply the cream twice a day to my target area and continue to work out at the gym.  I give this product 5-stars because I have noticed that my legs are gradually becoming smoother and firmer.  I purchased this cream at a reduced rate for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  I&#x27;m not sure about the results yet but like the way that it makes my skin feel.  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this a million stars!!!! The day after receiving this I was invited to a party a week away, and wanted to wear a pair of shorts I haven&#x27;t worn in quite some time but finally fit again. Lets just say my upper legs were not so flattering with the cellulite being visible. I remembered I had gotten this so decided to try it out. After applying  one leg I had to help my daughter to find her goggles so I came back 20 minutes later to apply other leg and couldn&#x27;t believe the already  tightening feeling and visible difference!!!(I know that many have said no visible difference for days, but I swear I seen less bumps on one side).... So after one week of use I felt confident enough to wear the booty shorts and not be tugging all night. I&#x27;m sure the fact that I have very tight legs due to exercise and healthy lifestyle do contribute to this working with such visible quick results (since it was getting rid of cottage cheese look not droopy skin). I definitely will be continuing using this since so far I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this cream at discount for a HONEST review</li>
    <li> I really like the smell (coconut) cream! The texture is really nice too which was a nice surprise compared to some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I have been using if for just a week and I am starting to notice a difference. My skin is so much smoother and well hydrated too.  I would definitely recommend this. I will follow up in a few weeks with more progress.</li>
