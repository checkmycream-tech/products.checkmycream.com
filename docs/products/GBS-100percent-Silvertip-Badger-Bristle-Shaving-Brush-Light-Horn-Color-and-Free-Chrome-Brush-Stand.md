      <li>the best I will get 100 shaves out of it.  </li>

      <li>I took a gamble on this GBS brush and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as wonderful as a Simpson, but it does just fine.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I bought this brush with great anticipation of using the silvertip brush.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re wanting a great quality Silvertip Badger, this is the way to go.</li>
      <li>Great quality at a great price.</li>
      <li>THIS BRUSH WORKS GREAT WITH THESE CREAMS.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s just nothing to compare to their great feel and latherability of Simpson or Rooney.</li>
      <li>AND IT WHIPS UP A GREAT LATHER.</li>
      <li>good weight, brush feels great against my skin.</li>
      <li>I have been using a Parker Best Badger brush, which has been fine, but I wanted to try a Silvertip.  </li>
      <li>If you have $50 to spend on a good brush, you won&#x27;t be wasting your money on this one.</li>
      <li>With my Edwin Jagger Sandalwood Soap, it did good.</li>
      <li>I think he weight of the brush is good</li>
      <li>The product has good weight and design otherwise, but unless you like to have badger hair bristles all over your face and bathroom, I would look for another brush.  </li>
      <li>makes a good lather and keeps its shape.</li>
      <li>The brush made good lather and feels good on the face.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;M SURE IT WILL WORK WITH ALL THE GREAT SHAVING CREAMS.</li>
      <li>Nice hefty weight to handle and bristles feel good on the face.</li>
      <li>:) BUY IT!</li>
      <li>Simply amazing.</li>
      <li>Husband still uses it, but is not as thrilled as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
      <li>Take my word for it, this brush is really well made and looks great!</li>
      <li>Not a damaging fan at all, just a nice working knot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He told me it&#x27;s so nice</li>
      <li>But it comes with its own holder</li>
      <li>The handle has a nice weight to it, but if you don&#x27;t like heavier brushes, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>THIS ONE WORKS GREAT AT A SUPER PRICE.</li>
      <li>Works great and does exactly as described.</li>
      <li>And I also haven&#x27;t had a problem fitting this brush into the plastic</li>
      <li>This morning I stopped counting at 46 bristles that fell out, and there were still more to count.</li>
      <li>The reason I bought this brush was to have a nice brush I could use for years and it fit my budget.</li>
      <li>But if you could spend $75 or more, go with a Rooney or a Simoson.</li>
      <li>But, this brush is nicely made, soft on my skin, holds a lot of water, and foams very nicely.  </li>
      <li>The stand it comes with, as others have said, is very cheap, but mine has worked fine.  </li>
      <li>and what seems to be (so far) great construction.  </li>
      <li>On the creams I used, I got a GREAT lather with my Proraso, Truefitt and Hill, and Taylors of Old Bond all excelled with this brush.</li>
      <li>If I push the brush into the soap while whisking, then I&#x27;ll really get a good pile of frothy soap.</li>
      <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t have a very dense knot, it does hold a good amount.</li>
      <li>This is my first 100% silvertip Badger brush, and I thought it would be amazing from the start, but it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;First 30 days were fine.  </li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>In all cases it made lather quicker and with less effort than the Best Badger brush.  </li>
      <li>I had the cheap Tweezerman.  </li>
      <li>However, the free stand broke as soon as I got it out of the box.</li>
      <li>I tested it on several soaps and creams, and it worked great on all levels.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Holds water nicely, feels nice on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Stiff enough to work a good lather but soft on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, this is really a great brush to put in your daily use or a rotational use.</li>
      <li>Not to light but not like a paper wieght either.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much about GBS, but so far I am quite pleased with the brush and consider it a clear step up from a Best Badger.  </li>
      <li>I really like the brush; transforms shaving soap into whipping cream consistency and is very easy to clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>I have a pure badger from the Art of Shaving that lathers up and retains moisture better.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t see anything special about it besides the handle.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worked great for me--a very dense knot and holds water like no other brush I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
      <li>Everything is true what they say about silvertip badger brushes.  </li>
      <li>I thought the price was to good to be true and that maybe everyone else had felt the same.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little lighter in the handle than the Parker was, too, so it stays handle-side-up in my stand a bit more easily, too - though it came with its own stand</li>
      <li>brush for the first time and seems fine.  </li>
      <li>I feel like i am getting bold all over again.</li>
      <li>The free stand broke on the first day.</li>
      <li>they engineered the thing so it barely fits on its own stand.  </li>
      <li>Muehle stand that I own (again upside down, at the top of handle where the bristles start).  </li>
      <li>Since it was free I won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re looking for silvertip at an economical price, you should give this a try.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit standard stands, chrome makes it too large,,there is better bang for the buck out there.</li>
      <li>Just right.  </li>
      <li>The first few shaves were great.</li>
      <li>The Silvertip is apparently one of the better types of brushes and I definatley feel i made the right decision with this brush.</li>
      <li>a 5 minute wet shave is comfortable, quick, and easy.</li>
      <li>After several uses, lathering soaps, creams, in bowls, mugs and on my beard, the knot has really fanned nicely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whether you use soaps or creams, this brush works really well!</li>
      <li>My first silvertip brush.</li>
      <li>This is my first silver tip badger brush.  </li>
      <li>If your thinking about a badger brush definitely put this one on the top of your list to consider.  </li>
      <li>It is soft &amp; helps raise the hair for a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>did a bit more reading and found that brushes such as these have a shedding period, which can about a month to get through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, this is an inexpensive Silvertip Badger Brush.</li>
      <li>Another 5 weeks of solid use and bristle loss is getting better.</li>
      <li>Good luck getting it to fit properly on any other stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do notice the soft (but firm) bristles and the great foam</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was a bit surprised that some breaking in was required since many of the cheaper brushes I&#x27;ve used were already soft and didn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It held SO much water and the water inside the brush was still hot.  </li>
      <li>I figured it would be a lower quality brush, expecting some shedding, but I really haven&#x27;t experienced any (outside of a few bristles on the first shave.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The free stand was broken on arrival, but the response to our query and the arrival of the replacement was amazing</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much lather this brush worked up.  </li>
      <li>I should have spent the $100 and bought a better brush.</li>
      <li>GBS Silvertip Badger really holds a lot of water too.</li>
      <li>It has since turned into a real problem.</li>
      <li>also read that it will take a number of uses before it really starts to get soft.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I feel like i am getting bold all over again. the hair keeps on falling and clogging my sink. That sucks!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, no complaints on the brush! It is soft &amp; helps raise the hair for a smooth shave. However, the free stand broke as soon as I got it out of the box. Since it was free I won&#x27;t complain too much. I think he weight of the brush is good it feels solid in my hand &amp; it has a classy look. $ is kinda high but comparable to other brushes of this type. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> At 77 shaving is torture. Wasn&#x27;t when younger and did it every work day before Court appearances. But with the Badger brush [ASIN:B004B6V24M Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Black Handle) &amp; Free Shaving Brush Stand], Proraso Shaving Soap [ASIN:B00837YY18 Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 Oz (150 mil, New Formulation], and Phillips triple head Norelco Aquatec  battery powered electric razor [ASIN:B006GQYSC8 Philips Norelco AT810 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor] (all purchased from Amazon) a 5 minute wet shave is comfortable, quick, and easy. I really like the brush; transforms shaving soap into whipping cream consistency and is very easy to clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Another 5 weeks of solid use and bristle loss is getting better. Still in excess of 10 per use, but better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was very excited to try this product due to the number of positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve also waited to make this review until I gave the brush sufficient time to get \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;.  At this point, I feel like I&#x27;ve done that, having used it regularly for about a month.  This morning I stopped counting at 46 bristles that fell out, and there were still more to count. That is about the regular experience; bristles left in the cup, in the sink and on my face. I have taken extra care to be extra gentle with the brush, both during use and in drying afterwards, and still the bristles fall out at an alarming, or at least annoying, rate.  The product has good weight and design otherwise, but unless you like to have badger hair bristles all over your face and bathroom, I would look for another brush.  Also, mine came with a free brush stand which did not fit the brush. It has a wide handle that hasn&#x27;t fit in any of the brush stands I&#x27;ve tried.  Its not a huge deal, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this for the bonus stand.</li>
    <li> After nearly 3 months of use, this product is continuing to lose lots of bristles.  I would never recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used this brush for the last time if I can help it.  After over a month of use I have not been able to get a decent lather from this brush, using multiple different shaving soaps.  I&#x27;ve gotten better lathers from boar&#x27;s hair brushes, which is extremely disappointing.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for several years now and was hoping to upgrade my brush collection, unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t the way to go.  Throw in the fact that it continues to shed, and it&#x27;s a lose-lose.  I guess I&#x27;ll keep it as my emergency brush, but not what I was expecting to get for the price.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush is the my second brush in 15 years.  The first was a cheap brush purchased in Denver in the late 90&#x27;s.  This new expensive brush provides a good lather, but sheds like a long haired dog in spring. Not sure which is going to last longer the soap bar or the brush.</li>
    <li> Great service, delivery!!  It was a Fathers Day gift for my husband, whose old brush was wearing out after 35+ years!!  The free stand was broken on arrival, but the response to our query and the arrival of the replacement was amazing</li>
    <li> My first silvertip brush. Alas, what a disappointment.  This brush has a very broad diameter, and does not fit in ANY brush holders, even those from GBS.  Additionally, it loses bristles at an alarming rate when I replace this, it will be from a vendor other than GBS</li>
    <li> Just received the brush and stand. The base snapped off the stand as I was hanging up the brush for the first time.  What a cheep piece of junk. One of the reasons I chose this brush was it came with a \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot; metal stand not a cheep plastic one. Why even include something this worthless.&lt;br /&gt;Used brush for the first time and seems fine.  Nice hefty weight to handle and bristles feel good on the face. A little worried reading other reviews about constant shedding.</li>
    <li> The free stand broke on the first day. I use the brush now for one month and every time I use the brush it looses countless bristles. Bristles are everywhere! I need to replace the brush but not with a GBS product</li>
    <li> Sheds.&lt;br /&gt;Like.&lt;br /&gt;Mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First 30 days were fine.  Then something happened and it started shedding.  Like 20 bristles per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it.  By my estimations I only have only about 30 shaves left with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the best I will get 100 shaves out of it.  Which works out to about $0.50 per shave.  Went back to my Tweezerman brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they engineered the thing so it barely fits on its own stand.  Good luck getting it to fit properly on any other stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost me $50.00 but lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see anything special about it besides the handle.  The handle is cool and the only reason i gave it 3-stars.  If 2.5 was an option i would have chose that.  I have a pure badger from the Art of Shaving that lathers up and retains moisture better.</li>
    <li> I returned it, too expensive for the quality. Doesn&#x27;t fit standard stands, chrome makes it too large,,there is better bang for the buck out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush with great anticipation of using the silvertip brush.  The first few shaves were great. Then, the shedding began. At first it was only one or two. It has since turned into a real problem. I have been using this brush for 90 days and it has increased the number of dropped hairs on a daily basis. Today (my 90th day) it dropped just over 100 hairs. Needless to say this brush is done. The reason I bought this brush was to have a nice brush I could use for years and it fit my budget. I should have spent the $100 and bought a better brush. If a higher priced brush only lasts 1year it is half the price of this brush. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I give it one star because the logo on the handle came off after two uses.  I can replace the knot and use the handle without being reminded of the company.</li>
    <li> This is my first 100% silvertip Badger brush, and I thought it would be amazing from the start, but it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit surprised that some breaking in was required since many of the cheaper brushes I&#x27;ve used were already soft and didn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a bit more reading and found that brushes such as these have a shedding period, which can about a month to get through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read that it will take a number of uses before it really starts to get soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s been my experience so far... as time has gone on and I&#x27;ve used this brush, it has indeed become softer and shed less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t help but feel like I have a piece of luxury when using this. If I push the brush into the soap while whisking, then I&#x27;ll really get a good pile of frothy soap.</li>
    <li> The picture here doesn&#x27;t do it justice. I should post a picture of mine but that&#x27;s a lot of effort. Take my word for it, this brush is really well made and looks great! It&#x27;s soft like you&#x27;d expected from a Silvertip brush, but it stays firm while you&#x27;re lathering. Great quality at a great price. It&#x27;s a little fatter than other brushes I&#x27;ve used, so it doesn&#x27;t fit in my holder. But it comes with its own holder so that&#x27;s fine. Buy this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a little over two years.  It&#x27;s worked great for me--a very dense knot and holds water like no other brush I&#x27;ve owned.  It seems, however, that reviews of this brush break down into those who&#x27;ve not had trouble with the knot, and those for whom this brush has shed like a dog in summer.  Personally, I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with this brush losing hairs.  However, as some have mentioned, it may not work up a lather as well as other brushes (especially if you&#x27;re using a hard soap).  But I usually use Proraso and it lathers just fine.  It&#x27;s a beautiful brush and well-weighted--and I like the look of the faux horn.  The stand it comes with, as others have said, is very cheap, but mine has worked fine.  And I also haven&#x27;t had a problem fitting this brush into the plastic Muehle stand that I own (again upside down, at the top of handle where the bristles start).  My two cents--if you&#x27;re looking for silvertip at an economical price, you should give this a try.</li>
    <li> Never owned a brush before so i don&#x27;t know how to compare to others out there. i did tons of research and read lots of reviews before buying this one. The Silvertip is apparently one of the better types of brushes and I definatley feel i made the right decision with this brush. I would recommend</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas present for my dad, because he has been using the same brush for as long as I can remember and it was starting to look ragged.&lt;br /&gt;My dad LOVED it! It&#x27;s very beautiful and well made, nice and heavy-duty. He told me it&#x27;s so nice he doesn&#x27;t even wan&#x27;t to use it! I am very happy with my purchase! :) BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but it does shed hairs, unfortunately. We knew it might shed some, but this is beyond &amp;#34;some&amp;#34;. Husband still uses it, but is not as thrilled as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> This is my third shaving brush.  I had the cheap Tweezerman.  I bought an expensive Parker, and it started falling apart on me.  I saw a few reviews on this one, and I was skeptical, but I clearly needed a new brush.  Am I enough of an expert to know silvertip vs. other badger bristles?  Nope.  But, this brush is nicely made, soft on my skin, holds a lot of water, and foams very nicely.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now, and I lost a few hairs the first use and I lost one this morning.  My Parker lost between 5 and 10 hairs with every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this brush did have an... animal smell to it the first few times I used it.  But, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed it after a week.  I do notice the soft (but firm) bristles and the great foam and what seems to be (so far) great construction.  It&#x27;s a little lighter in the handle than the Parker was, too, so it stays handle-side-up in my stand a bit more easily, too - though it came with its own stand (that I never used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my first silver tip badger brush.  I have been using a Parker Best Badger brush, which has been fine, but I wanted to try a Silvertip.  The price was reasonable, especially considering it came with a steel stand and not the usual plastic stand.  I have tried it with Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton College, Tabac, and a left over package of Vander Haagen Luxury.  In all cases it made lather quicker and with less effort than the Best Badger brush.  The brush made good lather and feels good on the face.  Using an EJ89 and Feather blades the shaves seemed a bit closer.  I haven&#x27;t seen any loss of bristles or other problems with the brush.  I haven&#x27;t seen much about GBS, but so far I am quite pleased with the brush and consider it a clear step up from a Best Badger.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.  I grew up with double edge razors and have been back to them about two years.  I&#x27;ll not go back to multi-blades.</li>
    <li> So I was a little hesitant about ordering this brush because there had been no reviews by anyone.  That scared me.  I thought the price was to good to be true and that maybe everyone else had felt the same.  Not only that, you have to go through a few pages of badger brushes on the Amazon website before you get to this one.  All I can say is WOW!  I&#x27;ve had all types of shave brushes from synthetic and boar hair to just the regular pure badger hair and Silvertip badger hair is completely the standard of brush everyone should be shaving with.  Don&#x27;t think about it, just buy it!  I took it out of the box and immediately noticed the weight was perfect.  Not to light but not like a paper wieght either.  Just right.  I went to the bathroom and ran some hot water, wet the brush and started to lather up.  Everything is true what they say about silvertip badger brushes.  It held SO much water and the water inside the brush was still hot.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much lather this brush worked up.  If your thinking about a badger brush definitely put this one on the top of your list to consider.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  Simply amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush somewhat on a whim, wanting a Silvertip brush that I could use on trips that I wouldn&#x27;t worry about getting beat up with travel. But it&#x27;s a brush I occasionally use in the rotation with my Simpson and Edwin Jagger brushes. It&#x27;s not as wonderful as a Simpson, but it does just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Pros\\&quot; of this brush are plentiful! First, this is an inexpensive Silvertip Badger Brush. If you&#x27;re wanting a great quality Silvertip Badger, this is the way to go. The handle has a nice weight to it, but if you don&#x27;t like heavier brushes, this isn&#x27;t for you. It definitely has a heavier feel, in fact, heavier than my Simpson Chubby 3. The Tips of the brush are nice and stiff, but not so stiff to sacrifice a good soft feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you use soaps or creams, this brush works really well! I tested it on several soaps and creams, and it worked great on all levels. With my Col. Conk Lime Soap, it worked up a rich and slick lather from the soap container. With my Edwin Jagger Sandalwood Soap, it did good. On the creams I used, I got a GREAT lather with my Proraso, Truefitt and Hill, and Taylors of Old Bond all excelled with this brush. I lathered them in a bowl, mug, or in my hand. I also did a face lather with this brush and Geo F. Trumpers cream, and it performed GREAT again! I couldn&#x27;t find any product that wouldn&#x27;t work well with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GBS Silvertip Badger really holds a lot of water too. Although it doesn&#x27;t have a very dense knot, it does hold a good amount. After several uses, lathering soaps, creams, in bowls, mugs and on my beard, the knot has really fanned nicely. Not a damaging fan at all, just a nice working knot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shedding, I have not had a problem at all with this brush shedding. I figured it would be a lower quality brush, expecting some shedding, but I really haven&#x27;t experienced any (outside of a few bristles on the first shave.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say all of that to say this...I still go to my SimpsonDuke 3 or Simpson Chubby 3 over this brush. If you have $50 to spend on a good brush, you won&#x27;t be wasting your money on this one. But if you could spend $75 or more, go with a Rooney or a Simoson. There&#x27;s just nothing to compare to their great feel and latherability of Simpson or Rooney. In fact, I prefer the Best Badger of a Simpson to the Silvertip of GBS here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this is really a great brush to put in your daily use or a rotational use. I took a gamble on this GBS brush and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Brush does not fit fit in GBS stand.</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE SOME OF THE PRICING ON SILVER TIP BRUSHES. THIS ONE WORKS GREAT AT A SUPER PRICE. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A WEEK AND NO BRISTLES HAVE FALLEN OUT AND IT WHIPS UP A GREAT LATHER. I&#x27;M A BIG FAN OF SPENCER AND DEVON AND TAYLOR OF OLD BOND STREET CREAMS AND THIS BRUSH WORKS GREAT WITH THESE CREAMS. I&#x27;M SURE IT WILL WORK WITH ALL THE GREAT SHAVING CREAMS.</li>
    <li> I have used a few &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; brushes but this is my first silver hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time, packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice weight to it and a decently wide bloom once used a bit and allowed to open up.&lt;br /&gt;Holds water nicely, feels nice on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Stiff enough to work a good lather but soft on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great and does exactly as described.</li>
    <li> good weight, brush feels great against my skin. makes a good lather and keeps its shape. a really great brush</li>
