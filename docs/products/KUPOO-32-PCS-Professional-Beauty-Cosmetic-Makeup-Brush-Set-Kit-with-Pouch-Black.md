      <li>I just love these brushes</li>
      <li>most are unusable</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get this many brushes for this price anywhere</li>
      <li>I recently used them and they&#x27;re wonderful</li>
      <li>Though there is some shedding it is very minimal, wonderful brushes for an even better price!</li>
      <li>I was very excited to receive these in the mail the day I ordered them online.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>yes they&#x27;re somewhat soft and they have a good variety.</li>
      <li>and I love them so much!</li>
      <li>My package was delivered a day before it&#x27;s original delivery date.</li>
      <li>This product arrived quickly and in tact.  </li>
      <li>they do smell a bit because of the pleather ( the case) and honestly the case is bigger</li>
      <li>All the bristles are falling out of every brush from the first time I used them.</li>
      <li>All the bristles are falling out of every brush from the first time I used them.</li>
      <li>Came in really fast!</li>
      <li>They are good except that all yhe brushes are basically the same just bigger</li>
      <li>Some of them are good brushes but keep in mind that the photos are lying and they&#x27;re mainly flat brushes so unless you really like working with flat brushes you can purchase this</li>
      <li>My daughter really wanted this brush set, so I ordered it for a gift.  </li>
      <li>The Pouch they come in is very durable and all brushes were in tact.</li>
      <li>Honestly, they were a waste of money, and I threw them all away.</li>
      <li>They arrived right on time, and are extremely soft.</li>
      <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t excited at all when it finally arrived.</li>
      <li>I could have saved up for decent make up brushes.</li>
      <li>Everything else I really love, except tthe fact that I had to throw away one of the fluffy brushes because i would softly run my fingers through it and like more than 20 hairs would fall out...but other than that I like it.</li>
      <li>The big ones do shed a little bit but are okay after 1 use!</li>
      <li>Really soft!</li>
      <li>other than that cool maybe wash before</li>
      <li>My other daughter now wants one too!</li>
      <li>A few of the bristles came out on the first application but haven&#x27;t since that time.</li>

<ol>
    <li> very nice. I like it a lot</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok. Look better onine. I think they should be label. But you get what you pay for, oh well.</li>
    <li> Good for the price to have more brushes however it was embarrassing to use the brushes on set&lt;br /&gt;and hair from the brush started falling all over my clients face...other than that cool maybe wash before&lt;br /&gt;using or prepare for it to shed.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Minimum shedding. I use them everyday. I have had mines for 2 years now</li>
    <li> All the bristles are falling out of every brush from the first time I used them. They look better on line for sure..</li>
    <li> Beware these brushes are very very stiff most are unusable not worth the money even at such a low price definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>

    <li> They are good except that all yhe brushes are basically the same just bigger I hope that makes sences ha.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for months now and I love them so much! They do shed a little bit, I only notice the face brushes (blush/powder) shed a little bit but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. For the price I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy these brushes. I bought them, yes they&#x27;re somewhat soft and they have a good variety. BUT every time I use them I spend three hours picking the bristles off of my face EVERY brush in this pack sheds an incredible amount it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. Bristles fall everywhere. This set does not work properly the bristles on these brushes fall apart everywhere it is not a good set to use especially around the eyes when bristles fall in to your eyes. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Bought it as a Christmas present for my sister.  She loves them.</li>
    <li> Great product! Gift for a friend. He loved it.</li>
    <li> Some of them are good brushes but keep in mind that the photos are lying and they&#x27;re mainly flat brushes so unless you really like working with flat brushes you can purchase this</li>
    <li> This came in the mail today ( before I did my makeup) and they work great! The big ones do shed a little bit but are okay after 1 use! they do smell a bit because of the pleather ( the case) and honestly the case is bigger then it looks in the picture but not too much bigger! But, I still recommend this product to anyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive these in the mail the day I ordered them online. However, I wasn&#x27;t excited at all when it finally arrived. The brush strands immediately started to fall off and left a mess everywhere. I don&#x27;t even use them. Honestly, they were a waste of money, and I threw them all away. I could have saved up for decent make up brushes. These are a joke.</li>
    <li> Came in really fast! Really soft!</li>
    <li> The brushes look and feel good...but after using them for one month some bristles appear to be getting loose..</li>

    <li> I just love these brushes</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this</li>

    <li> These brushes are AMAZING!! Love the quality; they arrived on time and they work great!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. It&#x27;s cheap so you get what you paid for. There&#x27;s about 3 brushes that I like.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get this many brushes for this price anywhere</li>
    <li> Great brushes, work awesome.</li>
