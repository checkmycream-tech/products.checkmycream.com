      <li>enjoy this set of makeup brushes came in a zipper carry pouch</li>
      <li>Great for applying my daily makeup to create polished look.</li>
      <li>They feel comfortable on my skin.</li>
      <li>These brushes are soft and good quality for the price of $30.</li>
      <li>Brushes are soft and there is a good variety.</li>
      <li>These brushes cover and apply nicely and they are very soft!</li>
      <li>They are not identified or numbered, so probably not the best set for amateur make up enthusiasts (like me).  </li>
      <li>Hopefully that will go away after I clean them.</li>
      <li>love everything about this set and recommend it to anyone who wants</li>

      <li>They are pretty soft and have nice handles; however, the larger brushes in the set I received are shedding.  </li>

      <li>Cheap cheap a waste of money</li>
      <li>I love the smooth wooden handles on these makeup brushes, as most I&#x27;ve seen are hard plastic and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>They did a great job at blending my makeup on my face and giving me a natural even look instead of a caked on scary clown look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The variations are awesome, thick and thin to straight to angled...</li>
      <li>The brushes are soft and they haven&#x27;t shedded yet.</li>
      <li>These are beautifully made, but she&#x27;d really bad.</li>

<li> These are beautifully made, but she&#x27;d really bad.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried the entire set as they aren&#x27;t labeled for how to use each one on what part of my face, and I am not a professional makeup artist so for some I can&#x27;t tell the difference and just make an obvious choice to use.</li>
<li> The natural goat hair of these bristles are extremely soft, thick and full on the brush, and after using them for a few days, I hadn&#x27;t noticed any of them falling out of the brush or looking worn down.</li>
<li> Brushes are nice but they have a bad smell.  </li>
<li> Some of them are soft but a couple of them are very harsh on the skin.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve had a few good ones, and a few bad ones over the years.</li>
<li> While using brushes I expected at least a little bit of shedding since these brushes are new and it was a lot less than I</li>
<li> Not first tier.</li>
<li> I am hoping these were just errant loose ones and not indicative of an ongoing problem -- I can&#x27;t stand brushes that shed!!!  </li>
<li> For some odd reason I thought these were going to be Mary Kay makeup brushes</li>
<li> Ahhhhh I&#x27;ve been trying to do my makeup with little brushes that come with the shadows</li>
<li> I had a five piece set before and it was just lacking a little.</li>
<li> but they are definitely a back up brush set for a list or broken brush when needed.  </li>
<li> Will be my everyday brushes!</li>
<li> but I clicked on the wrong one</li>
<li> The case has a horrible smell which makes the brushes smell horrible as well.  </li>

    <li> Brushes are average to good quality. The case is shiny patent pleather.  Set works as back-up or travel. Not first tier.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love my  brushes!!!! great quality, great price... I love them</li>
    <li> My wife loves the brushes. She said they are better than the high dollar ones</li>
    <li> This set has everything I can ever think I would need for my makeup. I had a five piece set before and it was just lacking a little. Now I have everything from brow liners to powder applicators. The variations are awesome, thick and thin to straight to angled... I am a happy camper! I feel like I am set for life..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and there is a good variety. This was a gift for my sister who spends a lot of time and money on make up, and she loves them! Great value and selection!</li>
    <li> Brushes are nice but they have a bad smell.  Hopefully that will go away after I clean them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are what you pay for. They are OK brushes but shed alot when using them. Some of them are soft but a couple of them are very harsh on the skin. I am OK with them because they were so cheap but they are definitely a back up brush set for a list or broken brush when needed.  The case has a horrible smell which makes the brushes smell horrible as well.  After using brush shampoo I was able to use them</li>
    <li> Ahhhhh I&#x27;ve been trying to do my makeup with little brushes that come with the shadows and then I was sent these brushes for testing purposes and for my honest review and I am finally getting it! These brushes cover and apply nicely and they are very soft! OMG so soft and they come in a beautiful black case! So happy with these! Will be my everyday brushes!</li>
    <li> This set is fabulous! The brushes are soft, but not too soft, they blend powder and liquid make up nicely. Great for applying my daily makeup to create polished look. They feel comfortable on my skin. The blending brush works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My foundation looked good, no streaks, and no blotches whatsoever. While using brushes I expected at least a little bit of shedding since these brushes are new and it was a lot less than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was received complimentary for review purposes. My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> great product, soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The brushes were great my sister and I have been looking for some good make up brushes and these were perfect :)</li>
    <li> good brushes and haven&#x27;t lost any bristles....an excellent buy for such a nice set.</li>
    <li> For some odd reason I thought these were going to be Mary Kay makeup brushes but I clicked on the wrong one and so now I have these which I am still highly pleased with. The brushes are soft and they haven&#x27;t shedded yet. They came in brush casings which was a bonus and the brushes I have used so far have been amazing especially the biggest three. The powder, blush/contour, and foundation brush have been above and beyond what I was expecting. They blend, buff, and pick up product flawlessly. I have only used the angled brush for eyebrows but I bet the rest will be great too</li>
    <li> Brush heads came apart from handles when taking them out of their plastic sleeves.</li>
    <li> Happy with the Brushes!  Good value for the cost.</li>
    <li> Cheap cheap a waste of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the expert in makeup brushes but I&#x27;ve had a few good ones, and a few bad ones over the years. This makeup brush set by Studio Makeup comes in a set of 15 different brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love the smooth wooden handles on these makeup brushes, as most I&#x27;ve seen are hard plastic and don&#x27;t last long. The natural goat hair of these bristles are extremely soft, thick and full on the brush, and after using them for a few days, I hadn&#x27;t noticed any of them falling out of the brush or looking worn down. The ends of the bristles are nice and even so there isn&#x27;t a stray one sticking up to place the makeup where you don&#x27;t want it going.

They did a great job at blending my makeup on my face and giving me a natural even look instead of a caked on scary clown look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy this set of makeup brushes came in a zipper carry pouch so I can easily take the set in a tote for when I travel and am not at home. I would recommend this set for anyone looking for a great set of makeup applicators, even if you&#x27;re not an expert at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and good quality for the price of $30. I used them today to do my makeup and all I have to say is I&#x27;m sold. The brushes hold product well and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Carrying Case with zipper is nice, keeps all my brushes and fits in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love everything about this set and recommend it to anyone who wants adorable Makeup Brushes Set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based upon my own experiences with the product.</li>
    <li> After years of using inexpensive brushes, I wanted a better set. I&#x27;m very happy with this set of 15. The brushes are soft and seem to be of very good quality. An excellent value too. I expect to have them for years to come. They do not shed either. And as a bonus, they are the perfect size to hold and compact to store when not in use.</li>
    <li> These are okay for the price.  They are not identified or numbered, so probably not the best set for amateur make up enthusiasts (like me).  They are pretty soft and have nice handles; however, the larger brushes in the set I received are shedding.  I&#x27;ve only used the bigger brushes a couple of times but had to wipe several hairs from my face each time.  I am hoping these were just errant loose ones and not indicative of an ongoing problem -- I can&#x27;t stand brushes that shed!!!  The smaller brushes are pretty good but even so, I would probably pass on these.</li>
    <li> These are beautifully made, but she&#x27;d really bad. Can not continue to use as I get the hair from the brushes all over my face and in my eyes. Have to toss.</li>
