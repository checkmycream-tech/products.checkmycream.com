      <li>It was amazing!!</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>It is amazing!</li>
      <li>This thing works amazingly!</li>
      <li>She ASKS to brush her own hair!</li>
      <li>It does a good job of getting the tangles out</li>
      <li>I bought the Tangle Teezer from Amazon a couple years ago and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the product is as good as everyone makes it out to be.</li>
      <li>This brush caught my eye and we&#x27;re all delighted with it.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful, but challenging to brush out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so glad I purchased this!</li>
      <li>We love it!  </li>
      <li>Tangle Teezer 100 times better!  </li>
      <li>When this brush came and is amazing.</li>
      <li>My daughter can even brush her own hair.</li>
      <li>and she begged for one of her own.</li>
      <li>My daughter loves this brush and now likes to brush her own hair.</li>
      <li>My daughters hair is very fine and curly and this brush helps</li>
      <li>It seems to go through the hair very smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It was very light plastic.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic brush!</li>
      <li>We love the knot geenie.</li>
      <li>but I think there might be a better one out there</li>
      <li>Seems like they were more concerned with design than durability.</li>
      <li>It detangles my hair better.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;d say this brush is better than most, and could be the answer to those with thinner hair.</li>
      <li>Awesome brush, it works wonders and my daughter does not fight getting her hair brushed anymore.  </li>
      <li>this is a miracle brush for sure,</li>
      <li>Since I spend time looking for the tangle teezer, i thought i should have more than one annd</li>
      <li>I called it a magic brush to help get the knots out easily.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t anything magical about this hairbrush, it is a fine hairbrush</li>
      <li>Great for my 3 year old.</li>
      <li>Works best with wet hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy for her to carry around and she likes the purple color we got.</li>
      <li>Works great and light years better than a traditional brush.</li>
      <li>It does well with her fine hair.</li>
      <li>A LOT of fine hair</li>
      <li>Definately what you want for care free care of your hair.</li>
      <li>Brushing her hair was always a torture session filled with thrashing and tears.</li>
      <li>Recommend it for tear free brushing.</li>
      <li>, this is a fantastic find.</li>
      <li>This works well for knots right at the surface, like the top layer of the hair.  </li>
      <li>With extraordinarily damaged hair that is straight on top, but quite wavy on the bottom (and thus knots VERY easily), I am always on the lookout for a good brush that will detangle my hair without further damaging it.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the cost!</li>
      <li>Then i saw the Knot Genie on a Woot special and thought it sounded like the Tangle Teezer.  </li>
      <li>But after a friend suggested I try it for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair that tangles when you look at it, I purchased one.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy for a child to handle, easy for an adult to handle&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
      <li>Sure enough, the Knot Genie worked like magic.  </li>
      <li>Great little brush.  </li>
      <li>Pretty cool.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to hold the hair near the root to detangle knots with ease.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Knot Genie, I had such high hopes that it would work well and would eliminate my need to purchase more and more brushes and combs.  </li>
      <li>I made the right choice.  </li>
      <li>Not only was it gentle on her hair, it worked quickly, and I think she actually liked the feel of the brush on her scalp.</li>
      <li>I have therefore accumulated a large tote bag full of brushes and combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it was the first peaceful, quick, hair-brushing experience I&#x27;ve had with my daughter.  </li>
      <li>very fine hair with countless knots.</li>
      <li>I let her play with it a bit, showing her new magic brush to her older brother.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I have a very tender headed three year old and this brush has certainly made hair brushing better.</li>
      <li>It gets pretty knotty at the ends</li>
      <li>Did exactly what I had hoped.</li>
      <li>When I first bought this, I thought it was God sent.  </li>
      <li>This brush leaves her hair soft and tangle free while providing a therapeutic scalp massage.</li>
      <li>Not as comfortable or effective on my waist-length, thick, curly, tangly hair.  </li>
      <li>I use one on my grand daughters long hair ( it has stopped the cries and yells) as well as another one for my dogs.</li>
      <li>Review is true of brushing from top down!</li>
      <li>I let her use it on herself a little, she liked it.  </li>
      <li>We are having a much easier time brushing my daughters hair with this.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-traditional shape and shiny color really got her attention.  </li>
      <li>Bought one for my granddaughter with the very curly hair.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, a brush works just as well if you take your time and gently untangle hair.</li>
      <li>Gentle to get the tangles out but pointy bristles scratch her head and neck</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>Works very nice to get through tough morning hair.</li>
      <li>Now I bought two more for her twin sisters due in 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>It is not worth spending more than about $5 on this brush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the average brush when detangling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to cut the detangle time in half with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
      <li>May have to wait until she is a bit older and</li>
      <li>My daughter is very young and usually cries and doesn&#x27;t want her hair brushed, but this is quick and easy and she likes it.  </li>
      <li>I sat her in front of spongebob (the usual) and told her I was going to use the magic brush.  </li>
      <li>It was the first time ever my daughter didn&#x27;t cry, scream, or complain in 5 years when I brushed her hair.</li>
      <li>said ok to use on dry but does not work so well with dry</li>
      <li>I always ask my hubby to brush my hair with the brush but so far no luck.</li>
      <li>My 3 year old daughter runs screaming from any type of brush.  </li>
      <li>It has completely stopped my daughter&#x27;s and my fights about the knots in her hair.</li>
      <li>3 year old loves her &amp;#34;special purple hairbrush&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I had to get this for my 9 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>She has super-tight, soft ringlets that tangle and knot together.</li>
      <li>My sister used to have to comb through my curls when I was young</li>
      <li>Purchased 3 of these for my granddaughters and it only gets the top hair when brushing children&#x27;s hair it need to get all of it the worse battle is fighting the tangles</li>
      <li>like I expected it to after reading all the high reviews.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 23 month old daughter who has long, curly hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great little brush.  I use one on my grand daughters long hair ( it has stopped the cries and yells) as well as another one for my dogs.</li>
    <li> This works well but is hard to hold. My 8-year-old could do the detangling herself but this is such an awkward shape that even I have a hard time holding onto it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than the average brush when detangling. I actually expected no pain from this brush at all, but I ran into some tough areas now and then - much less than the average brush, but still some pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the idiot me also had to see if I could use this to brush my hair up so I could tie it, and the result is no, you can&#x27;t do so. You could try, but it wouldn&#x27;t end very well as it lacks the grip you would usually need to brush hair upwards/sideways/etcetc.</li>
    <li> With extraordinarily damaged hair that is straight on top, but quite wavy on the bottom (and thus knots VERY easily), I am always on the lookout for a good brush that will detangle my hair without further damaging it.  I have therefore accumulated a large tote bag full of brushes and combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased the Knot Genie, I had such high hopes that it would work well and would eliminate my need to purchase more and more brushes and combs.  Unfortunately, my desire for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; brush was not fulfilled by the Knot Genie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Instead of detangling my hair, the Knot Genie ripped out chunks of hair.  Chunks.  Gone.  Its plastic \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; also don&#x27;t hold up to much, so several \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; bent within weeks of acquiring this brush.  That made the ripping issue even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Knot Genie made it no easier to detangle my hair than did a paddle brush or the [[ASIN:B000L596FE The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush (Colors Vary)]].  It is not worth spending more than about $5 on this brush.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and struggled with combing it each morning. This thing works amazingly! It takes me less than a minute to brush my hair each morning. I don&#x27;t have to sit and work out knots or anything. Worth the very small price!</li>
    <li> The knot genie did not do what it said it was supposed to do.  It just made the job of brushing out mine and my daughters hair twice as hard.  I went back to using a brush instead of having to deal with my daughter crying.  It was either &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; that hurts with a brush or tears from using the knot genie.</li>
    <li> It does work, however my daughter has thick hair and only detangles through the top half of thickness of her hair.</li>
    <li> Brushing my daughters hair is always a struggle. My husband leaves the house just so he don&#x27;t have to hear her screams. I can&#x27;t even finger comb her hair. I used the knot genie and she didn&#x27;t even flinch. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Best hair brush we have found. Gets tangles out, doesn&#x27;t pull my daughter (20 months) very fine hair with countless knots. I find it easies to comb while it&#x27;s still wet after bath during storytime so she&#x27;s a bit distracted. But she won&#x27;t fight this brush like she does the combs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister to use on my nieces who are constantly complaining it hurts to get their hair brushed.  I was disappointed that they found this brush even more painful.  They said that the bristles are too pointy and hurt their scalps.</li>
    <li> This brush felt like it was going to come apart it my hands. Seems like they were more concerned with design than durability.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the product is as good as everyone makes it out to be. It doesn&#x27;t work wonders on the knots in my kids&#x27; hair like I expected it to after reading all the high reviews.</li>
    <li> Works great and light years better than a traditional brush. Gets tangles out with minimal tears. Works best with wet hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long curly hair. I&#x27;m able to cut the detangle time in half with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of different to use but once you get used to it its great.&lt;br /&gt;Item said ok to use on dry but does not work so well with dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders with wet hair, so try to use with wet hair.</li>
    <li> I have to admit when I heard about this product I was thinking &amp;#34;yeah. Right…&amp;#34;. But after a friend suggested I try it for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair that tangles when you look at it, I purchased one.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy for a child to handle, easy for an adult to handle&lt;br /&gt;  DOES take the tangles out with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives : I can&#x27;t think of any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair that is kinky, curly, knotty etc, this is a fantastic find.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my granddaughter with the very curly hair.  My sister used to have to comb through my curls when I was young and she said it was a battle.  This brush caught my eye and we&#x27;re all delighted with it.  No tears when we comb Nora&#x27;s hair.  Now I bought two more for her twin sisters due in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush, it works wonders and my daughter does not fight getting her hair brushed anymore.  It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the Knot Genie based on other reviewers, because brushing my DD&#x27;s hair is our MOST HATED task of the day. She has super-tight, soft ringlets that tangle and knot together. Beautiful, but challenging to brush out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marketing is well done, but the product itself is a disappointment. The bristles are hard and sharp. The Genie feels awkward to hold. As soon as I stroked the Genie on my DD&#x27;s scalp, she said &amp;#34;Ouch!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking to our faithful Denman paddle brush. Sorry, a Genie this brush is NOT.</li>
    <li> Both girls are growing their hair out.  Lots of knots and tangles.  This brush has helped to reduce the amount of tears we had.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to brush her hair with Knot Genie and now she doesn&#x27;t get knots in hair anymore! No more hair brushing headache for us.</li>
    <li> I have a very tender headed three year old and this brush has certainly made hair brushing better. Be sure to hold the hair near the root to detangle knots with ease.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this when I borrowed my friends brush she used on her daughters hair. It was the first time ever my daughter didn&#x27;t cry, scream, or complain in 5 years when I brushed her hair. And we&#x27;ve tried everything from detangling sprays to &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; brushes recommended by hair stylists. It was amazing!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush! It has completely stopped my daughter&#x27;s and my fights about the knots in her hair. My only complaint is there isn&#x27;t a handle, but we just use this to get the tangles out, and then follow up with a regular brush for styling.</li>
    <li> My daughters have thick hair and would always cry when I combed their hair, no matter how gentle I tried to be.  This works well for knots right at the surface, like the top layer of the hair.  It seems to go through the hair very smoothly.  But my girls have really thick hair, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t get to the tough knots underneath that top layer of hair.  So I&#x27;d say this brush is better than most, and could be the answer to those with thinner hair.</li>
    <li> We love the knot geenie. No more tears when it&#x27;s time to brush my daughters hair. Her cousin has one and she begged for one of her own. Can&#x27;t believe we didn&#x27;t get one sooner.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush and now likes to brush her own hair.</li>
    <li> Works very well, my daughter is still sensitive and complains but definitely much less than the ordinary brushes. You still need detangler.</li>
    <li> Purchased 3 of these for my granddaughters and it only gets the top hair when brushing children&#x27;s hair it need to get all of it the worse battle is fighting the tangles</li>
    <li> When I first bought this, I thought it was God sent.  My (at the time) three-year-old didn&#x27;t scream when I brushed her hair.  Tangles came out.  Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t held up well.  The ends of all the bristles are permanently bent.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work terribly well anymore, and my daughter is back to yelling at me because of it pulling her hair.</li>
    <li> I preferred the wet brush to this brush. It detangles my hair better.</li>
    <li> My Daughter Hates It - and I dont blame her.  I bought the Tangle Teezer from Amazon a couple years ago and loved it.  Then i saw the Knot Genie on a Woot special and thought it sounded like the Tangle Teezer.  Since I spend time looking for the tangle teezer, i thought i should have more than one annd the Knot Genie looked similar.  Well, they may look similar, but they are NOT!  Tangle Teezer 100 times better!  If your daughter has a senstive head or you just want to make brushing her hair easier - do yourself a favor and buy the tangle teezer. Dont waste your time or money on this brush. The bristles were super hard and did not untangle the hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very tough ethnic hair it gets matted, and dreads this brush works wonders, I even use it on my hair! It actually feels soothing to use it on my scalp this is a miracle brush for sure, so glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> We love it!  My daughter no longer screams when I brush her hair.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what I had hoped. A LOT of fine hair</li>
    <li> My daughter has tight curly hair and she also has sensory processing disorder. Brushing her hair was always a torture session filled with thrashing and tears. On an adoption bulletin board I heard about the Genie Knot Brush. My hubby was skeptical when I told him I wanted to order it as I have spent hundreds of dollars in brushes, combs and products in her 4 years of life. When this brush came and is amazing. She ASKS to brush her own hair! It is amazing! We took it with us to the salon and she finally allowed the stylist to brush and trim her hair. Our stylist ordered a brush for her daughter! This brush leaves her hair soft and tangle free while providing a therapeutic scalp massage. I always ask my hubby to brush my hair with the brush but so far no luck. 😁</li>
    <li> This product made short work of my daughters long hair.  Definately what you want for care free care of your hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush my daughter lets me use to brush her hair. It does well with her fine hair. I imagine it would be hard to use on thick hair. They only drawback for us is that I wish it had a handle or a strap. I drop it constantly when I hit a snag. It is slippery.</li>
    <li> Gentle to get the tangles out but pointy bristles scratch her head and neck so she won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush has stiff bristles, which tear harder at my head than the soft, multi-leveled bristles of the &amp;#34;tangle teezer&amp;#34;.  Not as comfortable or effective on my waist-length, thick, curly, tangly hair.  Also not gentle enough for my partner&#x27;s delicate, thin, fine hair, which the TT is.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> My daughter does not like this product. The bristles are sharp and she complains about them, especially when her hair is wet.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t anything magical about this hairbrush, it is a fine hairbrush but my daughter still complains it hurts to brush out the knots. I didn&#x27;t find that  it removed knots any easier than any of her other hairbrushes.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is so knotty every morning. Brushing her hair was a nightmare; she would cry and run from me because it hurt to be brushed. Since getting the Knot Genie, she hasn&#x27;t cried or complained once. She loves it and so do I! I still sometimes use detangling spray on really bad knots but not always. Totally worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Finally a brush where my daughter doesn&#x27;t cry! Very happy with purchasing this product. Recommend it for tear free brushing.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I got it out of the box.  It was very light plastic.  I put it to the test.  I tried it out on myself and my daughter after we washed our hair and it actually worked!  Pretty cool.  My daughter is very young and usually cries and doesn&#x27;t want her hair brushed, but this is quick and easy and she likes it.  It&#x27;s easy for her to carry around and she likes the purple color we got.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 23 month old daughter who has long, curly hair.  It does a good job of getting the tangles out but the bristles are very hard on her head.  She cries every time I have used it.  May have to wait until she is a bit older and head isn&#x27;t so tender.  In my opinion, a brush works just as well if you take your time and gently untangle hair.</li>
    <li> We are having a much easier time brushing my daughters hair with this.  A great product! Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This little brush is a game changer. My daughter can even brush her own hair. The everyday battle has come to an end! Knot Genie is awesome. I ordered another for my niece!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long hair and had bought one for herself.  Worked beautifully on her!  I have medium length hair and normally only brush it in the morning and at night.  It gets pretty knotty at the ends and I usually have to brace myself for the pulling.  With Knot Genie I don&#x27;t have any pulling.  Even after a windy day knot genie just brushes my hair out with no pulling or winching on my part.  I wish I had this product when my girls were small.  They wouldn&#x27;t have been battles to brush their hair!</li>
    <li> I was debating between this and another product and I bought this one because it was shiny and non-brush looking.  My 3 year old daughter runs screaming from any type of brush.  Up to now I&#x27;ve been limited to using a pink pick to de-tangle her long, curly-at-the-ends hair.  I made the right choice.  It&#x27;s non-traditional shape and shiny color really got her attention.  I called it a magic brush to help get the knots out easily.  I let her use it on herself a little, she liked it.  I let her play with it a bit, showing her new magic brush to her older brother.  Then, the next day I tested it!  I sat her in front of spongebob (the usual) and told her I was going to use the magic brush.  Sure enough, the Knot Genie worked like magic.  It got tough knots and rats out that usually took forever and induced crying and screaming.  Not only was it gentle on her hair, it worked quickly, and I think she actually liked the feel of the brush on her scalp. No tears, no screams, no fighting....it was the first peaceful, quick, hair-brushing experience I&#x27;ve had with my daughter.  If you&#x27;re looking for &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; to brush out knotty hair...the Knot Genie is the one!!  Very happy with this product, and so is my daughter.</li>
    <li> Works very nice to get through tough morning hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to use with thick hair and no handle on the brush. We used it for a few times and now it&#x27;s a shiny decoration on the sink counter.</li>
    <li> Great for my 3 year old.</li>
    <li> I had to get this for my 9 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;This item makes managing her hair easy.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in other colors!&lt;br /&gt;I might have to get another just to keep around</li>
    <li> This is our second one of these. This is the only brush my daughter will use.</li>
    <li> Wish i would have purchased earlier. 3 year old loves her &amp;#34;special purple hairbrush&amp;#34;. Works great. Review is true of brushing from top down! Geat product!</li>
    <li> My daughter requested it and uses it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little big,easy to use by big children,hard to grasp by toddler</li>
    <li> This is not perfect but its better than all my other brush options. My daughters hair is very fine and curly and this brush helps but I think there might be a better one out there</li>
