      <li>I really would not recommend this product, it only maintains the shine for a very short time, definitely not work the money, I would not repurchase this product.</li>

    <li> Not really that shiny.</li>
    <li> Really brings the shine and cuts the frizz.  I recommend carefully applying though.  If you overdo, it can look greasy.  Really works with my 50s hairdo and curls.</li>
    <li> I use big shine almost everyday when I use my straight iron. i like it because i don&#x27;t get any frizz. I like the clean sleek look.</li>
    <li> I love all their products and have been ordering them for a long long time.  Anyone who has hard to hold hair or thin hair has to like theit products.</li>
    <li> works great.  It will make a real difference in the way your hair looks</li>
    <li> Sometimes I need/want extra shine in my hair, and this works great! Shine lasts awhile, but doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> Makes me hair shiny. I have mixed hair, so it doesn&#x27;t have a great natural shine. I would buy this again. It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair soft and shining. Also, when I placed the order, I expected to receive the product in about 5-7 days;however, I recieved it within 3 days.  This was just awesome!  I would recommend this product for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> I do not blow dry my hair.  When I wash it... I set it in large rollers....  Spray the rollers..  and when I comb it out, spray again.  It holds the shape for several days.. before washing again.....  I can brush it out the next day.. and spray again, If I prefer...  It never builds or gets tacky.  Always looks shiny and has volume...  Highly recommend it....</li>
    <li> Great shine spray- I just use a little to finish my style. A little goes a long way!  I like the fresh scent too. Be sure to test it though- since everyone&#x27;s hair is different. My hair is not fine- so it is possible that it could look a bit greasy if too much is used. Great quality and nice shine without making hair stiff.</li>
    <li> This will make your hair very luscious, but if you have fine hair or hair that gets greasy easily, this is NOT a good option. It also does nothing for flyaways. However, if you are looking for a very sleek style, this is an ideal product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be better in an aerosol-type spray.</li>
    <li> I have super frizzy, kinky-curly, very fine hair that&#x27;s never shiny on its own - it&#x27;s just too dry and all the strands don&#x27;t stick together. I use this as a finish after I&#x27;ve brushed, flattened, and re-curled my hair to add shine and condense curls down to be less frizzy. While not the best frizz control, It does add a little shine without much greasiness. It&#x27;s very lightweight and given my hair texture I didn&#x27;t expect to be gleaming in the sunlight or anything anyway. Works fine.</li>
    <li> I love this product! First time trying it and I love how it just gives the shine but does not make my hair oily I love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of shine sprays.  Most leave your hair oily feeling and weigh it down.  This is lightweight and just great shine!</li>
    <li> Same great shine spray that&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> I really like this shine spray when it first goes on. I only gave it 4 stars though because it doesn&#x27;t last in my curly, frizzy hair. The shine sticks around for a couple of hours then I&#x27;m back to my dry, dull hair. You can&#x27;t beat the price. It sells at retailers for 16.95.</li>
    <li> This product seems to make my hair dirty quicker.  It does create the shine that I was looking for though.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but when it arrived at my house...it had leaked half the bottle out in the packaging. the cardboard box was soaked. Love the Product...shipping? not so much.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and we love all love  it...awesome shine for your hair and we would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product works for me.  It makes my hair shine without making it sticky. I have one at home and one I have to take with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> Good value and no dents in can,</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing!!! It goes very fast for me though.  It maybe lasted 2/3 weeks.  That makes it pretty expensive but the quality is great.</li>
    <li> I really would not recommend this product, it only maintains the shine for a very short time, definitely not work the money, I would not repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> Fabulous shine...I have natural curly (little frizzy) hair and it looks smooooothe!</li>
    <li> A little dab will do ya.  I like this product a lot but it sits fairly heavily on my hair.  I use 2 squirts into my hands and then run them through my hair.</li>
    <li> this really works but you have to have the time to let it dry</li>
    <li> great shine - not sticky</li>
    <li> Already have the salon size of this spray. I highly recommend this 2.50 ounce size -- it&#x27;s super for traveling!.</li>
