      <li>This worked great!</li>
      <li>Thank you for offering a product that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune, and did a wonderful job.</li>
      <li>It works great!  </li>
      <li>Three for the price of one, now THAT&#x27;S what I call a good deal!  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with it and like the price.</li>
      <li>It is a great mascara.</li>
      <li>(For under $20 there are many good eyelash primers; my favorites are Origins and Clinique)</li>
      <li>Most of them cost more than the mascara!  </li>
      <li>I love it.....</li>
      <li>I have to spend more time trying to get an even coat on each eye than I think I should have to spend.</li>
      <li>This does more than anything else to make lashes look fuller and stay fresh-looking all day.</li>
      <li>you can not  find nothing more economical.!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was easy to apply and use.</li>
      <li>This was true for more than 1 tube.</li>
      <li>The product is easy to apply, and covers smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Well, you get what you poay for and these were cheap.</li>
      <li>Nothing comes out of these cheap tubes.</li>
      <li>Smooth and very easy and fast to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Seems to run out quickly.  </li>
      <li>e.l.f is affordable and primes my lashes the same as, or better than,  those that cost 3 or 4 times as much.  </li>
      <li>It certainly makes my lashes look longer and thicker when applied under mascara.</li>
      <li>I will certainly order again if the price does not increase too much.</li>
      <li>You really do get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>I definitely like the way it works as a primer in the way the mascara looks on my lashes, how nicely the mascara stays compared to the same mascara without primer, and improved ease of removal.</li>
      <li>e.l.f primer is better than a more expensive primer I have been using for years... and much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>Going back to the DIOR, expensive but excellent.</li>
      <li>highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I like how it&#x27;s not thick and clumpy like some primers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Primers are great, but all of them are SO expensive.  </li>
      <li>the primer barely comes off the brush..........</li>
      <li>I can get some out, but just barely.</li>

<ol>
    <li> This works wonders before putting on mascara, if you were on the short line for lashes!  I love it.....</li>
    <li> This does more than anything else to make lashes look fuller and stay fresh-looking all day. One coat of &#x27;scara afterwards and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> e.l.f is affordable and primes my lashes the same as, or better than,  those that cost 3 or 4 times as much.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I find that this primer gives my lashes extra length, so I like it. Can&#x27;t complain for the three dollars I paid for it off the ELF website.</li>
    <li> This worked great! It made my mascara go on a lot easier and stayed on a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to apply and use. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it and will keep on using it!</li>
    <li> It is a great mascara. Smooth and very easy and fast to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;And the price ? you can not  find nothing more economical.!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars.  It works great!  I just think that it could last a little longer.  Seems to run out quickly.  It certainly makes my lashes look longer and thicker when applied under mascara.</li>
    <li> You really do get what you pay for.  Price is ridiculously low, but the product is thin and does little to bulk up lashes.  (For under $20 there are many good eyelash primers; my favorites are Origins and Clinique)</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive eyelash primer.  Primers are great, but all of them are SO expensive.  Most of them cost more than the mascara!  I gave e.l.f. a try and will definitely buy it again.  The product is easy to apply, and covers smoothly.  I like how it&#x27;s not thick and clumpy like some primers I&#x27;ve tried.  Three for the price of one, now THAT&#x27;S what I call a good deal!  Thank you for offering a product that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune, and did a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> I definitely like the way it works as a primer in the way the mascara looks on my lashes, how nicely the mascara stays compared to the same mascara without primer, and improved ease of removal. However, I have to repeatedly re-insert the wand into the bottle because it just doesn&#x27;t apply as well as other primer I have used. I have to spend more time trying to get an even coat on each eye than I think I should have to spend. This was true for more than 1 tube. I would buy a different brand in the same price range, but I&#x27;ll keep using this instead of the pricey primers.</li>
    <li> Well, you get what you poay for and these were cheap. Going back to the DIOR, expensive but excellent. Nothing comes out of these cheap tubes. The only reaosn I continue to use this product that does nothing for my lashes primier-wise, is because I have to...I paid for 3! What a waste of $.</li>
    <li> This mascara primer was not exactly what I was looking for......the primer barely comes off the brush..........</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these were meant to be samples or not but there is so little product in the bottle.  I have to continually try to get some on the brush to make it seem like I&#x27;m putting any on at all.  I wish I&#x27;d only purchased the single pack.</li>
    <li> It seems to help build up my limp lashes.  I&#x27;m happy with it and like the price.</li>
    <li> e.l.f primer is better than a more expensive primer I have been using for years... and much cheaper.  I will certainly order again if the price does not increase too much.</li>
    <li> Is there anything in it???? I have used other primers and this is the worst. There hardly seems to be anything in it! I can get some out, but just barely. I know it&#x27;s a bargain price, but you get what you pay for! I&#x27;m going back to Lancome!</li>
