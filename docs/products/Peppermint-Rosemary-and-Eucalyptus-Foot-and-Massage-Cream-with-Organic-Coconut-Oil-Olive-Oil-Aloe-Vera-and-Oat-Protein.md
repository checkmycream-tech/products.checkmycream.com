      <li>Melissa was very responsive via email and made sure that I was a happy customer in the end.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products that advertise they help with foot pain</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I still love it.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance and the soothing.</li>
      <li>I swear that I sleep better when I use this lotion.</li>
      <li>and I love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I believe this company deserves a degree of confidence, and I am persuaded to give them a better opportunity to satisfy me as a customer.</li>
      <li>I bought another cream that works better for me and the problem that I have.</li>
      <li>Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>The aromatherapy side effects are a bonus without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>The cream is exactly what I was looking for as it has a smooth and non-greasy glide that is great for the masseur during the massage and prevents clothes from sticking after use.</li>
      <li>I love the feel and the light scent of this product.</li>
      <li>Thus, a fabulous product at a fabulous price!  </li>
      <li>It is easily massaged into my feet and has helped with my discomfort.  </li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS MUCH BETTER than my former one, I am SO happy to have found it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend:):):):)</li>
      <li>Works fine for moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and a light refreshing scent!</li>
      <li>Great for feet and smaller areas on the body.  </li>
      <li>Many people who have to be gluten free also avoid wheat in lotions that are absorbed in the skin.</li>
      <li>I will say that the shipping took a bit longer than I was hoping for BUT the seller was very prompt in responding to my questions and very easy to deal with so that helped out a bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rich</li>
      <li>Originally this product did contain wheat, but now it has been reformulated (as of January 2015) and oat protein is used instead.</li>
      <li>In reading the ingredients, I was actually excited.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After posting this original review I received a courteous email from Natural Escapes, LLC.  </li>
      <li>Cool to my feet, softens  my skin.</li>
      <li>the cool peppermint feel after I&#x27;ve massaged my feet.  </li>
      <li>Really soothing and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Thanks for providing an outstanding lotion.</li>
      <li>even though I’ve only been using the cream for a couple of days, i feel confident in saying that with continued use, I’m sure my feet will see improvement.</li>
      <li>At this point, I cannot say one way or the other how good the product is, but I CAN state that it is rare to have a company care about their quality and customer satisfaction like this, and even more rare for them to go out of their way to make it right.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>My favorite product by far!</li>
      <li>Applying this cream right after my bath/shower easily lasts 24 hrs and you do not have to use that much.</li>
      <li>This lotion is smooth and massages into the skin really well.</li>
      <li>With this kind of customer care, I could not leave the former review as it was written.</li>
      <li>It really does a great job of moisturizing and soothing without stinging or being overly cooling as other products are prone to do.</li>
      <li>You really get a good fresh scent from it and not an overpowering peppermint rush as you do with some other products out there.</li>
      <li>I even used it on my hands because it makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I expected a &amp;#34;menthol-like&amp;#34; experience, feeling warm and</li>
      <li>I am gong to try the body cream next time, but I love the peppermint coolness and fragrance.</li>
      <li>Most lotions I have tried for my neuropathy, clump together or feel gritty and sticky.</li>
      <li>Price is comparable to other lotions I&#x27;ve used that weren&#x27;t as effective.  </li>
      <li>The scent of this particular cream is quite pleasant yet it is not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and it absorbs very well.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This product may work better for other people but did not do as well for me.  </li>
      <li>I particularly like</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the most enjoyable foot treat. It smells divine and moisturizes your feet with leaving a greasy feel. I swear that I sleep better when I use this lotion. I plan to never run out of stock of this!</li>
    <li> I am writing this as a tentative review.  Here&#x27;s my story:  after receiving this item and trying it out, I was quite disappointed in that it was so thin and watery and did not seem to be of good quality.  After posting a review stating this, I was immediately contacted by Melissa, who represented the manufacturer.  Melissa expressed her concern over my disappointment and was offering to do everything in her power to make it right.  She also explained that the thin, watery consistency was most likely caused by the product having been frozen in transit.  At this point, I cannot say one way or the other how good the product is, but I CAN state that it is rare to have a company care about their quality and customer satisfaction like this, and even more rare for them to go out of their way to make it right.  I applaud this company, and am awaiting a replacement bottle to try again.  At that time I will update this review.</li>
    <li> My wife will testify that it works for her diabetic nerve damaged feet. What else can I say.&lt;br /&gt;She did say that she doesn&#x27;t know just what it is that is helping just that it does work.</li>
    <li> Works fine for moisturizing.  Does not help with my swelling and tenderness in my heel area. This product may work better for other people but did not do as well for me.  I bought another cream that works better for me and the problem that I have. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels great on your skin too.</li>
    <li> I love the feel and the light scent of this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for massaging but not a lot of &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; sensation. that I expected.</li>
    <li> At the end of the day, this cream is like putting a soothing/healing sock on. it smells &amp; feels great. even though I’ve only been using the cream for a couple of days, i feel confident in saying that with continued use, I’m sure my feet will see improvement. it was delivered immediately, before disclosed estimated timeframe. love the product, excellent service. thanks!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Not even a good moisturizer</li>
    <li> Very good cream I highly recommend:):):):)</li>
    <li> I got this for a group of people as one of some gifts after a mindfulness retreat. I also got one for myself.  I love it</li>
    <li> I bought the product because I was looking for a good massage oil alternative. I use it primarily for upper and lower back massages. The scent of this particular cream is quite pleasant yet it is not overwhelming. The cream is exactly what I was looking for as it has a smooth and non-greasy glide that is great for the masseur during the massage and prevents clothes from sticking after use. I have not had any issues with the pump thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note about Natural Escapes, they went above and beyond when there were issues with the USPS delivery. Melissa was very responsive via email and made sure that I was a happy customer in the end. I hope the company comes up with additional varieties for their massage cream product line.</li>
    <li> This lotion will make your feet feel like a million bucks. Rejuvenates tired achy feet and helps promote circulation and which helps keep swelling down. Not to mention how soft and supple your feet will feel with regular use.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST foot cream. It&#x27;s so rich and I love the fragrance. My feet are doing a happy dance.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great, however it did not have that cooling, tingling sensation I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! You really get a good fresh scent from it and not an overpowering peppermint rush as you do with some other products out there. It&#x27;s not too greasy and it absorbs very well. I was really happy with it. I will say that the shipping took a bit longer than I was hoping for BUT the seller was very prompt in responding to my questions and very easy to deal with so that helped out a bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Been using this for almost a year! Great massage cream. I still love it. It really does a great job of moisturizing and soothing without stinging or being overly cooling as other products are prone to do. My favorite product by far!</li>
    <li> I have been meaning to write this review for ages. I was using a VERY expensive foot cream from Kiehl&#x27;s and they stopped selling it. So I went online, thinking that I would never find a product as good as the Kiehl&#x27;s one, even though I was not happy about price, especially since I recently retired and am now on a fixed income!! THIS PRODUCT IS MUCH BETTER than my former one, I am SO happy to have found it. Works like a charm, price is right, lasts a long time. I am diabetic and my feet get so dry. Applying this cream right after my bath/shower easily lasts 24 hrs and you do not have to use that much. Thus, a fabulous product at a fabulous price!  I am now branching out to try some of the other products! If they are as great as this one, I am sold! I highly recommend this foot cream, I have tried them all over the years and this one by far is the best! Thank you! AE Haley, Brookline, MA</li>
    <li> In reading the ingredients, I was actually excited.  I expected a &amp;#34;menthol-like&amp;#34; experience, feeling warm and then rich - along with the other natural ingredients listed - this lotion cream was sure to be a home run!  But it wasn&#x27;t any of that to me. The application of it gave me no great relief or feeling of  &amp;#34;Ahhhh&amp;#34; whatsoever. I will try to use it up since I bought it. But it appears to me I have &amp;#34;again&amp;#34; fell prey to great advertising. And of course, it could &amp;#34;just be me&amp;#34; - but this is my honest review, documenting my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;After posting this original review I received a courteous email from Natural Escapes, LLC.  Their concern was that I expected results not claimed typical, considering the ingredients or the prescribed uses for the product.  Re-reading their statements concerning the product, the advertising on Amazon.com, and the product label, I do feel my review could be interpreted too harshly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I considered that it is possible my expectations of the product have exceeded its advertised benefits. I wanted a menthol-like &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34;, which is not provided by this product - but evidently such a sensation is provided by another product they offer, (&amp;#34;Peppermint &amp; Menthol Cooling Cream&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have offered me a choice of a refund, or a replacement (consisting of the other product). With this kind of customer care, I could not leave the former review as it was written. So I posted this edit, attempting to be fair.  I believe this company deserves a degree of confidence, and I am persuaded to give them a better opportunity to satisfy me as a customer.</li>
    <li> Many people who have to be gluten free also avoid wheat in lotions that are absorbed in the skin. Originally this product did contain wheat, but now it has been reformulated (as of January 2015) and oat protein is used instead. So now I have changed my rating to 5 stars because I like the ingredients rosemary, peppermint, and eucalyptus in a foot lotion.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency and it smells really good. I even used it on my hands because it makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and is soothing. It also feels great -- moisturizing, but not too greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this! Very moisturizing and a light refreshing scent!</li>
    <li> Used this to give my girlfriend a foot massage. She loved it! It was not messy and did not take a lot.</li>
    <li> My clients, as well as myself, LOVE LOVE LOVE this. The aroma is perfect, and NOT overbearing...It is a great way to utilize aroma therapy.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter and she loved the smell.  We were at a restaurant and she immediately rubbed it into her hands.</li>
    <li> This is nice with healthy ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great Fresh feeling on my feet is what I experience everytime I apply this cream! I&#x27;m very pleased with everything this cream does! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I have had bunions for years and they cause me a lot of pain.  This cream not only makes my feet soft and smooth, but it also helps take away the pain from my bunions because of the essential oils!</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product.  I like the creamy consistency and the wonderful aroma!  I am a diabetic and have very dry and painful feet so I was looking for a lotion I could but on at night for comfort and to ease the dryness and this does both.  It is easily massaged into my feet and has helped with my discomfort.  I especially like that it is made in the U.S.A. and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> does the job, just wished for a more prominent peppermint  quality</li>
    <li> I have ordered this twice now.  I particularly like the cool peppermint feel after I&#x27;ve massaged my feet.  I work in a house museum&lt;br /&gt;as a guide and every 45 minutes I am leading a group up a 3-story elliptical stairway, so by the time I&#x27;m finished for the day, my feet&lt;br /&gt;need some pampering.  And this product does it!</li>
    <li> Love the minty coolness on tired feet.  Really soothing and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing foot lotion for dry, tired aching feet.  I ordered a second bottle for my daughter who has problems with dry scaling feet.  I gave her a couple of foot rubs with it while she visited me and I&#x27;m hoping she will see the results I see.  Sometimes my foot discomfort keeps me awake but a little of this lotion relieves the restlessness and I can sleep.  Price is comparable to other lotions I&#x27;ve used that weren&#x27;t as effective.  Rubs in and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have a number of issues with my feet! They are dry, calloused, and I have psoriasis. I am always looking for a good foot lotion or cream to treat these monsters. I purchased this lotion a few weeks ago, and I love it. It wasn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it woud be, but it works. my feet felt great after one application. I am gong to try the body cream next time, but I love the peppermint coolness and fragrance.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Cool to my feet, softens  my skin. I am on my second bottle now and it is great stuff, Bob Flinn</li>
    <li> The customer support was excellent.  ; )</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Great for feet and smaller areas on the body.  Needs to be reapplied a lot, but I do love it!</li>
    <li> Thanks for providing an outstanding lotion. Most lotions I have tried for my neuropathy, clump together or feel gritty and sticky. This lotion is smooth and massages into the skin really well. Plus it works for my painful neuropathy. I use this every night. My feet are extremely soft too, thanks to this lotion.  This lotion does not have an overwhelming scent, just perfect. Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and the soothing. invigorating effect that it has on my feet which have given me trouble over a long period of time. Need something which is calming on the nerves due to neuropathy, yet promotes circulation and this product appears to do that.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotion/creams that I have experienced in a long time.  Helps with foot pain and anywhere else there is discomfort.  The aromatherapy side effects are a bonus without being overwhelming. It is not greasy and only a little goes a long way.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I always receive the product promptly.  I have tried many products that advertise they help with foot pain but this is the only one that really works.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best foot product I&#x27;ve used.  It smells wonderful and makes your feet very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this foot cream!  It moisturizes well without feeling greasy and smells great.  I received it two days after ordering and there was a personalized hand written thank you note on the packing list.  What a great way to do business!</li>
