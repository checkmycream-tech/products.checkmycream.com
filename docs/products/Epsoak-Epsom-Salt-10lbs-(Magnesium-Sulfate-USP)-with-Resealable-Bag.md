      <li>I like the packaging because it&#x27;s resealable and free shipping</li>
      <li>Love it and bloom profusely with large roses.  </li>
      <li>The quality is very high and the way my skin reacts to them is markedly better than the store bought Epsom Salt.  </li>
      <li>Really makes bathing more relaxing</li>
      <li>They were shipped and delivered quickly.  </li>
      <li>Wow, 10 pounds is a lot of salt, more than I had expected when I ordered:  but the price is great and I finally found a good place to stash it.  </li>
      <li>but it works just great for a big old bag of bathtime fun.</li>
      <li>Then again, you can add your own scents with essential oils.</li>
      <li>Once right after pruning and again in 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love making my own scented bath salts and the big bag lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>We bought ten pounds, used it up and ordered more.</li>
      <li>This is the first time we&#x27;ve bought Epsom salt in this quantity</li>
      <li>I use it to soak in the tub, but recently found out it is also good for some plants I recently put in the garden.  </li>
      <li>We argue who&#x27;s getting into the tub first thanks to these comforting salts.  </li>
      <li>10 lbs is a large amount</li>
      <li>I do like that it is a pure product, 100% magnesium.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these salts!</li>
      <li>I regret that I bought so much.</li>
      <li>like it, it a real deal</li>
      <li>Ships fairly fast</li>
      <li>but I really wish it was scented.</li>
      <li>SF Epsom Bath Salts dissolve very quickly and they left my skin softer than the standard epsom salt.  </li>
      <li>i have aches and pains and bad migraines that hurt my body and stuff, this is better than advil!!!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a better price and other makers add scents to them and think it&#x27;s fine to gauge the customers.</li>
      <li>This particular Epsom Salt has a &amp;#34;flake like&amp;#34; feel to it, unlike the ones I&#x27;ve brought in the local pharmacy which feels more like small crystal rocks.</li>
      <li>Epsom salt baths relieve my arthritis and can completely rid my body of any muscle tension - completely.</li>
      <li>Epsom Salt is a natural organic fertilizer.  </li>
      <li>The return policy was that I would have to send the salts back, wait for a refund and then reorder, which seemed like too much.</li>
      <li>Skin feels so soft afterwards.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I made some for myself and completely agree.  </li>
      <li>I have been using them simi-regularly to try and clear up some problem areas on my legs and back and have seen considerable improvement!  </li>
      <li>With Dr. Teal&#x27;s I felt the effects immediately; aromatherapy, soft skin, and deep relaxation.</li>
      <li>snips on either side invariably end up tearing the bag off below the resealing strips, making the bags totally and completely non-resealable.</li>
      <li>nice crystals but why so expensive?</li>
      <li>I really like this company&#x27;s products, and have ordered other salts from them as well.  </li>
      <li>My better half likes a weekly foot soak, and I use it occasionally in my soaking tub, with some subtle fragrant oils added.  </li>

    <li> Nice Epsom salts, great price.  They were shipped and delivered quickly.  I ordered the 10 pound bag - you cannot beat the price. They lasted a really long time.  I really like this company&#x27;s products, and have ordered other salts from them as well.  These do not have any scent.  I will continue to order them.  I will order again and recommend these.</li>
    <li> great product and prompt shipping</li>
    <li> Great for soothing baths. Superior product to anything you purchase at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Great value.  After I cut my roses back each spring I &amp;#34;feed&amp;#34; them Epsom Salt.  Once right after pruning and again in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;They Love it and bloom profusely with large roses.  So, this is a great buy for me. And SanFrancisco SALT co delivers promptly and I order every year.</li>
    <li> This is the first time we&#x27;ve bought Epsom salt in this quantity and I&#x27;m happy with both the price and quality.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I love making my own scented bath salts and the big bag lasts a long time.  You could do several make and take type parties with just one bag.</li>
    <li> Wow, 10 pounds is a lot of salt, more than I had expected when I ordered:  but the price is great and I finally found a good place to stash it.  My better half likes a weekly foot soak, and I use it occasionally in my soaking tub, with some subtle fragrant oils added.

    <li> i have aches and pains and bad migraines that hurt my body and stuff, this is better than advil!!!</li>
    <li> Love taking baths with this salt.</li>
    <li> This feels magical. I really enjoy taking a bath with this.</li>
    <li> No way as good as Dr. Teal&#x27;s. No way. With Dr. Teal&#x27;s I felt the effects immediately; aromatherapy, soft skin, and deep relaxation. This Epsoak sucks as far as delivering any of these advantages. I regret that I bought so much. I think I will return.</li>
    <li> nice crystals but why so expensive? walgreens is half the price.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell the difference between the two epsom salts</li>
    <li> This is an excellent deal.  Large quantity for an amazing price.  Ships fairly fast and I love soaking my feet in this.  Unfortuantely I do not have a bath tub any longer, but I can make up with it with foot soaks!</li>
    <li> We have not Epsom Salt in our small village; we use this to soak our feet.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Have ordered several times! I will keep ordering and using the products. Happy with all aspects of the purchase.</li>
    <li> Epsom salt baths relieve my arthritis and can completely rid my body of any muscle tension - completely. I like the packaging because it&#x27;s resealable and free shipping makes it a no brainer for me! Love it.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Bag is heavy duty and resealable.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> These salts are wonderful for soaking. Skin feels so soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;We have Lyme disease and must detox the toxins out. Thirty minutes in a soak with this product,  peroxide and baking soda is part of our daily routine!</li>
    <li> not much to say but I love taking baths with epsom salt and this is good quality for a great price.</li>
    <li> GO to the dead sea in Israel.  It will work better.</li>
    <li> I like the bath salts, but was disappointed when the package arrived and the bag was sliced open so all the salts were all over the box. I&#x27;m not sure who was the responsible party for the damaged packed. The return policy was that I would have to send the salts back, wait for a refund and then reorder, which seemed like too much. I just kept the salts and am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to the store Epsom Salts.  Stumbled across this option and the reviews impressed me.  Several I noticed and some type of skin issue.  I have been using them simi-regularly to try and clear up some problem areas on my legs and back and have seen considerable improvement!  The quality is very high and the way my skin reacts to them is markedly better than the store bought Epsom Salt.  If you have skin issues, please consider checking these out.</li>
    <li> Bath time with this stuff is majestic. If you like being majestic, don&#x27;t hesitate to take some bath salts. Baths are for salting, people.</li>
    <li> I decided to make jars of scented bath salts for Christmas gifts this past year and having done this for myself in the past, I have tried many different brands of epsom salts.  This one is by far the best.  Everyone complimented me on how great they were, how well they dissolved in the tub and how soft they felt.  I made some for myself and completely agree.  In fact, I&#x27;m back online today buying another 20lb bag just for myself!  In case you&#x27;re wondering, I get a good sized mason jar and fill it about 3/4 full with the salts.  I add some essential oils (one with just lavender oil and another with spearmint and eucalyptus) and some grapeseed oil. They are amazing and I look forward to my nightly bath ritual.  I highly recommend these salts!</li>
    <li> nothing better than an epsom salt bath, great product and price</li>
    <li> My product arrived as described and on time. I&#x27;ve used the Epsom Salt an an ingredient in making personalized bath salts. I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering!</li>
    <li> nice,it is perfect for bath salts, pretty too</li>
    <li> We argue who&#x27;s getting into the tub first thanks to these comforting salts.  If you&#x27;re having aches and pains and need some help falling and staying asleep...this helps.  Great product, great company.  We bought ten pounds, used it up and ordered more.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a nice foot soak! I wanted a big bag because I heard that the magnesium in Epson Salt can help prevent or lessen morning sickness. Since I had it so bad with my first, I figured I will give it a try. Even if it doesn&#x27;t end up preventing morning sickness, it is still awesome to soak in after a long day!</li>
    <li> Epsom salts are useful for so many things.  It was nice to be able to get the large bag size.</li>
    <li> Epsom Salt is a natural organic fertilizer.  Don&#x27;t invest your hard earned money on &amp;#34;Miracle Gro&amp;#34; or other plant food, Epsom Salt will help your plants to 1) Improve seed germination; 2) increase nutrient absorption; 3) have greener plants.  I&#x27;ve learned that plants which are not getting enough magnesium can be identified by their yellowing leaves. This is because magnesium is an essential component in the production of chlorophyll. Try sprinkling Epsom salt around your plants to achieve healthier foliage. About 1 tablespoon per 12 inches of height once a month will benefit the plants in your vegetable garden, as well as any trees, shrubs, flowers and grasses you want to green up.  It also deters slugs.  For your house plant, I add one tablespoon of epsom salt per gallon of water in EVERY watering session.  This particular Epsom Salt has a &amp;#34;flake like&amp;#34; feel to it, unlike the ones I&#x27;ve brought in the local pharmacy which feels more like small crystal rocks.This type of Salt absorbs very quickly in soil and water and it is genuinely pleasant to handle.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the price increase, too.  I do like that it is a pure product, 100% magnesium.  I use it to soak in the tub, but recently found out it is also good for some plants I recently put in the garden.  Who knew??</li>
    <li> like it, it a real deal</li>
    <li> Excellent and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!! Very pure and fresh bath!!!</li>
    <li> Came super quick and great product</li>
    <li> I genuinely like these epsom salts. However, there are recurring issues with the bags they come in. The handy &amp;#34;tear here&amp;#34; snips on either side invariably end up tearing the bag off below the resealing strips, making the bags totally and completely non-resealable. This has happened with every single 10 pound bag I have purchased, so I suppose the only answer is to use scissors to open the bag, and utterly ignore the suggested &amp;#34;tear here&amp;#34; snips.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great quality and quantity for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells Great!! I have not have a chance to use it, but it feels and looks like regular bath salts.  I look forward to using this one!</li>
    <li> This big bag of epsom salt is not for cooking but it works just great for a big old bag of bathtime fun.</li>
    <li> I usually buy my epsom salt from Costco which is much cheaper.  BUT, there is a noticeable difference in quality.  SF Epsom Bath Salts dissolve very quickly and they left my skin softer than the standard epsom salt.  Perfect soak post massage!</li>
    <li> Nice quality salts. I did not have any packaging issues like others have said. Package came vacuum sealed to keep out moisture.</li>
    <li> I use it for my feet, it&#x27;s really nice</li>
    <li> I have ordered almost 100 lbs this year. I&#x27;m addicted to these salts! so relaxing and cleansing from San Francisco Salt Company</li>
    <li> I love these.When i get back from work I hurt all over from standing and lifting heavy things all day. Perfect to soak in and relax after a stressful day!</li>
    <li> Really makes bathing more relaxing but I really wish it was scented. Then again, you can add your own scents with essential oils. The packaging is really good and moisture doesn&#x27;t get in and clump up the salt. 10 lbs is a large amount but I suggest the 20 lbs bag for even better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value however is what got me. You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a better price and other makers add scents to them and think it&#x27;s fine to gauge the customers. Just buy this and add the oils your self.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Nothing better for detoxing baths!  Easy and convenient.</li>
</ol>
