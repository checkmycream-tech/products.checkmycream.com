      <li>Apparently I wasn&#x27;t the only one, because they introduced the &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34;</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m an adult male. I ran across this shampoo in a toiletry package in a hotel.  I used it and was pretty surprised at what it did: I was able to comb my hair without having to plaster it down to make it manageable. My hair is pretty tough and unruly and hard to comb but this shampoo/conditioner combo worked exceedingly well without having to soak in a separate conditioner. Hair was clean and soft.  I recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Only shampoo I have used for years, Shipping is excellent, price is too!</li>
    <li> Nothing great, just okay.</li>
    <li> I can NEVER brush my hair right out of the shower because of the tangles, but the FIRST time I used it, I was able to right when I got done!!! It was like magic!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of shampoo. This is the easiest way to buy it and it came wrapped so it wouldn&#x27;t spill into the box it was shipped it. It didn&#x27;t spill!</li>
    <li> Good one and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was despondent when Pantene changed their formula, years and years ago.  Apparently I wasn&#x27;t the only one, because they introduced the &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; line shortly after.  There have been variations in packaging and naming, but this is the stuff.  I absolutely hate it when I have to use something, especially hotel shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried some high-end stuff, some which is pretty good, but they&#x27;re literally 3 or 4 times the price of Pantene.</li>
    <li> Great product. Good value.</li>
    <li> Works great on my labradoodle&#x27;s tangle prone fur. Make him soft, helps with his tangles, and make him smell so nice.</li>
    <li> Love Pantene 2 in 1 shampoo conditioner. Smells good and keeps hair healthy</li>
    <li> I was excited to hopefully find a 2 in 1 that I could use. My hair is very thin and gets greasy looking within 12 hours of shampooing. My thought was get a 2 in 1 shampoo and maybe my hair wont be producing so much oil. First day I loved it worked great, hair smelt nice and my hair was manageable and shiny. Now on day 5 and everyday has gotten worse since after the first day. The &amp;#34;crown&amp;#34; of my head is like I smeared Vaseline all over my hair this shampoo leaves a film on my hair thats gross. Just after blow drying my hair this morning it was very unmanageable as with no products in my hair I could get it to stand up on edge and it would move. All in all awful product that I will be throwing away. On to the next shampoo.....</li>
    <li> Too much conditioning for normal hair, but it does give great shine.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo wife and two daughters all love it, no buildup, smells good.</li>
    <li> Very good however  it has been oit of stock on subscribe and save worrh the price does the jon</li>
    <li> great shampoo, arrive on time</li>
