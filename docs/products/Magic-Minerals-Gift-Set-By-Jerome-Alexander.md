      <li>Also I am light completed and the powder looks white on me</li>
      <li>For me, it is much better than the other mineral products.</li>
      <li>I use a green tinted liquid concealer that works better.</li>
      <li>I used to use Estee and Pure and Bare , this one is the bomb.</li>
      <li>and it was really hot outside</li>
      <li>I applied with the sponge that it came with and was honestly surprised.</li>
      <li>Natural and covers all skin flaws,as it has specks of color that blend with tour skin type.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and will continue to use it, So thank you Jerome :)</li>
    <li> It did not totally conceal the flaws on my face and it was too powdery looking after applying the product. I use a green tinted liquid concealer that works better.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I had this product before and it is great for any complextion.  This was a really great price for the product.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  I have been using Jerome Alexander makeup for about a year.  For me, it is much better than the other mineral products.</li>
    <li> This is the best mineral make up I have ever used.Natural and covers all skin flaws,as it has specks of color that blend with tour skin type.Great product,</li>
    <li> I like my compact I carry it wherever I go the minerals stay on and it looks as if my skin was flawless.</li>
    <li> I liked the product before I ordered.  it really works well on my skin  very easy to use and I take one everywhere</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve used it faithfully now for over 2 years.  It does not break me out,  covers redness really well, and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that I have to cover up with a towel before applying it because it&#x27;s a powder--don&#x27;t want it on my clothes.</li>
    <li> Powder does not cover I have acne scars and the powder does not cover them. Also I am light completed and the powder looks white on me</li>
    <li> I use this for concealer for under the eyes and for any areas that need covering up.It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Like everything about this make-up.  It does exactly what is says it will do. Came with instructions, works perfectly.  Would buy it again. And yes I recommend it.  Mrs. VCB</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product ...just wish it was the large one like I ordered when I first started using it</li>
    <li> I like it better than the Bare Mins for color and application, it doesn&#x27;t fly away from the brush.  It adds a beautiful look to my face. It just gives a natural healthy look to my face without artificial coloring.</li>
    <li> Garbage. I had a feeling it would be. My complexion was too dark for it. I looked pasty and washed out. Not made for African American women who are DARKER...more so for light skinned girls maybe. You KNOW this is a bad product when hey refunded me and said I didn&#x27;t have to return the product.</li>
    <li> Love the finish on my face. Mascara had to be thrown away though.</li>
    <li> Works great but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased Magic Minerals it was in a much larger container and it seemed to cover better.  This doesn&#x27;t cover as good and seems to disappear quickly, not only off my face but out of the container.</li>
    <li> I really liked this item.  It covers well however, the brush keeps losing its bristles.</li>
    <li> I have used magic minerals for spot areas and it has always worked really well. This one I got was different in color. I don&#x27;t think the consistency is there with the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get mine from amazon, but instead from the local dollar store. It was marked down to $20...I&#x27;m not the type to pay $20 for a powder but I&#x27;m a sucker for clearance -.- SOooo I decided eh...what the heck. So I bought it...opened up as soon as i was in the car. I had been to the beach and it was really hot outside so my face was red and shiny. I applied with the sponge that it came with and was honestly surprised. I&#x27;m really fair skinned and the powder looked like it would be too dark but it wasnt! It evened out my skin and no more shiny-ness. It lasted for a while too before i had to touch it up. Now i wear it everyday...without concealer or foundation under it. I would definitely buy it again :D</li>
    <li> I came upon this  by accident and thought it was some cheap junk. I was mistaken. Once I began to wear it-my skin  glowed and I have received many compliments . I  like the large 32g size and order more than one. Easy and it&#x27;s beautiful. Maybe the reason they don&#x27;t need you to RETURN it ...is because you - used it on YOUR skin.Who wants it?&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a light to med colored base . I used to use Estee and Pure and Bare , this one is the bomb.</li>
