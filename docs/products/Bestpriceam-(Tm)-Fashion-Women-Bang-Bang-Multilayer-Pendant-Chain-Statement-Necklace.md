    <li> Absolutely terrible.  Wast of money it was tangled and already tarnished when it arrived</li>
    <li> Cute chain. Nice length.</li>
    <li> Really nice neckale. I&#x27;ve been looking for a double neckale for a while now and finally I got one I really like.

Arrived before original delivery date too!</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s cute. Looks like the picture. The chain is longer than I thought but i like it a lot. It came in much earlier than expected (said it would arrive between 7/1 &amp; 7/22 - it came in the mail on 6/21) I&#x27;m happy with it overall just wish it was shorter.</li>
    <li> The necklace is very pretty but it tangles up around my neck alot. Kind of a pain to wear because it just starts eventually choking me the longer I wear.</li>

    <li> Really cute for the price</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. The necklace is not dainty and cute as it appears. It&#x27;s much bigger and looks like junk. Definitely got what I paid for here.</li>
    <li> I received this beautiful necklace in a timely manner.  After using the necklace, I noticed that it gets tangled very quickly and it takes extra work to unlink it to straighten out the layers.  I would not recommend this necklace.  Sorry. Thank you.</li>

    <li> lays very nice on the neck, especially with a white sweater!!</li>
    <li> Cheap and seller is dishonest.</li>
