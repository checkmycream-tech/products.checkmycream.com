      <li>not the full replacement that i was looking for, but it&#x27;s still a good item.</li>
      <li>but if you are looking for something better I would recommend buying the norelco shaver 6100.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a full head replacement</li>
      <li>This shaver can be good for someone who does not have a lot of facial hair</li>
      <li>Better than the blades provided when razor was new.</li>
      <li>Nice having the swappable ends rather than a drawer-full of different devices.</li>
      <li>Nice to have several replacement blades at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>With fresh blades, this handy little shaver keeps on trucking.</li>

      <li>Although this razor is not the best I ever had, the heads are not too expensive and seem to last about a year before you have to replace them.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s worth it to just buy a new one. :O</li>
      <li>minor issue, and it may be just me, but I never seem to get a full years life out out replacement&lt;</li>
      <li>But these seem to be sharp as new and are working fine so far.</li>

    <li> Work as they should, no problem putting/replacing them, although I did not realize the didn&#x27;t come with the plastic snap ring, they are a little pricey but, what razor&#x27;s aren&#x27;t these days.</li>
    <li> Works great. Razor was starting to get dull and it was taking longer to shave, this solved the issue.</li>
    <li> Good replacement, ordered from Fesco Distributors, Inc.</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed. Nice to have several replacement blades at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> not the full replacement that i was looking for, but it&#x27;s still a good item. I was looking for a full head replacement</li>
    <li> Made my old electric Shaver run like new.  No more bumps and red spots on my neck since I replaced the blades.  Also cut the time spent shaving in half with the new blades.</li>
    <li> Just great and delivered fast!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. This is the only place I could find these blades too. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use this for my electric shaver, they are good but I would prefer to have a three head shaver. This shaver can be good for someone who does not have a lot of facial hair but if you are looking for something better I would recommend buying the norelco shaver 6100.</li>
    <li> Got the replacement heads on time and with no hassles. Although this razor is not the best I ever had, the heads are not too expensive and seem to last about a year before you have to replace them. But by then you really HAVE to replace them. You start getting a really bad shave. But these seem to be sharp as new and are working fine so far.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and very high quality.  Also quiet and efficient in operation.  Very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor issue, and it may be just me, but I never seem to get a full years life out out replacement&lt;br /&gt;heads.  I do have a relatively thick beard and I do shave daily and sometimes even more&lt;br /&gt;frequently.  So it is possible that others may get a longer life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I think the wider spacing between the cutting blades is a design improvement which&lt;br /&gt;I believe makes for easier cleaning.</li>
    <li> did the trick  good product</li>
    <li> Better than the blades provided when razor was new.</li>
    <li> This item came with the razor</li>
    <li> works better, good product</li>
    <li> Even though replaced, I didn&#x27;t feel they were that sharp! Sometimes it&#x27;s worth it to just buy a new one. :O</li>
    <li> Perfect head replacement item.</li>
    <li> My Husband was very pleased with these he had no problem putting them in and they work very well.</li>
    <li> With fresh blades, this handy little shaver keeps on trucking. Nice having the swappable ends rather than a drawer-full of different devices.</li>
    <li> Does not include plastic insert that I lost and connects the razors to the shaver head</li>
