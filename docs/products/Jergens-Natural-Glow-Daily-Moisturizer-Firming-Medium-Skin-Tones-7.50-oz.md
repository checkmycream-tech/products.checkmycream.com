<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years. I use the medium to tan version. I like using this as a moisturizer under my makeup. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t dry out. i buy the smaller bottles and keep them in my makeup back. It&#x27;s also great as a body lotion and totally worth the price. I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my complexion so if you&#x27;re buying it to look like you have a tan I don&#x27;t feel like it will really work for that. Its not odorless but i love the scent.  It doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s for sensitive skin but my skin is very sensitive and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breakouts while using this product.</li>
    <li> I use this year round. Love it! I apply after I shower and wait 10 minutes before getting dressed to help prevent streaking. I even use it on my hands though I use a regular lotion first on hands, knees, ankles and elbows to keep the color more uniform.  It did cause me to break out for the 1st week but having sensitive skin all my life I continued to use it through the &amp;#34;adjustment period&amp;#34; my skin usually needs and haven&#x27;t had a problem since. The smell isn&#x27;t so bad but it is distinctive so I do use it at night and shower again in the morning so my coworkers don&#x27;t have to smell it all day.  It&#x27;s definitely the best smelling self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; part, didn&#x27;t really have much to test that on but I continue to use this one because the smell is slightly different (better) than the regular formula.&lt;br /&gt;I stick with the fair-med because I&#x27;m really pale and the darker tanners do turn me orange no matter what brand.  This tanner isn&#x27;t gonna give you a super noticeable tan.  No one is gonna ask you if you just got back from the beach.  So just be sure you know what you&#x27;re getting.  It gives my skin a subtle coloring that looks way better than my natural paper white and is just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This worked great. I just wanted a little color for the summer and this did the job. Not too dark and no streaks.</li>
    <li> Occasionally leaves mildly noticeable streaking. However, this is a small payoff, and is less problematic once you get used to applying it. I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now.  I still look natural, but no longer blind passersby.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t streak or stain. Looks natural. Never orange. Smells great and leaves skin soft. Can&#x27;t think of one negative thing about it.</li>
    <li> I got this to preserve my self-tan (highly recommend St. Tropez by the way). It smells really lovely, almost a beachy scent that fades away after some time (definitely not over-powering). My skin can be erratic and fairly sensitive, but this product has not given me any adverse reactions. I only wish it came in a larger size as everyday, full-body usage would deplete this bottle very quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product almost a month ago, yet it was still delivered a week late. When it was finally delivered, I was charged four dollars at the door for shipping. Upon opening the box, I found a bottle of this product for medium to tan skin tones, not fair to medium like I payed for. The lid was taped shut with scotch tape, as though one might tape it when sticking it in a travel suitcase to take on a trip, to make sure jr wouldn&#x27;t leak. I can&#x27;t be sure, as I have nothing to compare it to, but it also feels as though there is excessive empty space in the bottle, and I wonder if it is a used product.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it was just the specific seller, but I will not be purchasing this online again.</li>
    <li> I liked this product better than most.  It is not as orange in appearance as most other self tanning products I have tried.  The price is nice and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking dry.</li>
    <li> worked on my bald head in early spring, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since spent enough time in the sun to darken up the glaring white bald head I get from the winter...and I don&#x27;t use it anymore...but it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;goes on easy, washes off the hands easy, and in a few days you can tell a gentle tanned effect.  I think I used it for around 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased Jergen&#x27;s natural glow several years ago, after it first came out. It worked really well, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell. I decided to go ahead and try it again recently because it says that it is improved. I have to agree!! The smell is soo much better than the original, I can catch a hint of the self-tanner smell but not much. I have very pale skin and this stuff works within a couple days. I am very happy I came back to try it again!!</li>
    <li> Used this product before.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I like that this lotion doesn&#x27;t streak, it dries very quickly, the smell is very subtle, and the color (when developed) is very natural looking.  However, i do not like the waiting process.  Being very fair skinned, this tanner seems to take forever to get noticeable color.  Also, if I am not super careful, my knees and ankles are too dark, but that&#x27;s my fault.  I also like that this lotion doesn&#x27;t streak in the pool, so I don&#x27;t look diseased.  however, it does fade in the pool, making me a shade lighter than when I got in the water.  This and Jergens natural Glow Express are the only self-tanners I have ever used.  That being said, i definitely want to try out some other ones.  I hear Banana Boat works very fast.  Also, something strange about this product; I had a huge mosquito bite that just wouldn&#x27;t stop itching in swelling (excuse my detailed grossness) but after one application of this lotion, the swelling went down and it stopped itching entirely.  Coincidence?  I don&#x27;t know...  Well, if you look like a ghost like me, try this lotion!!!  It&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as I have used the new odorless product and liked it.  When arrived, old formula.  Hate the smell &amp; would have NEVER ordered if I knew this is what I was receiving.  Picture says &amp;#34;Finally, great color without odor.&amp;#34;  This is not the bottle that was sent....</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this product! I purchased it once nearly six years ago and the smell was unbearable. Now that I am in college I was looking for a safer method of tanning so I decided to try it again. It&#x27;s amazing! I am 100% sure they changed it to tone down the smell a little, its still there but its so faint its excellent! It smells like sun tan lotion but I&#x27;ve found no one can smell it but you and I only smell it mostly right after I put it on and a little when I sweat. As far as lines and streaks and blotches go I&#x27;ve never had any except once from not rubbing it in enough, it just takes practice. I&#x27;ve definitely seen some firming action and my skin is sooooooooooo smooth. There&#x27;s a little bitty baby tiny bit of glitter in it, nothing worth deterring you from the product. The color is natural and I just look glowy! I&#x27;m sure the color isn&#x27;t great for everyone but I&#x27;m pretty pale but not pasty and a little like olive undertoned. Don&#x27;t use it on your face they make a subtler version for your face with SPF, also amazing! Good luck with it, be patient I loveeee it!</li>
    <li> I am very fair-skinned and have a very hard time tanning naturally. Most self-tanners I used made my skin look orange, but not this stuff! I have been using this moisturizer for about two weeks now and love the results! I didn&#x27;t notice a weird smell and I noticed it working after only two days! A must-buy for fair skinned people!</li>
    <li> Gives me a very natural looking, healthy look. It does not look fake like some of the tanners do!</li>
    <li> I am very pale and we are going to the coast next week so I wanted to try to \\&quot;blend in\\&quot; a little and not look like a ghost. So I got this stuff to try. It worked overnight for me! I was so happy. Now I can go to the beach without feeling so pale. LOVE THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> I know it isnt recomended to put on your face, and dont.  It makes you Orange, and a very ugly orange at best.  For my arms, after a week it was looking VERY fake.  My Request is that you use it for your legs only. I got fair to medium and i went from fair to ugly light orange, it was obvious i used a bronzer, but its not the worst thing i&#x27;ve used at least for my legs.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this stuff. It is really thick so it seems like I have to use quite a bit - has the consistency of body butter. The color is great, no streaks and no orange. The smell is my favorite part of it though. It smells so so good. I haven&#x27;t noticed any firming action but maybe with time, who knows. It does make my skin feel really soft and smooth though.</li>
    <li> I like it because I can look tan and not spend time in the sun!  Wish it smelled differently, but I use it anyway!</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion for the first time today, and there goes $8 down the drain.  It&#x27;s been 8 hours since I applied this lotion, and even then just on my legs, and I am constantly smelling that telltale self-tanning smell.  It&#x27;s overpowering.  I&#x27;ve been trying self-tanners since I was a teenager, why can&#x27;t they make something that doesn&#x27;t smell like this?!?</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product line. I am blessed to have smooth skin, and I achieved a nice glow. My friends asked why I had started tanning and they couldn&#x27;t believe it was a lotion! The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me personally...small price to pay for the nice glow. Two tips for use: 1. Be careful around the wrists as if you are not careful there can be a line at the hands. 2. Don&#x27;t wear anything tight such as a bra after application. I did this and ended up with a dark line where the bra straps are. I put it on at night after a shower and exfoliating with a washcloth first.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how quickly I saw results from this lotion!  There are three things that this claims to do, but I can really only speak for two of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Moisturizer: I used this after shaving expecting it would be more irritating than other lotions, but if anything it left my legs far less irritated than usual.  I&#x27;d say this is definitely effective at its most basic, moisturizing purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- \\&quot;Natural Glow\\&quot;: I am a pale person, but I&#x27;m generally okay with that.  I don&#x27;t have big dreams of being tan, I just wanted something to make me not glow-in-the-light when I wear shorts in sunny weather--so I was only using this on my legs.  They were noticeably darker in just three days and I was very pleased with the color they turned (not too orange.)  I was so pleased with the results that I stopped there--I don&#x27;t want my legs to get a lot darker than the rest of me.  I expect I&#x27;ll probably use this once or twice a week to try to maintain this shade, which is nice because this bottle should last me a lot longer than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;m only using it sporadically, I can&#x27;t really speak for the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to mention though that considering all this lotion does I was expecting a terrible smell, and thought it was unreasonable that so many other reviewers were surprised it had one.  I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or something, but I was amazed to find that it actually smelled kind of pleasant.  And I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone would be irritated by it as it&#x27;s not very strong.  It lingers a bit long, but it is not a strong or bad smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely recommend this product for anyone just wanting to get a little bit darker.</li>
    <li> It has taken the glare off of my otherwise very pale legs. It is easy to apply but definitely watch out for build up around your knees, ankles and toes. I have only used this on my legs but it probably would be the same challenge around elbows and knuckles. The scent is nice but a tad strong. One negative that I&#x27;ve found is sweating heavily seems to remove the lotion and thus the tan (at least it did behind my knees). Can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any firming improvements but it does moisturize nicely. Overall this a good lotion if you need something to help you get ready for shorts and skirts.</li>
    <li> I just bought this is in my local store and have only been using it one day and I can already see a difference. The smell is absolutely amazing!! I love being tan and not orange! Not streaks or spots, just amazing color!!! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I wanted a safe way to keep up with my tan as the temperature drops, so i thought i would give this product a try! I consider myself to be fair-fair/medium skin color at darkest, however, i did not get that tan!! I suppose they would consider my color closer to tan and I should have bought tan-dark. But, it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell, and it goes on easy. i cannot see any firming results, however :/ My nailed tend to turn a little bit orange with the product as well, so be sure to scrub hands thoroughly after using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros - gives good, even tan - but not too dark, ok smell, easy application&lt;br /&gt;cons - no apparent firming results, turns nails orange</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I really do! I think it works great, it makes my skin look naturally tan. the firming feature is a nice bonus...my patch of cellulite on my thighs looks tighter! The problem is the horrible scent. I&#x27;ve used other Jergens Natural Glow products and they didn&#x27;t have this scent. I will stop using this one and return to the regular (non-firming) lotion due to the fragrance added.</li>
    <li> Went on smooth, had a slight odor to it.  but it was not very different than others.  it washes off and leaves streaking or spotting.</li>
    <li> I am as white as it gets and this wasn&#x27;t dark enough to bother with. I used it for a week on two different places (inside of forearm and whitest part of me...my waist) and turned my skin a nice light tan, but it was so subtle that it was unnoticeable in bright light. It looked like a faint bruise in normal light. I will try the next darkest option Jergens offers. The product says you can notice a difference within 3 days, but I got only faint results after a week.</li>
    <li> I only used this tanning lotion once because I could not stand to put it on again.  It smells HORRIBLY strong.  The smell of it was so strong I could smell it through my jeans and it was irritating my eyes.  It also made my legs look sparkly, which I do not like.  Big waste of money.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m pale. Not albino, but really pale... As in I glow in the sunlight pale (no not sparkle, glow) and even the lightest shade of drug store makeup is too dark for me. I got this so that I could go to New Orleans for spring break and not look like a complete alien. Unfortunately it turned my hands orange the first time I used it because I just rinsed them rather than completely washing them. The rest of my body seems to be okay, maybe a little darker than it was and not too orange? I&#x27;ll probably only put this on once or twice a week until I go on the trip and stop right afterward (hopefully before I look like an oompa loompa) but it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
    <li> I have used self-tanners that cost upwards of $50 a bottle or tube and have also gone the spray tan route.  Neither of these worked very well.  Jergen, however is easy to apply, leaves no streaks and has very little self-tanner smell.  I really like it!  I doesn&#x27;t turn orange and gives a soft glow, so you don&#x27;t look overly tan or have that&amp;#34; fake bake&amp;#34; look.  Just be sure to let it dry completely before putting on yoru clothes, wash your hands, and I always wipe off my heel, knees and elbows, so the color doesn&#x27;t settle in those cracks and creases.  All and all, a great self-tanning product!</li>
    <li> Great coverage. Have to make sure you coat the areas really well and even.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but it arrived broken and leaked all over the little bag it was in :(</li>
    <li> I have been usisng this lotion for a few weeks now, and i don&#x27;t thinj i will ever stop. The bottle says you see color in 7 days, i saw color immediately. In 3 days the cellulite on the back of my legs nearly disappeared. As a fair skinned person who doesn&#x27;t tan well, this lotion has been a life saver. Also, i have very sensitive skin that is easily irritated by many lotions and i have had no issues with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is streak central .  Lousy lousy lousy. Can&#x27;t believe people give this good reviews. Are you kidding me? I&#x27;m no  stranger to tanners and know how to  prep the skin for it. I  wouldn&#x27;t even give it a single star but the application forced me to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a tanning lotion at a reasonable price - this is it! I was a tan-a-holic so this has worked magic without the side effects!</li>
    <li> Really is a good price for this! Smells terrible but does the job! Not really good for the face though. Also may want to have a base tan because it can look a little orange if you&#x27;re pale.</li>
    <li> Although most of you like this product. I still don&#x27;t fancy it. I used jergens natural glow for a year &amp; it never turned out right. The smell is quite lovely. &amp; its easy, but once you take a shower &amp; shave it starts to fade off. In all honestly. Don&#x27;t waste your money, go to a tanning salon &amp; get a real tan. Yeah, people complain about you having a greater risk of cancer. But tanning is so relaxing. You can lay in a nice warm bed &amp; listen to relaxing music. You can even use tanning stickers to have cute lil tatttoos to show how white you were before. You don&#x27;t get cancer from tanning. It only effects you if you go everyday for 6 months straight. Its okay to go everyday for a month. Take a break for a month &amp; go again. I always get compliments on my sexy beach like tan. &amp; how it infact hides stretch marks. Jergans isn&#x27;t the same. I wasted 300 bucks all together. When i could&#x27;ve just spent 150 a year on tanning...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many self-tanners and none of them give me the gradual, natural looking tan that this lotion does.  I&#x27;m really fair skinned and it&#x27;s difficult to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make me orange or look unnaturally dark.  I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years and it&#x27;s always given me a nice even tan.  I use the regular \\&quot;Enriching\\&quot; formula for my arms and lower legs and the firming on my upper legs/thighs and stomach.  The smell of this firming formula doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, but I may just be used to it after years of use.  If you&#x27;re fair skinned I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product that evenly distributes a tan and does not leave an orange tint to the skin.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a deep tan right away, which is nice. It allows you to adapt as you go along. And you can stop anytime. The one downside is a slight smell, so you should use this when your done being around people for the day or a few hours before.</li>
    <li> I work in a bank so most of the time I am safely tucked inside the cool, confines of the vault (kidding), anyway, I just don&#x27;t have the luxury to bathe in the sun coz of my job, so I tried this. Within a few days, I can see the effect already, so it performs. Wish though that it has SPF on it too, but can&#x27;t complain. I totally got what I asked for.</li>
    <li> Good product and it works.  A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin. My skin will naturally get a little color to it after summertime but I spend all summer building up to that color. I have been using this lotion for a month now and LOVE IT! It slowly has given me color and now I don&#x27;t have wait 3 months to have color! It looks natural and doesn&#x27;t streak at all!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is just perfect for me.  It does not give a deep tan look, but you can apply more than once a day if you wish.  I use this on my legs only as my arms and face got tan despite the fact that I used a very good tanning lotion with a 50 sunscreen protection.  You can not tell it is a fake tan and it matches the rest of me.  Also  there is no yellowing to it.  Looks perfect.  You do have to be careful when apply.  I have learned it works perfect if you put the product on them used circular motions on my legs to make surer it is evenly applied.  Put just a small amount on your knees and feet and make sure you wash it off your hands good.  I only use this on my legs as I said.  But I have been using these fake tanning products for over 3 years and this was has improved greatly.  No orange, yellow streaks like of old.</li>
    <li> Stinks! I am not usually sensitive to scents but this one rubs me the wrong way. The lingering smell makes me gag! BEWARE even if you are not sensitive to the smell, people around you might be!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not under the mistaken impression that this lotion can actually &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; anything.  It&#x27;s a marketing gimmick and is likely no different from the nonfirming formula.  That being said, however, this lotion imparts a nice glow about 3 to 4 days after you apply it.  I only use this self tanner on my legs.  First, I shave and exfoliate, making sure my knees, ankles and feet get extra attention.  Once my legs are completely dry, I apply grapeseed or almond oil to my feet and knees (and let it absorb for a few minutes) before spreading the lotion over my legs.  This ensures that I won&#x27;t get a buildup of color in these areas and this trick really works.  I rub the lotion in until it&#x27;s completely absorbed making sure I apply an equal amount of lotion to each calf and thigh and making my motions as even as possible so there are no streaks.  When I finish applying the lotion to my calves and thighs I then lightly go over my feet and knees, adding no more lotion to what&#x27;s already on my hands.  Then I go over my ankles, feet and knees with a damp washcloth (not wet). Then I let everything dry completely before getting dressed.  In this way I completely avoid any streaking and the resulting &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; comes out nice and even.  I apply this lotion every other day throughout the spring and summer.  This gives me a bit of color but not a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; per se.  The color is not orange at all and it is perfect for my light skin tone.  I suppose if I applied it more often, the overall color would be darker, but I don&#x27;t want the color markedly different from my arms and chest (which aren&#x27;t tan at all thanks to daily SPF).  I just want to be able to go without stockings in the hot weather.  I live in Florida and believe it or not, no one is tan here.  Yes, people have a glow and yes, they still go to the beach, but most of us protect with a high SPF.  It&#x27;s only the tourists who are tan, lol!  This lotion does not have the strong chemical smell that some self-tanners have, which is a very good thing.  The only down side is having to wait so long for results.  I know Jergens makes other self tanners that give instant color but I&#x27;m fearful that they would be streaky.  So I&#x27;ll stick with what I know.  I&#x27;ve been using this gradual self tanner for a couple of years.  I bought it based on the excellent reviews I read, both online and in magazines, so I decided to give it a whirl.  I do like the product and am really happy that I&#x27;ve found an application method that doesn&#x27;t leave me streaky.  It works for me.  I definitely recommend this product, but don&#x27;t expect any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; miracles.  It was absolutely no different from the regular formula, just FYI.ich is a very good thing.

    <li> Smells great and moisturizes well, but after two uses I started to get an orange color.</li>
    <li> I have very fair, ivory skin and have never found a tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange until now. Smell: when you first put it on, it smells like the old original Pantene shampoo. After a few minutes, it does have a faint biscuity smell like all self tanners but it is not very strong. I can smell it but anyone else I&#x27;ve asked says they don&#x27;t really notice it. Color: It&#x27;s a very gradual color change but with my fair skin, I had compliments from friends on how nice and sunkissed i looked after only TWO days. I&#x27;ve been applying it every other day to maintain. GLITTER: I don&#x27;t know what the glitter complainers are so upset about, there is a really slight shimmer to it....very very slight. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and I have nothing to complain about. If you have fair, untannable skin, I highly recommend this product. And if you can&#x27;t take the faint biscuity smell, wait for it to dry and put on your favorite B&amp;BW lotion over it.</li>
    <li> I used Jergens before, but had to stop because I just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. After a few years of failed sunless tanning lotions and spray tans, I embraced my paleness. Then my mom started using this product and recommended I use it, and it looked amazing on her! I was extremely skeptical because of my previous use, but I tried it, and LOVE it. I will never look any further than this lotion for my self tanning. I don&#x27;t know what they did to the formula, but it smells SO much better. It still has the Jergens smell (you&#x27;ll understand what I mean if you&#x27;ve used the product before), but it&#x27;s so light, and you hardly smell it after it&#x27;s had time to soak in. It goes on easier too, and lasts longer, even with shaving everyday. I am very pale, and it amazed me that after only one use, I already saw a difference! I use it with the face lotion for pale-medium, for both my face and the backs of my hands. As with any tanning lotion, you just have to be careful, apply it slowly, and keep your skin moisturized! I am lovin&#x27; my flawless tan. :)</li>
    <li> I am very pale, and not in a pretty porcelain way. More like halfway to the grave, transparent, can see my veins kind of way. This lotion gave me a nice subtle glow after only two application, and it isn&#x27;t orange at al. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t work well on scars, they stay quite a bit paler and become a bit more noticeable or leave it looking like uneven coverage. But for the cost, it&#x27;s definitely worth using! I do notice a self-tanner smell after a few hours, so I tend to use it at night.</li>
    <li> Perfect for people who want a light, soft golden glow on their skin</li>
    <li> Best thing ever created! Well for pale girls. I absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s great. Do not use it everyday once you obtained the color you want. Cut it down to maybe very other day. Spread it evenly and wait for it to dry before putting any clothes on to avoid streaks or smudges. Dance around nakey! WASH YOUR HAND SEVERAL TIMES AFTER APPLYING IT! Especially in between your fingers.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I&#x27;m incredibly pale, though, so I have to use it sparingly (less for a tan, and more to make my skin look less sickly). I usually put it on the night before an event, and it gives me a decent glow without making me look like an orange. If it&#x27;s a really special event, sometimes I&#x27;ll go wild and put it on two whole days in a row (I know I know, I&#x27;m the girl everyone&#x27;s mother warned them about). The smell is nothing extreme--I am familiar with the old formula, and this one is spades better (note the bottle says no &#x27;odor,&#x27; but there&#x27;s definitely a fragrance to it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Makes my skin look glowing !</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and I found I had to use this every day for there to be any noticeable color. I do not like using it every day, since it can come off on my sheets if I sweat during my sleep (though the stains come out of my white sheets in the wash with oxyclean). I also like to use more moisturizing lotion every other day, since the self tanners can be a little drying on your skin. I don&#x27;t think it has any effect on diminishing cellulite, though it does even my skin tone, which makes it less noticeable. I switched to the regular medium version of the natural glow lotion and find I can just use every other day or every couple days to help even my skin tone. Since it is fall, I don&#x27;t show a lot of skin or want my skin to be too &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;, but it just makes me feel a little better overall to have a little color and helps even out my very pale skin tone.</li>
    <li> I have used several other self-tanning products, but I find that Jergens Natrual Glow is the best.  Easy to apply, not sticky or greasy, and really does give your skin the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; that you want.</li>
    <li> I use this every day since I had skin cancer and I LOVE it! I regularly use it in gift baskets for birthdays or holidays as I recommend it to everyone. It gives you that subtle tan without appearing fake or orange. You don&#x27;t get any streaking and the smell is nice.</li>
    <li> this goes on easily, does not streak and gradually builds to a nice tan color. I can use it every other day after the first week or so to maintain, very natural looking, even around the feet!</li>
    <li> Works well. Have to be careful on knees, ankles, elbows or it accumulates and turns a little orangey.</li>
    <li> I started using this because mainly I don&#x27;t have the time to go to a tanning bed every day or go get spray tans etc...so I started looking for a gradual tanner/moisturizer and found this one! It&#x27;s honestly great and leaves no streaks. Although I would advise to be careful when applying to feet, ankles, knees. Places like that seem to want to absorb it a whole lot more. And also, don&#x27;t be like me and wash your hands off immediately after application, because then your hands don&#x27;t get hardly anything and it may leave a line. But regardless, this self tanner starts showing in as little as two days (for me) and because I&#x27;m so pasty white it was a HUGE help!</li>
    <li> Make sure you put this on your skin daily and evenly! If you don&#x27;t put it on evenly, you will be blotchy. This lotion helps moisturize as well as make you look tan!</li>
    <li> Nice lotion. Smells good too. Have fair skin and this gives nice color</li>
    <li> Works as well as the daily moisturizer for the face.</li>
    <li> While this stuff works by adding color to your skin I found the color to be a bit orange after about a week. If you have any dry spots (knee caps) it&#x27;ll be much darker there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this product. It has the perfect consistency and looks so natural. It&#x27;s a nice big tube, also. Thanks, Jergens!</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin damp &amp; tacky like. I have to shower twice a day because of this lotion since at the end of the day I feel sticky &amp; dirty. Who cares if my legs are slightly tan, they just feel gross!</li>
    <li> It brings on a very subtle tinting.  Honestly it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  When you put it on, you will have a slight tingly feeling on your skin (especially if you have sensitive skin like I do) which will ultimately go away.  Definitely wait before putting on pants or clothing over it and don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands after applying it.  I cannot comment on how it does with cellulites but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that powerful</li>
    <li> I got a really bad reaction to this. Sensitive skin? Beware, it didn&#x27;t play nice with me. :(</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the medium to dark one, may have been my mistake, not sure.  It was the old stuff since I know the new kind doesn&#x27;t have that self tanner smell which this does.  Other than that it was fine.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Just remember not to turn your hands or feet orange. It says see results within a week but I saw results the next day.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the item pictured. I was given the Jerseys Natural Glow, but without the firming lotion. Never sent it back though. Still a good product but again not what I thought I was buying.</li>
    <li> Great product when applying to elbows knees and heels add a little Vaseline before application to prevent stains</li>
    <li> I like this product and have purchased it before. Works well as far as what it is&lt;br /&gt;supposed to do. Nice feel and does not have any bad smell.</li>
    <li> This product truly does give you a glow . . . sort of a tan but more like a glow!  I always use it after showering as my body lotion.</li>
    <li> The smell is gross and there was not a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; after using it for a week. I exfoliated before applying and finally gave up on applying it.</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t smell as much as their old lotion. Still has that sunless tanner smell but not as much as the older versions. Great for building up a summer tan without the harmful sun!.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff better price than in the store!</li>
    <li> It works good to bring some color to this old white girl, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Better than other brands that I tried, (better than L\\&quot;Oreal++) in smell, color, consistency.&lt;br /&gt;  I do recomend this for those that need more color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wash hands after and I don&#x27;t put it on face elbows and rarely the knees.  I use it three to 4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt; Gives my skin a glow of natural color.  Very nice especially if you don&#x27;t get in the sun that much, I have a healthy light glow.</li>
    <li> This product gave a realistic lightly tanned look to my fair skin, and it really did seem to improve the appearance of tightening areas. I used it a lot, and got so comfortable with it that I started using it mores generously. (Don&#x27;t do that, be happy with the nice even color you get used as directed.) I found that even though  it seemed my skin did appear darker when I kept applying generously, it will rub off on the inside of clothing-and won&#x27;t wash out!</li>
    <li> Very natural-looking color. It is somewhat build able, but as this shade is fair to medium, it really doesn&#x27;t darken beyond a medium shade. It is very moisturizing, and I especially to use it after shaving my legs. It soothes any razor burn (i.e. prevents bumps and stinging), and is a great moisturizer in the winter months! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Subtle, no streaking, smells good. I&#x27;ve tried about 8 different kinds of self tanner and I&#x27;m going to stick with this one.</li>
    <li> This used to work good for me and leave a good color on me. However, after everyday in the shower some would rub off and when I did my exfoliation it would be really streaky and come off on towel. Therefore, after buying two of these I switched to something else and it doesn&#x27;t come off like this one did. I have used Jergens for the last 3 years and now I don&#x27;t care for it anymore.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Even has a nice &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; to it. Not bad at all.</li>
    <li> I recently revisited this Jergens product after nixing the old Natural Glow formula from my routine a few years ago. I always liked the concept of these moisturizers, but I&#x27;d been turned off primarily by the strong smell and uneven streaks of the old formula. Compared to that old stuff, the product HAS improved, but there is still room for more improvement. My intention was to use this on my arms and neck area twice a week and occasionally on my lower legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The color looks really good -- it gives me a confidence boost in everyday life. I get a soft sheen and subtle color that complements my skin well, and there&#x27;s absolutely no loud, &amp;#34;HEY EVERYBODY, I USED A TANNING PRODUCT!&amp;#34; orange tone. The visual &amp;#34;Natural Glow&amp;#34; aspect is pulled off superbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The smell itself has tremendously improved. The old formula smelled like harsh vinegar and hairspray, but this has a much more palatable aura to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The smell, while much better, just doesn&#x27;t go away. I can sniff clear wafts of it as I go about my day over 10 hours after applying it. The confidence boost I get from the color is nearly nullified by the self-consciousness I feel in close quarters with others while I have it applied -- especially at work. To improve the situation, I started putting old sheets on my bed (to prevent staining a good bedspread) and began to apply it at night, and although the smell fades somewhat the next morning, it never entirely goes away. What&#x27;s more, the simple fact that I even have to devise strategy like this in order to use the product makes it less than practical. Even if you can live with the smell, keep in mind that your significant other and sleep-in-the-bed pets will have to live with it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The product recommends that you wait a short while before dressing after applying it, and I&#x27;m diligent to apply carefully and evenly. Sometimes I&#x27;ve waited hours before putting a shirt on,never breaking a sweat and surely allowing the product to completely dry; yet, it still lightly stains my white clothes (&amp; same for bed sheets), and it can leave its scent on different clothing/fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Although I&#x27;ve had no rash or breakout of hives like a few reviewers have reported, I&#x27;ve noticed some pimples/whiteheads that I&#x27;ve never had in the past suddenly appearing on-location within a few days of applying the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: I really do like the visual impression this newer formula generates &amp; appreciate the improved smell, but the product is still too much of a hassle for me to use regularly. It&#x27;s primarily the endless lingering of the smell that&#x27;s a sticking point for me, and when I have to literally plan my day around the product to use it well and mitigate its drawbacks, it&#x27;s borderline-impractical. I DO recommend this if you&#x27;re planning to use it here and there in anticipation of a specific event where you&#x27;ll want to look your best, but I imagine it&#x27;s a heck of a lot of legwork to maintain the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; year-round.</li>
    <li> I cannot express how great this is!!!!! Seriously! I subscribed to have this delivered once a  month and am so thankful! not an orange color AT ALL!! My legs are so pale and this just adds a subtle &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; tone to my skin without making me look like I have a fake tan! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I received the package in the time I was told I would get it. Once I got it in the mail I opened the package and the lotion had exploded. The lid had one piece of tape on it and it still was everywhere. I had to end up throwing it away. I couldn&#x27;t have sent it back it was that bad.</li>
    <li> First off, I discovered it has GLITTER in it. Sparkles, or something. I held my arm up to my kitchen light and low and behold. I&#x27;d put it on my legs too right after exfoliating in the bath, and sparkles there as well. Then I held up the lotion nozzle to the light. Yup, glittery sparkles. I understand it&#x27;s a tanning &#x27;glow&#x27; lotion, but..Sparkles? For real?</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Like all other self tanners if you&#x27;re not careful your knees and ankles will look orangy and weird.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find something that wouldn&#x27;t make me look orange but give my very pale skin some color and this is great. I now have natural looking color without looking like an oompa loompa. Many reviews have said it smells bad, I think it smells good.</li>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t have to write a negative review but it was a negative experience. I bought this because I saw the product everywhere and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I&#x27;m pale and some extra natural glow would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a shower, dried myself thoroughly and applied the moisturizer all over my body and made sure I got it all even and covered. It&#x27;s got a sweet chocolate-caramel smell to which was very pleasant and the texture is really thick so it would be great as a moisturizes alone. I waited about 5 minutes until it felt dry and put my clothes on. So the next day I look in the mirror and all over my legs and hands there are uneven brown patches! At this point I can&#x27;t even go outside because I look like a patched cow. I thought this product was supposed to GRADUALLY create an even glow but hell the dark spots are pretty dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is, don&#x27;t get carried away because Jergens is a big brand that seems to be everywhere these days. I regret buying it and wasting $6 dollars on something that doesn&#x27;t even work. Complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> Others have had glowing (ha ha) reviews of this product, but if you have sensitive skin, STAY AWAY! Jergens Natural Glow has give me hives all over my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had hives before.  I haven&#x27;t ever had an allergic reaction to a lotion before.</li>
    <li> I tried this and don&#x27;t like the thickened texture for &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;. Otherwise works well.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff years ago because my upper body is the only part that tans on me in the summer.  I compensate with this so I can wear shorts.  I remember going through this stuff like crazy. I would buy two at a time and use it all summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they definitely improved the scent, I get streaks with this new formula.  Maybe its because I use it right after shaving I&#x27;m not sure, but if I dont shave the tanner really accentuates the hairs and pores on my legs. Its sad because this was a staple for me and I think if this keeps happening I&#x27;m going to have to try something else.</li>
    <li> While I didn&#x27;t purchase this product from Amazon, I bought a bottle from a Big Lots in town. I hadn&#x27;t heard of Jergens before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what sort of quality the product would be. They had both this version and a second version for people with darker tones, but given that I&#x27;m fairly pale, I felt this version would be a safer bet (especially for having never used products like this before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for just under two weeks now (around 12 days), and I will definitely say that it works. Typically I put it on shortly after showering at night and just let it do its work overnight (where I&#x27;m less likely to be sweating or wearing anything too tight-fitting). Originally just using it on my upper body, I started using it on my lower legs about five days ago. Between my thighs (untreated), my calves, and my arms/upper body, I can definitely see notable differences in tone. One of my coworkers even asked if I had been going tanning after only 4 days, so I&#x27;m guessing it isn&#x27;t just me who&#x27;s seeing it. I did notice there&#x27;s a couple small splotches on the sides of my stomach (which might be from having a bit extra added in that area or some residual body blue from a show a couple weeks back), so make sure to rub it in well and apply it evenly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some of the other reviews mention a smell, and while I&#x27;ll admit that I notice a smell while putting it on, it fades pretty quickly and isn&#x27;t very overpowering to begin with (I&#x27;d say it smells like a mix of lotion and that slightly &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; flavor of a lot of vitamins, if that makes any sense at all. Sorry if it doesn&#x27;t!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one worry about continuing to use it is in the ingredients: given that the product contains both petrolatum and mineral oil (which are considered carcinogenic), I&#x27;m not sure if I plan to continue to use it constantly or only for certain occasions. It still seems to be a safer alternative to using tanning beds or even outside (since UV radiation can also cause cancer), and I&#x27;m not sure how much of either ingredient is in the product. Regardless, it&#x27;s something you might want to remember while using this (or any other similar) product!lso cause cancer), and I&#x27;m not sure how much of either ingredient is in the product. Regardless, it&#x27;s something you might want to remember while using this (or any other similar) product!</li>
    <li> I sweat I have bought this years ago and it looked fine, but this bottle went full on streaky fake tan in one application.  I do have very light skin, but isn&#x27;t that sort of the point for people who buy fair skin gradual tanner? It also smells like fake tan which might be unavoidable, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> I remember using this product when it first came out and it smelled awful. Plus it took forever to show any color. So it was nice to see that the smell was better and that it actually starts showing results after one use (at least on this pale girl it did). I bought this to use in between sunless tanning so I would only have to apply the dark sunless tanning once a week, so far it is working. I only use it every other day and alternate it with just lotion. I finally have some color. The ONLY complaint I have is this, the smell at first when coming out is great but then within an hour or so it becomes that horrible chemical smell that makes you want to gag (or at least it makes me want to gag). So I put it on before bed and wake up with the smell, ew gross and it gets on my sheets so I have to switch them out and sometimes I can smell it after I take a shower when I sweat a bit. If only they could make it so this products smell didn&#x27;t turn sour after a bit of time but it is a great product other than that. Did exactly what it was supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it as tan maintenance for spray tans, in conjunction with other darker tanning lotions and by itself. It is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell like fake tanner and leaves my skin moisturized all day. I highly recommend this product! It&#x27;s one of the only &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; beauty products I swear by. allvanityallthetime.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Awful streaks and approaches long sleeves and jeans and no swimming till this is gone. Bottle went in the trash!</li>
    <li> I have definitely seen a noticeable difference in my skin.. Use everyday after the shower and BAM perfect summer glow!</li>
    <li> This is a good gradual tanner. It was not irritating to my sensitive skin and I had noticeable results within the days.  I have pale skin and it was just enough that I wasn&#x27;t completely white. However, if you are buying this because of the no odor claim, don&#x27;t. Once the slight perfume smells wears off, you are left with a faint tanner smell 3-4 hours later. Not obnoxious, but enough that someone sitting close to you can smell it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Do yourself a favor, try it, for only $6 you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Smells great, nice and creamy but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling slimy or greasy. Dries fairly quickly, and applies nicely. I&#x27;m usually terrible at applying self tanner but I got a nice, even color from this. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a difference between this &#x27;firming&#x27; one and the other natural glow one. I&#x27;ve only tried this one but I won&#x27;t be switching any time soon.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Jergens natural glow daily moisturizer firming lotion to even my unfair skin tones. I couldn&#x27;t bearly put this lotion long enough to get some advantage out of it due to its nasty scent. It almost reminds me of puke that I had to wipe them off.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product several times &amp; use it every spring &amp; summer.  I have very fair skin &amp; this gives my legs just the right amount of color during the warm weather so I don&#x27;t feel so much like a &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34;.  haha</li>
    <li> but I didn&#x27;t want the firming kind. I didn&#x27;t know it would be firming. But the product usually works. I think there is something in the firming that makes it not look as evenly applied.</li>
    <li> Okay; this is better most fake bakes, but it still smells. It is more subtle than most products, and the smell isn&#x27;t as bad, but it still smells.</li>
    <li> Still left my skin orange and with streaks</li>
    <li> This product is great as a moisturizer and gives a nice colour. It doesn&#x27;t streak or look too orange. Because it works so well I am willing to suffer through the smell… but only barely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to be odourless… THIS IS A LIE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its deceptively mild if you smell the top of the bottle at the store, but trust me, when you actually put it on the smell is AWFUL. Even if I give it 20 mins to dry before I get dressed, it still builds up under my clothes so throughout the day whenever I move I get another wave of stench wafting up into my face. It will not be covered by perfume or scented creams, and it is not a light, barely-there sort of smell. Its a nasty, musky odour that leaves you with a dull headache and mild nauseous feeling all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this I only use it every few days when I have hours to sit at home in my underwear waiting for it to sink in so that I can shower before I leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pray that they will find a way to get rid of this because otherwise it really is a great product.</li>
    <li> Streaks all over my legs. Didn&#x27;t like this product at all!&lt;br /&gt;Going to try L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product instead, per my friend&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. I am very pale and after using this for a couple days I can visibly notice a glow on my skin. The color is now darker, and it smells wonderful. :D</li>
    <li> Great product to keep up your tan.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned. Tried this for two weeks strait and there has been little to no difference in my coloration. Works well as a lotion but I can find a better lotion for less. Positives include the faintness of the color prevented it from looking unnatural a problem common with my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Great product. Nice fragrance. Absorbs well into my skin. Not as greasy as it used to be. A subtle tan. Moisturizes my skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do the sun any more and miss that so this works great for me! It&#x27;s gives me just enough color and I can control that with the application - how much and how often!  I have read some reviews that indicated an unpleasant scent but that is not my experience with the product I purchased so perhaps the product fragrance has been improved because of those reviews! :)  I found the fragrance of the product I bought to be pleasant and it does make my skin feel firmer, silky and sexy!  I also found the reviews very helpful in applying the product -how and when -so I got very good results. Thanks to everyone out there that provided the information!  So I&#x27;m enjoying this product, love how it makes my skin feel and the look! High fives for me!  Bought several - don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
    <li> This worked great as a firming cream, getting rid of the little bit of cellulite on my... um... friend&#x27;s thighs... lol. However, the tanning part turned out kind of blotchy and not natural looking at all. I read the instructions carefully and followed them, but after about 5 days I stopped using it because it was darker in some spots than in others. Luckily I started just on my legs to see how well it worked before applying it to the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> If you already have tan skin, this product will darken your color and even it out. But, if you are pale, give up now and don&#x27;t waste your time. I bought this at Walmart to jump-start my tan and was blown away. The tan looked surprisingly well for $7, but the smell was horrible. I couldn&#x27;t sleep because it smelled so bad. It lingered on my clothes and sheets and I couldn&#x27;t mask it with perfume. It also stained my white clothing. If you are going to take pictures, use it. Because you can&#x27;t smell pictures. But for daily use, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using some version of Jergens Natural Glow lotion for many years and have always been happy with it.  This version, the firming moisturizer fair/medium, is no exception.  I use it mainly on my legs after I shave, which is generally every other day.  This frequency gives my usual fair skin a nice golden glow with no orange.  Just be sure to use sparingly on knees and ankles.  I received the lotion for a great price, and it was delivered with no problems.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> It took a little perfecting, but it works very well once you get used to it. Use it daily, but lightly, and you&#x27;ll gradually get the shade you want. It can definitely start to look unnatural though if you keep going, so when you&#x27;re where you want it, STOP! Also it&#x27;s a little weird once you completely stop using it, like it comes off unevenly, so you just look kind of dirty.</li>
    <li> I loved this lotion last summer and used it almost daily, but the problem I had was as I let is wear off. I looked kinda like a tan and white zebra. In mid summer as I began to get this effect I changed to the darker tan and that worked for a while. But it does wask off some as you shower as my towels will attest to and when you are done with it for the summer you do go through an awkward period. I think it has a slight odor that I wish it did not. This year I have use it very lightly but I&#x27;m thinking I may go back to my real favorite (Banana Boat)</li>
    <li> 4 days, dimples gone.  I wish I would have discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> Left random patchy orange streaks, no gradual change, just one day appeared after applying. I was careful to let it sit after applying, doesn&#x27;t appear to have made a difference.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned with auburn hair and some freckles on my cheekbones (in other words, I have a pale redhead&#x27;s complexion). I get some color after just one application (takes about 8-12 hours). However, even after a couple days in a row it&#x27;s still a subtle and natural looking glow compared to other tanners I&#x27;ve used because it&#x27;s designed to take a whole week of applications to fully develop versus most other tanners which take only 3-4 days and end up uneven. This product&#x27;s slow/gradual color development, coupled with a thick consistency requiring a thorough massaging motion, is likely the key to its natural, non-streaky results. Fair redheads and blondes probably won&#x27;t be disappointed - it&#x27;s difficult finding a self tanner that won&#x27;t turn us orange or dirty-looking. The smell is bearable, but of course that&#x27;s subjective and many reviewers do complain about it. I just figure some sort of odor is par for the course with these products, and it&#x27;s simply worth it to me for the awesome color. I haven&#x27;t used it regularly enough to assess the firming element but it&#x27;s likely as ineffective as all the other firming lotions out there. I read that the molecules responsible for firming in these sorts of products are actually too large to be absorbed and the skin can&#x27;t use them anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I could manage my under tanned skin so that I could wear dresses since the weather has remained warm into the Fall. It works well as far as the tanning goes however the smell I just can&#x27;t get past. When you first put it on it is fine, but after a few hours it smells just like all of the other tanning products I have used in the past. My advice is to use it at bed time if you don&#x27;t have white sheets. Then you can shower in the morning leaving the product to work all night and won&#x27;t have to carry around the smell all day.</li>
    <li> Many people who have reviewed this product complained about the the smell. Straight out of the tube the smell is weird, but once its on my skin it smells so good! Now on the label it says after a few days you will see a noticeable difference. I don&#x27;t agree with that, it takes about a week to a week and half to see a noticeable difference in your skin tone. There is NO yellow or orange color afterwards! I tan very easily in the summer and I get a little pale in the winter so this keeps me from looking ghost like. I am only in my 20s so the &#x27;Firming&#x27; part isn&#x27;t too important to me, but my skin does seem a little tighter, which is fine with me. You do have to consistently apply this cream for it to work, once a day without fail. Just remember give your skin a few minutes before putting on clothes.  If your looking for a quick tanner, this is not for you. If you just want a moisturizer with a hint of color this is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is called firming moisturizer. It certainly won&#x27;t do any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;. But it&#x27;s a good moisturizer, smells nice and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Very subtle color, and doesn&#x27;t leave ugly or noticeable streaks. Takes a week or two to build up the color, and Jergens improved the scent a LOT from the earlier versions. I love using this product, and I can always be assured it won&#x27;t come out an ugly orange color!!</li>
    <li> It does firm but not much color change</li>
    <li> This lotion is very quick to bronze up whatever part of your body you have applied it to. I used it to even out a farmer ran and bronze my stomach and legs. It sets fairly quickly (as the instructions state to keep rubbing it in until you feel resistance) and once it sets you&#x27;re fine to stop rubbing. If you do not wait long enough you will get streaks and hot spots around you ankles, feet and knees. It works within a day depending on how pale you are (I&#x27;m very pale) and you can build your tan to a point. After that point the tan actually starts rubbing off. I could take my towel and rub off a whole section on my leg. So if you want to be darker than what you have built it to you&#x27;re going to have to do something else.  As far as the firming goes...I saw no difference. I used it for 2 weeks straight. Every day. Nothing was any firmer than when I started. I would have been better off with the moisturizing.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until I run out and if I need to de-pale myself for a day or two but beyond that I won&#x27;t look to this product.</li>
    <li> The product itself works really well if you can get over the smell. For some reason I cant seem too. I would not repurchase this because of its smell. It almost smells a little like burnt plastic.</li>
    <li> This lotion gives me great color in just one or two uses!  I am very light-skinned, and never really noticed a smell.&lt;br /&gt;  As with all self tanners that actually work, it is best to use after you have exfoliated in the shower, then I mix some of this with some normal lotion to make it last longer, and do not dress until the lotion has completely dried on your skin.  After doing that, I have never seen any color rub off onto clothes.  Good for the value, I am sure that there are better ones out there, but excellent for price and quantity!</li>
    <li> I am super pale, to the point of being a bluish color on my legs sometimes.  With two days of application of this product, my legs match my upper body in color.  With a few more full body applications, I have a healthy, radiant glow.  I especially love the smell and moisturization of this lotion.  It smells slightly like cocoa butter and coconuts, and keeps my skin feeling soft all day long.  Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> I have extremely pale skin. Usually, tanning lotions turn my skin orange. But, this product actually makes you that tan brown color you are looking for! In fact, I am going to go buy the Jergens tanning made for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;time till I was tan (meaning from completely pale to brown): 3 days!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;-works like it says&lt;br /&gt;-soaks into you skin fairly fast, compared to other products! (usually takes me about 4-5 minutes before I can put my clothing on)&lt;br /&gt;-applies evenly (usual products require way to much effort to put them on evenly, this is just like regular lotion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-makes you feel a little oily (so you might need to shower in the morning)&lt;br /&gt;-the product runs out fast (might have just been a problem for me since I was applying it liberally on my entire body every night)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tips:&lt;br /&gt;- when you wash your hands after applying make sure you are not creating streaks on your hands&lt;br /&gt;-take off jewelry!!!!! (I made this error and it created a line where my bracelet was)&lt;br /&gt;-exfoliate (so you don&#x27;t get a patchy tan)</li>
    <li> For such a great price, just try this stuff and see how ya do with it. I just applied this Jergens Nat Glow lotion for the first time and it&#x27;s drying. I have no idea what the color will be like but I am already convinced that I love this product. If you&#x27;re crypt keeper pale like me, this is the only lotion to use and the stuff truly is brilliant. Made specifically for your skin tone...and gradual..how much better can you get? Not Only that but it feels smooth and nice going on.  At first I thought the smell was odd, but it somehow changed into a mild scent and I actually like it. Its just when youre rubbing it in and your face is right down in it that its a wee bit strong. So, this is a Great product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before buying, so I want to write my own! This is my first attempt with something like a self-tanner, and I&#x27;m very pleased. It&#x27;s early April, and with weddings, parties, and a trip to south Georgia planned, I was a bit desperate for a quick solution to cure my pasty skin without going to a tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Testing it out a week prior to wedding #1, I found that even two days of applying after a shower provided a solid base color. My skin is fair, not porcelain-like, though, so the gradual color looks right for me, especially against my brown hair. I made sure to purchase the fair to medium bottle. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and have not experienced any problems. I keep good care of my skin on a regular basis, someone who doesn&#x27;t might experience small breakouts since it is kind of a thick lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was very particular about my application, smoothing over my face, neck, chest, arms, and legs evenly. A tip-- use very lightly, but evenly, on your feet! Feet tend to color much easilier. Definitely wait a bit (I wait 15 min.) to put clothes on. You want it to absorb well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the day the color appeared. The first day, slightly noticeable, and the second, even more so. I&#x27;m nervous to try day three (at least for early April, since few New Yorkers are tan at this point), I may start to look unnatural then, not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a smell, but not a bad one. It almost smells &amp;#34;warm.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t plan on using it the day of the special events, but probably two days leading up to them. Since it differs from my usual lotion, which is lighter, I feel a little bit weighed down when I&#x27;ve used it. As far as firming, I noticed it mostly on the back of my arms. That wasn&#x27;t my intent in purchasing, though a nice perk! I&#x27;m excited to wear my new sleeveless dress next weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s working out well, a good investment for a girl who doesnt have time to sunbathe--ever. $12 beats wasting time and moneyat a tanning salon. I think those who have had trouble with it probably did not take a methodical approach to applying it and waiting for it to absorb. Patience is a virtue!</li>
    <li> Very unappealing smell. I don&#x27;t know if it was made that way or it went rancid but it is not pleasant.</li>
    <li> I love the new smell (or lack-of) of this lotion. It makes using self-tanner much more enjoyable. My only complaint is that despite rubbing in well and exfoliating prior to use, I still get streaks on my legs after a few uses.  But the color is great and it dries quickly, making it practical for every day use.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this lotion. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it. It smells amazing and it gets amazing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;While I absolutely did provide quick and beautiful results it made me break ou horribly.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend spot testing this product first in the more sensitive area of your body. For me it was my chest and thighs.&lt;br /&gt;It does absolutely work by I do not recommend for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion helps tone my legs and arms as well as give me a hint of color (I noticed a difference after 3 applications). I have never had such smooth skin! This lotion is a 3-in-one product that is WELL worth the money! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> The color is very nice for my fair skin.</li>
    <li> This product works well if you are trying to do a self tanning, haven&#x27;t had any streaking issues. The oder is a little gross to me but oh well. I don&#x27;t believe any product indicating it will &amp;#34;Firm&amp;#34; and that was not my intention so no comment on this.</li>
    <li> This is the second lotion I have tried and it does leave an odor, but its not a bad one. I would recommend this product because my skin slowly started to get darker after 3 days and it evened my multiple tones out.</li>
    <li> This products odor triggered an allergic sinus reaction and throat irritation for me.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I had already applied to most of my body and had to shower it off when I realized what was happening.</li>
    <li> I remember trying this product years ago when it first came out. It smelled bad and if you stopped using it for a day it would leave streaks where it was coming off. This is not your mommas Jergens. I use it 2 days in a row then stop for a week. It gives my just enough color so I don&#x27;t blind complete strangers with my legs. It smells wonderful out of the bottle and doesn&#x27;t turn to that tanning bed smell later. I noticed the consistency is much thicker than before . It moisturizes and goes on evenly. I haven&#x27;t noticed any orange hue to my skin. Jergens really improved this product.</li>
    <li> This product did create a good tan, however, it left quickly after swimming. Also, have had itchy reaction ever since I stopped using.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product-got complimented on my gorgeous tan all the time! hint-where gloves, doesn&#x27;t stain hands or nails that way.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but this doesn&#x27;t work on me.  I am so disappointed!  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this product, easy to use, light tan evenly...makes me look like I&#x27;m NOT from MN!</li>
    <li> You have to be very light skinned to see much results, and I am medium fair skinned and not tanning much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other self tanners that left my skin really orange. This is the only one that has an ALMOST natural glow. You have to use it for a few days before it&#x27;s too noticeable, which I like (in case I make a mistake rubbing too much in one area). The only problem that I have with this product is the smell. It&#x27;s so strong it gives me a headache. Otherwise, I would use it more often.</li>
    <li> Loved it. I&#x27;m actually in need of another one. It&#x27;s so much cheaper to get it on Amazon then in the store.</li>
    <li> Omg this lotion saved my life, I decided to try it one day and I am very pale . I tried the most expensive self tanners on the market and they don&#x27;t compare to this drug store lotion. It gives and amazing tan that actually lasts everyday, and for once I do not look pale and have a nice glowing tan, I went out and bought the moisturizer natural glow for the face today hopefully it works the same as the body lotion !</li>
    <li> Broke out all over my body after using for a few days. Developed flakey itchy skin that took two weeks to heal after I stopped using it. Be careful if you have sensitive skin. Too bad because the color was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glowing and able to enjoy sitting out in the sun even more! It does have a sparkle (which I like), and I think the smell is nice!  It washes off... but so what? If it didn&#x27;t, I would be concerned.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Love it. Best when mixing it with real sun in the summer.  I always put body lotion on knees, elbows, ankles and feet before applying this, to avoid streaks in the joints. Very natural looking and minimal odor. Used to go to tanning beds but am scared of those now.  This is the next best thing when there is no time for real sun.</li>
    <li> I love tanning, but recently got shingles and was told not to tan in the beds anymore. So I bought this product. I love it and the glow, plus it doesn&#x27;t streak your skin or turn it orange.</li>
    <li> I was always skeptical with these tanning lotions and potions from people often falling victim to the &amp;#34;oompa loompa&amp;#34; curse. I usually lose my summer tan once winter comes along and my skin gets really pale. I&#x27;ve never used a tanning bed before so I decided to try this out first. I applied it once in the morning and once in the evening all over my body, including my face, and I got an instant tan. After three days and two applications on each of those three days I had to stop using it cause my skin was so dark and tan and sexy! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I started using Jergens Natural Glow about ten years ago. The formula has changed some and the smell is much better than before. (At least to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an olive skin tone and tan easily, but now that I&#x27;m 25 I decided to avoid the tanning beds from my college days. I want to make healthy habits for my kids. Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying a shade lighter than what you would consider yourself. I&#x27;m medium skin toned naturally, but use the fair skin toned lotion. I also have a strange application method, but it works for me: use a sandwich bag to rub the lotion in. It&#x27;s awkward to keep your fingers spread apart inside the bag to get it even, but I&#x27;ve mastered the &amp;#34;bag technique &amp;#34; lol. I&#x27;ve never gotten orange palms and don&#x27;t have to mess around with washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always apply at bedtime and do avoid white sheets! It will rub off some. I go over bony areas lightly and sometimes put some other lotion on first but I don&#x27;t have a problem getting orange. Use a decent amount and any extra keep using somewhere else. I also rub my arms and back of hands together once I&#x27;m done applying that helps to even it out and you can avoid using your palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply two nights in a row and then again 4 days later. When I shower in the morning I just try to wash my skin gently. I use a dove bar and don&#x27;t lather too much on the areas where I put my lotion. Works great for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also add that I have noticed firming on my quads and triceps. Kinda strange but hey, I&#x27;ll take it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy it too!</li>
    <li> This was the exact lotion I was looking for.  They shipped the product very quickly and it was just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I am extraordinarily fair complected. In the summer when I want to wear flip-flops and shorts, this is an issue.  So, I am a bit of a self-tanning connoisseur.  I have been using them since I was a teen (or about 20 + years, if you must know.)  In the early days, the smell was nauseating.  The color was only good if you used an expensive department store brand.  Well, they have vastly improved over the years.  I thought I liked this one a lot.  It gives a nice, natural color and leaves your skin soft.  But, after a few days you are left with streaks. It comes off unevenly for some reason. I know your cells are turning over, yada yada yada.. Exfoliating will help even the color out but it will also (obviously) negate the tan.  Hmmm... I think I will go back to a spray or mousse.  I haven&#x27;t had that issue with those.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the firming effect, I haven&#x27;t seen any.  I, personally, think this is a load of bull.  Yes, if you use self tanner, your cellulite (if you have any) will \\&quot;appear\\&quot; less noticeable because of the darker color but I seriously doubt that rubbing this (much less anything else) on your backside is going to magically shrink your fat cells.&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the smell.  Sorry, but it&#x27;s still noticeable.  My husband even commented that he smelled that I was self-tanning.  Ugh...  Perhaps not nauseating like the old days but definitely still there.  They can stick whatever label on it they want but the smell will probably always be on any self tanner.  This, however, is a little better than most of them out there in the odor department.  The nice thing about this product is that you can build your color if you don&#x27;t get it dark enough the first go round.  Overall, I think this is an OKAY product at best given the price but be warned that it may streak over time.  :/</li>
    <li> I got the Fair to Medium.  I&#x27;m a fair girl and rarely get any sun.  This smells like self tanner, but in a milder way, but you can still recognize the scent if you&#x27;ve ever used self tanner before.  It&#x27;s a wonderful consistency of lotion, and this tube is really huge.  It has definitely softened my arms up nicely :)  On to the self tanner part - I have used this repeatedly over the last four days - putting on a fair amount and rubbing in well a couple times a day.  My arms are achieving a gentle brown look, so it is a very gradual process, which I do like.  However, if you were looking for a quicker tanned effect, you&#x27;d have to go to the next darker shade.  I do like that it rubs in easily and dries completely probably within 10 mins. (and it&#x27;s just a little sticky for the first five).  I wash my hands afterwards, and haven&#x27;t had any darkening of my palms.  No streaks, no splotches.  I think the fact that it is a gradual tanner (tanner with lots of lotion to cut the &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; effect) makes it more forgiving.  Really soft skin afterwards, but you will have a little bit of that self tanner smell for a while, and even after several hours you will still be able to smell it on your skin.  Might buy again, but I basically got it because we are going to Disneyland next week, and I wanted a little color.  This tube will last forever.</li>
    <li> Good to use for quick color if needed.  Best to use every other day or two days prior to needing color.  Turns skin a bit orange if not blended well around ankles or knees, and stains hands if not washed thoroughly will keep using, great to have on hand</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it, but the packaging was ok. The smell is ok too. I am scared to try it, I will most likely try it on a small part of my body first to see. I am very pale and hope it will look natural.</li>
    <li> I love that when I look down at my legs they look 10x better with using this product.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. A few tips for you. I put it on after my shower and put a beach towel on my bed and lay out with my feet flat on the bed and my knees up for 20-30 minutes before putting on my clothes. Or pin your hair up, and do your makeup.  For me if it has been months since I use this as I am a NYer and only use this to look good in the summer. The first application always is patchy. Know matter how much I think I&#x27;ve done it right. After the second application, better. For me it doesn&#x27;t take until the 3rd application for everything to look even and smooth. If you are going to do your feet,  and you should, apply lotion all over tops of feet, between the toes, and on the bottom too. If you have rough skin or calluses, it still needs to look good. I&#x27;m starting in April for my trip in mid May. There is a FACE Jergens lotion. I saw it at Target, but it could also be many other places. Including,..............ta da Amazon.  I would not apply a day before an occasion or date. No, No. For me takes 3 full applications to make everything look even and smooth. If you are fair, use fair. I am sooooooo fair and if it works for me, most likely for you too.  I just bought a bottle at Target because I couldn&#x27;t wait for the one I just ordered. Then I&#x27;ll have a back up.. Wooo hoooo.  GLOW ON PEOPLE.</li>
    <li> Gives a good subtle glow over time. Smell is pleasant and mild.</li>
    <li> As long as you use your basic &amp;#34;rules&amp;#34; for sunless tanner, then you&#x27;ll be find with this product. Be careful that you don&#x27;t use too much on your feet and leave them looking dirty.</li>
    <li> The product Amazon shipped doesn&#x27;t match what is pictured here or in the product description.  Disappointing, but I thought I would give what they sent me a try, since it&#x27;s not really worth returning. If you were hoping to try this on your jiggle, just be aware that it is not the \\&quot;Firming\\&quot; moisturizer as advertised. If that&#x27;s important to you, buy elsewhere.  The type I received is ... okay.  It did cause some streaking and had a little odor to it, although not as strong as other \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; lotions I have tried.  It has a sort of glitter to it, it&#x27;s subtle but I&#x27;d rather not sparkle. Maybe I&#x27;ll just try sunshine and dieting.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the funky tanner smell as most similar products. And, since the tan color isn&#x27;t as strong, but builds up over a few days,  I never have the problem of streaks or darker areas that I often have with the other tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy enough to use everyday and saves me from having to spend hours out in the sun.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 6 years ago, used it a few times and absolutely HATED the smell. I was so excited that it now says right on the bottle \\&quot;great color without odor\\&quot;. I thought surely that meant that it was odor free. I was wrong :(. Although it still has a definite odor, they have fixed the smell considerably. It is much more tolerable now, but when you expect no odor at all, it&#x27;s disappointing. The color I get from this is awesome though, so I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;My advice to you is to use it at night before going to bed so that the odor will fade as you sleep and it won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume the following day.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT RODUCT AND A GREAT PRICE! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for those of us who have a skin tone similar to someone who recently rose from the dead. I&#x27;d rather avoid skin cancer, so I go for the fake tan. In the past I&#x27;ve always ended up orange and streaky, but finally those days are over! I can tell a difference after one application, but it&#x27;s subtle, which I think is perfect. You can go with the subtle glow or do more applications to get a light tan. I&#x27;ve tried it both ways, and frankly anything (besides orange streaks) is better than blindingly white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Use regular lotion on any place that bone shows through skin. I put a layer of lotion on my knees, shins and feet just before using the Jergens and I get a nice even color - no dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t be stingy or you&#x27;ll end up streaky. You don&#x27;t need to go overboard with the amount of lotion you use, but a thin layer WILL leave you streaky. You need a decent amount for an even color. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth complaining about or losing a star for, considering how inexpensive it is.&lt;br /&gt;3. Be sure to wait to get dressed until you&#x27;re totally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, it&#x27;s that easy. I honestly don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about with the smell. It barely has a scent and I don&#x27;t find it at all offensive. It&#x27;s by far the least smelly tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this lotion is great! I&#x27;m so glad I found it. I can finally wear shorts and skirts without being embarrassed!</li>
    <li> I bought this in the store, but wanted to review it on here. I am fair-skinned. Since It&#x27;s almost summer, I want a nicer tan. Now, It&#x27;s cloudy a lot where I live, so I can&#x27;t always get the sun I want. When I do...well, the tan is uneven from my bathing suit. With the this, I can apply it evenly and have a nice color every where and It&#x27;s not so uneven. My body looks nicer already! I exercise, but this is completing the puzzle! I love it because it seems to actually work.</li>
    <li> I remember older Jergens working well but having an awful smell. This must be a new formula because it&#x27;s much improved. Light pleasant scent when applying that wears off quickly. I personally think all &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; moisturizer is bulls***. Want firmer thighs? Do some squats. But the gradual tanning aspect works great! Very natural looking.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion at a local store because I had been looking for something to provide some color before a vacation.  I have read so many reviews of similar products and just wanted something easy to apply.  I must say after 3 nights of using it I can tell a difference and I like the shade.  I don&#x27;t know why the reviewers say it has a terrible smell.  Folks must have more sensitive noses than me...I notice a faint lotion smell but I have that with all of my lotions.  I&#x27;ll keep using...at least until this bottle is gone.</li>
    <li> This product has worked ok on my arms and shoulders but has left my legs very blotchy. I used three times in my legs only after exfoliating and shaving, so the skin was not rough at all.  I discontinued use on my legs but it&#x27;s been three days of scrubbing and still I&#x27;ve got some orangy-brown patches :-(</li>
    <li> I have naturally pale skin and very little time to spend outdoors, so I purchased this product to try it out. The first few days, it gave my skin a bit of a yellowish tint. If you are planning on showing a lot of skin, I would wait a few days for the &#x27;tan&#x27; to build up a bit. After the first few days, it did give me a pretty natural-looking tan. As other reviewers have stated, you should definitely exfoliate. I didn&#x27;t for the first week or so that I used the product and it started to flake on my legs and arms.</li>
    <li> The thing that&#x27;s great about this product (which I&#x27;ve used for years now) is it works so gradually, it&#x27;s hard to mess it up or leave streaky marks.</li>
    <li> I am an avid Jergens Natural Glow user! It is the best quality and natural looking tanning lotion at a reasonable price. The only reason this product gets four instead of five stars is because I&#x27;m not sold on the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; part of this lotion. After years of using this product (albeit not consistently) my skin doesn&#x27;t feel noticeably firmer.</li>
    <li> Although my first tube was not purchased from Amazon I am very happy with the product as a first time user. My only question is: After applying for several days and achieving the color, will it wash off in the shower. I have read many reviews but no one seems to say what happens when we shower. The spray tans shower off almost immediately from the first shower after getting a it and they are very expensive for just a weeks tan. For anyone that has used this product Please let me know if it showers off or does it gradually fade..</li>
    <li> These product does give you a glow, but it streaks. I actually threw it away since it wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
    <li> I can only put this on at night because the smell is really odd and overbearing. I can&#x27;t tell if my skin looks better from the cream but it does do a good job of keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Came in a day or two late, which was disappointing. I love the effect it has on my skin.  I&#x27;m going to use it a couple weeks before my wedding to get a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, as well as the beautiful results she received from it. Unfortunately, no matter how closely I followed the directions, my own legs were streaky and orange within days -- on all THREE of the separate occasions I tried this product. In hindsight, I should&#x27;ve asked my friend to borrow her tube of Jergens Natural Glow before I bought my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some other reviewers, however, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the product&#x27;s smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this in early January because I have a tropical vacation coming up and I am very fair skinned. (I didn&#x27;t want to blend in with the sand). I saw immediate results within the first 3 days of use. There was no streaking. I could tell where I had put too much around my feet and ankles, but that&#x27;s user error. As long as I washed my hands immediately after I used it, it didn&#x27;t stain them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little cheesy. My husband noticed it after a few days and asked me why I smelled so weird. He didn&#x27;t like it. But I just put on a more scented lotion on my hands and it seemed to cancel out enough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 weeks of daily use, I noticed one day after the shower most of my color was gone. Except for some splotches on my stomach and lower legs. I continued to use it for a few more days but I&#x27;m not really seeing results anymore. I&#x27;m back to being super pale. I noticed my white towel though, is orange-y. (I apply AFTER I shower every day, so this is the previous day&#x27;s application).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll discontinue use for a week or so and then apply the three days before my vacation begins to see if I can achieve the tan I got at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was totally happy with the product until this week! What happened??  I know it doesn&#x27;t last forever, but if I&#x27;m continually re-applying daily, shouldn&#x27;t that keep it from totally going away?</li>
    <li> For some reason, this product sucked out all of my jeuvaderm and botox.  Never use it on your face if you have had fillers!</li>
    <li> leave your face like a doll. the color and appearance is beautiful</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical at first, a lotion that can give me color in 1 weeks time! But because I am VERY FAIR skinned I ordered it in hopes of not looking like a ghost all summer. The result was shocking, it has been 6 days and I have a very nice color to my skin, my boyfriend looked at me and asked if I&#x27;ve been outside! I know some reviews say the odor is horrible, but I haven&#x27;t noticed it, and the perfume from the lotion when you first put it on is very nice, someone actually complimented my perfume when all I had on was the lotion!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 3 years and I love it.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of negative reviews about streaks and patchy sections.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any streaks or patches and I wanted to share my routine, maybe it will help some people.&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliate in the shower, and pat dry my body. I put on the lotion all over and WAIT before I put on any clothes. While the lotion dries I do my hair and make up. By the time I&#x27;m done (usually 10-20 minutes) it&#x27;s all dry. I don&#x27;t put it on every day, I use it every 2-3 days. I do put some regular lotion around my knees and elbows so that the tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t color them too orange.  I also wash the palms of my hands with soap so they don&#x27;t turn orange.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps! I really love this product and the scent isn&#x27;t too bad, I mean, there&#x27;s worse products out there!</li>
    <li> As far as non streaky brown color, its there. Jergens does a great job of giving my pale skin a nice brown color that isnt orange and isnt streaky or flaky.  BUT--the tanning lotion smell is there and its there all day long. Especially when im sweating at the gym, the smell is definitely more aromatic; and while its not an awful smell, per se--its not the nicest either. It smells exactly like fake tanning lotion.  The color quickly fades when you stop using the lotion (as to be expected) and im not so sure the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; part is really all that noticeable either--but i tend to not really believe a lotion can tone your legs in the first place, so that also makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the color was great but the smell just was not worth it.</li>
    <li> Literally impossible to mess up, it builds up over time. Subtle and not obvious. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad. The tan looks hardly noticeable &amp; natural.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m naturally fair and I don&#x27;t tan well. I burn. This gives me a nice glow to my skin—never orange. If I do happen to get a little color in the summer, this is nice to use once a week to maintain my color longer. Never looks fake, never streaks. I don&#x27;t use it on my face though, although I like the separate face moisturizer they have even though I don&#x27;t really use it anymore. I can&#x27;t really attest to the firming part because I haven&#x27;t used the firming kind in awhile but back when I did use it, it seemed to be making a difference! Either way, it works in just a few days and gives a nice even glow. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. Dries fairly fast but I try not to wear white right after applying it because if you sweat soon after, a little color may transfer. But that&#x27;s usually if you don&#x27;t wait long enough for it to dry completely. And it never stains clothes. I&#x27;ve never had any issue with that. I swear by this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer for 2 reasons. The color is gradually produced not over coloring like most. It really does firm the skin well. Its the only product I buy. Received in a timely manner as well! Will purchase again from supplier</li>
    <li> I love this Jergens Glow!  I&#x27;m of Irish descent----need I say more?  Well, I will.....very pale skin and it&#x27;s always hard when wearing a dress to have such pale, glow in the dark legs.  Even though I&#x27;m fair, I use the &amp;#34; Fair to Medium &amp;#34; and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  No more glowing in the dark.  I was afraid that this may be too dark for my skin, but it&#x27;s perfect.  It looks like a real tan.  No streaks.  No orange color.  I even use it on my face!  Moisturizes my body nicely.  Only thing---I don&#x27;t really see any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; happening (yet).  I am going to be using this all year round!</li>
    <li> Lovely IF you want to look like Willy Wonka&#x27;s Oompha Loompha people. Problem is...I DON&#x27;T!  Product promised gradual color, no streaking. Well the gradual is true...it show up over 8-24 hours after application.  As for the streaking, it is definitely there, in areas such as my ankles where I was careful to put it on evenly.  Tan doesn&#x27;t &#x3D; orange, yet my skin has a definite yellow orange cast to it. I&#x27;m tossing this bottle and going back to my pasty white legs. Didn&#x27;t notice any snell.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, leaves your skin smooth with a light color, almost natural, this is my second purchase!</li>
    <li> This lotion is so lovely! Don&#x27;t expect fast results, though. It took about two weeks of regular use to notice a difference in my skintone. However, its immediate effects more than made up for it! It tightened my skin up and made it feel so soft and smooth, it was crazy. I&#x27;ve never had a lotion work so well before. And, once the color did show up, it look so natural that people were asking me where I had gone to tan. Will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> It definitely firmed my thighs! It looks great as well. It&#x27;s a bit uneven, but I&#x27;m getting tanned now so you can&#x27;t really tell. I bought the light and it looks very natural. A lot of oeople comment on how nice and tanned I look.</li>
    <li> It took a little time to figure out how to use it so it would go on evenly. You have to use less around you knees and the crease between your leg and foot. After I figured out how to use it I love it. I am extremely pail and it give my skin a nice glow. I&#x27;m am darker than people who were always darker then me. I love it love it LOVE It!!!!</li>
    <li> It works fairly well. I have pretty pale skin. Be careful when using it. It got a little patchy on my legs. Worked great on arms and chest.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My family has taken to calling me the Mexican vampire because they&#x27;re all dark skinned and I&#x27;m very pale - like a snowflake. I bought this so I wouldn&#x27;t stand out as much, and it really does its job!</li>
    <li> If you follow the easy application directions you get nice even,.natural looking color.  I can&#x27;t really speak to the firming but a great moisturizer too .Above all a really great price!</li>
    <li> I have Casper the Ghost white white skin and I burn easily, retain the burn but not the color etc., so self tanners are pretty much a necessity, but they are not perfect.  The good news is THIS ONE is as close as you can get to perfect if you want a healthy light color, and don&#x27;t expect it to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this shade, you don&#x27;t have to worry about streaking, off-color palms, etc. Just use it like regular body lotion - it smells great (until you get VERY warm, like about ready to perspire - THEN it will smell like a self-tanner - otherwise it smells fresh and my boyfriend compliments me on the scent all the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no \\&quot;tan lines\\&quot; or streaks, or dark spots on drier areas like elbows/knees/ankles/heels etc. and my \\&quot;Casper\\&quot; white skin is now a more healthy looking NATURAL color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it every other day and just once a day (you could use it more often and build up more color, faster), and the color on me is not \\&quot;tan\\&quot; but healthy and natural looking, - and it added enough color that my many multi-shade freckles are more blended in.  I feel MUCH better about showing my skin now.  And - BONUS - the spider veins are much less obvious too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;I like this for daily moisturizing, but keep in mind it (A) is temporary and does not gradually build because you shower it off, and (B) it WILL \\&quot;smell\\&quot; IF you get hot - (no worries if you stay a comfortable temp.)  It&#x27;s a good place to start but not the answer to summer sunless tanning. ---- Also, I tried the next darker level and did NOT have as good of results - the smell was different and it did streak/blotch.</li>
    <li> I purchased this new \\&quot;no odor\\&quot; Jergens glow last month because it was billed as no odor.  I was shocked to find that it was not odor free but was HEAVILY perfumed.  I do not recommend this product for anyone with allergies or asthma as I had an immediate attack the first time I applied the lotion.  Although it gave me a great and almost immediate tan the price of being sick is too much for me.  I will look for another product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jergens during the summer months for years. The tan is effective and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother, who is 80 years old.  She received it as a gift last year and cannot find it locally, where she lives.  She said that it really helps to firm up her skin and make her wrinkles less visible.  I ordered 2 tubes for her, and she was grateful.</li>
    <li> This is the safest way I know of to get tan, now. Tanning bed are out, and so is bathing in the sun.</li>
    <li> I use this product after showers or every other shower. Leaves a lovely natural tone over time and it REALLY FIRMS. I had some pretty terrible cellulite, no amount of gym work was fixing it. This has pretty much gotten rid of it, I even catch glances of my thighs in the mirror and love what I see. I did have one small issue; I had scraped my legs with a shaver the week before and the naked eye couldnt see any scabbing (is was a very fine scrape) but the lotion found it! I had a bit of a darker color right where the scrapes were. This went away after a few days and I havent had the issue again. I also scrub with coffee granules in the shower for the cellulite and allow it to sit while I shampoo. The results have been great.</li>
    <li> I really like this product~ the price is great and the scent is nice... It&#x27;s easy to apply, too... I do find that I get patches of unevenness, however, no matter how careful I am about applying it and giving it time to dry... I do exfoliate, before application, but still get darker areas... Overall, it&#x27;s a nice alternative to unhealthy tanning and gives my skin a nice glow!</li>
    <li> I use the light to medium color specifically for my legs. In general, I find applying skin cream kind of tedious especially since most products seem to last only several hours. This Jergens product makes my skin feel great and I notice it working even 24 hours later.</li>
    <li> Color looks real..not orange or streaky</li>
    <li> I have used this on and off for a few years. Each time early summer comes around and I don&#x27;t want to scare small children with my ghostly white skin, I buy a tube of Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow at the drugstore. I think to myself, the smell couldn&#x27;t have been THAT bad. After about a week, I remember why I stopped using it the previous year. It covers well, gives a nice natural color over the course of a few days and doesn&#x27;t streak. However, maybe it&#x27;s the way it just reacts with MY skin, but the stink is just god-awful. It doesn&#x27;t fade, either, as the day goes on. What I did was apply it at night, and then shower it off in the morning because I felt everyone around me could smell me. Only problem with that was it left the sheets stinky, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to give up this year and try another product. No smell, but I don&#x27;t want to say what it is because I don&#x27;t want to look like I&#x27;m trashing Jergen&#x27;s and plugging another brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love everything about it. It provides a natural looking tan with no streaks. AND the firming additive works!  People often comment how young and great my skin looks :)</li>
    <li> Best for a gradual tan. I use it on my legs all year round.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to bring some color to my super pale legs that never soak up any sun.  It helped the first day and I didn&#x27;t look at all like I&#x27;d used artificial tanner. I used right after showering and got great results, no streaking or rubbing off. After only three days of use my formerly glowing white legs match my naturally tan arms. I haven&#x27;t used for longer than three days running because the tanner works so well I don&#x27;t want my legs surpassing my arms and face. I&#x27;m now applying about every third day and maintaining natural looking tan legs. I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> I just love how Jergens is promoting this item as new and improved but \\&quot;without the odor\\&quot;... I bought this because I have fair skin and I thought, okay, if they went the extra mile to perfect the product, then I&#x27;m going to try it out AND I was most certainly disappointed (FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!). I usually always buy Jergens lotion, it&#x27;s a great brand and their normal lotions are so moisturizing and have a light scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, which I love and use often... this natural glow lotion is disgusting. I wanted to test this out at night because I was still skeptical and didn&#x27;t want to smell during the day.. I almost wish I had just gone with my gut and not purchased this because I woke up several times and wanted to gag. The scent of this lotion is horrible. At first, it has a kind of fragrant smell that only lasts about an hour.. after that, the sick tanning bed/lotion smell emerges and boy does it stay... and lingers.. for hours.. and hours. I woke up and could NOT wait to shower, I scrubbed and scrubbed hoping the smell would dissipate but oh no, I&#x27;m sitting here, surrounded by co-workers, smelling like a seasoned fake &amp; bake tanner. So all in all, I&#x27;m not happy, I smell, OH.. and I&#x27;m still as pale as I was yesterday.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin. I&#x27;ve learned to live with it because I do get some limited natural skin exposure without trying. I bought this product for winter when I look like Casper the Ghost. It usually takes three to four daily applications to achieve a subtle glow. More than that can result in a color that starts turning orangey and unnatural looking.&lt;br /&gt;After playing around with this, I have come to the no more than four day rule with a reapplication one week later. When I start looking faded (by week 3) I use an an exfoliator and start all over again. This has worked well and the added benefit of using this is that it is a decent moisturizer. Since this is used during the winter when my sun exposure is at a minimum, the benefits of the moisturizer is appreciated since it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t what I consider greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product so long as it isn&#x27;t over used initially.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this for a darker tan.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t use it every day. I notice this does give me a hint of color. I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Self Tanner because it claimed NOT-TO-HAVE an odor. Very Untrue!! It still smells like Self Tanner&#x27;s maybe not as stinky but the smell is still there and interfere&#x27;s with my perfume. Shame on you Jergens for telling a lie and claiming that there&#x27;s no odor now because this is simply not true!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great for fair-skinned people like me who want to look like they&#x27;re not quite deathly pale. I generally use this before a beach trip. However, like all sunless tanners, this one smells very distinctly like self-tanner. I recommend using it before bed, and then waking up to being tanner!</li>
