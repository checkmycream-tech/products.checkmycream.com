      <li>Marketed as a product for pregnant women, this cleanser and sunscreen can be used by those who are concerned by the amount of chemicals found in most skin care</li>
      <li>okay, but not crazy about it.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and I have not had any problems with this cleanser, and I am very pleased with</li>
      <li>I enjoy that the ingredients were safer, but I didn&#x27;t notice any true difference in my skin.</li>

      <li>right off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin started clearing up right away.  </li>
      <li>out in the sun, whatever you do, don&#x27;t sweat because this product will slide right off.  </li>
      <li>I tend to break out more when I am pregnant, so I wanted to give this product a try to see if it would combat my chin break-outs during my current pregnancy.  </li>
      <li>I can only assume if it is safe enough for pregnant women to be using this product, it must be safe for the rest of us.  </li>
      <li>I am definitely not pregnant but figured this product would be good for my skin.  </li>
      <li>It cleans very well, leaves no residue, doesn&#x27;t burn, and actually has a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>It felt clean too, and the lotion was light enough that it didn&#x27;t cause me to sweat from it while working at a bakery.  </li>

      <li>It rinses pretty well.</li>
      <li>I mix a little of the tinted SPF into my natural BB cream to get the right color, and end up with great sun protection, too.  </li>
      <li>It looked like I was putting sunscreen on and had to make sure I blended it in really well or the white wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
      <li>Using only a pea-sized amount of cleanser, the large tube can last months, which is good considering the package is $38.</li>
      <li>The expiration is 10 years, so it&#x27;s pretty much expired.</li>
      <li>Regarding the face wash, this did a pretty decent job of getting makeup off.</li>

      <li>It took much rubbing to get it into the skin.  </li>
      <li>With the heat wave most of us have been experiencing (or the occasional extra hot flash for some women...), this sunscreen won&#x27;t stay on long enough to do much good.  </li>

      <li>Due to many harsh chemicals in skin care products, pregnant &amp; nursing mothers have very limited options with their facial care, and since the hormones of pregnancy can wreak havoc on skin, it is very important to figure something out.  </li>

      <li>I do not want to imply that if you order this product you will get a 10 yr old product</li>
      <li>It actually made me break out more and dried my face</li>

      <li>I like it for being pregnant and not pregnant, works for both.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a normal user of Clindamicin/Benzol Peroxide (topical) and a wash with Salicylic acid.  </li>
      <li>Due to my extreme nausea, the smell of many things makes me sick, and this product, happily, did not.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it for being pregnant and not pregnant, works for both. this is definately an item I would recommend and buy more of later on for myself.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and save my skin from those ugly acne. This is my first pregnancy and i experienced worst skin problem. But this duo return back my pregnancy glow.....</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like it, not suitable for me at least, give it to my friend now.won&#x27;t buy it anymore.what a pity</li>
    <li> The face wash is cool spells like soda.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer doesn&#x27;t work well for me, my face is still pretty dry. Maybe the person could add some oil olive or whatever to it.</li>
    <li> My skin did not like it.  I&#x27;m a normal user of Clindamicin/Benzol Peroxide (topical) and a wash with Salicylic acid.  This product did not work for me, and made my acne return with a vengence.  Small white-head bumps plus inflamed acne.  Dr. said it was OK to return to my usual products.  I give it an extra star for safety and peace of mind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all by the face wash and in fact it was a huge disappointment. It actually made me break out more and dried my face so not only did I have massive zits, they were amplified by the fact that my chin was dry and flakey. I liked the body wash though and have started to use that on my face and it seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> The acne clearing wash smells good and is light but hasn&#x27;t cleared up my pregnancy acne.&lt;br /&gt;I love the sunblock though, it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out more like so many sunblocks do.</li>
    <li> I suffered from awful pregnancy acne when I was pregnant with my daughter (don&#x27;t they say, daughters steal their mother&#x27;s beauty?) after never suffering from acne problems. I have always used Cetaphil for normal skin, but it was doing NOTHING! My husband treated me to this, as it is quite a bit more expensive than my usual regime.  He became my knight in shining armor! My skin started clearing up right away.  It felt clean too, and the lotion was light enough that it didn&#x27;t cause me to sweat from it while working at a bakery.  I will be buying this for future pregnancies, for sure!</li>
    <li> Due to many harsh chemicals in skin care products, pregnant &amp; nursing mothers have very limited options with their facial care, and since the hormones of pregnancy can wreak havoc on skin, it is very important to figure something out.  The Belli Skin Care set is a great alternative.  It is gentle, but still actually works to eliminate blemishes, marks, and other skin problems (especially those associated with pregnancy).  It&#x27;s also still safe for the baby, whether born or unborn.</li>
    <li> I can only assume if it is safe enough for pregnant women to be using this product, it must be safe for the rest of us.  The product is pleasant enough for every day use.</li>
    <li> Was good at first. But then was too harsh for my sensitive skin. Didn&#x27;t enjoy the faint citrus scent. But maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> The spf lotion goes on super white, even though it&#x27;s supposed to be tinted. Made me look like a ghost and didn&#x27;t smell very good. Didn&#x27;t go on easily either. The facial wash is really nice, smells good, and has lasted a long time. It doesn&#x27;t foam up, so don&#x27;t expect it to.</li>
    <li> Great for pregnant mom&#x27;s sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This product has very little lather. I put it on my Clarsonic and it didn&#x27;t foam at all. I felt like I had to use reapply. I like that there is SPF in the lotion but it has an odd color and I didn&#x27;t like the way it went on my face. It looked like I was putting sunscreen on and had to make sure I blended it in really well or the white wouldn&#x27;t go away. This product is okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it. I have way better products in my cabinet that are more suited for me.</li>
    <li> The marketing is toward pregnant women and new moms, but the idea is simply that the products are made with active ingredients that are safe for baby. This set is particularly focused on problems enhanced by pregnancy - acne and sunspots. I don&#x27;t love the feel of the sunscreen, but the face wash is really nice. The tube is larger than I expected. It&#x27;s made with lactic acid, green tea, and cucumber and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Although not completely natural, the ingredients of Belli Complexion Duo are allergen tested and do not irritate the skin. Marketed as a product for pregnant women, this cleanser and sunscreen can be used by those who are concerned by the amount of chemicals found in most skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser, while not foamy, does a good job cleaning and tightening the pores. The sunscreen, with SPF 25, can be used as a moisturizer. Using only a pea-sized amount of cleanser, the large tube can last months, which is good considering the package is $38.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for my wife at the perfect moment.  I&#x27;m sure this product may not work for every body but for my wife, it&#x27;s been good.  Of course she experienced the typical acne thing during pregnancy, although why that is is a mystery to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that helps expecting mothers get through times when they feel not at their glowing best helps the babies out I think.  ;)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face wash and moisturizer! I suffer from mild acne and usually use Proactive or an over the counter acne wash with similar ingredients. When I am pregnant the hormonal changes up my acne from mild to severe. Plus, regular treatments are a no no for the baby. When I received this combo I had about five large red inflamed pimples. I noticed a difference after the first use, my skin felt clean and fresh. In about three days my pimples had shrunk considerably. In a week my skin was clear! This works better than any acne treatment I have after tried. The moisturizer helps with my skin tone too. I normally feel that I look red and blotchy and wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead without my make up..lol. I actually like the way I look without make up now. I go out without it sometimes and feel good about my skin :) I intended to continue using this after my pregnancy, it wonderful and a real life saver! For once I actually have that pregnancy glow everyone talks about.</li>
    <li> I am definitely not pregnant but figured this product would be good for my skin.  I like it okay, but not crazy about it.  It took much rubbing to get it into the skin.  I like the sunscreen part as I am in the sun quite a bit this time of the year.  It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel any better and I don&#x27;t think I would pay the price asked for it.  Just okay...nothing extra.</li>
    <li> Though not pregnant, I do suffer from the same hormonal changes that cause chloasma.  I also dislike the breakouts that are a bonus \\&quot;gift\\&quot;.  The Belli Complexion Protection Duo was yet another product for me to try in my search to find something that works without a bevy of side effects like dry skin, burning eyes, red skin, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Belli acne face wash is wonderful.  It is one of the few I&#x27;ve ever used (out of dozens) that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry and tight after use.  It cleans very well, leaves no residue, doesn&#x27;t burn, and actually has a nice scent.  After a few weeks of use, I notice less drying in the problem areas (nose, chin) where I also apply acne medication.  Less dryness &#x3D; fewer flaky patches and redness &#x3D; a happy me.  As for a reduction in breakouts, there was a slight but noticeable improvement. When it comes to natural acne cleansers, this is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other half to this duo, the Belli Anti-Chloasma Facial Sunscreen SPF 25, is TERRIBLE.  Other than not having a bad scent or making my skin react in any way, there really isn&#x27;t much good I can say about this product.  It looks slightly yellow and chalky coming out of the tube (I had to make sure the product hadn&#x27;t expired!), but actually feels greasy when applied to skin.  I know it says it&#x27;s oil free, but after applying it leaves behind a sticky shine.  The yellow cast to the product also is apparent on skin after application, which left me looking a bit sallow and sickly.  Though, I suppose if you do The yellow cast can be counteracted with makeup, but for those that don&#x27;t wear make-up, this might be a big factor in choosing to use this product.  The sticky shine factor is also unpleasant.  Little strands of hair kept getting caught against my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once out in the sun, whatever you do, don&#x27;t sweat because this product will slide right off.  I was not a happy camper to see clearly defined yellow beads of sweat on my face.  Any attempt at blotting/drying ended up removing the sunscreen.  With the heat wave most of us have been experiencing (or the occasional extra hot flash for some women...), this sunscreen won&#x27;t stay on long enough to do much good.  I later tried using it on my arms and legs, but ended up with the same result.  Any moisture contact and this sunscreen comes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that these products are natural, especially with the face wash.  I would certainly consider purchasing this product again in the future.  The sunscreen I can&#x27;t really recommend at all.  Since I use sunscreen year round, I will give this one another try when colder weather rolls around and see if it works any better then.attempt at blotting/drying ended up removing the sunscreen.

    <li> I enjoy that the ingredients were safer, but I didn&#x27;t notice any true difference in my skin. The moisturizer isn&#x27;t my favorite. It was to sheer for my taste.</li>
    <li> I like this brand. I used the oil during my 2nd pregnancy and had NO stretch marks. I like the brand&#x27;s philosophy and that the ingredients seem well researched and since there is a doctor behind it--that the products are safe. I should say I&#x27;m not pregnant  but got this product to review from Vine because the ingredients are non toxic and with so much junk out there for face washes and sunscreen, I thought why not? Regarding the face wash, this did a pretty decent job of getting makeup off. There is no strange smell. It&#x27;s gel-like (not lathering). It rinses pretty well. No breakouts since using it (several weeks). The sunscreen seems to work well.I only tried it a few times, but like that it&#x27;s zinc oxide. No sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like is that it says \\&quot;born 2002.\\&quot; Which means that, this being 2012, it&#x27;s 10 years old!! No wonder they were sending it out for a vine review! Who sends out a 10 yr product?? The expiration is 10 years, so it&#x27;s pretty much expired. I do not want to imply that if you order this product you will get a 10 yr old product--I sincerely hope that would not be the case--and I like that it tells you the date of manufacture, which you rarely see in the majority of products, but didn&#x27;t like the fact that I was testing a decade old product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay to the product, nay to me reviewing such an old version!</li>
    <li> I tend to break out more when I am pregnant, so I wanted to give this product a try to see if it would combat my chin break-outs during my current pregnancy.  The first thing I noticed was the scent of the cleanser.  It reminded me of lemon/lime alka-seltzer, which is a nice scent.  Due to my extreme nausea, the smell of many things makes me sick, and this product, happily, did not.  I have used the entire tube of cleanser over the course of about a month, and I can&#x27;t say that it has improved my breakouts any, but they have not gotten any worse.  Aside from the spots on my chin, my face is very soft, and I have not noticed any discoloration/patches that I have had in the past. I have sensitive skin, and I have not had any problems with this cleanser, and I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen in this set is another story.  It is very thick and greasy feeling.  It has the consistancy of the zinc oxide that lifeguards wear on their noses.  It squeezed out of the tube like toothpaste, and although it was supposed to be oil free, it felt very greasy to me.  I never used the sunscreen, because I could just imagine how clogged my pores would be after using it, I would be a poster child for breakouts.  In short, I would happily purchase more of the cleanser, but not the sunscreen.  If they only way to get the cleanser is to buy this duo, I would pass.</li>
    <li> The product i recieved was \\&quot;born in 2002\\&quot; and expires in a few months. The consistency of the product is very thick, likely because it is so old. It takes a long time to massage into my skin and often still have blotches of tinted moisturizer that I need to rebound throughout the day. I would not recommend this purchase. The cleanser is mediocre and Cetaphil works better.</li>
    <li> I mix a little of the tinted SPF into my natural BB cream to get the right color, and end up with great sun protection, too.  The face wash works well, too.</li>
