      <li>but it&#x27;s not the best one out there.</li>
      <li>min)&lt;br /&gt;Its the best lipstain I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Best to go to the store.  </li>
      <li>Lipstains are the best lipstick products around.</li>
      <li>This color is very bright and needs to be reapplied often.  </li>
      <li>This is great lip stain.</li>
      <li>Love the color!!</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful and the price is good.</li>
      <li>Good purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not a good lip stain at all.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good stain go to &amp;#34;Just Bitten&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Very good, stains well on lips and does not come off easily.</li>
      <li>OKay I love the color of this lipststain, but I&#x27;m more impressed with the quality.</li>
      <li>I use it way more than I use stains from Benefit or The Body Shop!  </li>
      <li>It still requires some kind of finishing lipstick or gloss, though.</li>
      <li>Yeah I like it , it looks nice and stains</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely a nice color.</li>
      <li>I. Thought it was going to be but its close it stays on for most part of the day</li>
      <li>she is in love with it</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>the most aweful lip stain made my lips bleed</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>After a month of using it the top brush fell off</li>
      <li>I  love the color, but that is about all I like about it.  </li>
      <li>and I was sure that it would be trash</li>
      <li>/&gt;it is very very very bright red, so if it doesn&#x27;t get evened out, it can look obnoxious.</li>
      <li>Make sure your lips are oil-less and free of lipgloss or chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Dries out very quickly.</li>
      <li>id love a full refund  </li>
      <li>but it still worked good as new.</li>
      <li>It stays as it should, and is super easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It comes off very easily and fades fast.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Love this, and it was soo much cheaper than in stores.</li>
      <li>The very first night I received it, I was so excited I put it on, sat and talked to my boyfriend.</li>
      <li>The color is good for those who do like a very red lip, I&#x27;m just not to that point, and this stain, with the way it wears off so quickly, isn&#x27;t going to help get me there.</li>
      <li>This did not stay on for me more than a couple of hours and started light and got extremity light in the short period it stayed on.  </li>
      <li>when I kiss my husband or a hot cup of coffee!</li>
      <li>but the stain is nice enough to wear alone.</li>
      <li>(: I really like this product!</li>
      <li>Love this color, but for a lip stain, it does not last.</li>
      <li>the end of the first day of using it, the color was fading on the marker.</li>
      <li>Not that it wasn&#x27;t pretty and all, but I didn&#x27;t want to have to apply another coat</li>
      <li>/&gt;Caution- apply it on dry, clean lips only, and be sure to smudge it out quickly, before it dries!</li>
      <li>The application feels like I&#x27;m drawing on my lips with a marker, and it was pretty easy to do, but also easy to mess up.</li>
      <li>It stayed a beautiful shade of red even when dried</li>
      <li>fast shipping thanks</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a real stain.</li>
      <li>Straight forward.</li>
      <li>Applies easily and stays put for a very long time.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to make the claim that a product will last for 16 hours, you would think it would last more than 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It runs dry quick and it doesn&#x27;t last long, I liked the color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the most long lasting lip stain</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit that I am a bit timid to actually wear strong lip colors in public, so I decided to buy this inexpensive lipstain to try it out.</li>
      <li>maybe I wasn&#x27;t putting it right big deal</li>
      <li>This is even brighter than I thought it would be, it&#x27;s a very pure red.</li>
      <li>But all in all its okay :\</li>
      <li>Truly smooth proof and long lasting,</li>
      <li>red and vibrant!</li>
      <li>again i would like to get a free one that isnt dried out</li>
      <li>It definitely  last a long time as long as you use it right, and the color is VIBRANT!</li>
      <li>I think it also really needs a clear gloss to go over the stain, otherwise the lips just look dried out.</li>

    <li> red and vibrant! Pain in the butt if you mess up though.</li>
    <li> I  love the color, but that is about all I like about it.  It does not last very long on the lips, or the tube.  Mine was dried out in less that a week.</li>
    <li> Love the color!! Truly smooth proof and long lasting,when I kiss my husband or a hot cup of coffee!</li>
    <li> Bought this product, hoping I had found something that I wouldn&#x27;t have to re-apply every few minutes. The very first night I received it, I was so excited I put it on, sat and talked to my boyfriend. Looked in a mirror 10 minutes later and it was just about gone.  Does&#x27;t last any longer than my one dollar mood lipstick.</li>
    <li> A lipstick that actually looked red for me</li>
    <li> dried out i hate it i wont buy it everrr again i would like to get a free one that isnt dried out</li>
    <li> Love this color, but for a lip stain, it does not last. It doesn&#x27;t even stay on for an hour.</li>
    <li> Dries out very quickly.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to make the claim that a product will last for 16 hours, you would think it would last more than 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to constantly reapply this throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the first day of using it, the color was fading on the marker. The second day I tried to use it, it barely left any color on my lips, it was almost dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good lip stain at all.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favourite lip stains!  I use it way more than I use stains from Benefit or The Body Shop!  It stays as it should, and is super easy to apply.  No tickling or dripping from stains like Benefit&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very donf of putting things on my lips because when I kiss my boyfriend they get all over him. I&#x27;ve seen recently that a lot of lip stains claim not to come off, and they&#x27;re not as permanent as a long wear lipstick. So when I saw that they were selling a cheep one online I thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;Though I love the color, the performance is why I was so disappointed. It didn&#x27;t last any longer than fifteen minutes and I didn&#x27;t even see my boyfriend that day. Then, when I letit dry all the way and kissed my boyfriend it definitely made his lips luscious and red. Not that it wasn&#x27;t pretty and all, but I didn&#x27;t want to have to apply another coat already.&lt;br /&gt;I wont be buying this again, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good stain go to &amp;#34;Just Bitten&amp;#34; by Revlon!</li>
    <li> This is even brighter than I thought it would be, it&#x27;s a very pure red. Applies easily and stays put for a very long time. This is great lip stain.</li>
    <li> lasts for a very long time, after putting on the result is very dramatic and looks amazing. i love it</li>
    <li> This color is very bright and needs to be reapplied often.  I like it regardless but it&#x27;s not the best one out there.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last very long at all!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a real stain. It comes off very easily and fades fast.</li>
    <li> Lipstains are the best lipstick products around. Stays on all day. Wont smear off during drinking and eating. Quality product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> dried out after two uses. bummer.</li>
    <li> It runs dry quick and it doesn&#x27;t last long, I liked the color but I suggest lipstick of red</li>
    <li> Make sure your lips are oil-less and free of lipgloss or chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;I usually draw the outline and the fill it in. Then I make an o with my mouth to let it all dry a bit (about 30 sec to a min)&lt;br /&gt;Its the best lipstain I have ever tried. You will prob want to put chap-stick over it or lipgloss after about 5 min of letting it dry, otherwise you will get transfer color and it will come off faster. It definitely  last a long time as long as you use it right, and the color is VIBRANT!</li>
    <li> Love this, and it was soo much cheaper than in stores.</li>
    <li> OKay I love the color of this lipststain, but I&#x27;m more impressed with the quality. I accidentally left the lid unscrewed in my purse and I was sure that it would be trash but it still worked good as new.</li>
    <li> i took that one for my sister, she like it too much.&lt;br /&gt;so i advice you to buy it. she is in love with it</li>
    <li> the most aweful lip stain made my lips bleed id love a full refund  the worst prodiuct out there  i want refund</li>
    <li> I never wear anything but lip gloss and decided to try this on a recommendation from a blogger who suggested applying the stain and then removing it so that it would leave just a hint of the color...that technique works and will last for awhile but the stain is nice enough to wear alone. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> A lot of lip stains turn a completely different colour when they dry, but this one didn&#x27;t. It stayed a beautiful shade of red even when dried</li>
    <li> I can apply lighter and then do another layer to darken it up. It still requires some kind of finishing lipstick or gloss, though. It&#x27;s just not saturated enough or doesn&#x27;t dispense well enough to have this be the only product applied to the lips.</li>
    <li> Yeah I like it , it looks nice and stains ok but I have a very bad habit on licking my lips especially when my lips are dry and trust me with this lip stick you NEED Chapstick or something so your lips won&#x27;t get cappy looking also it comes off after 20 min for me :\ Anyways tho .. After a month of using it the top brush fell off I thought I pushed it hard or whatever I did maybe I wasn&#x27;t putting it right big deal huh! (You get what you pay for) But then when I put it back on the next day it fell off again &amp;#62;.&amp;#62; now I&#x27;m thinking maybe it&#x27;s not me 0-0... But all in all its okay :\</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I am a bit timid to actually wear strong lip colors in public, so I decided to buy this inexpensive lipstain to try it out. The application feels like I&#x27;m drawing on my lips with a marker, and it was pretty easy to do, but also easy to mess up. Fortunately for me, it wears off within an hour or two, but it leaves behind lines of pigment in the lines of my lips, which looks really weird and slightly frightening. It wears off quicker if I drink water or eat. I think it also really needs a clear gloss to go over the stain, otherwise the lips just look dried out. The color is good for those who do like a very red lip, I&#x27;m just not to that point, and this stain, with the way it wears off so quickly, isn&#x27;t going to help get me there.</li>
    <li> This did not stay on for me more than a couple of hours and started light and got extremity light in the short period it stayed on.  And it is not smooch proof.</li>
    <li> Very good, stains well on lips and does not come off easily. The color is beautiful and the price is good.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth it! It&#x27;s not the most long lasting lip stain but it&#x27;s definitely a nice color. Straight forward. Reminds me a lot of a red crayola marker from kindergarten though...you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase. It was dry and colorless.  Best to go to the store.  I think Target carries this product.</li>
    <li> (: I really like this product! the color is extremely red and gives a sassy/flirty feel to your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution- apply it on dry, clean lips only, and be sure to smudge it out quickly, before it dries! you can try smoothing it over with chapstick or lip gloss!&lt;br /&gt;it is very very very bright red, so if it doesn&#x27;t get evened out, it can look obnoxious.</li>
    <li> I like this its really not the color I. Thought it was going to be but its close it stays on for most part of the day fast shipping thanks</li>
