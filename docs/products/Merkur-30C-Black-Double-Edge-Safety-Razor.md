      <li>/&gt;Looks classy as heck and gives just as good of a shave as the gillette 17 blade power</li>
      <li>I bought this razor looking for a contemporary look, high quality feel, and a great controlled shave.</li>
      <li>but it just seems sooo worth it!  </li>
      <li>I have always wanted to be able to use a DE razor, and even a straight razor.</li>
      <li>Being able to change the blade often, since they are MUCH cheaper than venus blades, is preventing anymore razor burn/bumps.</li>
      <li>I find the Merkur 2pc razors more aggressive but too much so for me.</li>
      <li>It has a good weight to it and the handle&#x27;s texture is easy to grip even while wet.</li>
      <li>You get a mild shave.</li>
      <li>Will most likely purchase more and display them on the bathroom countertop as well as use them.</li>
      <li>but when I finally received it, I was very pleased.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much stubbier in person than any of the pictures can accurately portray.</li>
      <li>It makes shaving fun again.</li>
      <li>The handle is short, and the end fits perfectly inside my palm, which helps when shaving around contours; some reviewers have found it uncomfortable, but i think it&#x27;s a benefit of good</li>
      <li>Wow what a razor, for those that are stock on more than one blade you guys are wasting your money.</li>
      <li>and it has a nice overall heft to it.</li>
      <li>crosshatch on the handle is very positive and wont slip in soapy hands.</li>
      <li>It also shaves good, it&#x27;s well built like the other Merkur razors.</li>
      <li>Need to fully disassemble when replacing the blades, and the handle is a little short, The rest is just perfect.</li>
      <li>As a newbee to the old DE shaver it made learning easy and shave compares better or equal to any moder 3,4,5 blade out there.</li>
      <li>My first safety razor</li>
      <li>After transitioning from traditional 3+ blade razor I fell in love with this one.  </li>
      <li>It was my first time making cream in my bowl with a badger brush, and that in itself was a treat for my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After the first stride/stroke/pass..</li>
      <li>i used the razor for the first time with the included merkur blade.</li>
      <li>is my first safety razor</li>
      <li>My first Safety razor</li>
      <li>The downside is that I have a pretty epic beard, so I am only able to shave my neck.</li>
      <li>Very high quality feel finish and function.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t even feel as if I was passing a razor over my neck, and it was a VERY close shave.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much in this razor</li>
      <li>I had expected much more from a Merkur razor.</li>
      <li>I use an aggressive blade like a feather stainless platinum with this razor because it is just like the rest of the Merker 3 pc line.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this razor!</li>
      <li>very well</li>
      <li>Good for gentle shaving but not aggressive enough for rough stubble unless you take three or four passes.  </li>
      <li>However, beard and face must be very clean, very wet (hot); apply a quality post-shave.  </li>
      <li>Classic Merkur head in a 3 piece design, very grippy handle and very maneuverable.</li>
      <li>Like any other razor, the quality of the shave is mostly dependent on the blade...</li>
      <li>For those that have huge hands you may want to buy the long handle edition.</li>
      <li>I experimented with shaving creams and believe the less you use, the better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Proglide Shaving takes half the time with greater satisfaction and NO nicks.  </li>
      <li>The handle keeps the blade steady.</li>
      <li>So to summarize, love it, low price and high quality, I imagine it will last me for decades.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>so I suggest you spend a little more money and invest in the longer handled razor.</li>
      <li>Overall well worth the money.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m surprised it is not more popular at the $30 price point.</li>
      <li>But I haven&#x27;t had even a scratch so far!  </li>
      <li>It has the same Merkur DE shaving head that I have seen on most other Merkur products, which a reliable tried-and-tested design.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous blades in this razor and pretty much get the same results.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have large hands by any stretch but the handle in this feels tiny.</li>
      <li>As far as I am concerned this is a waist of money and time.</li>
      <li>so I change the blade frequently in the Merkur.</li>
      <li>High quality materials, solid feel, hefty weight -</li>
      <li>The weight of the razor is fantastic, although the handle is a little short, but nothing that some getting used to doesn&#x27;t solve.  </li>
      <li>I must admit I was extremely nervous to use the razor for the first time.</li>
      <li>but so far I couldn&#x27;t imagine any possible complaints.</li>
      <li>a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a hot shower, used some Jack Black face scrub to loosen up my neck hair and exfoliate the skin.</li>
      <li>I am not disappointed in the least.</li>
      <li>so I can not compare to other safety razors but normal toss away</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> From the age of 15 until 50 I used a Gillette safety razor.  Switched to Gillette&#x27;s macro blades and upgraded as Gillette added blades.  I&#x27;m now 81 and found the Proglide blades too expensive .  Went to the safety razor last month.  Bad decision.  After 2+ weeks of daily safety razor shaving, I gave up and returned to Gillette&#x27;s Proglide.  Hang the expense/&lt;br /&gt;Proglide Shaving takes half the time with greater satisfaction and NO nicks.  I experimented with shaving creams and believe the less you use, the better.  Excessive lather clogs the multi-blades and affects the shave.  However, beard and face must be very clean, very wet (hot); apply a quality post-shave.  I favor the Neutradena products.</li>
    <li> It makes shaving fun again.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to be able to use a DE razor, and even a straight razor. To me, it just signifies being a gentleman and bad@$$. The downside is that I have a pretty epic beard, so I am only able to shave my neck. I received my razor yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a hot shower, used some Jack Black face scrub to loosen up my neck hair and exfoliate the skin. I must admit I was extremely nervous to use the razor for the first time. It was my first time making cream in my bowl with a badger brush, and that in itself was a treat for my skin. I have done a lot of research about DE razors, so I knew not to apply pressure. I also knew which way my hair grows and went with the grain, and then against for a second shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first stride/stroke/pass..I was hooked! It didn&#x27;t even feel as if I was passing a razor over my neck, and it was a VERY close shave. I became more confident every pass, and didn&#x27;t even nick myself. I lathered up again, and then went against the grain. I ALWAYs cut myself with a multi blade cartridge, but not with this beauty! Perhaps beginners luck, but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed, I considered shaving my beard just so I could keep shaving.  Shaving with this razor, a badger brush and fresh cream is awesome. I love shaving now!</li>
    <li> Great product easy to use and handle. Would buy again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Good for gentle shaving but not aggressive enough for rough stubble unless you take three or four passes.  I upgraded to more aggressive Merkur, and use both.</li>
    <li> Perfect weight. Love it</li>
    <li> High quality materials, solid feel, hefty weight - all contribute to the pleasure of using this razor. The handle is short, and the end fits perfectly inside my palm, which helps when shaving around contours; some reviewers have found it uncomfortable, but i think it&#x27;s a benefit of good design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first safety razor and I love using it. It beats all the disposable cartridge systems that I&#x27;ve used. This is the sort of item that can get passed on from generation to generation - nothing disposable about it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my choice.</li>
    <li> I heard about the benefits of switching to a safety razor, but was concerned that I&#x27;d nick legs. Haven&#x27;t done it yet. The handle keeps the blade steady. Being able to change the blade often, since they are MUCH cheaper than venus blades, is preventing anymore razor burn/bumps.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first entry into DE shaving and have been using it every other day for the past 2 months. It&#x27;s sturdy and works well with the Derby and Merkur blades I have been using it with. It has a good weight to it and the handle&#x27;s texture is easy to grip even while wet. It has the same Merkur DE shaving head that I have seen on most other Merkur products, which a reliable tried-and-tested design. Overall I like it.</li>
    <li> razor is a piece of junk.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> 1st safety razor, good weight, easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor but not for me as I like a longer handle. I returned it and purchased casually the same razor but with a longer handle. Merkur makes a beautiful razor. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great razor, heft, construction, feel. Overall well worth the money. As a newbee to the old DE shaver it made learning easy and shave compares better or equal to any moder 3,4,5 blade out there.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product. I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much in this razor but when I finally received it, I was very pleased. My only ding was that I should have bought the longer handle blade (same  style). It feels very small in my hand so I suggest you spend a little more money and invest in the longer handled razor. In all, it&#x27;s still deserves 5 stars for the quality.</li>
    <li> This thing is sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks classy as heck and gives just as good of a shave as the gillette 17 blade power whatever, if not better and with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference is that the blades for these come in packs of 100 for like $11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make the investment and switch on over to the enlightened side, you&#x27;ll save lots of money on blades in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the learning curve isn&#x27;t too high with these, i&#x27;ve managed not to cut myself too bad yet and I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year now. just get a styptic pencil or a block of alum or something and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have large hands by any stretch but the handle in this feels tiny. The weight is good and it still provides a close, comfortable shave so I&#x27;m giving it four stars, but man the small handle takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> A little thin for me. Did not feel manly imo</li>
    <li> Happy with it. Need to fully disassemble when replacing the blades, and the handle is a little short, The rest is just perfect. Very good geometry, very good surface finish.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using safety razors. I now own two. This one and a muehle. I love them both. Will most likely purchase more and display them on the bathroom countertop as well as use them. You can definitely see the German engineering and quality in these razors. Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor so I can&#x27;t comment on how it compares to anything else but so far I couldn&#x27;t imagine any possible complaints. After buying it I second guessed myself about getting the 20c instead for the longer handle but after using it this is a non-issue. Even for my 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; roommate who gave it a spin he didn&#x27;t find it too small in his much larger hands. So to summarize, love it, low price and high quality, I imagine it will last me for decades.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome and I&#x27;m surprised it is not more popular at the $30 price point. Classic Merkur head in a 3 piece design, very grippy handle and very maneuverable.</li>
    <li> From what I have read on other review&#x27;s , all the merkur three piece razors have the same head design . The head on this razor doesn&#x27;t allow the blade to contact  your face properly. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the handle. I have tried numerous blades in this razor and pretty much get the same results. If you suffer from razor burn easily this may be the razor for you. I had expected much more from a Merkur razor. As far as I am concerned this is a waist of money and time.</li>
    <li> I love it. My first Safety razor so I can not compare to other safety razors but normal toss away razors don&#x27;t stand a chance anymore. I don&#x27;t think i will ever go back and I will be sticking with safety razors for now on. The cost of the razor its self isn&#x27;t bad and over time works itself out. I bought a 30 pack of blades for 6 bucks!!! Thats insane compared to todays disposable razor prices. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this same razor again if for some reason I lost mine. Sturdy construction, no issues!</li>
    <li> Bought this in an attempt to save some money on razor blades.  The weight of the razor is fantastic, although the handle is a little short, but nothing that some getting used to doesn&#x27;t solve.  The closeness of the shave is far better than that from expensive 3 blade disposables!  Never looking back!</li>
    <li> The handle has a good feel. It should not slip in any condition. This razor is attractive and has a good balance. It also shaves good, it&#x27;s well built like the other Merkur razors. I use an aggressive blade like a feather stainless platinum with this razor because it is just like the rest of the Merker 3 pc line. You get a mild shave. I find the Merkur 2pc razors more aggressive but too much so for me.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor and I love it!  I was using a mug and shaving brush with a Sensor razor but this is how it should be. I hesitated to switch to DE shaving, because I thought I&#x27;d be cutting myself. But I haven&#x27;t had even a scratch so far!  It takes a bit longer to shave but it just seems sooo worth it!  And I just paid $8.97 for 50 blades. Vs $28.00 for 10 Sensors.  Not ever going back!</li>
    <li> Solid product, functions as expected.  I&#x27;m definitely sold on the single blade razor.  In hind sight this does seem slightly expensive at about 30 bucks, and I can see graduating to another one eventually - maybe longer handle or butterfly.  Overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Easy to change out blades and keep clean.  After transitioning from traditional 3+ blade razor I fell in love with this one.  The handle is heavy and fits well in the hand and the black handle provides grip and a modern touch to a old school blade.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice razor. the handle is quite short and thin(i have big hands)but very well balanced.the crosshatch on the handle is very positive and wont slip in soapy hands. this is a 3 piece razor and a lot like my jager.i have a longer handle barber pole merkur as well,that is nice but not as well balanced. i used the razor for the first time with the included merkur blade. i should have used one of the feather or dorco blades as they are both sharper. for as nice as their razors are i dont see how they sell any of their blades as dull and expensive as they are.all in all i would buy again and may buy the longer handle version to see how i like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this and use it with the Derby brand blades,and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal for the money.They work to give me a very good shave with no nicks or cuts so far.I usually get four shaves with this per blade.</li>
    <li> No problems with this razor, I use it just about every day with Wilkinson blades.</li>
    <li> Although not drop-in simple as  the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; design, the mechanism works well and it has a nice overall heft to it. Like any other razor, the quality of the shave is mostly dependent on the blade...I use a a Braun electric on a day-to-day basis so I change the blade frequently in the Merkur. It&#x27;s very smooth and thorough on my neck where the Braun is not as reliable.</li>
    <li> For a smooth, close shave, Merkur is best!</li>
    <li> Very high quality feel finish and function. Highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> Fits in the hand perfectly with good balance.  Seems like it will last forever.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor looking for a contemporary look, high quality feel, and a great controlled shave. I am not disappointed in the least. Now be warned, this thing is very small. It&#x27;s much stubbier in person than any of the pictures can accurately portray. Had I known this I would have gone for the 20C or a barber pole, but I decided to keep this one for travel and started shaving with it. Guess what? It&#x27;s awesome and I have no plan to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although a little weird to grab onto at first compared to my cheap Lord razor, it takes no time to get used to. The grooves you see etched into the handle are really noticeable to the fingers and combined with how this razor is weighted, they provide superb control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit and finish, style are top notch too. At this price what more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> Wow what a razor, for those that are stock on more than one blade you guys are wasting your money. If your are tired of wasting  your money  go to this razor a little  expensive at the beginning  but is worth. For those that have huge hands you may want to buy the long handle edition.</li>
