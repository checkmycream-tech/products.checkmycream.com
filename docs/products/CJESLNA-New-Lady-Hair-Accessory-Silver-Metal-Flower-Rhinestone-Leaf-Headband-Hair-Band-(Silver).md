    <li> I waited awhile to get this. It&#x27;s a very pretty head band I accidentally ordered the same head band from another seller so I had two. which worked out because one fit perfectly this one however is kid size. When I tried to put it on the metal became that attaches the silver. It snap and cut my finger.look at te reviews if it says small Beverly carefull my pinky finger is bruised and has a cut. So glad I got the other one. People stop by my job just to see what headband I&#x27;m wearing that day.</li>
    <li> The product was broken when it arrived and I was unable to use it for my wedding</li>
