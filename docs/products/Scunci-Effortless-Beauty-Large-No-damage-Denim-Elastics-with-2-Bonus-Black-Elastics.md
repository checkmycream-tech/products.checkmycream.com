### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great hairbands!</li>
      <li>These elastics are  great.</li>
      <li>A great price and add on.</li>
      <li>This color pack is my favorite now, all the best neutrals.</li>
      <li>and she loved them.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Good quality, good colors.</li>
      <li>Good hair tie</li>
      <li>These work nicely for my hair</li>
      <li>These are nice scrunci&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Easy to take off!</li>
      <li>The quality is okay, and there are plenty of elastics.</li>
      <li>I was looking for more earthtone colors for my collection.</li>
      <li>Love how there are so many colors out there, so</li>
      <li>After one use, they lose most of their elasticity.</li>
      <li>I like how there are many in a pack with the variety of colors</li>
      <li>Holds my hair but stretches easily.</li>
      <li>I can find the exact brown of my hair and they blend in nicely.  </li>
      <li>and, I have to say, they&#x27;re way more durable and fun to use than rubber bands.</li>
      <li>With long hair, and a fetish for matching colors with my outfits, I&#x27;m always looking for good hair products.</li>
      <li>I wrap them about 3 times to hold my hair down efficiently, and they stay in great throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>What can I say, they&#x27;re hairbands, sturdy and work great for really thick hair.  </li>
      <li>and I love how big they are.</li>
      <li>These work great for my thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I keep a lot of these in my purse just in case that happens, so I can put my hair back up easily.</li>
      <li>I love that these don&#x27;t have a metal clip, so nothing for my long straight hair to get caught on.  </li>
      <li>, I thought I the whole pack had the rubber lining, rather than the two samples.</li>
      <li>I never bought such cheap hair ties from scrunci.</li>
      <li>but so far these have worked better then other ones</li>
      <li>My hair is not thick by any means...</li>
      <li>The main problem is that the elastics are far too stretchy.</li>
      <li>But as far as hair ties go, these are the cream of the crop for me!  </li>
      <li>My 05 year old daughter wears them to school</li>
      <li>So far I have had 8 break on me.</li>
      <li>They are soft and don&#x27;t yank my hair out when I go to pull my ponytail out.  </li>
      <li>Great colors but elastics are too thick, at least for my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, bottom line: 4 stars -- not perfect, but good enough for my purpose.</li>
      <li>They stretch a bit over time, but nothing major</li>
      <li>They are a one time use only and have barely any elastic and stretch out after 30 minutes</li>
      <li>Good hair ties- its very hard to find ones that work because my hair is so thick</li>

    <li> These work great for my thick hair.  I wrap them about 3 times to hold my hair down efficiently, and they stay in great throughout the day.  They are soft and don&#x27;t yank my hair out when I go to pull my ponytail out.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is they do tend to lose their elasticity after awhile.  I keep a lot of these in my purse just in case that happens, so I can put my hair back up easily.</li>
    <li> Great hairbands! I&#x27;ve been using these for years, and always find them reliable. They stretch a bit over time, but nothing major</li>
    <li> Bought them for my gf and she loved them.</li>
    <li> Good product. Holds hair in place well. Had one bow break on me after about 30 uses, but I have really thick hair</li>
    <li> These do not work. I never bought such cheap hair ties from scrunci. They are a one time use only and have barely any elastic and stretch out after 30 minutes</li>
    <li> I have used scunci products for years. I used to swear by them... until I got these.  So far I have had 8 break on me. My hair is not thick by any means... and I don&#x27;t sit there and stretch them out.. disappointed for sure</li>
    <li> These are nice scrunci&#x27;s but some do break if I try to force a 3rd loop. I have long thick hair and securing it in place is pretty hard with these. I usually have to use two for a bun and I have to have my hair completely wet in order for one of these to hold a ponytail. I like how there are many in a pack with the variety of colors but it just doesn&#x27;t do a 100% job. My hair would be about 75% maintained with these and that is with trying to do the same up ​do over and over again.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair but stretches easily.</li>
    <li> These elastics are  great. Cause no hair damage. Easy to take off! My 05 year old daughter wears them to school and I get no complains from her.</li>
    <li> Good hair ties- its very hard to find ones that work because my hair is so thick so these do work but I find that I have to redo my hair alot but so far these have worked better then other ones</li>
    <li> A great price and add on. My girls and I go through these like nothing and I love how big they are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;ve been using these things for years to wrap wires and, I have to say, they&#x27;re way more durable and fun to use than rubber bands. This color pack is my favorite now, all the best neutrals.</li>
    <li> What can I say, they&#x27;re hairbands, sturdy and work great for really thick hair.  Well, as well as anything can work for really thick hair and if you have really thick hair, then you know what I&#x27;m saying.</li>
    <li> I have long fairly thick naturally curly/wavy hair that I usually wear pulled back into a low pony tail.  These work nicely for my hair -- I can wrap 3 times, and they hold well.  They&#x27;re sturdy, too -- thicker than a lot of alternatives.  However, they don&#x27;t \\&quot;recover\\&quot; when I take them out as well as I&#x27;d like.  And when I reuse the same one the next day, it&#x27;s looser -- in other words, they seem to lose their elasticity with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, you get a LOT of them in a package, and I like this set of colors: black, dark blue, denim blue, and other \\&quot;neutrals\\&quot; that can go with just about everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line: 4 stars -- not perfect, but good enough for my purpose.</li>
    <li> The quality is okay, and there are plenty of elastics. The main problem is that the elastics are far too stretchy. After one use, they lose most of their elasticity. It might just be part of the \\&quot;no-damage\\&quot; thing, but the elastics slip off my hair within an hour. I prefer the Ouchless brand.</li>
    <li> I like the fact these don&#x27;t have any sharp parts to break off long hair.</li>
    <li> Good quality, good colors. I was looking for more earthtone colors for my collection. With long hair, and a fetish for matching colors with my outfits, I&#x27;m always looking for good hair products.</li>
    <li> Great colors but elastics are too thick, at least for my hair.  Too loose when wrapped 3 times, too tight when wrapped 4 times.</li>
    <li> I love that these don&#x27;t have a metal clip, so nothing for my long straight hair to get caught on.  They eventually wear, and stretch out, but that&#x27;s just the nature of the beast - I&#x27;ve never met a hair tie that didn&#x27;t.  But as far as hair ties go, these are the cream of the crop for me!  Simple, so they can go with a casual or dressy outfit.  Love how there are so many colors out there, so I can find the exact brown of my hair and they blend in nicely.  I will buy these again and again, and recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> Good hair tie, I thought I the whole pack had the rubber lining, rather than the two samples. So there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the scrunchies, I just found the explanation to be misleading.</li>
