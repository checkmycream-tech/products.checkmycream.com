      <li>best mascara out there</li>
      <li>I gave it to my best friend as a christmas gift</li>
      <li>Just perfect.</li>
      <li>This is the best mascara I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I am a mascara junkie, and this is probably one of the very best mascaras I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Product is wonderful; price was great.  </li>
      <li>excellent works good for me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a great mascara...</li>
      <li>Great mascara.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to know I have a good go to mascara though!  </li>
      <li>It is a good mascara</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and accentuates all my lashes perfectly.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>love it !</li>
      <li>Love the Estee Lauder mascara!</li>
      <li>I bought this mascara at the cosmetics counter and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>It was nice not to have to go to he store.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to any woman who is looking for the perfect mascara!</li>
      <li>and I find Estee Lauder mascaras to be the best, so far.</li>
      <li>This one in particular is very good.</li>
      <li>More than that, though, I think it especially succeeds as a lengthening mascara, which really isn&#x27;t what the product is billed as, but suits me just fine.</li>
      <li>but it kind of gets easily off</li>
      <li>My lashes look great all day, with absolutely zero flaking.</li>
      <li>Love  the volume  </li>
      <li>After searching for many years for the perfect mascara, I finally found it!</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I have tried a billion mascaras from every end of the spectrum (dept store to drug store) and this one always comes out on top.  </li>
      <li>Estee Lauder mascaras are my favorite.</li>
      <li>This mascara fills the bill and I have tried most of them</li>
      <li>I am a mascara junkie like most women.  </li>
      <li>Many tubes that have gone in the trash.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>This is the perfect way to get the products you want and at a cheaper price than regular retail stores.</li>
      <li>I stumbled on this mascara by getting it in an Estee Lauder \\&quot;freebie\\&quot; and I am glad that I did.</li>
      <li>Usually love their products</li>
      <li>I love EL products, so, we shall see.  </li>
      <li>The product did not go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>so far, so good.  </li>
      <li>I used to use Lancôme definicils and waterproof Maybelline Falsies which was a huge pain to remove, but this product is way better than definicils and really negates the need for waterproof mascara period!</li>
      <li>It almost seems like they sent me a returned &amp; used one that is many, many months old.</li>
      <li>A good idea, since I now buy only E L mascaras.</li>
      <li>so I ordered a full size.</li>
      <li>The correct mascara as sent in quick tim.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it warrants the higher price unless name brand is important.</li>
      <li>I am always on the great mascara hunt looking for something that will make my eyelashes long, full and natural looking.  </li>
      <li>I like it better than Dior Show and many other mascaras.      </li>
      <li>After developing a skin sensitivity to my normal foundation, I was told to use Estee Lauder Futurist which is supposed to be safe for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment!  </li>
      <li>Found it is worth it to spend a little more for mascara!</li>
      <li>Fast shipment and product exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>My lashes look healthy and long</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice because I can use 1 coat during the day for a lighter look and 2 or 3 for a more dramatic look.  </li>
      <li>I am very pretentious with mascaras, I used to love only Yves Saint Lauren mascaras as it were only they to provide ideally separated eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Wow!!!</li>
      <li>I have typical Asian &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t-hold-a-curl&amp;#34; lashes and this is amazing stuff!</li>
      <li>I usually look for lengthening and volume (don&#x27;t most of us?!)  </li>
      <li>I am sure I will always try the next big thing that promises everything I want in a mascara.  </li>
      <li>I recently received a trial of the &#x27;Sumptuous Bold&#x27;, just an FYI</li>
      <li>I used to love Max Factor mascara -- which had a cult following before it took its entire line to Paris and no longer sells in the US.</li>
      <li>I was introduced to Estee Lauder mascaras by way of the free samples given when you spend a certain amount on other E L products.</li>
      <li>I am really dissatisfied that this seller would sell old merchandise</li>
      <li>Lashes are long, bold and curl out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always trying new mascaras</li>
      <li>Estee Lauder mascara pleasantly surprised me!</li>
      <li>I was much happier with bare essentials mascara because that one went on cleaner and didn&#x27;t flake.</li>
      <li>I love that it washes off very easily, not over waxy, etc.  </li>
      <li>I received the product and it was old to start with.  </li>
      <li>Not only is it volumizing, but it really does lift and curl my lashes as well.</li>
      <li>Not only is it very gentle to my eyes, it makes my nearly non-existent eye lashes appear thick and long.</li>

    <li> best mascara out there</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this mascara by getting it in an Estee Lauder \\&quot;freebie\\&quot; and I am glad that I did. I am always on the great mascara hunt looking for something that will make my eyelashes long, full and natural looking.  This mascara fills the bill and I have tried most of them I think.  I like it better than Dior Show and many other mascaras.      Try it -  you will like it!</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample freebie.  It&#x27;s the only mascara I can wear that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water for hours on end including ones supposedly hypoallergenic.  Goes on smooth and accentuates all my lashes perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara at the cosmetics counter and really liked it.  It was nice not to have to go to he store. The correct mascara as sent in quick tim.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful; price was great.  Fast shipment and product exactly as described.  This is the perfect way to get the products you want and at a cheaper price than regular retail stores.</li>
    <li> I am a mascara junkie, and this is probably one of the very best mascaras I have ever had. Not only is it volumizing, but it really does lift and curl my lashes as well. More than that, though, I think it especially succeeds as a lengthening mascara, which really isn&#x27;t what the product is billed as, but suits me just fine.

    <li> I&#x27;m always trying new mascaras and I find Estee Lauder mascaras to be the best, so far. I was introduced to Estee Lauder mascaras by way of the free samples given when you spend a certain amount on other E L products. A good idea, since I now buy only E L mascaras.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever tried. I love it.  Lashes are long, bold and curl out. Just perfect.</li>
    <li> Great mascara. No spider lashes. Doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> I received the product and it was old to start with.  It hasn&#x27;t lasted me a month, I used to sell cosmetics and estee lauder was one of them.  I am really dissatisfied that this seller would sell old merchandise</li>
    <li> Wow!!! I have typical Asian &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t-hold-a-curl&amp;#34; lashes and this is amazing stuff! I don&#x27;t even need a curler and it manages to lift and curl my lashes as promised! I used to use Lancôme definicils and waterproof Maybelline Falsies which was a huge pain to remove, but this product is way better than definicils and really negates the need for waterproof mascara period! Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> A sample mascara was part of a \\&quot;gift\\&quot; with purchase. Tried it and like it so I ordered a full size. It is a good mascara and I don&#x27;t think it warrants the higher price unless name brand is important. Went back to using my Cover Girl in the orange tube which is a fraction of the price. I have long lashes And I like a mascara that thickens also.</li>
    <li> This product is very thick. Somewhat hard to remove. The product did not go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a great mascara...only had this one day...so far, so good.  I love EL products, so, we shall see.  I&#x27;ve been using Clinic, and I&#x27;m not getting the length I want.  With this, lengthens and provides volume.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like it...it clumps up and is hard to get off</li>
    <li> Found it is worth it to spend a little more for mascara!</li>
    <li> Not very happy it does give you fullness but it kind of gets easily off</li>
    <li> excellent works good for me</li>
    <li> I have tried a billion mascaras from every end of the spectrum (dept store to drug store) and this one always comes out on top.  I love that it washes off very easily, not over waxy, etc.  It has never flaked on me and I have even cried with this on and not had mascara all over my face and it&#x27;s not waterproof.  Anyways, I always come back to it.  I am a mascara junkie like most women.  Many tubes that have gone in the trash.  I am sure I will always try the next big thing that promises everything I want in a mascara.  It&#x27;s nice to know I have a good go to mascara though!  I usually look for lengthening and volume (don&#x27;t most of us?!)  I do have fairly long lashes.  It&#x27;s nice because I can use 1 coat during the day for a lighter look and 2 or 3 for a more dramatic look.  I recently received a trial of the &#x27;Sumptuous Bold&#x27;, just an FYI, I do not see any differences between the two.</li>
    <li> This was probably one of the worst mascaras I have ever purchased including dime store brands. It goes on gloppy, flakes off and smudges. The brush is pretty much useless and it does nothing in the ballpark of curling or defining or lengthening lashes. I used to love Max Factor mascara -- which had a cult following before it took its entire line to Paris and no longer sells in the US. I was much happier with bare essentials mascara because that one went on cleaner and didn&#x27;t flake. This was a massive disappointment. If my husband had not tossed out the box for it by accident, I would have demanded a refund -- it was that bad. It almost seems like they sent me a returned &amp; used one that is many, many months old. Yuck.</li>
    <li> My lashes look healthy and long luv this mascara im addicted. ive used almay for years tried other expensive mascaras but nothing beats estee lauder sumptious.</li>
    <li> Did not care for. Usually love their products</li>
    <li> I think it was kind of expired since the smell was so bad. I gave it to my best friend as a christmas gift and I didn&#x27;t even check the quality and she told me that the smell was so bad.</li>
    <li> I am very pretentious with mascaras, I used to love only Yves Saint Lauren mascaras as it were only they to provide ideally separated eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;But Estee Lauder mascara pleasantly surprised me! It is of same quality as YSL!</li>
    <li> Love  the volume  it gives but I felt it should have lasted a bit longer before getting  a bit clumpy.</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder mascaras are my favorite. This one in particular is very good. Adds volume and length and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> After searching for many years for the perfect mascara, I finally found it! After developing a skin sensitivity to my normal foundation, I was told to use Estee Lauder Futurist which is supposed to be safe for extremely sensitive skin. While purchasing the foundation, I decided on a whim to purchase the mascara. I am so glad I did. Not only is it very gentle to my eyes, it makes my nearly non-existent eye lashes appear thick and long. I highly recommend this to any woman who is looking for the perfect mascara!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment!  Love the Estee Lauder mascara!</li>
    <li> You could see it actually lift the lashes upward.....love it !</li>
    <li> Not as thick as Sephora&#x27;s volume mascara but does the job well! And seems like it will last longer!</li>
