      <li>While I agree that in most cases you get what you pay for an quality brushes are an investment, you&#x27;re talking to a person who had never used a brush to apply foundation before</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>This product was way way way worth the price!!</li>
      <li>This foundation goes on smooth with such a flawless finish and has staying power.</li>

      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>This foundation does exactly what I want as it evens out my skin tone, is lightweight, does not look caked up and is easy to apply and remove.</li>
      <li>Another quick search and....</li>
      <li>A quick search and...</li>
      <li>Not only is it affordable, but it is very light and feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all!</li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands of foundation and have found the Maybelline New York Dream Matte Mousse Foundation in Nude great for my combination skin (normal to oily).</li>
      <li>It is a full coverage foundation that doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out and matches my skin tone really well.</li>
      <li>It covers up minor skin discolorations and leaves me feeling nice and matte.</li>
      <li>Overall, this product is OK for the price.</li>
      <li>Price is better than all stores, just wish they made a bigger size.</li>
      <li>I am surprised to see so many positive reviews about this product - I will definitely not buy it again.</li>
      <li>Real Techniques Expert Face Brush ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Twenty years ago I discovered that I didn&#x27;t need to use any moisturizer on my face which changed my whole appearance, because I stopped breaking out.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>In addition, many of the collections have a lot of pink undertones, such as the Light 5 -</li>
      <li>The nude has a very orange tint.</li>
      <li>so I will choose Classic Ivory (Light 2) next time.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Texture is okay, a little clumpy compared to the liquid I was used to.</li>
      <li>and that was a little steep for something that I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like or would work for me.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery, product as described, came as a double pack</li>
      <li>But if you try to scoop it out on your fingers as if you were putting on a liquid foundation, it beads up and looks like something you picked off an old brown sweater.  </li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>This product had older packaging than what is currently sold in stores.  </li>
      <li>I have rosacea, oily t-zone, and occasional adult acne, so this is no small feat.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time in 20 years that I&#x27;ve tried something other than powder</li>
      <li>Overall I really LIKE this stuff, I would LOVE it if it wasn&#x27;t cakey, but for me this is&#x27;nt a big deal because in a few hours my skin oils make it appear less cakey.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product thinking I was only going to get one of the mousses but to my surprised I received two.</li>
      <li>But when I received it and first tried to apply it, I thought I&#x27;d gotten an old product because it seemed dried out and cakey.  </li>
      <li>, that is almost impossible to completely remove with a good handwashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I only give it 4 stars because it can be cakey, and I prefer to look as natural as possible.</li>
      <li>I have normal/dry skin, with no dry patches.</li>
      <li>But because my oily skin does come through at times I do tend to finish it off with a little bit of veil or powder, though not as much, it is still a must!</li>
      <li>you are looking for pink or dark selections, you have found the right product line.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Overall, this product is OK for the price. However, the color selection is just terrible. The Medium 2 is one of the darkest mediums that I have ever seen. Any thing above 2 is very dark for white skin. In addition, many of the collections have a lot of pink undertones, such as the Light 5 - it&#x27;s pink, pink, pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this foundation is difficult to \\&quot;get right.\\&quot; I was hopeful that this might substitute for my favorite - but expensive - Benefit foundation. It doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for pink or dark selections, you have found the right product line. Otherwise, keep looking.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking I was only going to get one of the mousses but to my surprised I received two. This product was way way way worth the price!!</li>
    <li> This product had older packaging than what is currently sold in stores.  The seal is intact though so I am hoping it will be fresh and good to use.</li>

This foundation goes on smooth with such a flawless finish and has staying power. But because my oily skin does come through at times I do tend to finish it off with a little bit of veil or powder, though not as much, it is still a must!

    <li> great ptice two fay shipping, love it</li>

    <li> This has been my go-to foundation for as long as I can remember. Not only is it affordable, but it is very light and feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all! It stays on really well and is very easy to apply, as it is super smooth and creamy and feels good on the skin. I hate liquid foundations, as I find them messy and oftentimes heavy, so after I found this foundation, I&#x27;ve never looked back. I recommend this product to my friends and have converted many people!</li>
    <li> its all good i love it thank you good job</li>
    <li> It doesnt rub in smoothly.  It clumps on my skin.  Will never use again</li>
    <li> The nude has a very orange tint.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin. Twenty years ago I discovered that I didn&#x27;t need to use any moisturizer on my face which changed my whole appearance, because I stopped breaking out. I also begun using powder instead of liquid make up. This is the first time in 20 years that I&#x27;ve tried something other than powder and I love it. I even use it as a under-eye concealer. It doesn&#x27;t crease and it holds up for about 4-5 hours for me. It covers up minor skin discolorations and leaves me feeling nice and matte. This is the 2nd one I get. I have one for the winter that is lighter and another for the summer when I have a bit of a tan. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The trick to this foundation is in the application.  Read on....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so much wanted to love this product.....everyone gave it great reviews and I thought it would be the answer to all my skin woes.  But when I received it and first tried to apply it, I thought I&#x27;d gotten an old product because it seemed dried out and cakey.  This is not a mousse like a whipped, airy, spray mousse (obviously, since it comes in a jar).  But if you try to scoop it out on your fingers as if you were putting on a liquid foundation, it beads up and looks like something you picked off an old brown sweater.  But...why all the great reviews?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... off to youtube I went.  And what I found on youtube was several makeup tutorials for this product using a foundation brush.  AHHHHH...(cue the lightbulb moment).  Most of the tutorials suggested the MAC duo fibre face brush.  A quick search and...$42?!?!  Eep.  While I agree that in most cases you get what you pay for an quality brushes are an investment, you&#x27;re talking to a person who had never used a brush to apply foundation before and that was a little steep for something that I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like or would work for me.  Another quick search and....Real Techniques Expert Face Brush ([[ASIN:B007O7AZBG B007O7AZBG]]  At under $10, this was more in my range for trying something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the results...  perfection.  Putting this foundation on with a foundation brush gives me great results.  I have rosacea, oily t-zone, and occasional adult acne, so this is no small feat.  It literally gives me an airbrushed look.  An added bonus to using a foundation brush to apply your makeup (I&#x27;ve never liked makeup sponges) is that you don&#x27;t get foundation on your fingers, pressed into your fingerprints, that is almost impossible to completely remove with a good handwashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re thinking about this foundation, go for it...  but add on a foundation brush and watch a couple youtube videos.  The results will be much better that way.be much better that way.</li>
    <li> I tried this matte mousse foundation and was so disappointed! My skin felt dry all day and I don´t like the coverage at all. I am surprised to see so many positive reviews about this product - I will definitely not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Well, considering that you&#x27;re buying makeup online, one would hope you know what you&#x27;re looking for. The misses loves this stuff. Price is better than all stores, just wish they made a bigger size. The thick glass is very deceiving</li>
    <li> This foundation goes on smoothly and has a medium to full coverage. I have normal/dry skin, with no dry patches. For color comparison purposes, I wear Buff Beige in Cover Girl foundations and this was a little too dark so I will choose Classic Ivory (Light 2) next time.</li>
    <li> For someone who has avoided all drug store foundations for years because they made me break out this stuff is pretty awesome. I only give it 4 stars because it can be cakey, and I prefer to look as natural as possible. I try to put on extra moisturizer or mix a little in with the mousse on my finger before applying it. My friend who went to beauty school recommended it to me and she loves it also. It is a full coverage foundation that doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out and matches my skin tone really well. I have a skin tone that people think is darker than it is. Alot of the time someone will look at me and say I have &amp;#34;olive skin&amp;#34;, but when it comes to cosmetics I usually need lights or naturals. Overall I really LIKE this stuff, I would LOVE it if it wasn&#x27;t cakey, but for me this is&#x27;nt a big deal because in a few hours my skin oils make it appear less cakey. I have read other reviews on the net saying that this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on. I don&#x27;t have a problem with that it seems to stay for the most part. If my face rubbed up against something with pressure it would come off, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem for me.</li>
    <li> This foundation is light yet it still does a pretty good job although it looks kind of dry but mainly only if you look up close.</li>
    <li> Best deal for the price.  Coverage is perfect and lasts through the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my fifties and still have oily skin with occasional break-outs.  This matte foundation looks fresh for 12 hours!</li>
    <li> Good for my dry/combination skin. Goes on flawless and the color is not too light. I just started using it and I like it much more than powder or liquid because it blends very nicely.</li>
    <li> Loved this foundation!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation, the formula is the best I have ever had on my face, it is so light and great cover.</li>
    <li> This is the lightest makeup i&#x27;ve ever used, great coverage and the color is perfection. The only thing is that I don&#x27;t have enough ...I need more!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years! Light stuff, doesn&#x27;t feel like you caked on a lot of makeup.</li>
    <li> Good product but pricey.  I was not very impressed with the amount you get for the money&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will add more product or lower the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not darker than expected, but it doesn&#x27;t match my skin because of it&#x27;s orange-y tint. The formula/texture is great and the coverage/pigmentation is nice as far as drugstore make up goes but like I said, it&#x27;s a bit orange and I have to correct it by using a violet toned primer.</li>
    <li> I was used to wearing Avon mousse foundation but they no longer carry it. this works just as well maybe better. very good product!</li>
