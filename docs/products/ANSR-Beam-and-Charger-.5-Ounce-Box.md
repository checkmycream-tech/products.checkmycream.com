      <li>This is amazing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 1/2 weeks (which is amazing since it&#x27;s supposed to take up to a month to see any results), and already my friends, my family, and even my fiance all agree that this thing is working.</li>
      <li>I will update my review with how well it works in a month when it has had time to become effective.</li>
      <li>Time will tell how effective it is in comparison.</li>
      <li>Nice to know she can use something with no side effects like sun sensitivity.</li>
      <li>The price of this product is a fraction of salon/dermatologist treatments and it can be used in your own home.</li>
      <li>My mother wants one now, and so does my best friend.</li>
      <li>I recommend this device if you have those under-the-skin acne lumps (the non-painful kind that just stick around forever).</li>
      <li>the ANSR is an incredible product and does exactly what it claims.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>OK, another beauty treatment that seems to be more hype than help!</li>
      <li>ANSR is the best thing I have ever tried, and believe me, I have tried everything and have spared no expense in my quest for clear skin.  </li>
      <li>My ANSR is still going strong!  </li>
      <li>light treatment is equally great, it reduces the appearance of fine lines and sleep lines under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the frown creases I have in my brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Reading all of those good reviews from some customers I was excited to try this</li>
      <li>Good luck, this is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>, I liked that most of the reviews on Amazon had the verified purchase stamp at the top of the review...</li>

      <li>If not the light felt warm and injoying.</li>
      <li>So it doesn&#x27;t hurt to be safe.</li>
      <li>Better product info to prevent user error would seem beneficial to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>get a peel or fraxel or ipl, but do not waste money on this product whatever you do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I told my sons BFF to give this product a try based on the fantastic results I witnessed on some of my co-workers!</li>
      <li>I also use OSEA skin care topicals and love that line as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was sort of going from touching a sandpaper to touching silk.</li>
      <li>Though my acne has gotten a lot better, there are still some pimples even this can&#x27;t stop.</li>
      <li>so for that it almost seems like it should come with the tanning goggles just to be safe.  </li>
      <li>He was so impressed he took it back to school</li>
      <li>HAVE BEEN QUITE PLEASED W/</li>
      <li>&quot;  By law, thats the top amount you can put in them</li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I should have heeded my instinct, and moved on to a more transparent company than ANSR.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> While I purchased the ANSR for my daughters acne, I have also been able to use it for my aging skin.  I can say that I am seeing a change in my wrinkles and that a small red mark on my face is almost gone. I&#x27;ve noticed some changes in my daughters acne but I also know that she is not using it as much as she should be to see results. While the price is somewhat steep I decided as another reviewer had written that it is cheaper than the cost of a dermatologist (we&#x27;ve been down that road already with pills and washes that don&#x27;t work) and you can return it within the 30 days. Whether it works for acne or not I am keeping it for my soon to be gone wrinkles! I usually use it while reading the morning paper or watching TV and break my face into sections and use it the entire 5 minutes on each part.  Will update you in the future on the acne when I can convince my daughter to use it as directed!! Would recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I purchased my ANSR in desperation after a particularly bad and inconvenient breakout. Because of what may be a hormonal condition, my skin is always troublesome - though mostly in one area. I seem to have responded well to blue/red Omnilux light treatments in skin clinics/spas in the past, though they are extremely expensive, particularly if you (like I seem to) need them for maintenance. It&#x27;s too early to say with 100% confidence that the improvement I&#x27;ve seen in the past month has been from treating my breakout-prone areas with 10 - 20 minutes of ANSR blue/red light per day, but I&#x27;m pretty optimistic that it has. I&#x27;ve had fewer large eruptions and the ones I do have seem to be stopped sooner and heal more quickly than before. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this tool; it helps me feel like I have a bit of control over a problem that&#x27;s followed me into adulthood and can be - as you&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;re reading this - completely consuming and frustrating. And it&#x27;s absolutely saved me money that I would have spent with an esthetician (who now I will only see occasionally for deep cleansing). I think it&#x27;s especially useful for people who tend to only break out in select areas (a full-face treatment will take you much longer to go through every day). I hope very much that this improvement continues as I continue using ANSR.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and have been using it religiously everyday since. It works quite well for acne... just hold the blue light right on top of the pimple for a couple of minutes. The acne is gone by the next day or two. I actually bought it for the red light benefits of anti-aging, and I would say that my wrinkles have softened somewhat... but it did take time to notice a difference. I will continue to use it everyday because I feel it is helping to prevent further wrinkles, and helping to keep the ones I have from becomming any worse. The little bit of warmth and the nice humming the device makes is very relaxing too. :)</li>
    <li> I am anxious, to see if this helps with my moderate acne and sometimes severe cysts on chin. I did wonder if I should be using a tanning goggle as I read in mayoclinic.com that blue light can cause retina damage. I will post a review in a month to tell readers if it is working. I am also using Jojoba oil to control my oily skin and vitamins b5, guggul and zinc! I ordered a tanning goggle on amazon for 5 bucks just in case to use with my ansr. good luck!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t underestimate this device. It seems like a simple light could not achieve much in the way of results but it can and it does. The blue light works wonderfully at clearing your skin and the red light just within one use works at diminishing lines and plumping your skin. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased a real ANSR beam for myself. It is absolutely a miracle worker when it comes to reducing and eliminating acne and acne scars.  I notice the difference within 5 minutes of treatment and your face doesn&#x27;t get used to it.  It is very effective over time in helping to clear acne.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and this works! I loved it to much that I purchased one for my sister as a gift.  What was sent was fake!  There are a few things that you need to check to make sure it is real:  1. The front should say \\&quot;ANSR:\\&quot; NOT \\&quot;ANSR: Beam\\&quot;   2. The back should say \\&quot;Oregon Aesthetic Technologies, Inc Beam 1 and ANSR:\\&quot; NOT \\&quot;MADE IN THE USA and ANSR:\\&quot;   3. The real ANSR beam will vibrate and warms slightly when in use.  The fake one will not vibrate as much and does not get warm to the touch.    If you find one of these for far below market price, it may be a fake. I paid the market price via AMAZON.com and my sister still got a fake one. Be careful!  We only figured this out because we had an authentic one to which to compare it.</li>
    <li> I have had acne for over 20 years, after using many different products with no success.  This little device has changed my life. I was using it everyday, when I first got it. Now I am down to 2-3 x week, and I do not have any new cystic pimples. I used to get those big pus filled pimples that were 2-3 pimples combined. I have not had any of those in 6 months, since using the ansr. I love it. I would tell anyone who has acne this item is well worth the price, when you consider how much we spend on the soaps, trips to the dermatologist, you will come out cheaper buying this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had globular cystic acne since 1975. Tried every prescription and over the counter product, and still was trapped with cysts that had to be injected each month to resolve them...and THIS WORKS!!! I&#x27;ve got a box full of medications I no longer need...just this amazing little light machine.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and effective.  I&#x27;m so glad I got this when it was still less than a hundred dollars.</li>
    <li> This device actually works!  I&#x27;ve tried everything,including the Zeno, which didn&#x27;t.  If you get cystic acne, get this ANSR Beam.</li>
    <li> I was in my gym and saw a friend of mine using the ANSR beam. When she told me how great it worked, I was skeptical. Now I have it and I&#x27;m a believer! Great product, great design, easy to carry arround.</li>
    <li> Although best results are indicated after eight weeks of use, I&#x27;ve been using the red light for about two weeks and am pleased. I can already tell some differences in the wrinkles on my face-- mostly with my \\&quot;furrowed\\&quot; look above my nose and between my eyebrows and the wrinkles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do realize this is NOT a miracle product. The changes are noticeable and appropriate for a product with this price, but it&#x27;s not like a dermatologist&#x27;s procedure or plastic surgery. I also have to admit that I have a good regime otherwise; toning, moisturizing, and occasional glycolic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really used the blue light and I do wonder how easily this product would minimize acne. There are just so many causes/issues with acne. You&#x27;d need to make sure it&#x27;s part of a total plan to stop break-outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern I have is... regardless of which light you use, but especially if you&#x27;re trying to get rid of acne... rubbing this thing all over your face is just going to spread the bacteria, dirt, etc. everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, recommended.</li>
    <li> I used a Groupon coupon to try LED light therapy and, while I thought it was beneficial, there was no way I was going to spend the money on going back repeatedly.    This is a great little product. It&#x27;s easy to use, and I have definitely seen improvement in fine lines and overall skin tone. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance - this product is saving not only my skin but also my wallet.</li>
    <li> I had suddenly developed rosacea and after trying Metrogel and making a far out appointment to see a dermatologist I read about this device and decided to try it. I had up to this point had to wear makeup to try and conceal the worst of the rosacea. In a matter of just over a week the combination of using this and Eucerin Redness Relief face wash has made the condition clear up - totally. I think I probably had a mild form but it was very noticeable, sore and embarrasing. I would recommend it.    So it now a couple of weeks later and I have used this little machine religiously and the results are terrific. My rosacea has disappeared - pimples arent appearing and its starting to make an impact on lines on my face. I will update this review in a couple of months perhaps.</li>
    <li> 2nd Update:&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from my review, below, I love this little gadget and it worked great. It&#x27;s been several months now and I still believe blue light therapy is the only thing that works for me...but I had to update this review as I just got the Verilux Clearwave Phototherapy System for Acne which is a new blue light wand. It, quite frankly, is even better. I have no ties to Verilux in any way but this new one is actually 50 times stronger than the ANSR. ANSR has 2 tiny blue bulbs in the head and the Verilux has around 50. You have to move the ANSR all over your face to make it work and with that tiny head it takes a half hour. Twice a day. With the strength and size of my new one, you just put it on one area of your face for three minutes and it&#x27;s done. The Verilux also has disposable light heads so that when they begin to lose strength or die out (like the bulbs in a tanning bed) you just plop on a new one. This one does not so as these two bulbs get weaker or die you have to buy a WHOLE NEW ANSR beam. I was fine with all that until I got my new one. The bulbs are even bigger. My face just responds immediately to Verilux and I don&#x27;t have to spend all day waving the wand over my face like I had to with ANSR,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong...either one will work and this is the best treatment ever for acne, but the Verilux is way closer to what is used by my dermatologist and the results are equal to that as well. I had to give away my ANSR to a friend who has been wanting one....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st Update:&lt;br /&gt;After using this for several weeks I wanted to give the whole breakdown on the process.  The first week I noticed blemishes on the skin surface were small, or went away as well as tiny bumps under the surface of the skin. Towards the second week, things were brought to the surface so while I saw more breakouts surface and began to wonder if this was supposed to be happening, they were kept small with using the Answr and could be covered by good foundation. By the end of that week I noticed my pores were smaller because they were obviously totally cleared of excess oils or bacteria. By the third week for the first time ever I was able to stop using foundation entirely with crystal smooth skin, small pores, a flawless complexion.  That said, the instructions say it could be 4 weeks. I did notice that when I used the red light as well more, that I did indeed have cellular regeneration meaning that my skin began creating a fresh later and the top layer sloughed off. Like a dermabrasion. This also helps minimize fine lines.  I took the time the first three weeks to use as directed...twice a day. It was time consuming but this amount of treatment was temporary. I didn&#x27;t always use the red light for the full amount of time but I always used the blue light (for bacteria removal).  Now I simply spot treat as needed taking far less time and then do my full face maybe just once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A MIRACLE WORKER!!  I was using prescription Retin-A prior with little result. This is the ONLY thing that worked and quite frankly blew my mind...I&#x27;ve never had flawless perfect glowing skin before and at may age it&#x27;s a bizarre thing to start now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to the original review: First, as someone who once worked in cosmetic sales (selling the ingredients to the cosmetic scientists at the large cosmetic companies) I learned a lot. People who say they&#x27;ve tried every acne product on the market really only tried 2 if they are over the counter. There are only 2. If you turn the box over on any product you will always see \\&quot;Active Ingredient: 10% Benzoyl Peroxide\\&quot; or \\&quot;Active Ingredient: 2% Salicylic Acid\\&quot;  By law, thats the top amount you can put in them and those are the two acne treatments. Some of the most expensive and most highly advertised products actually contain LESS...like Proactive. They apparently spent the money on ads and had a LOWER percent of the active ingredient. While there may be some all natural over the counter items that vary, basically your entire aisle of acne treatments is made up of only 2 products....and lots of marketing dollars to make you think they are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For recent hormonal breakouts, neither of these worked for me. Tanning did and I don&#x27;t want to tan. Then I began reading about the blue light therapy and wondered if this is why tanning worked because even if I just did it for a few minutes without drying my skin out, it worked. But it ages you horribly and I certainly don&#x27;t need that and it&#x27;s expensive long term in lots of ways including the time to tan, the monthly fee, driving there, potential skin cancer risks, and probably needing botox later because of it!.  Dermatologists are now using 15 minutes of solid blue light therapy applied over a solid area  It seems crazy, but this goes down deep into the skin to kill bacteria and also remove excess oil in the glands which is why this works differently than other acne products like those that put heat on a pimple. Those are all topical, while this kills pimples you can&#x27;t even see yet by killing the bacteria and clogged pours below the skin surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In testing, the blue and red light combo worked better than simply blue light therapy. So even if you don&#x27;t feel like you need the red light for cell turnover, remember those test results for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do you need cell turnover? That is actually what keeps us young. The reason we age is that as we get older our body stops the cell turnover process that it had in our youth, always removing the top layer of skin and generating new layers. Cell turnover is what retin-a and dermaplaning does...manually turning over your dead skin and generating new. This may seem like it&#x27;s drying out your skin, when it&#x27;s actually getting rid of old skin on the surface via cell turnover.  (not like Retin-a which actually causes peeling)  My skin actually didn&#x27;t look dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so the directions...I couldn&#x27;t figure out how this thing worked by reading reviews here, on the Costco site (it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than at Costco incidentally), on the beauty sites etc prior to buying (I research loads before I buy any product over $100 which is why I learned about blue and red therapy when I was considering just buying the blue light.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, I liked that most of the reviews on Amazon had the verified purchase stamp at the top of the review...I knew they&#x27;d bought the product rather than it being given to them to review, or having a connection to the company. I know even if you don&#x27;t have the stamp you could have just bought it elsewhere but this is something new and I wanted to see what people who bought it on Amazon found just to be sure and it showed great results. This is a weird product so I wanted to know real everyday person results. But people talked about how they used it differently so I read the book that came with it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a small booklet that came with it that doesn&#x27;t give you much info. Trash it. Read the more detailed one. Only then do you get the full scoop. So here is what you do, according to the booklet in my hand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash and dry your face prior. Use it on a clean face.&lt;br /&gt;Choose a 4x4 area of your face and begin moving the blue light back and forth slowly over it. It will then pulse and turn to a red light. Continue moving it on the same area to complete the process on this section. Push the button again and move on to the next 4x4 area. You do NOT go over your whole face the first 5 min of blue light. You are to concentrate on back and forth over small areas. For me I often did a bit more than 4x4. I did my chin area first, my right cheek, left cheek, then my forehead.  So I divided it into 4 areas except for the 2nd week when more breakouts surfaced that were formerly hidden below the surface at which time I broke it up into 6 areas. THIS WORKED!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not hold this above your skin, you touch your skin with the element as though you are shaving back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it says it can take several weeks to clear out all acne at the first use, I woke up the next morning with totally different skin after ONE use. I had just started breakouts in a few areas and, whereas they typically get worse the next day, these all had come to the surface  or had gone away completely.  By the end of the FIRST week I had totally clear skin which I typically don&#x27;t have because I also workout heavily and the sweat winds up clogging my pores fairly often as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a miracle worker for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tube of retin-A costs more than this for me and that takes about a month to complete cell turnover and it just never cleared things up for me. I actually felt a funny faint tingling under my skin after the first use of this...it felt like I had just tanned my face which is, I&#x27;m sure, just the bacteria dying and the cell regeneration perhaps as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the evening while I watch TV and in the morning while I drink my coffee.  Nothing else works for me, truly, so I&#x27;d rather wake up 15 min earlier or drink my coffee more slowly then to go without doing this.  There is always a cost to beauty and this is actually the cheapest dermatology appointment and treatment I&#x27;ve ever found...it does take time though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could use it without the red light and just do the blue light, as that has been shown to cure about 80% of acne but everything I read said the blue/red combo works better in studies.  If I am rushed I do the blue then just a little red but not all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: I didn&#x27;t read this in the instructions but some reading I did on the results of blue light therapy said you should wear tanning goggles when using it because blue light is not good for the retinas and this will prevent any issues. I close my eyes whenever I use it around the eye area (otherwise it&#x27;s on your skin and you see no light, unlike most blue light therapy)  but I am going to buy some tanning goggles as I genetically may have retina issues and I already have had corneal issues due to bad lasik.  So it doesn&#x27;t hurt to be safe. I expect because this is not held away from the face, it doesn&#x27;t have this warning but people might use it around the eye area so for that it almost seems like it should come with the tanning goggles just to be safe.  Also I think the small instruction booklet should be more clear on how to use it because just reading the reviews on various sites I could tell some aren&#x27;t doing it the way it works best so of course there is varied results. And it says nothing about the blue and red light combo working best on acne, just the benefit of the red light for reducing fine lines etc (due to the cell turnover) so I would be willing to bet some concentrating on acne don&#x27;t realize the benefit of both together for ACNE as well.  Better product info to prevent user error would seem beneficial to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Clear out the medicine cabinet. This is amazing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd update: I have found that combining this with 40% glycolic acid peel sold on Amazon has amazing results. I don&#x27;t use it as a peel, I just dab it on to empty out all bacteria instantly from any blemish or any part of my skin that has blemishes. It just takes a minute. Then you neutralize the skin per sinstructions with baking soda and water which stops the acid from working. The acid goes DEEP into your pores to empty out any contents instantly and kill all bacteria. you&#x27;ll see it happen. Then this kills any further bacteria and stops the future blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;With these two tools you should never have anything but perfect skin again.he directions...I couldn&#x27;t figure out how this thing worked by reading reviews here, on the Costco site (it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than at Costco incidentally), on the beauty sites etc prior to buying (I research loads before I buy any product over $100 which is why I learned about blue and red therapy when I was considering just buying the blue light.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, I liked that most of the reviews on Amazon had the verified purchase stamp at the top of the review...I knew they&#x27;d bought the product rather than it being given to them to review, or having a connection to the company.

    <li> I purchased the ANSR beam specifically for its blue light blemish clearing feature, based on other Amazon reviews. Although a blue light appears when switched on, the net result is no difference whatsoever. I gave the device a fair trial, using it as directed twice daily for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works for others, but it certainly didn&#x27;t for me. I give it two stars rather than one only because the item was shipped promptly by the vendor and it \\&quot;appears\\&quot; to be in working order, even if the device does not deliver the advertised results.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you a little about myself before I start the review. I am 24 yr old female who has suffered from acne since I was 15. Once I got off birth control my acne started getting worse and worse everyday. I have fair skin that can be very red at times, so after a break out cleared up I would have little red marks left over for weeks. I have large pores and blackheads mainly on my nose. I also get a lot of little white heads on my cheeks and jaw line. I have tried for several years to clear up my acne with a lot of different over the counter and high end products. I have never seen a dermatologist because of the expense and I would not like to take prescription medications. I have suffered and suffered, but now I have found my ANSR!    I read about the ansr beam online and did a lot of research before I purchased it. It is an expensive little gadget and I wanted to make sure that my money wasn&#x27;t wasted. After 4 months of thinking about it I finally purchased. At first I wasn&#x27;t too impressed, but I knew it was a tool that took time to see results. Twice a day everyday I used it 10 minutes in the AM and 10 minutes in the PM. I didn&#x27;t find it hard to stick to, I would just watch a show or relax on my bed. If for some reason I had to skip the morning I would do 20 minutes at night. Also if I had a bad pimple I would hold it on there for longer than normal.     Its been 2 months since I started using the ansr beam and I am very happy with my results. After 1 month of use I started to see a change in my pore size and my blackheads are finally disappearing. Also my breakouts are very small and spread out. I used to break out the worst right after my period and this month I didn&#x27;t break out at all. The pimples are much smaller than they used to be and go away a lot quicker. The little red marks that are left over only last for maybe 3 days at most. Now that I have my break outs under control with the beam I feel like I am repairing the damage that has been done through the past 9 years. Everyday I feel more confident about my skin and I am no longer depressed about it.     This is the best product I have bought for my skin and it is worth every penny! I highly recommend the ansr beam to any acne sufferer who feels like there isn&#x27;t an answer to their skin issues. There is an answer and its called The Ansr Beam!</li>
    <li> I got this in the nick of time...I had a few cystic pimples forming and I opened the packaging, charged the ansr, and in a few hours...I was using it.  By the next morning, my cysts were smaller. I&#x27;ve been using this now for a week, and my face is clearer. I am going to keep using it, and update in a few months.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about the light therapy.  My wife seemed to get one or two deep zips on a regular basis.  That&#x27;s all, no real \\&quot;acne problem\\&quot;.  She always washed her face and used acne programs like Proactive, but still got the one or two big, deep zits.  Since using this light (every day), she&#x27;s had about zero problems.  Apparently, it really works!</li>
    <li> The instructions say use for 5 minutes per light (there&#x27;s an option that it will change on its own which is kinda fun.) I did it for 5 minutes and saw very little improvement. When I increased the time, I started to notice the difference. I think maybe if you have light acne 5 min may be enough. I&#x27;ve had severe acne regular and cystic since I was 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY Instructions to get the best out of this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash your face or clean the area you wish to light.&lt;br /&gt;2. Exfoliate the skin the best you can (you can take a bit of sugar or baking soda and rub it in where you want to be treated. Don&#x27;t scrub hard! Just gently rub your fingers on the area in circular motions until you cover the area and rinse well.) This will help you remove lots of excess dead skin so the light can penetrate better.&lt;br /&gt;3. Dry the skin.&lt;br /&gt;4. You&#x27;ll see the light instructions. Use the blue light just hover above your skin and stay there 15-20 or so minutes NOT 5.&lt;br /&gt;5. Change to the red light if you wish and hang out for 10-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seemed to really keep the flaring up under control. No it didn&#x27;t cure me, but neither did Accutane which is one of the strongest acne medications out there... I don&#x27;t have a ton of hope when I try new products but I don&#x27;t doubt that this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, simple instruction (which I say change if you wish), portable, effective, grips in your hand well, cost efficient considering the price of other products like this easily bump up to 3-400 dollars (the professional ones run 1200-2500 or so.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 inches wide, an inch tall or so. Basically close to the size of your palm. Comes with a charger. Holds charge well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time it takes isn&#x27;t too time consuming when you consider doing it while watching tv or whatever. You can prop it on something if your arm gets tired.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m of \\&quot;an age\\&quot; where I thought I needed to consider lessening some wrinkles.  I was so hoping that this would work because I&#x27;ve never had any other treatments before.  Unfortunately after more than a month I can&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever.  I can see that it might work for acne but if you&#x27;re wanting to use this for anti-aging save your money and try something else!</li>
    <li> I told my sons BFF to give this product a try based on the fantastic results I witnessed on some of my co-workers! My sons friend had horrible teen acne. So bad,- infact he considered dropping from school from embarrassment. 2 months ago I encouraged him to please give Ansr a try. Well, he came over last night and OMG..OMG!! His face..IT&#x27;s CLEAR..It&#x27;s BEAUTIFUL!!! This ANSR,,is The ANSWER!! Look-I don&#x27;t ever write reviews,and I know no one who works for the company..I only wish he would have taken some BEFORE and AFTER shots of his face!!      This little device is AMAZING!!If you wash your face everyday..you can Anser your face everyday!!</li>
    <li> My skin condition was not bad and I got nearly no acne before I use this device. I was more interested in the anti-aging red light, but might as well tried the blue light together. Since I used it as instructed for 2 days, I got a breakout on my forehead and my cheek! I continued to use it (both blue &amp; red) for 2 more days to see whether my skin would get better, but I was disappointed as I got some rash and new acne as if the device irritated my skin. So, I stopped using the blue light, instead I used only the red light, and so far my skin went back to normal again! I find this device helps to get rid of the fine lines under eye area, and my skin did feel a little bit tighter. However, I would say putting on skin care product with proper massage works better than rubbing your face with this little guy. I do like the look of this device anyway :)</li>
    <li> As a national sales manager for this product, I have been using the ANSR:BEAM product for the past 9 months after being recruited to help this product get to market.  It was a natural fit because I have a experience as a professional model for the past 2 decades as well as a sales career promoting products that are all about healthy living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I have paid over $1500 for a series of light therapy panels at a local med spa but I was frustrated when I found out that I had to keep going back to maintain the collagen boost on a monthly basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I looked at the price and the portability of the ANSR product, I was pleased that it could fit into my beauty regime on a daily basis no matter where I was traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the BEAM by my bed and when the alarm goes off in the morning, I BEAM for 10 minutes and it&#x27;s the best way to wake up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good friend who hasn&#x27;t seen me for a few months, asked me honestly if I had gotten any \\&quot;work\\&quot; done. Flattered, I told her about the BEAM. And she swears that after even only a few weeks, she can see a difference in her skin, too! People keep commenting on how fresh my skin looks. I also use OSEA skin care topicals and love that line as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall skin has tightened, redness has minimized and my fallen eye lids are back to where they are supposed to be.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO HELP ME WITH SOME ADULT ACNE ISSUES. I USED IT FOR ABOUT FOUR DAYS THEN GOT IMPATIENT WITH HAVING TO SIT  THERE FOR TEN MINUTES TWICE DAILY.(I HAVE 3 YOUNG CHILDREN)WAS GETTING READY TO RETURN IT WHEN I NOTICED MY TEENS ACNE WAS CLEARING UP NICELY.SO THERES NO QUESTION THAT THIS BEAM WORKS AND IT WORKS FAST.NOTICED AN IMPROVEMENT IN MY TEENS ACNE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AFTER WE GOT THIS .SMALL AND PORTABLE SO YOU CAN TAKE IT AND USE ANYWHERE. WELL WORTH THE MONEY. ONLY REASON THAT I DIDNT GIVE IT 5 STARS IS BECAUSE LIKE I SAID TEN MINUTES IS LONGER THAN YOU THINK WHEN THERES KIDS SCREAMING IN YOUR EAR.</li>
    <li> I used this twice a day, red and blue light, for 4 months. I didn&#x27;t see any change in redness, acne, or fine lines.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and saw all the \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews and assumed they were from trusting people and gave this a shot based on that.  Twice a day for which amounts to 30 minutes each time or more - who has this time?  I did it anyway because when you pay more than a $100 for something, you give it a shot.  Didn&#x27;t work.  After two weeks I wanted to send it back and found out a \\&quot;Beauty\\&quot; product purchased through Amazon can only be returned if unopened and in new condition!  Save your money and instead try seeing a dermatologist or your general practitioner for an antibiotic.  Or... try eating different things (no dairy or sugar) and see if that helps your breakouts.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I ordered the ANSR after looking at reviews for effectiveness and reliability of the units. This unit had high ratings for both as well as a cost much less than other products out there. I decided to try light therapy after suffering for over a year with hormonal related acne after ceasing to take the birth control pill. I tried Clarasonic with expensive acne cleanser/treatment regimes (my insurance won&#x27;t cover retin A which has worked for me in the past), essential oils, supplements/herbs, and progesterone creams, all with some improvement, but still no full control over cycle related outbreaks mostly to my neck/chin/lower cheek areas. After just over 2 weeks of using mainly just the blue 5 minute treatment only once a day, I saw great improvements. I am sure if I could use it twice a day as recommended, it would be even better. This is the first thing I have tried in the last year that has shown significant reduction over my monthly cycle, so I am happy and optimistic the results will sustain. I continue to use this in conjunction with my Clarasonic and sulfur based acne spot treatment, skinceuticals LHA regime, and essential oils (tea tree/lavendar/oregano) to keep my acne at bay and to maintain my healthy skin. I am 44 and am told I look 30 and I plan to keep it that way. The price of this product is a fraction of salon/dermatologist treatments and it can be used in your own home. It is definitely worth a try for those of you suffering from any type of acne.</li>
    <li> blue beam seems to get rid of dandruff or other weird bacteria infections like a disenfectant. I just like it but can&#x27;t guarantee it works. works for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this device for 2 days. So far I do not see any difference in acne. However it is reducing the horrible heat rash on my neck. Nothing has gotten rid of it! I am hoping since this is a skin ailment it should also work on my acne, which is a skin ailment as well : ).   Two stars until I see a difference in acne.      Now, after a few more days since my last review, this little device it taking care of my painful cystic acne.  They normally swell up, become inflamed and red, which normally stays this way for weeks and in the worst case scenario months uugghhh ;  {  .  I plan to get a bigger device (non-hand held), which includes the red and the blue light.  ANSR will be great to travel with because it is small and compact.  &lt;3 Like this!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste any more time...the ANSR is an incredible product and does exactly what it claims.  I have polycystic ovaries which cause horrible hormonal cystic acne on my chin and I also get regular non-cystic acne everywhere else on my face.  The ANSR has gotten rid of all of it.  I still use prescription topicals, but even with every prescription available, my skin use to be horrible, with multiple cysts that would last for weeks or months, even after being injected.  I started to see results within 2 days and after two weeks my skin was 100% clear.  I have not had a single cyst for 3 months and only a couple of very minor whiteheads.  ANSR is the best thing I have ever tried, and believe me, I have tried everything and have spared no expense in my quest for clear skin.  Just use the ANSR as directed both morning and night (My routine is to wash skin, ANSR for 10 minutes - 5 blue and 5 red, moisturize, apply topicals, apply a thin layer of benzoil peroxide on known problem areas) and your skin will be clear!  *One thing to note...please be advised that ANSR claims to warranty their products only if ordered directly from them.  I found this out when I contacted their customer service with a question.  Luckily mine has not had any issues, but if I would have known about the warranty issue, I would have purchased from ANSR&#x27;s website rather than from Amazon.  UPDATE 10/2011  My ANSR is still going strong!  I use it 2x every day and my skin is still clear!  In the last year, I think I have had one cystic type pimple start deep within my chin.  I quickly got out the ANSR and zapped it with the blue then applied Clearasil, and the cyst went away without surfacing!  I love my ANSR, and if it ever dies, I will be right back on Amazon to purchase another one.  Hope this helps!  Happy ANSRing!</li>
    <li> I would have paid three times the price for this little gem! I am 25 and female and have had a worsening complexion for the last few years. I have tried changing my birth control, topical creams of every kind and had become distraught thinking I would never be able to leave the house again as the last few months had been the worst yet.   I have washed my face with my Clarisonic or with steaming hot washcloths to open the pores, moisturized in the a.m. and used an acne treatment in the p.m. along with two full cycles of the blue and then red light treatment every morning and evening and I am seeing a great improvement in my skin!! Thank Heavens! My skin has always responded well to sunlight and tanning (which we have very limited light here in Seattle) but I don&#x27;t want to tan on a daily basis. Many people will probably need a longer treatment than one five minute cycle, so it is a time investment, but as others have said in these reviews, do it while you watch tv or read, and if your skin matters enough you will do anything to fix it! Even after my very first use I noticed an improvement in the size of my blemishes and the evening of my skin texture. After using it for one week now, the red scars from older acne have dramatically lightened and I have not had one new blemish! I will continue to use it daily and I just pray it continues to work for me.   If you are having skin trouble I would recommend this product to anyone and simply tell you to use consistently and for a longer treatment each time. It&#x27;s a Godsend!!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily with the recommanded product&#x27;s too and i have not been able to see any changes yet.</li>
    <li> I asked for and received the ANSR Beam for Christmas. I was thrilled! I began using both the blue and red light immediately, till it ran out of it&#x27;s tiny charge and I had to plug it in. Not a big deal and as soon as it was charged I was using it again. I was praying it was the answer to the constant, fairly severe acne that has plagued me since I turned 12.     I used it faithfully two weeks, becoming a little frustrated as I broke out worse and worse as the days went on. Almost exactly a week later, things got pretty crazy as I prepared for a big event at the end of the month and I decided I would skip the next week or so since it wasn&#x27;t helping. Things stayed the same with my skin. On the day of the event, January 31st, I noticed that my skin was considerably clearer than normal; \\&quot;Perfect\\&quot; I thought happily.     During the next week or so my skin cleared up like it had not been since I was a child. Not relating this to the ANSR Beam I was stumped as to the sudden change. After all, I hadn&#x27;t touched the Beam in a couple weeks. It was amazing, I felt beautiful and unashamed of my bare face. My family and friends remarked on my clear skin. My husband loved it, but it scared me, I didn&#x27;t know why it had happened and I was worried what would happen when/if my acne came back. When my husband, my baby and I went out on Valentine&#x27;s Day the waitress remarked that my baby had my \\&quot;beautiful, baby-face skin.\\&quot; I had never received such a compliment!     It lasted for several weeks longer and then I started to slowly break out again. By mid March I was back to \\&quot;normal.\\&quot; I was very sad. I thought back over why things had changed and the only reason it could have happened was the ANSR Beam. On March 21st I started using it again. As it stands, my face has followed the pattern of the first time. It has been breaking out worse and worse. I *think* and hope it is \\&quot;clearing out\\&quot; all of the impurities... If it was the ANSR Beam that produced the change before, I should know in a two or three weeks. I will update this review then. Fingers crossed for me!</li>
    <li> I have had the ansr beam for a little over a month and it has changed my skin! A little time consuming I wish I had a whole body beam! I have break outs and wrinkles and this has calmed both! Thanks Ansr Beam!  [[ASIN:B0030ZRQQ8 ANSR Beam and Charger, .5-Ounce Box]]</li>
    <li> I am in my early 40s, have very sensitive skin, and have had very stubborn adult acne for well over a decade.  I ordered this nifty little gadget after seeing a segment about the effectiveness of blue and red light therapy on the Dr. Oz show.  It sounded a bit far fetched and gimmicky to me, but I did some research, saw that there is actual science behind it, and figured I&#x27;ve spent a whole lot more on products like Proactive (that did NOT work for my acne but dried my face out like a raisin), a dermatologist, and various prescription products (which didn&#x27;t work for me either), and that I could always return the item if it didn&#x27;t work.     I started noticing small changes (like less redness, slightly smaller nose pores) after about a week. My acne did not disappear overnight, but I have been using this thing for close to two months now, and the only time my skin has been as clear as it is now was when I was on strong make-you-sick-to-your-stomach antibiotics.  Some dark spots that were the result of old pimples and which have been there for years are gone, and some little skin-colored bumps that I thought were scars have shrunk and/or disappeared as well.  I am impressed.  Also, this has not dried out my skin like many of the acne medications I&#x27;ve tried.    My husband thought this little device was ridiculous the first time he saw me use it (I kinda felt that way too), but this evening he made the comment that \\&quot;that thing actually works.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love this product. I need it for red light for small and fine  line therphy. Its work great love it but wear a set of glass with it as the light is bright. I felt very relaxed useing it. The results should be good. If not the light felt warm and injoying.</li>
    <li> I have been battling Large Painful cystic acne on my chin and mouth area for about 15 years now. There are usually 2 to 4 present at all times at various stages. I have seen 3 dermatologists &amp; the only thing they told me may work after trying everything else is Accutane (which I cannot bring myself to use) and to come in for painful injections into the cyst as needed to shrink them.  I am told that it is caused by stress and hormaones. Have tried thousands of dollars of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; including Zeno which did nothing.  I have been using the Beam for exactly 1 month now....... it is incredible! The 1st 2 weeks were bad but after reading other reviews I stuck it out for the full month before deciding. I had more activity then normal. Week 3 I had 1 emerge that is completely gone now.  Today, on day 30, I have no cystic acne on my face at all! This is incredilble for me. This is the ONLY thing that worked for me. I use the blue &amp; red 5 min session on each side of my mouth/chin area a minimum of twice a day when watching TV or relaxing in bed. When I feel a sensation of something way below the skin starting I do extra blue just on that area. I do not mind using this product the rest of my life compared to what I have lived through with this issue.  I also use Murad acne care products along with the this product.</li>
    <li> Buy the ANSR 30 days a go and i still haven&#x27;t see any type positive of result on my face yet still the same :oS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month which is the least amount of time you should give it a try before deciding if it&#x27;s for you or not.  I have had mild to moderate acne for over a decade and nothing has been as consistent with giving me results as ANSR.  As a side note I never write reviews, mainly because I&#x27;m never impressed with a product enough to take the time to do so.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews on here that either claim it&#x27;s working after only a few days, or say that they used it for 2 weeks and their skin got worse so the product is useless.  No skin clearing product will realistically work in only a few days time, in fact anything you get from a dermatologist will come with the advice to give it 6 weeks before deciding if another form of treatment is necessary.  During the first two weeks of using ANSR my skin did get worse, multiple painful cysts which were stressful to deal with, but I toughed it out because of remarks from other reviewers who said they went through the same thing and after the purging things got better.  I do believe however that the 5 min full face treatment twice a day would be inadequate.  I personally do 5 min of blue light on one half of my face/neck, then 5 min of blue light on the other side of my face/neck, then 5 min of red light on my whole face/neck in the AM and 5 min blue and 5 min red on one half of my face/neck and the same on the other side of my face/neck in the PM.  That means 15 min total in the morning and 20 min total at night every day, no exceptions.  I know that sounds like allot to do, and it is, but when you suffer with skin problems for as long as I have that extra time in the morning and night is a very small price to pay for not having to walk around embarrassed by a new breakout.  I don&#x27;t understand how some reviewers claim to watch TV or do other things when using ANSR because you have to watch how you&#x27;re moving the device along your face to make sure all areas are covered evenly.  Also, before using the device I wipe down the lens with some rubbing alcohol so I don&#x27;t spread around bacteria.    By week 3 of using ANSR I no longer had deep cysts and my skin looked healthier overall.  After a month&#x27;s time all I&#x27;ve gotten are small things that are few and far between and are so minor they clear out in a day and are hardly noticeable.  If I do feel something that gives me concern I place the blue light over it and let it sit for a 5 min cycle and that stops it from going any further.  As far as reducing old red marks, I think it needs more time.  If you look on the ANSR website the before and after shots they provide are after 6-8 weeks of using the product and I know from experience that even when you go to a plastic surgeon for laser treatments to address red spots they tell you to wait 3 to 6 weeks for a change, and that&#x27;s with medical grade technology.    Bottom line, this product does require a serious time commitment so if you don&#x27;t think you can work it into your routine save your money.  ANSR may not make your skin flawless but it will reduce your acne problem to very minor.  I started with mild to moderate acne so if you have minor acne to begin with than maybe you can get 100% clear.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a month, more than the directed twice per day, with very little results. I broke out even worse the first week and then I started to clear up.  After that, it was impossible to stop the acne from coming out in full effect.  It did not prevent acne but may have helped to clear the acne that was already bloomed.  I would not recommend this product.  After 15 years of fighting acne with over the counter treatments and now light therapy, I am seeing a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This thing is worth every penny, the best thing I have ever used on my face including peels and creams. You have to do it on a regular basis though but it WORKS! I will continue to use for as long as I live!! It evens out my skin and I break out much much less now, I am 39 and have fair sensitive skin with sun damage and even friends have commented on how even and clear my face is.. Get it, you will be amazed!</li>
    <li> I used to have HUGE problem with acne. Whenever I get rid of one, another came up immediately. However,  after using ANSR, I did notice the difference!! I never believe in this kind of thing, but surprisingly, it does work!!!!  First, it didn&#x27;t get rid of my acne dramatically- but it slowly worked and reduced new breakouts significantly.  Now I rarely have new breakouts and my acne scars are starting to fade out. I have been using this for about 4 weeks now.  I would definitely recommend this product to whoever get major stress from their acne problems.  It HELPS!!!</li>
    <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t be skeptical about a \\&quot;light beam\\&quot; that you hold up to your face to clear acne and get younger looking skin? This sounds like something straight out of some of the worst infomercials I&#x27;ve seen. Yet, I must say, this little device actually seems to be working and I&#x27;ve been telling EVERYONE I know about how wonderful it is.   I have mild to moderate acne, but the biggest issues I deal with when it comes to my skin is my compulsive need to pick at my face. As much as I try not to do it, sometimes I&#x27;ll just be sitting there, and I&#x27;ll realize I&#x27;ve been picking at my face for the past five minutes without even thinking about it. I&#x27;ve even been known to pick at my face when I&#x27;m sleeping. I only pick when I know there&#x27;s something to pick at though, so if my skin is flawless, I generally feel no need to pick at it altogether.   THANKFULLY, the ANSR beam is working brilliantly at keeping me from picking at my face. It not only keeps my skin relatively flawless and clear, but I can also use it whenever I know I&#x27;m inclined to pick at my face (e.g., at home when I&#x27;m watching TV, right before I go to bed, etc.) and since my hands are already busy holding up this little device, they can&#x27;t be used to pick since my hands are busy and I know that this device works at both killing the acne and healing my skin (which sort of helps with my compulsive desire to deal with my acne). Honestly, I love love LOVE this thing.   Instead of washing it in-between treatments with a little bit of soap and water like it says, I just bought hundreds of individually wrapped alcohol swabs from Walgreens for $4 and carry those around inside the little bag that came with the beam. I use the small swabs on both my skin AND the beam to clean off any oils, bacteria, etc. before beginning use. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 1/2 weeks (which is amazing since it&#x27;s supposed to take up to a month to see any results), and already my friends, my family, and even my fiance all agree that this thing is working. My mother wants one now, and so does my best friend. It&#x27;s hard to believe, but this thing really does work.   I love it, and I use it almost obsessively, but the beauty of this little thing is that I have seen no negative side effects from using it. I&#x27;ve also done so much research on this technology and concept since I bought the ANSR beam, and can&#x27;t find anything negative about it.   My only complaint would be that the device does need to be charged somewhat often, since the battery life on it does not last very long. Still, for the fact that it is only a little over a hundred dollars, and I&#x27;ve spent about $750 now on professional skin treatments recently that produce almost the same results, I&#x27;ve got to say that this is not really that big of an issue. If I charge it once, it will last for about 5 days with regular use, which isn&#x27;t bad, but I might be spoiled by my Clarisonic (which lasts for 2 weeks).   I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I read the glowing reviews and bought this product hoping to clear up my skin without using creams or going to a dermatologist. I used it as directed for two weeks, and with their great branding and nice form function, I really wanted to love it. I have sensitive skin and mild breakouts, like a scattering of small blackheads across the nose and an occasional red nodule that would eventually disappear with time without turning into a whitehead. With the ANSR, these same bumps evolved into ENORMOUS and embarrassing whiteheads. I stopped using it, and the problem went away, back to my regular skin condition. Also, the light from the device was starting to affect my eyes. Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent so much on trying this product, because it can&#x27;t be returned.  I have to say that my experience has made me incredibly skeptical of those claiming \\&quot;miracles,\\&quot; or even that the product works at all. With the credence given to reviewers, it&#x27;s a very good marketing return-on-investment to purchase a few of your own product and write glowing reviews.  In the end, I broke down and went to a dermatologist, and I have to admit that was probably the best choice all along.</li>
    <li> I am really happy I found this beam!  My face has cleared up significantly since I started using it!  I am already recommending it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I used this product religiously for several months.  I really wanted it to work, but I am not convinced that it did.  I don&#x27;t have terrible skin, but I do have monthly hormonal breakouts.  While using this product, I continued having breakouts.  I didn&#x27;t notice that there was much difference at all.  I also didn&#x27;t notice that they cleared up faster while using this product.  In fact, I stopped using it completely, and my skin has been no worse than while I was using it.  I had high hopes for this product, but I just can&#x27;t tell enough of a difference to justify the purchase.    I also want to mention that my husband had a FIT every time I used it.  He acted like he was being blinded by the light, especially the red one.    Sadly, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.  It might make a difference for someone, but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> HAVE BEEN QUITE PLEASED W/THE ANSR BEAM, TAKES THE INFLAMATION AWAY FROM A BREAKOUT BY THE NEXT DAY AND HEALING TIME IS CUT WAY DOWN, FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it works or not. Not sure how to tell if it works?? Anyone know?? Cute light machine tho.</li>
    <li> The ANSR Beam has helped me so much. It has helped keep my fact acne clear for months. It&#x27;s a great product. I don&#x27;t know if it helps wrinkles, but I do know it helps acne.</li>
    <li> i use it twice a day for a month now, 5 min blue light and 10 min red light. i put blue light on acne spots for 1 min and it worked just fine. acnes significantly heal faster than before. but i do not see much improvement on the fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead, under eye, and sides of my mouth. so i would recommend to people who wanted to use it for acne treatment as its cheaper than other products.     i also bought DPL, having been using it for only a week. i think it works so much better with visible improvement on the skin tone and fine lines. it s a lot more expensive tho. but it has far more light bulbs. i am looking forward to see more improvement as i use it longer.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a couple weeks now and so I havent got to see the full effect yet of the product but so far it has been working with reducing my acne, it does tend to cause your face to be a little dry though because after all it is a light.</li>
    <li> I am 33 years old have had adult acne flare ups and pick scars for years. I was indifferent when I ordered this product, because I have been disppointed many times in the past. After a week and a half it seemed as though my skin was getting worse, particularly my chin, but be patient! 2-2.5 weeks into it my skin totally calmed down and I see results. Hyperpgmentation from picking has greatly faded and new pimples are few to none. Pores appear to be smaller too. It does say the machine doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, but mine feels exceptionally dry. I can&#x27;t say for sure if that is due to the machine or the forced hot air heat that I am subjected to at work and home 24/7. Don&#x27;t give up if it doesn&#x27;t work instantly, nothing does. Good luck, this is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have tried the stim light and found it was drying out my skin, soI decided to try this especially since it has the blue light and I am at that age where I am suffering from hormonal acne. I have used it for 3 weeks and have found that it makes my skin feel smoother but it hasn&#x27;t made any visable differences.  It also does nothing for black or whiteheads but I am going to keep using it and hope that in the long run it will help. It is very easy to use. I would like to find another device that actually tightens and tones without spending too much. If anyone knows of such a device please recommend.</li>
    <li> Light is ok. I think a larger one you do not have to hold is better.Over all I like it.</li>
    <li> As part of my mini-midlife crisis, I decided to purchase a red light product.  After reading several reviews and comparing prices, I purchased an Ansr and began using it.  I&#x27;ve seen definite improvements in my skin, both in terms of blemishes and fine lines, and will continue using it for those.  But that&#x27;s not what blew me away.  I get aphthous ulcers in my mouth, on a fairly frequent basis.  This is due to an autoimmune disorder, and I&#x27;ve had to suffer through them since I was a child; there was never anything I could do about them.  But I&#x27;d recently read a passing mention of red-light therapy being used for aphthous ulcers, and decided to see what kind of effect the Ansr beam might have on mine.  The next time one formed on the inside of my cheek, I applied the Ansr beam directly over it (on the outside of the cheek) for five minutes, once in the morning, once in the evening.  Normally, my ulcers last a week; this one was gone within ONE DAY.  I&#x27;ve since been able to repeat this process on two more ulcers that attempted to form, and annihilated each of them in a single day as well.  Even if I&#x27;d never seen a single change on my face, in terms of the number of blemishes or lines, I&#x27;d be thrilled to death with the device and would swear by it, for this alone.  Those ulcers are incredibly painful and can make it difficult to eat and swallow, and for the first time in my LIFE I have a way of fighting them.  While I&#x27;m sure the makers of Ansr aren&#x27;t in a position to advertise the product for that purpose, I am going to swear by the device for the rest of my days.  It&#x27;s very rare that I&#x27;ve ended up feeling this much gratitude to any company, but this is the best hundred or so dollars I&#x27;ve ever, ever spent.</li>
    <li> I bought this product several months ago and have been using it on and off. I am in my mid 30s and have been having breakouts on chin and cheeks areas since my mid 20s. For my skin, proactive line worked well but was extremely irritating and drying it up. In addition, I started to have more wrinkles because my skin was so dried up. So I was looking for a better solution. I found it. This little gadget does miracles but works in combination with other products best. For example, I clean my face thoroughly with a sonic facebrush first, then apply a mosturazer (no SPF!) then use ANSR beam. Twice a day. My skin felt comforted imidiately after the first use and the next morning redness and breakout diminished. After about 4 days, the tone of my skin became more even and skin was more smooth to touch. It was sort of going from touching a sandpaper to touching silk. My family noticed that my skin looked different right away.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;1. Use on clean and moisturized face. Don&#x27;t use creams/lotions w/SPF.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use twice a day (be patient, don&#x27;t rush. You want to stay on problem areas a few seconds longer).&lt;br /&gt;Expectations:&lt;br /&gt;1. My skin tone, texture, look and feel improved greatly after a week of continues use.&lt;br /&gt;2. The breakouts healed and were reduced to a great extent.&lt;br /&gt;3. I didn&#x27;t see a significant reduction in wrinkles or blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;4. The red light may stimulate facial hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product and should be a part of every woman&#x27;s beauty ritual.</li>
    <li> First impression:  This is a very pleasant acne treatment. Unlike all the creams and washes I have tried before, there is no smell, no mess, no difficulty. I can not speak for its efficacy, as I have only had it for one day.   Use:  So far it is almost fun to use. One button operation is simple and easy. Directions are quick, simple&#x27; and clear. It quietly vibrates and becomes pleasantly warm as it works.   My treatment:  It does take a long time to use. Although the directions do not say to do so, I split my face into three segments for use. The forehead and each cheek gets its own ten minute treatment (Five minutes blue light, five minutes red.) This makes for thirty minutes per full face treatment. However, a quicker treatment would be to follow the directions and spend five minutes blue, five minutes red for the entire face. Ten minutes twice a day is manageable for anyone.   Efficacy:   I have had it for one day. I will update my review with how well it works in a month when it has had time to become effective.</li>
    <li> Just received this product today and used it for the first time.  Regardless of how it works to reduce acne/fine lines, it certainly feels relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - and I&#x27;m not sure why I didn&#x27;t catch this while I was researching the different devices - I&#x27;m a little annoyed that the ANSR uses a 430nm blue light.  A 405-420 nm wavelength has been shown in numerous studies, clinical trials, etc to be the most effective.  My only guess is that use of a 405-420 nm wavelength is currently covered by one or more claims in a patent that has yet to expire, and ANSR either didn&#x27;t want to pay a license fee and/or wanted to keep the cost of the device down by not having to pass the license fee on to customers.  Looks like the more expensive devices like Tria and Tanda actually do use a wavelength within the recommended range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m going to give this a try, but I wish I had noticed this fact while I was deciding what to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve used it for a while...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the ANSR for about a year now, and I do feel it is a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give it some time before I wrote a review. I have a lot of acne, and have been going to a dermatologist for about 2 years trying different methods. I know someone with an occasional pimple will have good results with this device. The ANSR hasn&#x27;t solved all my acne problems, but it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1- rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;2- 1 charge lasts about 2 weeks with freq usage.&lt;br /&gt;3- Small, easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around Dec/Jan, I had trouble spot on my chin that would breakout with pimples one on top of the other, repeatedly. (holiday stress).&lt;br /&gt;All my prescription creams and treatments wouldn&#x27;t work to reduce the flare ups. When 1 pimple would start to die down, 2-3 would replaced it with a vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used the Ansr on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This is the method that worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pressed Ansr, the Blue light, on the area for 10 mins (2 rounds of the blue light)  2-3 times a day. (I would just skip the red light part)&lt;br /&gt;After the 2nd day, new pimples stopped coming. I continued for a week, and the existing pimples were fading away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST part!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been over 3 months and that area has NO new pimples at all! I believe the blue light really diminished the amount of oil and sebaceous glands in that area, and \\&quot;killed\\&quot; all the bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;Now I just run the blue light over my chin area once every 2 weeks as maintenance, but I don&#x27;t need to do the 10 min cycles on it anymore. I think that was just for the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the 10 min cycle on the rest of my face yet, because I haven&#x27;t had the time, as you can see, it takes a while to do that, and the light doesn&#x27;t cover much area at 1 time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, I want to do the blue light laser treatment on my whole face at my dermatologist office.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it really works.</li>
    <li> It was just okay. I did not really seem to get any noticeable results from this product. I probably would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!!!  Stop wasting your money and monthly creams and try The Beam.  It has taken 10 years off my appearance.  My friends keep asking me what I have been doing because I look so much younger.  This thing works.</li>
    <li> My son came home from college with the worst case of acne we had ever seen him with. We insisted that he use this while at home. Within three weeks his faced cleared up dramatically. By the time he left he was almost completely cleared up. The only thing he used for treatment was this beam. He was so impressed he took it back to school and his face has remained clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for almost a month now.  I do have to say that you can see results, although not instant.  You really have to stick to twice a day everyday.  I started seeing results after about 10 days to 2 weeks.  I think it&#x27;s a great gadget. Definately worth the money since it had a blue and red light.   I say stick to it and it will do it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> OK, so I&#x27;m 57 years old and lately I am going through some hormonal changes.  One of the unfortunate things that goes along with this is the cystic acne on my face that has haunted me at various times in my life.  Trust me when I tell you, I&#x27;m sick of it.  Oh yes.  Nasty bumps that never seem to go away.  I went for years having clear, beautiful skin, but now nasty acne has returned to haunt me.  So after a couple months of this crap, I decided I needed to take drastic action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the absolute truth.  I bought the Ansr beam yesterday afternoon, and I used it last night, this morning, and again tonight.  Ten minutes each session...five minutes of blue light that kills the bacteria causing my acne, five minutes of red light that tightens and eliminates creases and wrinkles.  I swear to you, not only are the bumps under my skin almost completely gone,and my skin is definitely smoother all over.  I am completely blown away. My husband couldn&#x27;t believe it, either, as he commented on my smooth, glowing skin.  I am ecstatic.  This thing is worth its weight in gold.  If you suffer from cystic acne, run, don&#x27;t walk, and get one of these things.  The skin toning and tightening is just a bonus, but I&#x27;m so thrilled I would have been happy with just the acne solution alone.  I can&#x27;t say it will work for everyone as fast as it did for me, but I can tell you, this device definitely works.</li>
    <li> 10mins seems too long for me. I think it&#x27;s a good device but its does takes a lot of discipline to use it daily. I can&#x27;t tell how well it helps my acne because I&#x27;m too inconsistent using it. it&#x27;s been 2 years and the battery seems to be failing.</li>
    <li> This product is genius. Yes, it is a little expensive but it is definitely worth it! I&#x27;ve had acne since my early teenage years, and its only gotten worse over the years by becoming cystic acne rather than pimples. I&#x27;ve tried so many products that have dried out my skin and left so much damage by basically eating away at my skin and leaving it extrememly red and flacky. I&#x27;ve cried so many times when I&#x27;d look in the mirror and see not only cystic, painful acne, but also a red and flacky face. I&#x27;ve had this product for about 4 days now, using it once in the morning and once at night (both the red and blue light). From what I&#x27;m seeing after just a couple days, I have much hope for this product. My face is so much better. I dont use any topical cream anymore (except for oil free lotion that helps prevent breakouts - to keep my skin from drying out), not even at night and my skin has never felt and looked so good. This changed my life, giving me confidece once again!</li>
    <li> Used this for three months straight every day.  Then used it for about four days a week to two days a week.  I am not noticing anything that I can really write about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 months now and I can see the difference.  As with any other acne products, you have use it as instruction and continuously.  It&#x27;s help me a lot and it&#x27;s way cheaper than the other blue or red light that are $300 each.  Worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional model in Paris and NYC, and my skin was breaking out with small bumps from all the traveling I do with work. I had researched blue light therapy and thought I would spend the money for the ANSR product- even though it was a bit pricey. I am kind of shocked with the results. I&#x27;m under 25 and dont have a lot of skin complaints, but I really see a difference in my skin. The acne cleared up in 1-2 weeks, and my pores seem smaller as well. I recommend this product, and hesitate to give it five stars only bc I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and dont know all the effects. Good product.</li>
    <li> I decided to give the ANSR beam a fair shot before giving my objective opinion, so after six months, I can honestly say that I am very glad that I invested in this little device. There were quite a few good reviews, but I&#x27;m always skeptical, as most everyone could be working in the marketing department, for all that I knew.   Pros: my acne has markedly improved. The device worked quickly, and I began seeing tentative results the next day, although it may not be the same for everyone. My acne is primarily bacterial, which is why the device works so well. I purchased it because I had started to develop an intolerance for benzoyl peroxide. The device is compact and comes with a carrying bag, although with the price tag, I have been slightly reluctant to just hoof it around with me anywhere. I have better results when I use my acne face wash in conjunction with the device, but I&#x27;ve been able to eliminate the medicated lotion, which bleached my sheets and clothes. Definitely a plus.   Cons: when you read the description you think, &#x27;great, 10 minutes twice daily, piece of cake.&#x27; But you really need to be honest with yourself about your schedule. I have a high-stress medical career, and there are quite a few 4am mornings where I just don&#x27;t have the time, energy, or motivation to do the beam for 10 minutes. If you think about it, that&#x27;s 20 minutes a day, which equates to a couple of hours per week. To some people, no big deal, to others (like myself, while working two jobs and countless side projects) a couple of hours is significant. It&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t do anything while treating yourself - but trying to do things like writing, typing, or cooking dinner is akin to rubbing your stomach while patting your head. It requires some coordination, and I find that I tend to miss spots on my face if I have to concentrate on something else. The best things to do are read and watch tv. The device also has to be used religiously - if I miss a couple of days my acne comes creeping back. Again, this is only a con for some people.   Overall, it&#x27;s a wonderful device if you have realistic expectations and can genuinely see yourself having the time and motivation to use it long-term. If you are expecting a miracle or a quick cure-all that requires no continuing maintenance, you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Read the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; reviews and bought it.  On the all areas where I used this, my skin got inflamed and acne actually came up where nothing was there before.  Sanitized it every time too.  Now I dont have sensitive skin or weird skin, if it works for 98% of people, it always work for me.  So then I thought, I must be using it wrong, proceeded to use it on my skin not to actually touch my face, did nothing.  If it works, it works way too slowly for my liking as I use it for 3 weeks, half an hour or more a day.  What else I didn&#x27;t like about it?  It make the tone of my skin look weird.  I stopped using it and my skin heals much faster.   What does work?    1.) Facials and professional extractions.  With PROFESSIONAL extractions EVERYTHING is rooted out quickly in 1/2 hour, then followed by up to 3 days of redness to heal.  Nothing mineral makeup can&#x27;t cover up.  What else works?  2.) The old fashioned way of watching anti-inflammatory foods - no sugar, dairy, fried stuff, or anything that may inflame your specific body type.  (Read the gold standards \\&quot;The Clear Skin Diet\\&quot;, \\&quot;Eat Right for your Type\\&quot;, and \\&quot;The Anti-Inflammatory Diet and Cookbook\\&quot;).    3.) Supplements and letting your skin heal naturally with minimal chemicals, makeup, etc.  Nothing really beats that.   Don&#x27;t buy this, I wish I didn&#x27;t.  Now its sitting in a drawer unused.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40 and have had acne since I was 10 and did the whole dermatologist, retin-a, pro-active thing to limited success.  I have the whole zit spectrum, black heads, whiteheads and those below-the-surface cysts.  Kiehls Rare Earth Deep Pore Daily Cleanser (got it on Amazon and love it) took care of the blackheads but didn&#x27;t help a whole lot with the whiteheads and cysts.  This machine came in yesterday.  I used the blue setting last night and this morning.  Within two uses it significantly reduced several non-painful cysts that I have had forever.  I used to be able to feel big lumps under my skin and now they are almost gone.  I can&#x27;t believe it worked that fast  but it did.  The remaining zits are unchanged so far.  I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if prolonged use of the device will help.  I&#x27;ll update if I see any improvement.  I recommend this device if you have those under-the-skin acne lumps (the non-painful kind that just stick around forever).</li>
    <li> It is concerning that the company refuses to disclose the technical details of the product.  This makes it nearly impossible to determine if the light intensity, etc., is appropriate for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have heeded my instinct, and moved on to a more transparent company than ANSR.  This was to my peril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After fewer than 30 days of use as specified, the product has proven defective.  It does not charge, hold a charge, etc.  It is functionally broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And -- unless ANSR answers to this problem -- I&#x27;m out $120.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise you to SEEK ANOTHER PRODUCT.  And yeah, I&#x27;m a real person, not hired by anyone, or anything.  Just keenly interested in LED technology for personal therapy.</li>
    <li> I have only just started using the ANSR Beam, but in reading the enclosed product information, I see that the manufacturer&#x27;s warrenty is only in force if purchased directly from OAT (Oregon Aesthetic Technologies, Inc.) This should be clear on Amazon&#x27;s item description, which it is not. I cannot write about my personal experience with the product, as it is new to me.</li>
    <li> OK, another beauty treatment that seems to be more hype than help! I use this almost every night after I wash my face and before I apply any night creams. I still get zits (I&#x27;m 45 going on 46) and I can&#x27;t say I notice any fewer breakouts. I use the blue light (antibacterial) on my face and chest, then follow with the red (healing) light. Again, I don&#x27;t notice any reduction in my acne scars, brown spots, sun damaged areas, or pore size. I&#x27;d be curious how other &#x27;red light&#x27; therapies stack up against this device. Next!!</li>
    <li> I should start by saying that I&#x27;m not terribly consistent -- maybe once a day.  But when I do have a blemish the blue light dries it up and the red light heals it.  I can count on it to take care of any PMS spots on my chin which is nice since I&#x27;m middle aged and OVER breaking out!  I have noticed an improvement of the lines around my mouth and the beginnings of crow&#x27;s feet.  I also share this with my daughter (12 y old) and she is benefiting from it also.  Yes, she knows to keep the lights away from her eyes!  Nice to know she can use something with no side effects like sun sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I promised myself I&#x27;d give this little device at least a 2 month trial before giving a review, because may I just say while I have an audience, such reviews as &#x27;I just got this product today and I hope it works!!! I will post more if it works or not!!&#x27; are rarely followed through and are frustratingly useless. Also, I&#x27;m pretty cynical and wasn&#x27;t really expecting this to work super well. But, here&#x27;s the happy scoop. I am a 25 year old female with fair skin, which can burn easily in sunlight and which also responds well to the topical treatment of benzoyl peroxide (which left my skin old looking and dry). My acne has been mostly in my T-zone, especially around the chin area, consisting mostly of whiteheads... but I&#x27;ve also enjoyed the occasional flaming red cluster zit that looks like a 3rd eye in the wrong place on my face. Anyway, if you&#x27;ve similar skin type and acne type..I would definitely try this product because I bet it will work for you. Even if you don&#x27;t have similar skin, this may work well for you. I generally use this product every night for 30 minutes. Before every use, I wash my face. I also clean the product every few uses with a baby wipe. I use the Blue/red light on my chin area, then my nose and cheeks (just the surface below my eyes, not the entire cheek), and finally my forehead. I try to do about 10-15 minutes in the morning also but it&#x27;s hit and miss. For the first 3 weeks though, I used this thing regularly, sometimes a half hour in the morning AND night. I do use this product with protective sun-tanning glasses because I do not trust the claim that the blue light is harmless (ah, my cynicism Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found in the 2 months that I&#x27;ve been using the product..first week, no difference. Second week, skin MAYBE looked a little better, or was it a hopeful delusion? Also, a few zits were popping up in the weirdest places- as in my upper arms and neck (but better than the face!). 3rd week...I THINK there was an improvement, but not huge. Fourthweek...4 weeks without the use of awful benzoyl peroxide and zits were few and far between (unprecedented)! 5th week...skin tone and texture was undeniably improved.  6th week and on...phew, I think am one of those who have found success with this product!  This product DID minimize acne outbreaks and improve overall skin tone and texture with consistent use over 6 weeks time. This product DID NOT fade the red marks of previous zits, but those fortunately fade with time anyway, and did NOT reduce the size of my pores in the dreaded T-zone. But still, the tone and texture of my skin is improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product 4-stars and not 5 is because A) the target &#x27;lens&#x27; that you want in contact with your face feel similar to the rest of the device and in the beginning it is difficult to rely on your tactile senses alone to ensure that full-on contact is being made and B) Why do I often have to reset this product before it will properly charge? It does not really charge like a cellphone, as it claims, because I never have to reset my cell phone for it to charge.&lt;br /&gt; But, despite these trivial negatives...I&#x27;m grateful for the little thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. Give it a fair try...4-6 weeks at least. I think that today, phototherapy is the safest and most effective alternative there is to toxic topical treatments like benzoyl peroxide. At least, within my budget. Really hope it works for you...good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My ANSR beam lasted about a year. I used it while talking on my cell which I&#x27;ve later read in the manual is not recommended. I purchased a new one about a month ago. It had different packaging (as shown) and the box was re-stickered with claims that were different than what was on the box. The device sounded different than my first device (as if something loose was rattling inside) and the batterly life was about half that as my first one. I went to the official website of ANSR beam because I wanted to purchase a legitimate device as the first one really worked for me, but ANSR beam&#x27;s official website has been &#x27;under construction&#x27; for a long time now. This is not a good sign. I&#x27;m assuming they are going out of business or had some issues with the FDA and it&#x27;s a real bummer. The original product worked.  Needless to say, I returned my second device...it just wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
    <li> so i have never written a product review before but felt i had to do so now. for years, i thought i had  cystic acne which was occasional and localised but very painful. nothing topical worked at all, only gave my skin a kind of chemical burn. the horrible pain of the inflammation beneath the skin would often make me end up trying to squeeze the bump just to relieve the pressure. all just made it worse. after a latest course of antibiotics failed, suggesting i was building resistance, i went to a dermatologist. i didn&#x27;t have acne, i had rosacea, which can look like acne but behaves completely differently, never coming to a head and not responding to topical acne treatments. as a dedicated bikram yogi, this news was upsetting - that kind of moist heat is a huge rosacea trigger. my derm put me on oracea, an oral low-dose antibiotic, but warned me it would take time to work. in the meantime, i started reading about rosacea as i knew nothing about it. suddenly all my skin problems made sense - the unexplained flare-ups of redness and pain in my nose that had no obvious source, the tiny whiteheads that would pop up after yoga that i assumed was my skin sweating out toxins. i also saw that one of the treatments that&#x27;s most effective is IPL which the derm offers - starting at $300 a pop. eek. that&#x27;s when i went looking for ansr which i&#x27;d previously seen sold at my local bliss spa, as it worked on similar principles.   rosacea is an inflammatory condition, not a bacterial one, but i figured the blue light couldn&#x27;t hurt along with the red for inflammation. wow. after two days, the redness has hugely subsided, the inflammation that was stopping the healing of the cyst i&#x27;d squeezed had calmed and another bump under my skin had been halted in its tracks. my pores look smaller already which gives me the confidence to use enough moisturiser without fear of clogging.   i wanted to write this because although there are many rave reviews for acne treatment here, there are only a fewfor rosacea. true, if i hadn&#x27;t gone to my derm i wouldn&#x27;t have known that&#x27;s what i had, but if i&#x27;d gotten ansr anyway, it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered, as it works for both. if nothing else has worked for what you think is acne, try ansr. if it&#x27;s actually rosacea, ansr has as good a chance of working. i am hoping the effects last as when my skin had completely calmed i plan to try going back to yoga and use the ansr afterwards to see if it will stop the inflammation triggering rosacea. fingers crossed....</li>
    <li> As a late-40s woman who has been struggling with breakouts and redness (probably rosacea) for the past year, I have pretty much tried everything from topical treatments (both OTC and doctor-prescribed) to oral contraceptives to antibiotics to the most minimalist skincare regimen imaginable. I read about the ANSR beam and though skeptical decided to give it a try, based on product reviews and other research. I thought I noticed improvement within the first week of use, but knowing my skin issues are very cyclical, wanted to give things a full 5 weeks before making a final judgement. Well, let me just say, in two words: I&#x27;m amazed. This little gizmo WORKS. It doesn&#x27;t completely eradicate breakouts, but it greatly minimizes both the frequency and severity of flare-ups, and healing is vastly accelerated. My skin looks wonderful. All my friends have noticed a dramatic improvement. When coupled with the use of sea buckthorn seed oil and jojoba oil -- and keeping all other face treatments to a minimum -- the results have been nothing short of a miracle for me. I am truly impressed.   The ANSR beam is easy to use and it works. I use both the blue light setting for blemishes and the red light setting for rejuvenation. I would say the red light also has helped with fine lines and overall skin tone, but it&#x27;s the blue light for blemishes that has blown me away.   If you have tried everything else to no avail, try this. Used consistently and along with other good skin care habits, IT WORKS. I would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Okay I will try and make this as brief and straight to the point as possible. Let me start by saying I have seen a derm. and was on tretinoin cream and BP gel which dried my face out terribly in some spots and also made it extremely oily in others. I then decideded to try a clay mask and some other natural products and my face was doing fine besides a few break outs here and there . NOTHING MAJOR! I then came across blue light therapy and let me say I honestly thought this was the answer since I had.... HAD mild acne. I used this product as directed and religiously, woke up extra early before work to sit and use this product etc. Long story short, my face has not been this bad in a LONG time. This product caused me to break out all over my forehead and on my cheeks. I started getting pimples that wouldnt come to a head and were in like a cluster and just left marks all over my face. Reading all of those good reviews from some customers I was excited to try this and I wish I would have stuck with what I was using before. The darn thing also dies so quickly. Maybe if I had of continued using the product a little bit longer, I may have seen results but honestly before using this my face was very clear and I wasnt embarrassed to talk to people or look in the mirror. I found out that you have 30 days or something like that to return the product in order to receive a refund. UPS picked that crap up and I am waiting for my money back. PLEASE dont buy this product. If you have mild to moderate acne, this is NOT the answer and may make your acne so much worse than it is. Even my normal healthy routine (eating healthy, drinking plenty water, etc) cant stop me from breaking out from using this product. I hope someone reads this and takes my advice before you feel how I do. Not attractive and about $120 short because of a product that does nothing but shine a blue light and then a red light on your face!!!!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product when I got a facial at Gene Juarez in Tacoma, WA. I bought it and although it was sort of fun to use, I think it had more of the placebo effect. Months after my purchase, I ended up going back to my Doctor and getting a prescription acne medication (Duac gel) that is far more of a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; than this little device. Try the Duac gel if you haven&#x27;t already, it seriously changed my life!!</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I was so excited that I used it about twice a day. As other people have mentioned, it can cause breakouts before helping. That&#x27;s exactly what happened to me. I pushed through it and used it consistently for about a month or two. It wasn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but it slowly started to clear up my acne. Though my acne has gotten a lot better, there are still some pimples even this can&#x27;t stop.</li>
    <li> I bought this and used it consistently and it was a WASTE of money...get a peel or fraxel or ipl, but do not waste money on this product whatever you do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I did a LOT of research on red and blue light therapy before finally choosing on a product to try.  This was the best rated yet most affordable product that I could find.  I love it.  When I use it nightly (both the red and the blue) I started to see a noticeable difference after about a week of using it.  It&#x27;s rechargeable so you don&#x27;t have to spend any money on replacing batteries and it&#x27;s very compact which makes it easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> Went thru 2 of these, both chargers broke after only few months of using.. I believe this product has manufacture defect. I contact  number on mfg box, no longer in service. What a scam! Probably product not on market anymore.. Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Item received in good conditions. Very strong red and blue light. But its quite tiring to hold the device for 10mins only on 1 small portion of the face. overall, if it works, i dont mind.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to this item to arrive because I was looking for a light therapy for skin care that combined the red and blue lights, so I can save time.  First, I received it unsealed, and the ANSR had a tiny scratch on the rubber disk, some black dirt on it.  I also didn&#x27;t like that there were 2 labels to cover up the description of product. Also, there was a sticker on the box that said it was not FDA cleared.&lt;br /&gt;It said that the first time you charge this, it will take 2 hours.  It only worked for 20 minutes for the full charge because there are 3 tiny white lights that comes on when it is done charging. What I did not see in the description before purchasing it, was the unit vibrates or buzzes when in use. I didn&#x27;t care for the massage, as I am looking for a light therapy for skincare.  Furthermore, the unit has a total of 4 bulbs.  2 red and 2 blue lights.&lt;br /&gt;The blue light comes on, along with that vibration;then after 5 minutes,the vibrations kinda skips then the red light comes on.  It shuts off after 5 minutes of the red light.  To me, this product seems weak compared to other items similar to this that has many more LEDs in it.  Perhaps for someone who has very mild acne, normal skin.  I happen to have super oily skin and need something stronger.</li>
    <li> The ANSR beam is great.  I suffer from hormonal breakouts and using this 2x a day has practically made my blemishes non-existent.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> so far so good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;might be working.. but not sure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use only red light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blue no need as i feel my face wash kills bacterial and i dont want to over do the &#x27;kill bacteria&#x27; part</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and was able to use it only once because it stopped working. I asked the seller for a full refund, but it was denied! For me the product did not work in any ways!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in 2011 out of desperation(I developed acne after being on several rounds of antibiotics and nothing was helping). I used it for about 4 months and saw zero difference, so I just put it away. Last week I found it and decided to see if using the red light would help reduce facial redness. Well, when I plugged that thing in it to charge the red light automatically came on and wouldn&#x27;t go away. It did not hold charge and wouldn&#x27;t work at all. I took it apart and couldn&#x27;t believe how cheaply it was made. What was I thinking paying over a $100 for this garbage? -_-&lt;br /&gt; For those who actually want something that works... go with 0.01% retinol gel. I can guarantee you, it will get rid of your break outs no matter how bad they are (it actually re-surfaces your skin, reduces acne scars and prevents future break outs). Retinol is also the only thing that was clinically proven to reduce wrinkles and help build collagen. You can either get a prescription for it or look for it online.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this item very long so it is hard to tell any dramatic difference. However,  it has help my acne. I would highly recommend getting goggles as the red light is very bright.</li>
    <li> I only have hormonal acne and this doesnt really do much to get rid of the pimples or make your skin better.  I no longer use the product.  After 4 months I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  Its hard to commit to using this thing anyway.  After using this I began to break out under the chin which never happened before so I&#x27;m thinking that it doesnt really kill bacteria but maybe the light surpresses it in the area you use it on (face).</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who is experiencing acne for the first time in her 20&#x27;s. Was interested in the technology and looked at a different but similar device which was cheaper but sounded like it would have cost a fortune in disposable batteries. This has a charger. She loves it and says it has cleared her skin, so I am happy with it!</li>
    <li> I do not use this as often as the directions say... (10 minutes in the morning and at night takes longer than you think!), but I will use it on the weekends for up to an hour at a time - usually about 4 each of blue and red cycles, and I always feel this helps prevent breakouts that are starting and clear up any skin issues.</li>
    <li> at first you would think it is expensive, but compared to other devices it is quite reasonably price/ kind of cheap when you consider. Don&#x27;t expect your acne to disappear immediately but it really keeps it at a controllable level.good product to add to your acne care routine.</li>
    <li> I noticed a reduction in acne after just a short time using this. After about a year, the unit no longer turned on. The battery is not replaceable so it went to the landfill. I had a much better reduction in acne simply by cutting dairy out of my diet.</li>
    <li> This is one amazing little device. It starts showing results the first time you use it and the results stay for several days between treatments. This is great for wrinkles and pimples, how many products do that!?!&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> At first I was completely skeptical of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it as a gift for my boyfriend but only because of all the great reviews it had on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I can say now that me and my boy friend are extremely happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;The blue like treatment is the only thing that has ever reduced the size of my black heads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years and never with any success.&lt;br /&gt;So although I can still see them up close in the mirror, the number and size of them have reduced dramatically, and I&#x27;m confident that with more time and two 5minute treatments a day they will soon be gone for good.&lt;br /&gt;Red light treatment is equally great, it reduces the appearance of fine lines and sleep lines under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the frown creases I have in my brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;Get it and I&amp;#34;m sure you will feel the same way after the first week of use.</li>
    <li> I am using it on a daily basis but see no change yet.  I am still a little squeptical about this product.</li>
    <li> If only based on the ANSR product&#x27;s performance, this would be a 5-star rating. I was a skeptic, but desperate to find an effective treatment for my acne. I am in my 30&#x27;s and have suffered comedonal and inflammatory acne, with minimal cystic lesions. As a medical professional who knows the science of the skin and has traditional prescription acne products at my disposal, I was frustrated with the expense (Accutane) and harsh side effects. I live in a very dry climate and all acne prescriptions dried my face terribly. I decided to try the ANSR (purchased elsewhere - Costco used to carry these on their website).    The effects were relatively gradual - but the typical \\&quot;guideline\\&quot; is at least 3-4 weeks of consistent treatment of any skin product before an effect is seen. I was amazed that my skin was nearly acne free around 1 month after consistent use. My skin tone was not poor before, but seemed to improve overall. I did not have a lot of hyperpigmentation prior to treatment, so I can&#x27;t comment on that claim. I was finally no longer embarrassed to be seen without makeup!    The ANSR is easy to use, although the product packaging gives little direction. You charge it up, then unplug it and hold it directly over clean skin, moving it slowly around for 5 minutes - 1st cycle, blue light for acne; then 5 minutes - 2nd cycle, red light for improved skin texture (boost collagen production, decrease wrinkles). It switches cycles automatically and stops at the 10 minutes. You can cycle through and use either cycle independently, if you prefer. I generally did this twice daily, and found I could read or watch tv while doing it. The battery initially lasted 4-6 days between full charges. The unit is very compact and easy to take while traveling. That said, there were times I went camping or just thought, \\&quot;Hey, my skin is fine now. I don&#x27;t really need this anymore. . .\\&quot; And after a few days of non-use, I&#x27;d start noticing return of a few pimples under the skin. Back to my ANSR! And, if and when I did start to feel something \\&quot;below the surface,\\&quot; I could focus the blue light therapy on that area and the pimple-to-be simply went away within a day or two. Impressive!    The science seems to be supporting frequency-specific effects of light therapy but not quite enough evidence for me to convince all of my patients. The devices on the market now pretty much seem to be FDA-cleared, which doesn&#x27;t indicate any endorsement of function. (Don&#x27;t put too much faith in our dear FDA, folks, anyway.) So, that brings up to the present. I loved my ANSR from Dec. 2010 to Jan. 2013, then it died - the battery would no longer hold a charge. In its defense, the specs indicate an estimated battery life of 1000 uses (which I exceeded). I began looking for a new device, and also tried to contact the company, Oregon Aesthetic Technologies, Inc. (OAT). The phone number does not even ring. I did some internet sleuthing and found this article ([...]) indicating that the company was ordered by the courts to halt sales and that the physical office location seems to be shut down, as of October 2012. Apparently OAT did not obtain said FDA-clearance before selling its ANSR products. I frankly don&#x27;t care and would have bought another one, with the single concern that customer service will be basically defunct for anyone purchasing an ANSR right now.    I ultimately purchased a Sirius Aurora  [[ASIN:B004REGO00 Sirius SS-77 Aurora Light Therapy System]] for my 2nd light therapy device, simply because it was relatively low-cost, has the capability of red, blue and green light therapy, is a plug-in model (so no battery to die/recharge) and has a pretty decent summary of multiple journal abstracts about the science of light therapy on their website. Time will tell how effective it is in comparison. I will post a review there after using it a month or two.</li>
    <li> I have never had acne problems or any other skin problems. I am a 32 year old woman who has always had nice skin. After i turned 32 i started to notice my skin looking not as bright, firm, or youthfull as it was in my 20s. I started using this product after a facial lady recomended it. After the first use i noticed my skin was softer. After the first month i noticed my skin was brighter and seemed to have more elasticity back in it. After 3months my skin seriously looked so much younger. I started getting complements on how my skin seemed to glow! I continue to use my product twice a day and now feel that i have my 22year old skin back! I baught one for my sister, mother, and friends for gifts. It has also cleared my bff&#x27;s pregnancy acne. I will never stop using my beam!</li>
