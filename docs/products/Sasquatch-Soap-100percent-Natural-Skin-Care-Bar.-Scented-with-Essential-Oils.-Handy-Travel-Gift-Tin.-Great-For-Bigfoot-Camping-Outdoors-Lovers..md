      <li>and I liked it so much that I bought it as a gift.</li>

      <li>The scent is nice, not overly masculine or feminine, and it cleans without overdrying.</li>

      <li>This soap has a very nice smell to it, very unlike commercially sold soaps.</li>

      <li>The tin is made of nice solid materials and feels well crafted.</li>

      <li>Worth a try, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into.</li>
      <li>I originally bought it as more of a gag gift, but they actually like it.</li>
      <li>According to dad the smell is great, the container is decorative, and the soap suds up enough to be used not only to clean the body with but also for shaving.</li>
      <li>It smells really good but isn&#x27;t over powering like other soap for men can be.</li>
      <li>Not bad soap actually, but the scent is more manly.</li>
      <li>It comes in the little tin can as pictured and is a good buy in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I first got him some as a stocking stuffer around Christmas time--</li>

      <li>Thick white lather and it smells great!</li>
      <li>It is all natural, smells great, and lasts through quite a few washes.</li>
      <li>I was glad to read in one of the other reviews that you can purchase the soap without the tin; being able to puchase refills is definitely a bonus.</li>
      <li>Terrific aroma, easy lathering, and no residue on the body nor on the tub/shower.  </li>
      <li>When I first saw it I thought it would be a cute little gift that would make him laugh.</li>
      <li>Anytime it is nearing the end he calls me up to &#x27;hint, hint&#x27; me that he wants another</li>
      <li>and the shipping was really fast.  </li>
      <li>I ordered three of these soaps as gifts for various [male] friends, and they all got a real kick out of them AND liked the soap itself a lot.  </li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for this shaving soap at all.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very earthy.</li>
      <li>My fiance absolutely loves this soap.  </li>
      <li>I found the soap to generally be much less drying than most bar or deodorant soaps.  </li>
      <li>Decent sized bar</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>It did indeed make him laugh which was enough in itself!</li>
      <li>It rinses clean with low to moderate lather.</li>
      <li>Only thing is it got used up really fast.</li>
      <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised that it smells like nature.  </li>

    <li> I got this for my husband back in December as a stocking stuffer. When I first saw it I thought it would be a cute little gift that would make him laugh. It did indeed make him laugh which was enough in itself! After him using almost all of it in a month and a half I must say I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It smells really good but isn&#x27;t over powering like other soap for men can be. The smell is indeed woodsy and masculine so spot on with the name. It comes in the little tin can as pictured and is a good buy in my opinion. I didn&#x27;t even use the soap and I liked it so much that I bought it as a gift. I give this product an A++ :)</li>
    <li> This soap is very woodsy smelling and has a nice texture to smooth the skin. This may be one of my favotire scents from Seattle Sundries and it works well for both men and women which is always nice.  Not to mention-- the tin is adorable.</li>
    <li> Smell good. Big foot happy. Me clean.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gag gift to my husband. Now I&#x27;m back to order more because he loved it so much. He says he feels cleaner than he ever has and the scent is great.</li>
    <li> The smell of this soap was loved by some of us. But some people did not want to be around the smell. I thought it was a pleasant, earthy smell. The person that received this soap as a gift, did like the smell and said that he would use it.</li>
    <li> I ordered three of these soaps as gifts for various [male] friends, and they all got a real kick out of them AND liked the soap itself a lot.  I&#x27;ll be baaaack......</li>
    <li> good price fast shipping</li>
    <li> I mean...it IS called sasquatch soap, so I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised that it smells like nature.  Good for those who want to smell like underbrush</li>
    <li> Ha, It was a fun party gift!</li>
    <li> This was my nephew&#x27;s comment in response to receiving this as a gift.  He loved the tin and didn&#x27;t want to use the soap!  :-)  Would recommend for purchase.</li>
    <li> This was for a stocking stuffer for my Sasquatch-lovin&#x27; hubby...He really got a kick out of it! The fragrance was very nice, and the tin was super cute. He uses it in the green house-well, we both do!! I was glad to read in one of the other reviews that you can purchase the soap without the tin; being able to puchase refills is definitely a bonus. The tin keeps the soap tidy, and we both like that it is 100% natural. A fun gift, definitly a hit!!</li>
    <li> A great soap for the man&#x27;s shower.  Terrific aroma, easy lathering, and no residue on the body nor on the tub/shower.  Would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Also the tin makes it easy to accompany traveling.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved this with the container and all when I got it for a stalking stuffer It&#x27;s a good scent and i like supporting small business. get it for the guy in your life - he&#x27;ll enjoy it!</li>
    <li> This is a great &amp;#34;gag gift&amp;#34; for those who make jokes about or truly do believe in Big Foot.  And it actually smells great.  The only con is that it is a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Thus was an excellent product, it smells great cleans great and I love the tin it came in. I can use it as a trinket box</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really excited for this product it smells great and the shipping was really fast.  The tin is made of nice solid materials and feels well crafted.</li>
    <li> Actually smells pretty good.  Bought as a gift for a friend.  Comes in a nice tin so you can travel with it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, a mix of pine and musk. Decent sized bar and it has lasted a long time so far. Thick white lather and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Bought these as stocking stuffers at Christmas, and nothing but rave reviews.  They smell wonderful, and the packaging is cute. :)</li>
    <li> Got this for stocking stuffers for both adult children. They loved it.  They liked the tin and made in Washington</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice natural soap. Love the woodsy smell to it. Only thing is it got used up really fast. My husband only used it in the shower and the bar only lasted 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> smelled great! nice earthly clean smell. will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a joke as a Christmas gift for a friend whose has the nickname of Sasquatch. Needless to say it was a big hit and he loved it!</li>
    <li> My fiance absolutely loves this soap.  I first got him some as a stocking stuffer around Christmas time--but I&#x27;ve since bought him 5 more tins of it.  He loves the smell and the feel of the soap.</li>
    <li> Funny and functional gift!</li>
    <li> This soap has a very nice smell to it, very unlike commercially sold soaps. The scent is very earthy. Worth a try, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into.</li>
    <li> Our son loves this. I didn&#x27;t know how popular this was. It seems like every one loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my hubby and he loves it. It is all natural, smells great, and lasts through quite a few washes. Want to buy more soon.</li>
    <li> Lots of fun for a gift, I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> I bought this soap looking for something that had a masculine scent and also cleaned well. The lather was very poor, and I have soft city water. The scent was... different. It was light, but also somewhat lemony. All in all, the scent was not as masculine as I would have hoped, and it reminded me of citronella. I ended up opening another brand of soap and don&#x27;t plan on using the remaining product.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and my father love this soap. I originally bought it as more of a gag gift, but they actually like it. They said it&#x27;s super &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; because it has &amp;#34;rocks and sticks&amp;#34; in it. Personally, it doesn&#x27;t sound very appealing, but they&#x27;re both fans!</li>
    <li> After a hard day of traipsing through the forest frustrating amateur photographers and scaring backpackers, a Sasquatch can get pretty dirty and smelly. Trust me. You don&#x27;t want to get near it until it has had a bath. Sasquatch soap takes care of the dirt and the smell without drying out the hair and skin. And it comes in a handy travel container! Perfect for loping along mountain crests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes an excellent stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> My Boy Scout loves this soap … perhaps he hopes it&#x27;ll bring Sasquatch closer to camp?</li>
    <li> Great! Was a great Gag gift for a hairy brother!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap, I have gotten it for a stocking stuffer 2 years in a row, he loves watching Bigfoot shows, and this is a cute gift.</li>
    <li> My wife watchers &amp;#34;Bigfoot Hunters&amp;#34; so I got her this as a gag gift. Not bad soap actually, but the scent is more manly.</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift for my brother; it&#x27;s now his favorite soap!!</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this soap. The scent is nice, not overly masculine or feminine, and it cleans without overdrying.</li>
    <li> I gifted this soap to my dad because I liked the drawing and thought I was being funny--turns out to be one of the best gifts I&#x27;ve ever given him! According to dad the smell is great, the container is decorative, and the soap suds up enough to be used not only to clean the body with but also for shaving. Anytime it is nearing the end he calls me up to &#x27;hint, hint&#x27; me that he wants another and the man is picky about his soaps. The last time I bought this I included 2-3 other Seattle Sundries soap and am waiting for the status on them but Sasquatch is a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out you can buy just the soap (no tin) on the maker&#x27;s website for about $5--10 were purchased. This continues to be a well loved soap!</li>
    <li> I have a family that loves everything about Sasquatch and this was a perfect gift for him. The soap actually has a really pleasant scent.  The tin it comes in makes a great keepsake.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gag gift and the recipient thought it was great! The soap itself turned out to be pretty cool as well. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for this shaving soap at all.  It was difficult to lather and I didn&#x27;t care for the scent</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift and it smells great!</li>
    <li> This was tucked into a gift basket as a gag gift but the recipient thoroughly enjoys the soap and the masculine but pleasant scent!</li>
    <li> Smells a bit like Murphy&#x27;s OIl Soap. It rinses clean with low to moderate lather. This soap is full of ground up walnut hulls which act as an mechanical exfoliant- but as they are fairly gritty, might be too rough for those with sensitive / thin skin.  I found the soap to generally be much less drying than most bar or deodorant soaps.  Comes in a reusable tin.  I&#x27;d call it a good novelty soap gift for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would actually use this soap indefinitely if it was somewhat more cost effective.</li>
