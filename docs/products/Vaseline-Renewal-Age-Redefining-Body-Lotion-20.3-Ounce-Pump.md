      <li>Amazing on the hands too.</li>
      <li>This the absolute best lotion.</li>

      <li>I love these products, but wish I could purchase them in stores.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>Thank goodness I am still able to get it through amazon, because I cannot find it in stores any longer.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>My wife likes the texture and aroma and feels her skin is better protected and the lotion is &#x27;age defying&#x27;.</li>

      <li>but I love the scent.</li>
      <li>mom loves how this lotion makes her skin feel and hasn&#x27;t been able to find anything like it.</li>
      <li>It does have an interesting smell.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff works.</li>
      <li>Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, and I admit it&#x27;s not my favorite either, but it fades after applied and doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.  </li>
      <li>Love this product</li>
      <li>Very rich, great smelling and absorbing.  </li>
      <li>Very rich and never oily.</li>
      <li>Since purchasing our first vaseline renewal lotion we have  been very satisfied with our purchase.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and far from overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products, and this IS the best.</li>
      <li>do not see any indication of SPF on my bottle, which is fine by me.</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal vaseline customer since 2008 when this product came out and can not believe they discontinued it!</li>
      <li>I use it everyday and my skin looks amazing !!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cost effective, one bottle lasts forever, and it really works.  </li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite beauty lotion.</li>
      <li>I stand under a ceiling fan on full blast when I apply it, to keep it from getting &#x27;goopie&#x27;.</li>
      <li>The smell dissipates quickly and absorbs well into my greasy skin.</li>
      <li>Most of them don&#x27;t live up to their hype.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is worth almost 10X what you pay for it.</li>
      <li>I purchased it (from a non-Amazon site) based on the previous good reviews.  </li>
      <li>The skin has also retained its original texture and has not taken on the sheen that is normal to some scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this lotion but noticed that I could no longer find it in my local stores.  </li>
      <li>i have been using this product for two plus years, and it does exactly what it claims</li>
      <li>This is not your average lotion---I love it and recommend it!</li>
      <li>I have a drawer full of products that claim to brighten, tighten and smooth my saggy skin, grow hair where it doesn&#x27;t grow anymore and get rid of hair that keeps sprouting from strange places.</li>
      <li>(Just as you need to do when using pure retinol.)</li>
      <li>It really helps soften my skin.</li>
      <li>One that has managed to form scar looks as light as scars I have had for the last 2 decades!!!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know where these bottles are actually coming from if Vaseline isn&#x27;t making this line anymore, but I will continue to order while it is available or maybe another product will come along to replace it.</li>
      <li>would recommend to anybody that wants to keep their face feeling and looking fresh and young AND without causing breakouts.</li>
      <li>And since I choose to lounge right next to the stove, I also catch pretty large oil droplets..</li>
      <li>I have used this for several years -  originally recommended by&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
      <li>I have all kinds of special moisturizers for various parts of my face and body-- undereyes, neck, feet,hands, fingernails,elbows (and va jay jay).</li>
      <li>I recently read that it was being discontinued, and I hope it isn&#x27;t true.</li>
      <li>If I put my nose right up to my skin I can barely smell it.</li>
      <li>I mainly use it on my arms, legs, and feet.</li>
      <li>i use the regular vaseline intensive care lotion on the rest of my body especially because i love the sun.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for many years and my skin is so soft and extremely firm!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any discernible wrinkles, only recently am I seeing a couple fine ones on my forehead.</li>
      <li>Brand new bottle - throwing it out..</li>
      <li>but I now live in a dryer desert like climate.</li>
      <li>makes my skin so soft and dead skill free!</li>
      <li>This is the Best Brand, to expensive, each time I order it is more expensive.</li>
      <li>Smells a little strong</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have a distinct smell that is characteristic of the AHA content.</li>
      <li>I have had it a couple months and used it multiple times trying to adjust to the odd overwhelming scent.  </li>
      <li>Of the three spots where the hot oil landed, two never took - never! - thanks to the lotion.</li>
      <li>My legs stay moisturized and feel smooth and soft all day (and night) and all the brown spots and little scars etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and seems to keep skin looking young.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t cause break outs, thoroughly hydrates all day, its not greasy, and really does keep skin youthful.  </li>
      <li>I am almost 60 and not amused with all the physical changes that come with getting older.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For background, I&#x27;m of South Indian origin and while my overall skin color is a light tan, I form quite dark scars that don&#x27;t blend with the rest of my skin color and hyper-pigmentation</li>
      <li>I am super sensitive to heavy fragrance.</li>
      <li>It lated a long time and was very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It is a new and different fragrance from what I am used to--</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m used to that smell due to the time I did with acne medications a few years ago :-)</li>
      <li>I use this after my Sheer Infusion lotion, and it gives my face an even toned, clear finish.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only lotion i use on my face. i use the regular vaseline intensive care lotion on the rest of my body especially because i love the sun. this lotion i save for my face and i think it does an excellent job. was upset that the Wal-Mart closest to me stopped selling it and if i wanted to get it locally i had to drive across town. i found it online today and with a flat shipping rate of $4.99 i purchased 5 bottles and can save the gas and aggravation of driving 25 minutes to pick it up. would recommend to anybody that wants to keep their face feeling and looking fresh and young AND without causing breakouts. *****[[ASIN:B001ECQ5F2 Vaseline Renewal Age Redefining Body Lotion, 20.3oz Pumps (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> So disappointed in this product.  I purchased it (from a non-Amazon site) based on the previous good reviews.  Well, this is the worst smelling mess I have ever used - trying to scrub it off of my hands now.  I cannot comment on how moisturizing it is, as I can&#x27;t get past the rotten cold cream smell...  Brand new bottle - throwing it out.. what a waste of money.  Would give 0 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Since purchasing our first vaseline renewal lotion we have  been very satisfied with our purchase.  The three bottle package we felt was a bargain and our   shipment was received in the promised time and in good order.  We will be continuing our use of the lotion for many years.  We are totally happy with our choice of product.[[ASIN:B001ECQ5F2 Vaseline Renewal Age Redefining Body Lotion, 20.3oz Pumps (Pack of 3)]]  Our purchase was through \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I grew up in a tropical climate but I now live in a dryer desert like climate. I generally have oily skin, but after being in the dry weather for a few years, it has managed to dry out certain areas of my skin creating dry patches. I generally like the vaseline brand but with their other lotions, unfortunately after a few hours my skin feels oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline Renewal is the only one that actually hydrates without my skin turning oily a few hours later. no more dryness no more oily skin. It works like magic!</li>
    <li> I use this after my Sheer Infusion lotion, and it gives my face an even toned, clear finish.  I love these products, but wish I could purchase them in stores.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion but noticed that I could no longer find it in my local stores.  Discovered that it has been discontinued by Vaseline, so I was very happy to find this 3 pack on Amazon.  Now I am set for a while!</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for two plus years, and it does exactly what it claims - my skin looks beautiful at the age of 47; nice and smooth.  And, it smells good!</li>
    <li> I use it for everything including my face since it has collagen and pro-retinol which is the same thing the much more expensive facial creams have and keeps my skin exfoliated.</li>
    <li> The Best!!! Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s been discontinued.  Very rich, great smelling and absorbing.  Amazing on the hands too.</li>
    <li> This is similar to a product that Neutrogena made briefly. I use it every night. It really helps soften my skin.</li>
    <li> Skin renewal at a fraction of the cost of some other products. It&#x27;s not too greasy and seems to keep skin looking young.</li>
    <li> Great lotion and I hope to order more to have on hand.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great!  I have been using it for many years and my skin is so soft and extremely firm!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> One of my favs.... :,(&lt;br /&gt; so sad discontinued it... So I stocked up! The one lotion that will slop off all that dead skin from your heels and elbows. All that peeling from a dry winter will disappear in a day or two if you apply a few times throughout the day. Smells a little strong but I love the scent. Typical aha scent I think. Kind like the alba botanical maximum but, def stronger. Exfoliates and moisturizes. bring it back vaseline.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff works. Great!!</li>
    <li> I believe it helps my skin from looking like crepe paper arms, and fades brown spots on arms and hands. I feel it helps in the battle of age related problems.</li>
    <li> Vaseline no longer offers this item in stores, at least not in my area, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom loves how this lotion makes her skin feel and hasn&#x27;t been able to find anything like it. I kept 1 bottle and gave the other 2 to her</li>
    <li> This should be called death and despair because that is how it makes me feel. I am not sure if this product works or not but I will not be using it anymore. It seriously smells like garbage decomposing after a rainstorm. Worst smell ever. Makes me gag.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Thank goodness I am still able to get it through amazon, because I cannot find it in stores any longer.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body lotion !!!  I use it everyday and my skin looks amazing !!!  It&#x27;s definitely a must have for me !!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that many stores do not carry. It lated a long time and was very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is the worst smelling lotion ever!!!  I have had it a couple months and used it multiple times trying to adjust to the odd overwhelming scent.  I am done trying....I am throwing the entire bottle away.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is the Best Brand, to expensive, each time I order it is more expensive. Love this product it is hard to find, I&lt;br /&gt; guess it is discontinued, unable to find it at drug stores now.  Yvonne</li>
    <li> This the absolute best lotion. Very rich and never oily. It is great for every part of  your body. I&#x27;ve even used it as a face lotion.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping!!!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I am super sensitive to heavy fragrance. This is tolerable--the AHA&#x27;s are the \\&quot;rotten\\&quot; smell, as they all smell that way. The smell dissipates quickly and absorbs well into my greasy skin. I mainly use it on my arms, legs, and feet. The ingredients show lactic acid (AHA) and retinol--for cellular renewal (age spots, sun damage...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not see any indication of SPF on my bottle, which is fine by me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the lotion for years and notice a big difference in the complexion and feel of my skin. I don&#x27;t know how much younger it makes my skin look but I get compliments on how I don&#x27;t look my age.</li>
    <li> Bought it for scar reduction..... all over. Bought the 3-pack deal. So two bottles are in the refrigerator now. They will last well that way.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have wrinkles so can&#x27;t review about that. Although the science is valid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My evidence that the product works is what it did to a recently acquired scar. I burn myself often while cooking and all from oil that splatters. And since I choose to lounge right next to the stove, I also catch pretty large oil droplets..ouch! I don&#x27;t remember the last time I saw my forearm without scars :-)&lt;br /&gt;For background, I&#x27;m of South Indian origin and while my overall skin color is a light tan, I form quite dark scars that don&#x27;t blend with the rest of my skin color and hyper-pigmentation joins the party all the time. Once scars form it takes a very long time for them to disappear on me.&lt;br /&gt;After I pretreated the oil burn immediately with cold water, I applied the cream and have been doing so every morning after shower. Of the three spots where the hot oil landed, two never took - never! - thanks to the lotion. One that has managed to form scar looks as light as scars I have had for the last 2 decades!!!! No kidding. And only if I looked for it. The skin has also retained its original texture and has not taken on the sheen that is normal to some scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m sold on this lotion. I hope my decades-old scars will also gradually disappear with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it in the height of Summer. In summer, if used sparingly, it will not feel sticky. I stand under a ceiling fan on full blast when I apply it, to keep it from getting &#x27;goopie&#x27;. I guess that will not be a problem during cooler months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a distinct smell that is characteristic of the AHA content. But I&#x27;m used to that smell due to the time I did with acne medications a few years ago :-) So it does not bother me at all. It doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and be patient. You might like it. This is a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find this product in stores.  I have used this product for years and have not found anything to come close to it for the price.  I ordered this from Amazon a few months ago.  I have since run out and I tried another product off the shelf and believe me, nothing compares to this product.  I don&#x27;t know where these bottles are actually coming from if Vaseline isn&#x27;t making this line anymore, but I will continue to order while it is available or maybe another product will come along to replace it.</li>
    <li> I am almost 60 and not amused with all the physical changes that come with getting older. I have a drawer full of products that claim to brighten, tighten and smooth my saggy skin, grow hair where it doesn&#x27;t grow anymore and get rid of hair that keeps sprouting from strange places. I have all kinds of special moisturizers for various parts of my face and body-- undereyes, neck, feet,hands, fingernails,elbows (and va jay jay). Some work, some don&#x27;t. Most of them don&#x27;t live up to their hype.&lt;br /&gt; My latest area of concern has been my legs...My \\&quot;old dried out lizard skin and covered with brown age spots\\&quot; legs. None of my lotions and creams seemed to penetrate enough to get rid of the dryness and scaliness...even after I used exfoliating scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using the Vaseline Body Lotion for a few days and I am shocked at what a difference it has made. My legs stay moisturized and feel smooth and soft all day (and night) and all the brown spots and little scars etc. from sun damage  already are less noticeable. I have started using it on my arms,chest and neck now.&lt;br /&gt;Several of the reviewers gave this lotion low ratings because of the smell. It does have an interesting smell. If you don&#x27;t use a boatload of it, the smell diminishes after a few minutes.I just put ALOT of it on about an hour ago. If I put my nose right up to my skin I can barely smell it. It is a new and different fragrance from what I am used to--but I don&#x27;t find it offensive,especially since it works! The lotion has lactic acid, and alpha hydroxy acid in it and also something called called retinyl palmitate (I&#x27;ll have to look that one up...Maybe it a weak form of retinol? Not sure.) I know lactic acid and AHA do a great job of exfoliating the top layer of skin so that products can penetrate better. There is also a warning to be sure to wear a sunscreen when using this. (Just as you need to do when using pure retinol.) This is not your average lotion---I love it and recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very good! I have used this for several years -  originally recommended by&lt;br /&gt;my Dermatologist.</li>
    <li> If you tend to have flaky skin nothing beats this lotion for getting rid of it. I&#x27;ve tried other products, and this IS the best. I recently read that it was being discontinued, and I hope it isn&#x27;t true. In any case, I bought a package of three just in case. It should tide me over for awhile. Vaseline company, if you are reading, I will be p---ed if this disappears, as will many others.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite beauty lotion. It contains very high quality ingredients and less parabens than other body lotions. This product is worth almost 10X what you pay for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my face and body for about the last 10 years.  It&#x27;s the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t cause break outs, thoroughly hydrates all day, its not greasy, and really does keep skin youthful.  I am often asked what I use, and if I ever had Botox (I have NOT) bc I don&#x27;t have any discernible wrinkles, only recently am I seeing a couple fine ones on my forehead. Its so simple that all I use is this Vaseline Renewal lotion! It&#x27;s so cost effective, one bottle lasts forever, and it really works.  Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, and I admit it&#x27;s not my favorite either, but it fades after applied and doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.  I can&#x27;t believe this has been discontinued by Vaseline and their new line of lotions all have awful ingredients that are Comediogenic.  So I bought a few bottles of this stuff and I hope I can use it before it expires.  Because this has an AHA in it, it won&#x27;t last forever.  Then I have to find a new moisturizer which is very disappointing!  Wish they had not discontinued this line, it is wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed. This is a good product. I&#x27;ve been mixing it with AmLactin. Good combo. Guess I&#x27;ll have to find the Vaseline lotion elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Product is the best but the seller Your Dream Store overpriced 3 for $75.00</li>
    <li> My usual lotion is Vaseline Firming, but since it is so hard to find decided to try this. Definitely not a good substitute. This is reason for my rating.</li>
    <li> luv it&lt;br /&gt;does what it says and is not sticky!</li>
    <li> I love it. But it&#x27;s getting too expensive. i am going to have to find an alternative</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used for such a good price! I am so glad I found it here! I have been a loyal vaseline customer since 2008 when this product came out and can not believe they discontinued it! So happy with this lotion makes my skin so soft and dead skill free! I love it! Buy it while you can!</li>
    <li> This is a homerun for Vaseline and it is truly unfortunate that it is not widely available in stores. It has a wonderful creamy, nurturing texture, but doesn&#x27;t feel in the lease bit greasy once it is on your skin. The smell is pleasant and far from overwhelming.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the texture and aroma and feels her skin is better protected and the lotion is &#x27;age defying&#x27;.</li>
