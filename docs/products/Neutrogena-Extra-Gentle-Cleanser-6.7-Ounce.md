      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>If you purchase more than one than the price is discounted more.</li>

      <li>, anyway I was looking for a good cleanser and thissssss got rid of it completely, even the scaring</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this very gentle Neutrogena cleanser for many years.  </li>
      <li>This product is one of Paula&#x27;s Picks for an overall excellent product, so I decided to try it when I needed to pick up a new cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And my face was clean with</li>
      <li>I am so happy for Neutrogena creating gentle moisturizing cleansers too for sensitive skins like mine.</li>
      <li>so i feel it cannot really clean my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad amazon has started to carry it at a good price because it has become harder to find in stores.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great for my very dry skin.</li>
      <li>Perfect cleanser for daily use as it leaves you skin soft, moisturized, clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>I was so happy with how soft it made my skin that I went back and bought 3 more bottles of it.</li>
      <li>Overall good.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser is a great fragrance and soap free product.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin in the colder months and this is a great before bed cleaner, compared to my not so sensitive morning cleaner.  </li>
      <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;great for teen acne, no harmful additives or strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;Convienent with subscribe and save, and the cost is comparable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It feels like lotion on my skin but does the job to remove the makeup at night and leave me with a fresh palette in the morning.  </li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive to most preservatives and stabilizing agents.</li>
      <li>I have very beautiful smooth, radiant skin that people always complement me on, and for fifteen years from my late teens I used a natural avocado-based product called Avodeau.</li>
      <li>It may or may not work for you, but it&#x27;s certainly worth a shot.</li>
      <li>Maybe a bit pricey but surely worth the money.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s that gentle, yet it leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>After struggling to get a suitable replacement I stumbled on the Neutrogena products and my skin went back to what it has always been.  </li>
      <li>I know that Neutrogena makes a great line of products, but for facial cleanser I presently prefer Cetaphil.</li>
      <li>My two teenager daughters love washing with this each night as it is not harsh on their faces and works very well for acne.</li>
      <li>It feels very gentle when I use it.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this cleanser months ago.</li>
      <li>This is not my first time using this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I finally decided to try this cleanser and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Remember, this is a gentle cleanser!  </li>
      <li>I bought this to reach my goal purchase for free shipping and was pleasantly surprised to find how well it worked.</li>
      <li>Even within the Neutrogena range I cannot use anything else, it has to be the Extra Gentle Cleanser, the Alcohol free gentle Toner, the Light Night Cream and the Intensified Day Moisture Cream.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and non irritating and the best thing is that it can also be tissued off - no worrying about rinsing it off completely.</li>
      <li>and whenever I stray from Neutrogena extra gentle I&#x27;m sure to break out.  </li>
      <li>I generally use a wash cloth or face sponge (lightly) with this product, which helps take off waterproof makeup.      </li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re allergic to any of the ingredients, I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a very gentle cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The extra gentle cleanser is very gentle, but it doesn&#x27;t clean very well</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I wanted to try a gentle cleaner out for a change.</li>
      <li>Its reasonable price is a plus too.</li>
      <li>but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It is really gentle.</li>
      <li>My face feels clean, but it does not dry out my face.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth trying, though, if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It even removes waterproof mascara and is just as gentle as promised.</li>
      <li>I think I have normal skin, but most cleansers dry out my face</li>
      <li>No strong smells and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I like that it is gentle but actually does clean your pores.  </li>
      <li>Extra Gentle Neutragena is just that and inexpensive and you barely have to moisturizer afterwards :)</li>
      <li>Dry, sensitive and inflamed with Rosacea, it is intolerant of most cleansers.</li>
      <li>soooo mild and moisturizing  especially in a desert climate or in the wintery midwest this is a godsend.  </li>
      <li>I was reading the reviews and noticed that most are actually for a different neutrogena product.</li>
      <li>I have very sensative skin and have tried pretty much every facial wash (drug store, spa, department store brands).</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>have very sensitive skin, and this did burn slightly the first time I used it, but, since then, it has been fine.  </li>
      <li>I like the cleanser, however my preference lies with something that has a little more sudsy feel to it.</li>
      <li>I am 48 years old and people think im not a day older than 30!</li>
      <li>I have delicate skin and am allergic to so many products, but this products works well, and as the name states, it very gentle.  </li>
      <li>Just massage onto the face without water for a while then gently rinse off, you will have a well cleaned yet soft face.</li>
      <li>If your skin is just sensitive to fragrance, try the Oil-Free Moisture in SPF 15 (or 35), especially when going outside, both are fragrance free!</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY cleanser I used that doesn&#x27;t dry skin out, it adds moisture and my face feels very clean after using.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The benzoyl peroxide makes my skin flaky and dry but this clears that off and keeps my skin looking fresh and moisturized.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is very good for sensitive and oily skin. It mositurizes as it cleans and doesnt strip your face or cause a red chemical rash afterwards. My skin was so happy a week after washing with this and moisturizing with the neutrogena oil free moisture.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser is a great fragrance and soap free product.  I agree with another reviewer that it does not necessarily wash make-up off well, especially around the eyes when used as a normal cleanser per the instructions.  I generally use a wash cloth or face sponge (lightly) with this product, which helps take off waterproof makeup.      Remember, this is a gentle cleanser!  I&#x27;m not sure many facial cleansers would remove makeup without a little friction unless they were specifically designed to remove make up.  To remove makeup without scrubbing, try as a tissue off cleanser.    If your skin is really sensitive to a lot of things, follow up this facewash with Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture for Sensitive Skin.  If your skin is just sensitive to fragrance, try the Oil-Free Moisture in SPF 15 (or 35), especially when going outside, both are fragrance free!</li>
    <li> I was reading the reviews and noticed that most are actually for a different neutrogena product. The extra gentle cleanser is very gentle, but it doesn&#x27;t clean very well, I use it before swimming and noticed, after leaving the pool, that i still had big mascara stains under my eyes. I am still looking for a good cleanser for dry/sensitive skin that foams and that I can use with water. This is not the one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.It&#x27;s very gentle and non irritating and the best thing is that it can also be tissued off - no worrying about rinsing it off completely.</li>
    <li> When choosing skin care products, I usually follow the recommendations from [[ASIN:0553383302 The Skin Type Solution]] or Paula Begoun&#x27;s [[ASIN:1877988340 Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me (Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)]]. This product is one of Paula&#x27;s Picks for an overall excellent product, so I decided to try it when I needed to pick up a new cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, and this did burn slightly the first time I used it, but, since then, it has been fine.  It also works great with a Clarisonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since, as of my writing this review, Amazon isn&#x27;t including the ingredients list for this product, I wanted to include them here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Ricinoleate, Isohexadecane, TEA-Cocoyl Glutamate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PEG-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Bisabolol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, BHT, Geranium Maculatum Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great cleanser for the price, but I just wish that it were free of parabens.  It&#x27;s worth trying, though, if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried a number of cleansers like this one (Cetaphil, Ponds cold cream, Boots cleansing lotion, etc.) and this one seems to work the best. It takes make up off well and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a &#x27;filmy&#x27; feeling if you just wipe off.  If you do rinse with water, it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a tight, squeeky-clean feeling. It really does leave your skin feeling moisturized and yet cleanses enough to get rid of the dirt and make-up!  I&#x27;m very happy with this cleanser and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser, for once my cheeks didn&#x27;t burn after using something, and it made them feel very good, plus it took my makeup off effectively which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Super mild, no fragrance, perfect for sensitive skin or people who don&#x27;t like super astringent cleaners. No microderm abrasion beads or whatever, just a plain white cleansing soap.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8 years now, and really love that I can do the Subscribe &amp; Save for this product on Amazon.  If facial cleansers tend to dry your skin out, I would recommend going with this as it will not dry out your skin, but it still cleans the oil out.</li>
    <li> This product is going in the trash.  It is almost like a cold cream and doesn&#x27;t even wash off a water based mascara.  Partway through the day my face became so greasy it was affecting my vision - a greasy film transferring from my face to my eyes. Yuck!!</li>
    <li> This product cleans great and it does a great job  moisturizing too.  I have sensitive skin and have not had any trouble since using this for over a week.  I also noticed my face looked softer and had less fine lines, and it is not red at all.  I plan on using this forever and I hope Neurtogena does not discontinue this product as some suspect they may/are.</li>
    <li> I have very sensative skin and have tried pretty much every facial wash (drug store, spa, department store brands). My favorite (very expensive) facial wash was discontinued, so I was back on the hunt. I finally decided to try this cleanser and LOVE it. Does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts. Cleans, but doesn&#x27;t strip moisture. Give this one a try!</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get used to the fact that there were no suds.  It did not take long to notice that, even if my face was a little red before I started to wash, it was calmer afterward.  And my face was clean with no noticeable tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am running through the bottle a little faster than I like, probably because I keep trying for the soap suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works beautifully with a Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and whenever I stray from Neutrogena extra gentle I&#x27;m sure to break out.  It feels like lotion on my skin but does the job to remove the makeup at night and leave me with a fresh palette in the morning.  I&#x27;m so glad amazon has started to carry it at a good price because it has become harder to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Just to preface this, I am in my mid-20s and I have combination, acne-prone skin that gets dry from acne medication. The purpose of this cleanser is to cleanse your skin in a very basic and non-obstructive way. It will not effectively remove makeup, so don&#x27;t expect it to. I only used it when I was bare-faced or during the mornings when I just woke up. With that said, it never left my skin feeling remotely cleaner. In fact, I felt cleaner when I simply washed my face with water. It left a thin residue on my skin, which I believe is for moisturizing purposes, but I never felt as though it did much.I stopped using it within two months. It&#x27;s sitting in my closet now. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Not very good for removing makeup, but easy to rinse off and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like all foaming cleansers do.</li>
    <li> This does as is advertised.  I use to use Avena lotion but that product was discontinued.  This seems to work just as well as the Avena product.</li>
    <li> Perfect cleanser for daily use as it leaves you skin soft, moisturized, clean and fresh. Would certainly recommend as a daily cleanser</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this non-soap facial cleanser by a friend after a dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation to stop using soap.  It not only cleans, but has transformed my shaving.  Foam or shaving cream is no longer needed; not a nick with blade shaving. The push-top dispenser is not convenient for travel, but I transfer some of the product to a 1-ounce travel dispenser with a screw-top.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this cleanser months ago. I bought only 1 bottle at the time, wanted to know how well it worked. I was so happy with how soft it made my skin that I went back and bought 3 more bottles of it. If you work outside or have dry skin you should really try this Neutrogena product.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally for my children to use and I was happy with how it cleaned their faces, so I decided to use it and turned out to be a great daily cleanser.  I like that it is gentle but actually does clean your pores.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> What the heck? I swear I had to read the label twice. It comes out smelling plastic-y with no lather. Did I buy Extra Gentle Lotion or what? No... label says cleanser..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really not sure if this thing helps moisturize my face. I don&#x27;t think it hurts it either... Meh.</li>
    <li> I bought this to reach my goal purchase for free shipping and was pleasantly surprised to find how well it worked. It even removes waterproof mascara and is just as gentle as promised. Maybe a bit pricey but surely worth the money.</li>
    <li> It is unfair to rate this product because I believe it may have been frozen solid as the package waited on my doorstep for a day or two in Minnesota. I know that Neutrogena makes a great line of products, but for facial cleanser I presently prefer Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> This is not my first time using this cleanser. I stopped using it for a while because it&#x27;s not strong enough in summer. However, in winter, it works perfectly. Just massage onto the face without water for a while then gently rinse off, you will have a well cleaned yet soft face. It doesn&#x27;t have any artificial fragrance, which is another reason why I like it so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this very gentle Neutrogena cleanser for many years.  I&#x27;m over 50 now and it&#x27;s great for my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding face wash that doesn&#x27;t either dry out my skin or make it greasy. This product is absolutely perfect! It moisturizes and still cleans. I love it, great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s perfect for my very very sensitive skin! I definitively recommend. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> It feels very gentle when I use it. But my face do not feel as clean as I used to feel with other facial cleanser. Overall good.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a foaming, soap-like cleanser, this is not for you. But if you need a cream cleanser that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy or stripped, this could just be the ticket. I started using this cleanser many years ago, and have been faithful to it ever since. Oh, I&#x27;ve dabbled with other cleansers - some very pricey ones, in fact - but they always disappointed. They made my skin feel as if I&#x27;d just gone through an acid bath, or they were so perfumey I had to wash my face again to get the stink off, or they weren&#x27;t capable of removing so much as blush, much less mascara. Neutrogena Extra Gentle is just what it says: extra gentle. No worries about taking off eye makeup with it, it&#x27;s that gentle, yet it leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean. When my local grocery store stopped carrying it, I was devastated. So when I found it on Amazon, I did a happy dance. I now have a subscription for it and automatically receive a bottle every two months, which is about how long it takes for me to go through one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great cleanser at a fantastic price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!</li>
    <li> This was recommended in a women&#x27;s magazine so I thought I would try it.  I do like the way it feels on my skin and I am interested in seeing how it works over the long term.  As stated, I don&#x27;t love the scent but it&#x27;s not so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t use it, just wished it smelled better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. it is kind of too gentle for me. so i feel it cannot really clean my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried almost every product from neutrogena and this is by far the best. This is the ONLY cleanser I used that doesn&#x27;t dry skin out, it adds moisture and my face feels very clean after using. I been suffering from acne and my dr recently prescribe clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide, I use the medication along with this. best ever!</li>
    <li> Perfect! It is really gentle. No strong smells and easy to clean. Maybe buying a bigger one next time then.</li>
    <li> Face cleansers can be harsh and expensive. Extra Gentle Neutragena is just that and inexpensive and you barely have to moisturizer afterwards :)</li>
    <li> I thought this products was going to do well But this product did not get all of my make up off and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin. My skin gets really dry after washing my face and I was hoping this product would help but it really didn&#x27;t. I feel as though I&#x27;ve wasted money on this product. I will not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;great for teen acne, no harmful additives or strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;Convienent with subscribe and save, and the cost is comparable.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend it and will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> For me, this product doesn&#x27;t work for removing makeup (I use Bare Minerals and Waterproof Mascara). However, I like to use this product after washing first with a scrubbing foaming cleanser which removes my makeup but often leaves my skin dry. The Neutrogena Extra Gentle will then make my face less stiff and dry and provides a better base for applying makeup. (Dry skin and makeup are not a good combination!)</li>
    <li> I have delicate skin and am allergic to so many products, but this products works well, and as the name states, it very gentle.  The price is good too.</li>
    <li> So many things that are labeled &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; irritate my skin but not this - I&#x27;ve bought this over and over again.  Nothing comes close to replacing for me at least.</li>
    <li> Facial skin is extremely sensitive to chemicals. My skin is sensitive to most preservatives and stabilizing agents. I use this everyday and experience no allergic reactions, no red rashes and no dry skin patches. Its reasonable price is a plus too.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially in the winter.  I love this facewash!  Very subtle smell, if anything.  My face feels clean, but it does not dry out my face.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is often hard to find in local pharmacies. My two teenager daughters love washing with this each night as it is not harsh on their faces and works very well for acne.</li>
    <li> Extra gentle is an understatement. I believe it&#x27;s dye and fragerance free, but it won&#x27;t remove even a trace of make up from my face (and I use very little makeup). Its not even a good moisturizer. I tried it for my son&#x27;s eczema inflammed skin, but it wasn&#x27;t sufficient to bathe him. Not happy with this product at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try a gentle cleaner out for a change. I like the cleanser, however my preference lies with something that has a little more sudsy feel to it. But overall I would recommend this to people with highly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> soooo mild and moisturizing  especially in a desert climate or in the wintery midwest this is a godsend.  no lather  but no super tight face either</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me. It is basically a lotion. This did not wash my face or moisturize it. It is not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I think I have normal skin, but most cleansers dry out my face so I look for ones for sensitive skin. This one does the trick. I also like that I can use this as a makeup remover and just wipe off.</li>
    <li> I always come back to this cleanser because its so gentle for my face. I love how its creamy and lightweight, yet cleans my face thoroughly removing dirt and makeup as well. Neutrogena cleansers have always been in whatever regime I do, I cant use any other brands cleanser because they always either irritate my skin or break me out. I am so happy for Neutrogena creating gentle moisturizing cleansers too for sensitive skins like mine. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser, very gentle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 or 4 bottles of this product and it works for me, as it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this in the mornings after using benzoyl peroxide at night for acne. The benzoyl peroxide makes my skin flaky and dry but this clears that off and keeps my skin looking fresh and moisturized. I use a lotion after rinsing this off, but if you don&#x27;t have dry skin you may not need to. It has a similar feeling to Cetaphil but it&#x27;s a little creamier and thicker, sort of like cold cream, but not greasy. You can even use this as a non-rinse cleanser-just wipe it off with a tissue or towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is unscented but I don&#x27;t like that it has parabens. It&#x27;s non-comedogenic and doesn&#x27;t seem to give my skin any troubles unless it&#x27;s already raw and irritated (even then it just burns a little bit while it&#x27;s on). Unless you&#x27;re allergic to any of the ingredients, I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a very gentle cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Capric/Caprylic Stearic Triglyceride, Cetyl Ricinoleate, Isohexadecane, TEA Cocoyl Glutamate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PEG 20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Bisabolol (L-Alpha), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root), Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, BHT, Geranium, Dipropylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my only complaints are that it has parabens and that it dries up in the pump nozzle. I&#x27;ll overlook theses little things and give it five stars because it works so well.</li>
    <li> I have very beautiful smooth, radiant skin that people always complement me on, and for fifteen years from my late teens I used a natural avocado-based product called Avodeau. The company closed down  around 1990 and I could not get the product. After struggling to get a suitable replacement I stumbled on the Neutrogena products and my skin went back to what it has always been.  I think my skin is classified as normal to dry and I cannot use any facial wash as these always make my skin dry and tight.  Even within the Neutrogena range I cannot use anything else, it has to be the Extra Gentle Cleanser, the Alcohol free gentle Toner, the Light Night Cream and the Intensified Day Moisture Cream. I am 48 years old and people think im not a day older than 30!</li>
    <li> I took away 1 star because I wish this cleanser lathered.  This is a very dense and creamy cleanser and does not lather, it has little to no scent and is very gentle.  I have sensitive skin in the colder months and this is a great before bed cleaner, compared to my not so sensitive morning cleaner.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Treating my skin as if it were a piece of fine silk (chortle) has been a challenge. Dry, sensitive and inflamed with Rosacea, it is intolerant of most cleansers. Needless to say, I was pleased to find out that this cleanser lives up to its deceptively simple name. It doesn&#x27;t further dry out or irritate my skin and still leaves it clean. That it is inexpensive is also a very big plus. It may or may not work for you, but it&#x27;s certainly worth a shot.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so this is a great product.  You cannot beat the price for this!!  If you purchase more than one than the price is discounted more.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this face cleanser is nothing more than moisturizing lotion.  I would highly recommend &#x27;Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Foaming Cleanser, Fragrance-Free&#x27; instead.</li>
    <li> I recently got a bad infectious rash (bump like pimples, which is diagnosed to never go away without serious treatment) but I eat healthy so it never looked bad like the picture I see on google, anyway I was looking for a good cleanser and thissssss got rid of it completely, even the scaring and I occasionally got a pimple or so and I don&#x27;t get them anymore...yay I&#x27;m happy.</li>
