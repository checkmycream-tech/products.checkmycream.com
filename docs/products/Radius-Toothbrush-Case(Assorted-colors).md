### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great purchase!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad to have this and think it will be great to travel with!  </li>
      <li>so I was happy about that too.</li>
      <li>works great even until now.</li>
      <li>The product is great along with the solar powered company.</li>
      <li>Great case.  </li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>Great toothbrush holder.  </li>
      <li>It.s very nice to put the toothbrush in</li>
      <li>I ordered it anyways and was happy to see that it was in fact a Radius case, and it fit my toothbrush perfectly!  </li>
      <li>This fit my radius toothbrush perfect.</li>
      <li>BEST IDEA, hold on to the case that the ORIGINAL Radius toothbrush came in.  </li>
      <li>Nice product.  </li>
      <li>Toothbrush fits nicely but I didn&#x27;t get the option of choosing the color.</li>
      <li>Most toothbrush holders, in my area anyway, do not accommodate the taller toothbrushes of today.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>This case will NOT work if you own the Original Radius Toothbrush with the curved handle and the angled head.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my toothbrush fresh!!</li>
      <li>Its roomy and cute, easy to use.</li>
      <li>Works great and provides a nice clean and dry tooth brush.</li>
      <li>Works fine to protect toothbrush when travelling.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit the radius SCUBA.</li>
      <li>It wont even fit inside, nor will it come close to closing.  </li>
      <li>Quick, easy.</li>
      <li>It keeps my tooth brush clean and bugs from crawling on it.</li>
      <li>I clean it every now and then with dish-washing soap and water</li>
      <li>Best toothbrush holder I&#x27;ve had so far, so I would definitely buy this one again if need be ^_^.</li>
      <li>This may say it&#x27;s for a Radius toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not for the most popular wide end one, the correct one is available on Amazon, but make sure you read the description very carefully to avoid a hassle.</li>
      <li>I think any size toothbrush would fit in here (except electric or very odd sized), and the product is of good quality.  </li>
      <li>Up until this point, I&#x27;ve been putting my toothbrush into a plastic bag since the Radius toothbrush won&#x27;t fit into a normal toothbrush holder.  </li>
      <li>If you travel a lot, as I do, size is really important and these products would take up much too large a space in a suitcase.</li>
      <li>You present the product as assorted colors leading us to believe more than 1 for the price.</li>
      <li>and it is easy to clean because of the material it is made out of (although sometimes I had to use a toothpick to clean the narrow groove between the clasp and the body of the toothbrush holder).</li>
      <li>love the holder - it took way too long to deliver</li>
      <li>Very sturdy construction.</li>
      <li>4.98 for 1 is too much.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not broken.</li>
      <li>The shipment came fast, and now I keep my tooth brush in it all the time.</li>
      <li>It has vents to let moisture out but keeps everything from coming in, I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>it still looks new.</li>
      <li>Love that it has two small &amp;#34;breathe holes&amp;#34; in it.</li>
      <li>It is large with large air vents to dry the brush after use.  </li>
      <li>The only problem with these is the lack of air holes to let your toothbrush dry after use and storage, which is relatively easily remedied by simply poking holes into the plastic with a hot piece of metal such as a safety pin or a paper clip.</li>
      <li>In addition, the items were far from waterproof, another criteria factor for travel.</li>
      <li>Advertised as specifically appropriate for the Radius toothbrush, which is thick and angled, requiring a non-standard toothbrush case.  </li>
      <li>Sturdy and contrary to what other reviewers have expressed the perfect size for your average toothbrush, any smaller and my standard run of the mill toothbrush would not fit.</li>
      <li>The case is large enough, and stury enough for a regular STRAIGHT toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Not hard at all to open and close the toothbrush holder and the clasp and hinge</li>
      <li>Will buy in the future direct from the company.</li>
      <li>It is neither broad enough nor does it accomodate the angled head.  </li>
      <li>Price is kinda high but not that bad for a nice case.</li>

    <li> When I opened the package from Amazon containing the toothbrush holder and other plastic travel items (soap box and razor holder) from Radius, I was shocked to see how large they were. If you travel a lot, as I do, size is really important and these products would take up much too large a space in a suitcase. In addition, the items were far from waterproof, another criteria factor for travel.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and contrary to what other reviewers have expressed the perfect size for your average toothbrush, any smaller and my standard run of the mill toothbrush would not fit. The only problem with these is the lack of air holes to let your toothbrush dry after use and storage, which is relatively easily remedied by simply poking holes into the plastic with a hot piece of metal such as a safety pin or a paper clip.</li>
    <li> love the holder - it took way too long to deliver</li>
    <li> It fits the oversized toothbrushes. It can be sterilized in the dishwasher after traveling.</li>
    <li> bought this a long time ago. it still looks new. but from time to time it gets a dirty gunk in it, even though i keep my toothbrush clean.</li>
    <li> The shipment came fast, and now I keep my tooth brush in it all the time. It keeps my tooth brush clean and bugs from crawling on it. It has vents to let moisture out but keeps everything from coming in, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was a bit concerned that this wasn&#x27;t actually a Radius toothbrush case.  I ordered it anyways and was happy to see that it was in fact a Radius case, and it fit my toothbrush perfectly!  Up until this point, I&#x27;ve been putting my toothbrush into a plastic bag since the Radius toothbrush won&#x27;t fit into a normal toothbrush holder.  I&#x27;m very glad to have this and think it will be great to travel with!  It came in a neutral color so I was happy about that too.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush fits nicely but I didn&#x27;t get the option of choosing the color. I received a pink case and was upset because I&#x27;m a guy!</li>
    <li> It.s very nice to put the toothbrush in that I use everyday.</li>
    <li> This may say it&#x27;s for a Radius toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not for the most popular wide end one, the correct one is available on Amazon, but make sure you read the description very carefully to avoid a hassle. I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t just make one universal size and fix the problem, but they don&#x27;t. Caveat emptor!</li>
    <li> Purchased this in September of 2012 and it is now January 2014 that I write this review (I got the clear case, although I wouldn&#x27;t mind to have gotten any other random color). I&#x27;ve been using it to store my toothbrushes ever since I&#x27;ve purchased this case and it&#x27;s not broken. I clean it every now and then with dish-washing soap and water and it is easy to clean because of the material it is made out of (although sometimes I had to use a toothpick to clean the narrow groove between the clasp and the body of the toothbrush holder). Not hard at all to open and close the toothbrush holder and the clasp and hinge works great even until now. It fits the Oral B toothbrushes or Colgate toothbrushes that I change every month (It&#x27;s about 8 and 1/4 inches in length, the widest part is 1 and 1/2 inches, and the height is a little less than an inch. Best toothbrush holder I&#x27;ve had so far, so I would definitely buy this one again if need be ^_^.</li>
    <li> The product is great along with the solar powered company. You present the product as assorted colors leading us to believe more than 1 for the price. 4.98 for 1 is too much. You don&#x27;t even give a choice for color. Will buy in the future direct from the company. Go Radius!!!</li>
    <li> This fit my radius toothbrush perfect. Love that it has two small &amp;#34;breathe holes&amp;#34; in it. Small enough that nothings getting in while in drawer but efficient at helping control moisture on the inside so I don&#x27;t have to worry about mildew on my brush</li>
    <li> Keeps my toothbrush fresh!!</li>
    <li> It needed to have a vent to prevent the moldy smell.</li>
    <li> Works fine to protect toothbrush when travelling. I just throw the plastic case in my suitcase or overnight bag! Quick, easy.</li>
    <li> I love this. It works great. The pull over lock stay closed at all times. I would buy this again in the future.</li>
    <li> The case really does not fit a radius tooth brush--it is too small for a regular radius brush.  thought it would be the answer for travel--it is not.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush holder.  Lays flat when open and toothbrush can dry without being enclosed in the case. Very sturdy construction.</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars because it doesn&#x27;t have any holes in it to allow the toothbrush to dry. Other than that, it holds the toothbrush, opens and closes with no problems. I guess I can add a few holes using a heated safety pin as one person mentioned in another review.</li>
    <li> Did not fit my Radius Toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Dimensions are incorrect.</li>
    <li> Advertised as specifically appropriate for the Radius toothbrush, which is thick and angled, requiring a non-standard toothbrush case.  It is neither broad enough nor does it accomodate the angled head.  It is durable, but not useful for regular toothbrushes as the clasp is too difficult to undo, and the hinge appears unlikely to last more than a very few uses. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I keep my toothbrush in this container all the time.  It is large with large air vents to dry the brush after use.  When I finish with the brush, I can put it in the container without worry of any mildew or fungus buildup.  I keep my toothbrush in the container and the container in the cabinet to avoid any bathroom bacteria.  Works great and provides a nice clean and dry tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Its roomy and cute, easy to use. I would recommend this case. Price is kinda high but not that bad for a nice case.</li>
    <li> The case is large enough, and stury enough for a regular STRAIGHT toothbrush.  BUT, the POINT of buying a RADIUS toothbrush case, IS TO HOLD an RADIUS TOOTHBRUSH.  This case will NOT work if you own the Original Radius Toothbrush with the curved handle and the angled head.  It wont even fit inside, nor will it come close to closing.  BEST IDEA, hold on to the case that the ORIGINAL Radius toothbrush came in.  That&#x27;s probably the ONLY thing DESIGNED to hold this specific toothbrush, or the other angled ones.  Will keep searching or just tape the broken hinge on the case it came in.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit the radius SCUBA. Not happy. Not worth returning. Don&#x27;t buy this for a RAIDUS SCUBA.</li>
    <li> Great case.  Will last forever.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I am a tooth brushing fanatic and have to have a toothbrush with me everywhere I go!  Most toothbrush holders, in my area anyway, do not accommodate the taller toothbrushes of today.  This one does.  I think any size toothbrush would fit in here (except electric or very odd sized), and the product is of good quality.  The item arrived on time - I recommend the product and the seller.</li>
