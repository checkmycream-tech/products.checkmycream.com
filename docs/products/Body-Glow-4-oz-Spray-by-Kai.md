      <li>A wonderful, soft scent</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product in NYC and loved it immediately.  </li>
      <li>It has a very light oil-like texture and smells wonderful...similar to gardenia.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the package, it was encased in two layers of bubble wrap, which I was pleased to see that.</li>
      <li>I love how to body glow</li>
      <li>Kai is one of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This is just as fabulous as everything else!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this smell.</li>
      <li>I love them both, but wish the scent of the body glow lasted longer.  </li>
      <li>Light, floral just amazing.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this oil along with the Kai body buffer because they were Oprah&#x27;s favorite things.  </li>
      <li>so i don&#x27;t have oil marks on my skin, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>It has a great scent and makes my skin soft with a nice shimmer.</li>
      <li>but I love the smell</li>
      <li>okay but overpriced.</li>
      <li>I purchased it there and fell in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>wear Kai is Devine! :)</li>
      <li>I have received many compliments.  </li>
      <li>Love the aroma of the Kai</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and it gives your skin a sexy sheen without glitter.</li>
      <li>~ she is a CANCER Survivor and wanted me to make sure that I note that this KAI BODY SPRAY is the BEST thing out there to use for DRY SKIN</li>
      <li>Simply the best n worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It smells light, floral and very clean.</li>
      <li>Light and fresh!</li>
      <li>KAI is light and has a clean floral smell.  </li>
      <li>and the you smell great all day long.</li>
      <li>This body glow is really a very gentle smooth light spray of fragrant oil.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, love the product.</li>
      <li>I love this scent and much cheaper than the perfume.</li>
      <li>This time around, the product feels watery and the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong, but I still really like it.</li>
      <li>It is a light body spray and very hydrating.</li>
      <li>so I only use in warm weekends</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I have purchased several bottles and really love this product.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more Kai products.</li>
      <li>When used with some of the other KAI products for a &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; effect, it lasts nicely throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>When I was younger I used to wear Jungle Gardenia which was somewhat overpowering so for women my age Kai is nice and subtle...not too loud at all.</li>
      <li>which doesn&#x27;t really bother me but others might want to be aware of.  </li>
      <li>I wear this as I love the smell, I live in Kauai, Hawaii and Purchased it last year for my Sister Sandy</li>
      <li>I have to actually place my nose close to my arm to smell it, but that&#x27;s fine with me.  </li>
      <li>REALLY</li>
      <li>Now I believe it wears off fast or not as fragrant.</li>
      <li>Does absolutely NADA.  </li>
      <li>Very tropical/floral</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very oily</li>
      <li>Smells great but very subtle.</li>
      <li>Such a soft sweet floral without being overpowering!</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Kai but the Glow is not very long lasting either that or</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, so you are not left with an oily feel.</li>
      <li>Fresh, clean and a little tropical</li>
      <li>Love the long lasting fragrance!</li>
      <li>Even though it has an oil base it  absorbed well into the skin and left a wonderful fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Light &amp; moisturizing with a little glow...</li>
      <li>makes my skin feel soft not oily.  </li>
      <li>Scent is soft (not at all overpowering like some oil-based body oils).</li>
      <li>I have used both products myself, and they smell exactly the same, but the actual perfume dries a lot quicker.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item, especially with the KAI body wash, bath bubbles, or lotion/body cream.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, and it lasts a long time even if used as a body lotion, but it&#x27;s not very moisturizing and the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long beyond the shower....</li>
      <li>Love the scent, but it is very subtle</li>

    <li> I wear this as I love the smell, I live in Kauai, Hawaii and Purchased it last year for my Sister Sandy ~ she is a CANCER Survivor and wanted me to make sure that I note that this KAI BODY SPRAY is the BEST thing out there to use for DRY SKIN ~ She said \\&quot;IT REALLY WORKS\\&quot;  ~ you will not be disappointed - if I could I&#x27;d give it 10 STARS - Mahalo</li>
    <li> KAI is light and has a clean floral smell.  I love how to body glow makes my skin feel soft not oily.  I have received many compliments.  The bottle is pricey for 4 oz.</li>
    <li> I have had this before and repurchased, the best summer moisture as it is light and fresh and makes your skin glow, and the smell is heavenly</li>
    <li> I am using this as someone suggested to layer the fragrance and keep the scent lasting longer.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working or not....  I was expecting a watery solution, but this spray is actually a bit oily which doesn&#x27;t really bother me but others might want to be aware of.  I love the fragrance and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Scent is soft (not at all overpowering like some oil-based body oils). Received in a timely manner.  Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> This product has no smell what so ever. I just bought a bottle of oil :(</li>
    <li> Great product! Very fast shipping. LOVE IT! Wish they had a bath powder too. Light, lovely scent for Spring and Summer!!</li>
    <li> And guess what - I can&#x27;t return it b/c it is considered a \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot; liquid so Amazon does not allow returns. I am not sure if the one I got is bad or what. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Very weak smell, doesn&#x27;t compare to the tester I tried in another store.</li>
    <li> love the way this stuff smells!  i have to rub it in so i don&#x27;t have oil marks on my skin, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This body spray is so beautiful! The smell is intoxicating! I recommend this for all women who like lite perfumes! Simply the best n worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT.  ITS GREAT</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and it lasts a long time even if used as a body lotion, but it&#x27;s not very moisturizing and the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long beyond the shower....</li>
    <li> I cannot get enough of this scent!! Light and fresh! Hard to find. So happy amazon sells it! Will definitely buy more Kai products.</li>
    <li> Kai found me in fact &amp; now it&#x27;s my signature scent. I can&#x27;t change it! It is AMAZING. I have tried every other Kai product before now. This is just as fabulous as everything else! Perfect for summer. Light &amp; moisturizing with a little glow...</li>
    <li> KAI is what I would imagine Hawaii smells like.  Light, floral just amazing.  I have this and the roll on Eau de Parfume as well as several candles.  Maybe I&#x27;m obsessed but try it and you probably will be too!</li>
    <li> Love the long lasting fragrance!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product in NYC and loved it immediately.  I tried it several times (which I do with all cosmetics) before I was sold.  Even though it has an oil base it  absorbed well into the skin and left a wonderful fragrance.  There are several KAI products to choose from but this doubles as a moisturizer and fragrance product.</li>
    <li> This is a very popular fragrance in Hawaii. I purchased it there and fell in love with the scent. It is a light body spray and very hydrating. It is an oil so I spray it into my hand and pat it on my body, to avoid getting it on the tile floors. I have purchased several bottles and really love this product. It smells light, floral and very clean.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing! Fresh, clean and a little tropical, I adore this fragrance and it gives your skin a sexy sheen without glitter. Love it!</li>
    <li> To shower is human...&lt;br /&gt;To wear Kai is Devine! :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Kai but the Glow is not very long lasting either that or my nose just gets used to it. When I was younger I used to wear Jungle Gardenia which was somewhat overpowering so for women my age Kai is nice and subtle...not too loud at all.</li>
    <li> Wish I could get in in Prime Time!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing it&#x27;s very oily so I only use in warm weekends but I love the smell</li>
    <li> Bought for my friends birthday and she loves it! Such a soft sweet floral without being overpowering!</li>
    <li> This body glow is really a very gentle smooth light spray of fragrant oil. It absorbs quickly, so you are not left with an oily feel. and the you smell great all day long.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has a very light oil-like texture and smells wonderful...similar to gardenia.  When used with some of the other KAI products for a &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; effect, it lasts nicely throughout the day.  I highly recommend this item, especially with the KAI body wash, bath bubbles, or lotion/body cream.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely NADA.  Smells okay but overpriced. Forget this stuff..  NO shine on skin.  I wanted something that made the skin glow without an oil affect - this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but true !!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has a great scent and makes my skin soft with a nice shimmer. Kai is one of my favorite scents. Great for summer.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for years for an authentic Hawaii scent and this one is perfect! Best blend and never buying anything else!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and much cheaper than the perfume.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother. When I opened the package, it was encased in two layers of bubble wrap, which I was pleased to see that. There were no leaks, rips, or tears in any part of the package, and it came two days earlier than expected. This specific &amp;#34;body glow&amp;#34; is actually oily when you spray it on. It does dry after a while, but it leaves a little oil behind. If you&#x27;re looking for actual PERFUME, then I would suggest buying the KAI PERFUME, and not the KAI BODY GLOW. I have used both products myself, and they smell exactly the same, but the actual perfume dries a lot quicker.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice scent, but it wears off very quickly.  Which can be a good thing for those people that don&#x27;t want a stronger scent like the perfume.</li>
    <li> I discovered this years ago before Oprah name Kai perfume as one of her best of... I don&#x27;t know if there is a mass production of the products now. But it seems to have lost some of the essence. I still use it but it used to get noticed by others. Now I believe it wears off fast or not as fragrant. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> A wonderful, soft scent</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil along with the Kai body buffer because they were Oprah&#x27;s favorite things.  I love them both, but wish the scent of the body glow lasted longer.  I spray it into my palm, then rub over my upper and lower arms, neck and chest.  I have to actually place my nose close to my arm to smell it, but that&#x27;s fine with me.  Love the scent, but it is very subtle</li>
    <li> Kai products are wonderful , beautiful gardenia smell.</li>
    <li> Fragrance does not linger as long as I would like, but I adore Kai.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma of the Kai but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay with you long.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, love the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before and LOVED it. This time around, the product feels watery and the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong, but I still really like it.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ever!!! I get compliments on it every time I wear it. Very tropical/floral</li>
    <li> Not the smell I am looking for.  I prefer a lighter scent.</li>
    <li> There are very few scents I like. I am like a child and often make faces when standing in line behind someone wearing perfume. I LOVE this smell.</li>
    <li> Smells great but very subtle. I would recommend layering with the body lotion.  I love Kai because it doesn&#x27;t smell artificial.</li>
