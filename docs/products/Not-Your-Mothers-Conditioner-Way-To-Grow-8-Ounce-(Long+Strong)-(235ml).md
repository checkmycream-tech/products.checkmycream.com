      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo, which I love, so decided to grab the conditioner.</li>
      <li>It made my hair look even more damaged then before and didn&#x27;t improve growth at all.</li>

      <li>My hair feels great and is much softer and brushes through easily.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product, and I do see a huge difference in my hair growth and strength of my hair.</li>

      <li>Smells great and leaves my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>&amp; I found out that it&#x27;s ALL RIGHT WITH ME!!</li>
      <li>I always have some hair fall out, but this was easily two to three times that amount.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to brush.</li>
      <li>so it covers hair well but also rinses out easily.</li>
      <li>my hair is strong and never falls out.</li>
      <li>I have fine, medium length</li>
      <li>But since using the shampoo, 2 months now, I have noticed a huge change in my hair health.</li>
      <li>This conditioner feels cheap.</li>
      <li>It is excellent for everyday use.</li>
      <li>but I like how its sulfate free.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair growth, but it did make my hair soft and smell good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair super shiny, and the scent is more mild compared to the shampoo if that bothers you.</li>
      <li>i did notice a significant amount of hair in my shower drain.</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s chemical death for your hair.</li>
      <li>pretty sure this shampoo/ conditioner duo makes your hair fall out.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and I will continue to use this for as long as it continues to amaze me!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why a shampoo would cause this, especially being sulfate free and claiming to be so good for your hair.</li>
      <li>This product smells great, only need half the amount of other conditioners and the best part, it has already helped my hair grow longer, I can tell the difference each time I use it, Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so true to what it says it does.</li>
      <li>my brush and comb full of my hair...</li>
      <li>YET after i was almost through one full bottle i had been noticeing ALOT of hair loss...</li>
      <li>My product came on time and quick.</li>
      <li>I was expecting it to make my hair feel really soft but it didn&#x27;t feel any better than it does with cheap conditioners.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel, soft and light.</li>
      <li>After using it twice, I have decided to stop using it because more than my normal amount of hair fell out both times.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and it left my scalp and hair clean.</li>
      <li>I had read reviews on this conditioner and seemed like it would be worth a try.</li>
      <li>had really high hopes for this sulfate free shampoo/conditioner</li>
      <li>I most definitely give this product 5* all around, and trust me when I say for me, that&#x27;s rare.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I loved how soft it left my hair.</li>
      <li>It really works though!</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time today and didn&#x27;t experience any hair loss like</li>
      <li>At first you use this and</li>
      <li>first day I changed to something</li>
      <li>but it most definitely made me lose hair!!!</li>
      <li>It makes your hair feel so clean and soft, and it really does help your hair grow--I noticed my hair getting longer after TWO washes (I also used the shampoo).  </li>
      <li>The first two uses were fine but after washing my hair a third time with it</li>
      <li>Really wanted to love this product since it is sulfate free, but it failed on many levels.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak as to whether this makes hair grow but what I am certain of is it does not condition at all.</li>
      <li>You really have to use the conditioner though..</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for someone who wants stronger and longer hair.</li>
      <li>It also rinses VERY well, too.</li>
      <li>so it works very well together.</li>
      <li>Seems like it goes so fast and at 6 dollars</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this product in along with the Long &amp; Strong Shampoo. I have fine, medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful but my hair felt greasy afterwards, even with the shampoo alone.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my hair but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be continuing to use it given how it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, and I do see a huge difference in my hair growth and strength of my hair. The shampoo and conditioner smell so good. You really have to use the conditioner though.. but thats okay - I like combining the two. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the hopes it would help my hair grow longer quicker. After using it twice, I have decided to stop using it because more than my normal amount of hair fell out both times. I always have some hair fall out, but this was easily two to three times that amount.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair growth, but it did make my hair soft and smell good. It sort of smelled like a strawberry smoothie.</li>
    <li> Has a wonderful smell that lasts all day.  Get&#x27;s the tangles out and smooths my hair so it&#x27;s easy to brush.</li>
    <li> best shampoo ever it really makes my hair grow and shiny.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this and wanted to try it so bad. it smells great and it washes but hair well but it most definitely made me lose hair!!! I noticed my hair growing out but I also noticed it getting thiner! its definitely not for me but it might be for someone else. a little disappointed :/</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money, dried my hair out and made it break off.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if my hair grows any faster but I do love the fragrance and my hair feels healthier</li>
    <li> bought this thinking that it might help my hair grow longer. it didn&#x27;t. I smells awful and left my hair feeling very dry. I have natural curly hair, its dry enough as it is. Dont need any help in that department</li>
    <li> Still a little to early to tell if it is making a difference. But I&#x27;ll keep using it. Hopefully I&#x27;ll see a change soon.</li>
    <li> I used this once and my scalp, head, neck, ears, face and back broke out in terrible hives.  My daughter&#x27;s friend had the same reaction.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and leaves my hair feeling wonderful. I would recommend this for someone who wants stronger and longer hair.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner</li>
    <li> I left another review on the NYM Grow Shampoo as well, but I couldn&#x27;t copy &amp; paste so I&#x27;ll sum this one up. This shampoo &amp; conditioner set is amazing. I recommend getting the NYM Grow Leave In Conditioner as well to complete the set. The reason this conditioner isn&#x27;t like others is because when you pour it in your hands, instead of a creamy feeling.. it&#x27;s like a whipped mousse like feeling. I absolutely love the way it makes your hair feel when I get out of the shower. It also rinses VERY well, too. I most definitely give this product 5* all around, and trust me when I say for me, that&#x27;s rare. The only thing I&#x27;m rather irritated with is the time it took for my products to get here. Everything else is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was told about this and wanted to try it. I love this product. It works, and my hair has grown fast</li>
    <li> I like the smell of it and for a few hours post shower, your hair feels really soft but then it&#x27;s just odd to the touch and doesn&#x27;t feel right?</li>
    <li> Have yet to see results. There is some hair that falls out but I think it&#x27;s because you really massage this into your hair, there is bound to be.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! Smaller than most, but a little bit goes a long way. Nice and thick so it covers hair well but also rinses out easily. Smells great but not an overpowering smell at all like one reviewer said. My hair feels great and is much softer and brushes through easily.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible! Will never waste my money again. It smells horrible and it made my hair clump up. Bought with conditioner as well and I absolutely hate it. It made my hair look even more damaged then before and didn&#x27;t improve growth at all.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this conditioner in conjunction with my head and shoulders shampoo. I always use head and shoulders for shampoo but I like to play around with my conditioner based on what I feel my hair needs. I recently got balyage on my dark brown hair and needed something to help my hair grow and be stronger since the bleaching and the aggressive hair trim for split ends. I had read reviews on this conditioner and seemed like it would be worth a try. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my imagination or what but I my hair feels healthier and it seems to be growing faster than ever! I was using biotin for about 4 months to grow my hair faster but I never noticed a major difference in my hair, just my skin and nails. I stopped about 3 weeks ago bc I didn&#x27;t think it was working. I am not taking any vitamins or supplements to increase my hair growth so I can only attribute this faster growth to the conditoner bc that is the only thing that I have introduced that is new. It smells great and is very affordable. I can buy this at my local grocery store for about $5.00. Although it&#x27;s a small tube (especially for long hair like mine) I tend to add a little head and shoulders conditiner if I need alittle more product. The consistency of both conditioners is very similar so it works very well together. This is a great product and I will continue to use this for as long as it continues to amaze me!</li>
    <li> At first you use this and a week later your hair looks like it is growing long but after that it like stops working and you don&#x27;t see any more changes with your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It smells amazing and is sulfate free--both good things for hair. I can&#x27;t say whether it actually made my hair grow because I&#x27;ve also been taking vitamins and getting regular trims. My hair  definitely seems a lot healthier . Since buying this, I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s sold in stores for much much cheaper, however I have had some difficulty actually finding this specific type of this brand.</li>
    <li> The improvement I had in my hair was great. I needed to grow my hair out and this actually helped and work. Definitely have bought the not you mothers beach waves shampoo as well. Just trying out everything in their hair line. It smells great 2!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third use of this shampoo/conditoner.The first time I used it, I loved how soft it left my hair. I had heard about people having issues with hair loss using this product and didn&#x27;t really pay much attention or think it would happen to me. The first two uses were fine but after washing my hair a third time with it oh my gosh! I lost so much hair in the shower and I can run my hands through my hair and lose 3/4 strands every single time. I think it&#x27;s falling from the root too which is very concerning. I don&#x27;t know why a shampoo would cause this, especially being sulfate free and claiming to be so good for your hair. I&#x27;m going to use this a couple mores times but if this persists, I will definitely try to get my money back.  I will leave another review with updated results in a few more weeks in case things change. Edit: I could only stand using this product another week and it wasn&#x27;t the hair fall that was bothering me. Maybe that was normal? But I found this product left my hair less than clean or shiny. My hair felt lifeless really. And stringy. It also left my roots feeling greasy. Also if you are wondering, I did not use the conditoner on my scalp. While the conditoner was lovely and creamy, I found myself using a lot of product to make my hair feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Okay this is my favorite conditioner ever. EVER! It is super moisturizing yet doesn&#x27;t weigh fine hair down. It makes my hair super shiny, and the scent is more mild compared to the shampoo if that bothers you. I have not experienced any of the shedding that other reviewers have noted. It is such a luxurious conditioner and I will buy it again and again and tell everyone growing their hair out how nice this is because that&#x27;s how much I love it. 10/10.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner to help grow out a pixie cut. The scent is nice and it left my scalp and hair clean. The shampoo does leave the my hair feeling dry but my scalp tends to be oily so I didn&#x27;t mind--if it was a little longer I would suggest following with an oil while it is damp because this conditioner will probably not be enough moisture. For the price I thought this was a nice quality product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! it does seem to be a little heavy for my hair. Next day my hair is starting to feel dirty again.</li>
    <li> made my hair grow in  about a month</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recently recommended this product to me. My hair grows so slow and I have always looked for something like this. She posted that she noticed a difference within a couple weeks and I wanted to check it out. I have been using it for a week now and it is wonderful! I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel, soft and light. I can absolutely tell a difference in the length of my hair. I felt like maybe it was my imagination but other people have told me they notice it looks longer! I havent had any negative effects from this product. I also purchased the shampoo. Ulta had them buy one, get one half off.&lt;br /&gt;Try this product! It&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shampoo and conditioner ive used on my hair...i couldnt believe how soft,clean, and awesome my hair felt and looked...i could even go a couple days without it looking bad....YET after i was almost through one full bottle i had been noticeing ALOT of hair loss...my hair was clogging the bath tub drain,which NEVER happens....my hair was just pulling out in the shower....my brush and comb full of my hair...even in clumps!...my hair is strong and never falls out. So even though my hair felt better than ever me losing my hair was not worth it....first day I changed to something els my hair stopped falling out....I am a good judgment of products and I see alit of five stars on this but take it from me and just watch the amounts of hair loss if u try this product! I would defiantly rate this a five but because of the major hair loss issue i rate it a one star,two at the highest :( bummer</li>
    <li> I seldom write reviews but was very disappointed with this product. This conditioner feels cheap. It does not feel moisturizing and tangles my hair. The few times I used it, I applied My regular Nexxus conditioner after this conditioner because it felt rough and unconditioned. I do not have dry hair so a conditioner must be bad to dry out and tangle my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the TRUTH!! It&#x27;s so moisturizing &amp; it clearly aids in the growth of African American hair types. It is excellent for everyday use. Love love love this stuff. It&#x27;s cheaper at Meijers or Walmart but I was unaware of that at the time I purchased this from Sundance Beauty which they had the cheapest price on Amazon. It&#x27;s so true to what it says it does. I tried it &amp; I found out that it&#x27;s ALL RIGHT WITH ME!! The best!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product. I however have to purchase it and wish there was more for the money. Seems like it goes so fast and at 6 dollars each I can&#x27;t justify it.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the texture of my hair after using these products. Not sure if my hair is growing faster because of it but I like how its sulfate free.</li>
    <li> I am growing my hair to donate to locks of love. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for three months now. I have noticed a big difference in my length. I like the smell and how it makes my hair feel. I wish it came in a different bottle. I seem to always drop this one for some reason. I end up transferring it into one of my liking. Problem solved.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel or smell. It looked dull and dry and flat. I will look for something else. Purchased with the shampoo</li>
    <li> I do like this shampoo, but I have very thick and long hair, it takes a lot of conditioner, so it doesn&#x27;t last lone.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, only need half the amount of other conditioners and the best part, it has already helped my hair grow longer, I can tell the difference each time I use it, Love it! I would like to find this in Stores instead of only online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; preservative in this stuff :(</li>
    <li> Love it...try it, you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak as to whether this makes hair grow but what I am certain of is it does not condition at all. I have pin straight fine hair &amp; had to buy a bottle of leave in conditioner because my hair was a dry rat&#x27;s nest after each use. I ended up throwing away more than half a tube. Total waste of money!!! Wish I could give zero or negative stars.</li>
    <li> It has an odd smell. Like its trying to smell like strawberries but it doesn&#x27;t really.. It really works though! I usually get my hair cut every 4 months and by the second month of using this product my hair had already grown from what it should be by the 4th month! I also noticed that I don&#x27;t have any split ends since starting. Which is a big deal because my hair breaks all the time. People said their hair fell out but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice in my hair. My hair naturally falls out through the day and in the shower since I have THICK hair but I didn&#x27;t see a difference in before using the product and after; If anything I think it HELPED my hair. because of this I&#x27;ve bought more Not Your Mother Products. They are cheap and, although their smell, work wonders!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  It makes your hair feel so clean and soft, and it really does help your hair grow--I noticed my hair getting longer after TWO washes (I also used the shampoo).  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I definitely recommend this product.  I have not experienced any hair loss like the other review.  I will definitely continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smells great and leaves my hair so soft and shiny. Will definitely buy again. Love love love it.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to love this product since it is sulfate free, but it failed on many levels. Left my hair feeling dry and noticed a lot of hair loss during my shampoo/conditioning.</li>
    <li> I like how there are not as many additives in this product compared to regular conditioners, but I prefer Simply U. My hair is thick and this conditioner makes it a little to frizzy. After a few weeks it started to calm down and become soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have had great success with this shampoo and conditioner in growing stronger hair.  It has a great scent and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> ehhhh. its just okay. i took pictures the day i started using it and the day i ran out and there was no difference what so ever. It did make my hair feel thicker, but once i stopped my hair went to normal. while using it i did notice a significant amount of hair in my shower drain. pretty sure this shampoo/ conditioner duo makes your hair fall out. Once i stopped using this i noticed i no longer had so much hair in my shower drain.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great! I use it with the shampoo and together my hair feels soft and is shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner and leave it in over night as a treatment. Too soon to see if it will really stop my split ends from being so bad!</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this. She has noticed and improvement in hair growth eventhough she has medical issues, she says you may notice more considerable results. She says her hair seems thicker and healthier, she has noticed an inch growth after 1 bottle use, she uses the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I do see a slow grow when I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo, which I love, so decided to grab the conditioner. This stuff smells great and leaves my hair feeling super healthy. I have noticed a decent hair growth. My hair is typically frizzy &amp; breaks easy. But since using the shampoo, 2 months now, I have noticed a huge change in my hair health. Will continue to use long term 😄</li>
    <li> This did not leave my hair soft at all, this is the worst long and strong set I have used.</li>
    <li> My product came on time and quick. I used it for the first time today and didn&#x27;t experience any hair loss like the other reviews said. I was expecting it to make my hair feel really soft but it didn&#x27;t feel any better than it does with cheap conditioners. I will update my review after I use the product for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have written a review about the shampoo and it goes the same for this conditioner, a little goes a long way,it doesn&#x27;t make my hair go flat, I have body and my hair is starting to finally grow...this item I would recommend you try if you have hair issues, I&#x27;m happy to hair again! Thanks to Amazon</li>
    <li> made my hair fall out. had really high hopes for this sulfate free shampoo/conditioner but i&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s chemical death for your hair. i would avoid this one...</li>
