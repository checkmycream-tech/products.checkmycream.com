### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best nose strip I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Best of the best I had ever use.</li>
      <li>I feel this is great purchase and great deal!</li>
      <li>but when I use pore strips, they come out great, but this product doesn&#x27;t pull the blackheads out at all.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice peel off..</li>
      <li>Okay, well, this product smells wonderful (loooooove the smell).</li>
      <li>This time is good .</li>
      <li>Feels good on the skin</li>
      <li>Almost as good, though.</li>
      <li>It peels off painlessly, has a great fragrance and cleaned my pores better than any cleaner I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Liked the thought of it</li>
      <li>mmmm it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>but its okay as a mask but its not something i got to have</li>
      <li>It works okay though either way</li>
      <li>Hurts a tiny bit but it has great suction!</li>
      <li>In my opinion it works better than the boscia masks which cost quite a bit more than this product.</li>
      <li>It did remove most of the fine hairs on my nose and forehead</li>
      <li>Great Product, leave my skin baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for my sensitive</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling so much better not to mention smooth.</li>
      <li>Cool product!  </li>
      <li>However, it is quite easy to peel.</li>
      <li>As for the quality of this product, I wish it would extract more, but it does do a nice job overall.</li>
      <li>My pores are all clean.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t really clean out the pores in the areas I needed (nose &amp; chin).</li>
      <li>This stuff is by far amazing</li>
      <li>I had really high hopes for &amp;#34; The Face Shop&amp;#34; since it&#x27;s a famous brand in Korea</li>
      <li>Works pretty well-</li>
      <li>It is also friendly for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have instead, the Volcanic Clay black head heating gel mask, which seems to do what it claims, but honestly I am a bit reluctant at anything that seems to be conducting heat on my skin.</li>
      <li>Plus, it leaves your nose super soft.  </li>
      <li>It really gets everything out of your pours.</li>
      <li>This really does work.</li>
      <li>Very sticky until it dries, just a note.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>I was also pleased with the shipping as I received this product sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very by this product.</li>
      <li>depend on how much, and how often on your skin.</li>
      <li>This product really does the trick.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had other clay nose packs before, and this one just doesn&#x27;t get that many whiteheads out.</li>
      <li>It takes some work to get it on, and it takes longer than similar products to dry enough to remove it, but once it is dry it is by far the best of the many similar products I have tried.  </li>
      <li>My blackheads are not super prominent</li>
      <li>I was really excited and expected to use it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, nothing out of the ordinary.  </li>
      <li>Arrived fast and I like the design and the CONCEPT, but I have really big pores and it honestly didn&#x27;t really take out very much. :(</li>
      <li>I like this more than the typical black head strips.</li>
      <li>Be prepared to be amazed at the amount of icky stuff this removes...just fantastic.</li>
      <li>Just not what I expected, do not see much result</li>
      <li>I have bought more for my nephew who plays alot of sport and has a real problem with blackheads and bad skin - we covered his whole face and back</li>

<li> I have bought more for my nephew who plays alot of sport and has a real problem with blackheads and bad skin - we covered his whole face and back</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry off for me, even if the application is left on for hours.</li>
<li> I hoped it would clear pores as thoroughly as those little pore strips.</li>
<li> I have given it several tries.</li>
<li> and it takes forever to dry.</li>
<li> You apply on and let it dry for 20 minutes, then you peel it off.  </li>
<li> Did pulled out a lot of my white head and black head.</li>
<li> I have only used it a few times since I purchased it</li>
<li> but this doesn&#x27;t really remove black heads sadly :(&lt;br /&gt;it smells really good though.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt like the other nose strips.  </li>
<li> consistency is very sticky and thick making it hard to spread &#x3D;</li>
<li> Although it is a small tube, a lot can go a long way.</li>
<li> All the black stuff come off just like that.  </li>
<li> i was expecting it to pull out something in my skin like some black heads or something</li>
<li> but when I massage it on my nose, wait 15 minutes, and then rinse off, I still have black heads and don&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
<li> When I put on, has a slight tingly feeling.</li>
<li> It don&#x27;t pull out all of your black head but some of it.</li>
<li> waste of time and money.</li>
<li> I used the product a couple of times and it pulls out few if any blackheads.</li>
<li> I feel like it was a waste of money.  </li>
<li> After using a few times, I gave up the product.</li>
<li> Product is very thick and sticky, it reminds me of marshmallow fluff.  </li>
<li> Used it a couple of times but it never removes anything, not sure if its because the layer I put is too thick/thin (tried both)  </li>
<li> I followed all the product&#x27;s direction, but when peeling off, I saw very few blackheads came off.</li>
<li> If too thin, holes starts forming, but too thick</li>
<li> It&#x27;s weak.</li>
<li> Plain awful.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.. :(</li>

    <li> Just not what I expected, do not see much result</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very by this product. Although it is a small tube, a lot can go a long way. I was also pleased with the shipping as I received this product sooner than expected. As for the quality of this product, I wish it would extract more, but it does do a nice job overall.</li>
    <li> It peels off painlessly, has a great fragrance and cleaned my pores better than any cleaner I&#x27;ve ever tried. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Bought this from Urban Outfitters. It dries on the skin and has a pulling feeling, but doesn&#x27;t pull out the blackheads.</li>
    <li> i was expecting it to pull out something in my skin like some black heads or something but its okay as a mask but its not something i got to have</li>
    <li> This is the answer to blackheads!!! I have tried dozens of products and this outstrips everything I have ever tried!!!! BUY THIS STUFF you will never look back. I have bought more for my nephew who plays alot of sport and has a real problem with blackheads and bad skin - we covered his whole face and back and you would not believe the difference!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry off for me, even if the application is left on for hours. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>

    <li> I have tried everything out there to get rid of the blackheads on my nose.  This product really does the trick.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This really does work. My pores are all clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing out of the ordinary.  I feel like it was a waste of money.  I will not be buying again.  You could probably do a DIY mask for this.</li>
    <li> Be prepared to be amazed at the amount of icky stuff this removes...just fantastic. Leaves your skin feeling so much better not to mention smooth.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well- I hoped it would clear pores as thoroughly as those little pore strips. Almost as good, though. Very sticky until it dries, just a note.</li>
    <li> Best of the best I had ever use. I like this more than the typical black head strips. I&#x27;m tempted just to stock this product up....</li>
    <li> This stuff is by far amazing and I have brought everything. It really gets everything out of your pours. Hurts a tiny bit but it has great suction!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come in looking like the picture above and it doesn&#x27;t even seem like the same product... It works okay though either way so I still use it.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for &amp;#34; The Face Shop&amp;#34; since it&#x27;s a famous brand in Korea but this doesn&#x27;t really remove black heads sadly :(&lt;br /&gt;it smells really good though.</li>
    <li> I used the product a couple of times and it pulls out few if any blackheads. It did remove most of the fine hairs on my nose and forehead that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Great Product, leave my skin baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great addition to my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other clay nose packs before, and this one just doesn&#x27;t get that many whiteheads out. It&#x27;s weak. However, it is quite easy to peel.</li>

    <li> mmmm it&#x27;s ok. Arrived fast and I like the design and the CONCEPT, but I have really big pores and it honestly didn&#x27;t really take out very much. :(</li>
    <li> I would have given the product five stars but my face had a allergic reaction to the product. WHich could happen to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice peel off.. You can control the amount and where you like to apply on your skin. I use this once a week. Did pulled out a lot of my white head and black head. Did not irritate my skin or cause redness. It is also friendly for sensitive skin. This 50g tube can use up to about 4~5 months. depend on how much, and how often on your skin. I feel this is great purchase and great deal!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty small for the price and it hurts like heck to peel it off, but it works. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for putting it on my entire face! lol.</li>
    <li> I was really excited and expected to use it. It don&#x27;t pull out all of your black head but some of it. And leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> Took a while to come and doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hope... consistency is very sticky and thick making it hard to spread &#x3D;T  Used it a couple of times but it never removes anything, not sure if its because the layer I put is too thick/thin (tried both)  If too thin, holes starts forming, but too thick and it takes forever to dry.</li>
    <li> Well, I finally figure out why mine didn&#x27;t peel off!  Because I was sent the heating gel mask instead.  Id like to try the peel off make though. Because that is the one I wanted.  I have instead, the Volcanic Clay black head heating gel mask, which seems to do what it claims, but honestly I am a bit reluctant at anything that seems to be conducting heat on my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this from the face shop store in US. It didn&#x27;t really work. After using a few times, I gave up the product. I followed all the product&#x27;s direction, but when peeling off, I saw very few blackheads came off. waste of time and money. Don&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Okay, well, this product smells wonderful (loooooove the smell). Feels good on the skin BUT I have not seen any improvement in my nose. I have only used it a few times since I purchased it but when I massage it on my nose, wait 15 minutes, and then rinse off, I still have black heads and don&#x27;t see any difference at all. My blackheads are not super prominent but when I use pore strips, they come out great, but this product doesn&#x27;t pull the blackheads out at all. I wonder if I use this product for a longer period of time, if it will help improve my skin, but as of now, the blackheads are still there and it hasn&#x27;t made any improvements on my skin.</li>
    <li> This time is good . Thank you</li>
    <li> Cool product!  It dries just like a rubberized material, which is then peeled off.  Removes blackheads and gunk from pores.  Plus, it leaves your nose super soft.  Without any washing or water involved.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;d rather use nose strips than this. I have given it several tries. I followed it&#x27;s instruction. Tried following instructional videos on Youtube too. Plain awful.</li>
    <li> Liked the thought of it but it didn&#x27;t really clean out the pores in the areas I needed (nose &amp; chin). When I put on, has a slight tingly feeling. When peeled off, nothing was really different..... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.. :(</li>
