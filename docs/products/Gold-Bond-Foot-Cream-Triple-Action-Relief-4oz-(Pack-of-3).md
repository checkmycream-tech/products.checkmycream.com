      <li>The best part, though, was when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>I never write reviews but felt compelled to write about this amazing product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Receiving this as it&#x27;s own package would have been my preference....</li>
      <li>It also smells nice, but not too overwhelming, which is also good for stinky feet.</li>

      <li>This is actually the best foot cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I have had cracked heels for 25 years, and most creams helped but never cured.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products but none ever seem to heal instead</li>
      <li>It is a favorite in my household.</li>
      <li>Of all the foot creams I have used, this has proven to be the best especially for the heels.</li>
      <li>Gold Bond product, &amp;#34;Gold Bond Ultimate Diabetic Skin Relief Skin Protectant Foot Cream&amp;#34; which is the best foot cream product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>(and I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to do about it), within 2-3 days looked totally healthy.  </li>
      <li>He started using this foot cream morning and night and it healed the more sever heel to the point that he was then able to start using a pumice stone as part of the process.</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>The best thing about this product is that it actually penetrates the skin!</li>
      <li>I just wish to say that I had tried the to top brands of foot creams, and Gold Bond has beat them all.</li>
      <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the deals I get through Amazon!</li>
      <li>flip flops around the house and out and about more often.</li>
      <li>I use this on my feet and hands mostly....</li>
      <li>and I like this better.</li>
      <li>love this stuff my podiatrist suggested this.</li>
      <li>Best treatment I&#x27;ve found in 10 years for cracked, dry feet, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
      <li>healthy skin and smooth as a Baby&#x27;s Butthind.  </li>
      <li>Skin is now much softer, no dryness, and feels good.</li>
      <li>I do use other foot creams, but this is best for night time or when wearing socks.  </li>
      <li>Now with, mostly inconsistent, use over the last 2 months, my feet look great.</li>
      <li>this is the best on the market hands down</li>
      <li>This is a super product as Most of Gold Bonds are...</li>
      <li>Within days I noticed a huge improvement.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also not too greasy which makes it comfortable to use on all of the time.</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>I now have smooth heels.</li>
      <li>It does great, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Soft feet good product</li>
      <li>Even better than this brands higher priced - &amp;#34;superior&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Upon first application, I could tell my feet was feeling softer and more supple.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find it locally so was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and my feet are nice and soft.</li>
      <li>It was just cool, and soothing.</li>
      <li>However, the tube does not permit the full contents to be dispensed.  </li>
      <li>this stuff has been the only product that keeps my feet looking good.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s reasonable price (even better value buying at Amazon in bulk).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they could design a better way to dispense it and other stuff like toothpaste, but I guess if a lot of the stuff is thrown away, that&#x27;s more profit for them.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Winter time in New England can be tough on one&#x27;s skin, especially on feet. I was so happy to have found this product a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It really works! I apply it to my feet twice a day, once in the morning after my shower and then again at night. Within a few days my feet feel smoother and my heels are no longer cracked. The key is to keep applying it consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The light, pleasant smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering, just a hint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s just the right consistency. It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but not too much so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry feet, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and I use this not only on my feet but on my hands as well, better than any hand lotion I have ever tried</li>
    <li> This foot cream is really good.  I&#x27;ve been using O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s for a couple of years and I like this better.</li>
    <li> It gave relief to the person I purchased it for within 24 hrs of application. His feet were so bad he could hardly walk from the painful cracked feet. I don&#x27;t know what causes this but it&#x27;s probably a condition that needs maintenance.  That&#x27;s why I got him the 3 pack deal.  Also, the product came fast and on time, etc.  Thank you to all who recommended this product.  I read the reviews to help me choose what to purchase.</li>
    <li> Fighting dry skin in the dry climate of New Mexico is a full-time job.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of foot creams - different brands and prices - and this is the only cream that really works.  I apply it twice a day and it really makes a difference.  It has a subtle fragrance and absorbs very quickly.  I buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> The cream really works good on dry, cracked feet. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is the tube it comes in. Very difficult to get everything out of it. I&#x27;m sure they could design a better way to dispense it and other stuff like toothpaste, but I guess if a lot of the stuff is thrown away, that&#x27;s more profit for them.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot lotion or creme, that I have ever used. My feet are typically in pretty bad shape, hard, dry, and cracked. Sometimes they are so bad fabric will stick to them, like Velcro. Sometimes it is even uncomfortable to stand barefoot. Even after just one application, I notice quite a difference. It also smells nice, but not too overwhelming, which is also good for stinky feet.</li>
    <li> I finally spent the money and bought this cream. It really works! I noticed an improvement in just one day.  I used at night and my heels were still soft in the morning. After 3 days, my feet are beautiful.  It&#x27;s great for your elbows, too!!</li>
    <li> I put the cream on my heel every morning and put socks over the cream.  Voila, my heels are smooth again (not like a baby&#x27;s butt) but  pretty gooood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using for a week but after the first couple of days, I could feel the improvement.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in a local store, solely based on the reviews on this website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been nothing less then phenomenal, far better then the exfoliating potion&lt;br /&gt;I purchased at the spa, and the worthless micro-pedi callous remover (see my review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just one night of this on my heels I experienced a 90% improvement on my poor&lt;br /&gt;dry heels that looked like fish scales. By the third treatment, (second day) my heels&lt;br /&gt;are back to normal, no rough spots. I am fascinated that this can be done without exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have of course expanded the use of this product to my entire foot and hands and&lt;br /&gt;it has softened them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I found this product, based on everyone&#x27;s reviews.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of the dry cracked skin on the heels and bottom of the foot. Doesn&#x27;t work overnight. Use it everyday and you&#x27;ll notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Ordered due to recommendation from a friend. Works fine, really does help with dry skin (heels / toes).  Will order again. Definitly want to put on socks after applying to feet. Otherwise you&#x27;re going to slip and slide everywhere!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best foot creams that I have used. It is easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands all oily. I use it almost nightly and my feet have gone from being very rough and hard to being perfectly smooth. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Have had athletes foot and halfway through medication to fight some toenail fungus that appeared.    The Gold Bond cream on my cracked feet has worked WONDERS in just 2 weeks time.  Just noticed this morning waking up, I could feel my blankets tickling the bottom of my feet.  Thats a sensation I have not felt in a few years due to my cracked and dry feet.    There is still a little ways to go, but I would say I am 90% there in having totally moisturized feet, and totally soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is actually the best foot cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried several creams from pricey to cheap, but this is the one for me.  It really works!  I can now wear my sandals and flip flops this summer without worrying about how my feet look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products but none ever seem to heal instead they help for that day but the next day back to square one. This is different. If I use this consistently, it makes my feet very soft and it lasts beyond that one day.  Eventually they do revert to dry and cracked but nothing is a cure-all.</li>
    <li> Works very well for dried cracked heels.  I use with GEL heel socks at night occassional, and am very happy with the foot cream.  Initially I had to sand down my heels with 80-grit sand paper and a belt sander, but after that I started using the foot cream for about 3 months now and it does a very good job preventing the dryness/cracking.  Will definitely continue to use.  I do use other foot creams, but this is best for night time or when wearing socks.  When wearing sandals (i.e. Tevas), its a little too slippery (I use another foot cream in that case).  All in all, its a very good product, and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this foot cream for a number of years for some foot problems and it is great. Also, just a tiny bit on the elbows heals dry elbow syndrome :)</li>
    <li> I used this when I was in a Rehab Hospital with after surgery knee replacement.  It works great, is easy to carry and keeps the feet smooth. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it is the way it is packaged.  When the tub gets down to almost empty it is extremely difficult to squeeze out the remaining cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10/14:&lt;br /&gt;After writing the above review I decided to cut the tub in half to see what product remained.  There was enough for about two more weeks of use.  I had squeezed and squeezed but evidently the red plastic cap is big enough to prevent a great deal of the product from getting out.  So from now on I will cut the tub in half when I have used all I can squeeze out of it and enjoy several more weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Great product; great price.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond Foot Cream does the trick. I use it daily on very dry feet. The price is excellent when you use the Free Super Saver Shipping.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond Foot Cream, Triple Action Relief, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3) is AMAZING!  I was the victim of circumstance from a game of \\&quot;Extreme This Little Piggy.\\&quot;  My littlest piggy went wee wee wee all the way off my foot.  The loss of my pinky toe had left me with a dry, cracked nub.  In the winter time, my nub would get sore and pain me something awful.  I followed the directions of the good people who had left reviews on this site by applying Gold Bond Foot Cream, Triple Action Relief, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3) liberally to my feet and then donning socks.  Upon first application, I could tell my feet was feeling softer and more supple.  When my cat stopped hissing at me as I would rub my feet on his belly, I knew it was working.  After one full week of use, I was shocked one morning after removing my socks to find my little piggy had grown back!  Now, I can enjoy a Full game of \\&quot;Normal style This Little Piggy\\&quot;, I can once again count to twenty and have started adding to my collection of toe socks. Thank you Gold Bond Foot Cream, Triple Action Relief, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)!  You are the BEST!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any great improvement, but seems to be working somewhat</li>
    <li> I love Gold Bond Foot Cream, Triple Action Relief!  It&#x27;s greatly superior to any other cream I&#x27;ve tried, including Gold Bond Ultimate Softening Foot Cream in the white tube.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find it locally so was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s not greasy but really softens my feet.  My pedicurist even noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> The best foot cream out there.  Packaging is such though, that it&#x27;s hard to get out of the tube when it&#x27;s running low.  Which Gold Bond made it in a tub container. Scent not too smelly, nice thick cream that absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. The heels of his feet were rough and cracking. One heel was severe causing bleeding and pain. He started using this foot cream morning and night and it healed the more sever heel to the point that he was then able to start using a pumice stone as part of the process. I wish Amazon allowed pictures so I could show the difference.</li>
    <li> This is the quickest acting lotion I have ever used on my feet! Just sent some to my mom that has flaky diabetic feet. Same results as if I had soaked my feet for 20 minutes in a hot tub, rubbed with a cloth and then buff with a dry towell and repeat in a week!</li>
    <li> I use Gold Bond Foot Cream every day and am very satisfied with the product.  However, the tube does not permit the full contents to be dispensed.  I cut it open and found a 3 - 4 week supply that could not be squeezed out due to the shortness and girth of the tube and the very rigid top.  What a waste!  Not that I waste it, but I think the company should rethink their packaging to give us full value.</li>
    <li> Best cream ever and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Even better than this brands higher priced - &amp;#34;superior&amp;#34; product.  Don&#x27;t be fooled this is where your search will end.</li>
    <li> I have dry feet, and Gold Bond foot cream works really well.  I apply twice daily, when I remember to do so.</li>
    <li> This cream is a miracle worker for feet. After a really long winter, my feet were very dry and rough. A few nights of this has helped tremendously! It&#x27;s also not too greasy which makes it comfortable to use on all of the time.</li>
    <li> The cream its working as I expected..its third time when I used this..good price...my heels and my toes are good now</li>
    <li> Yes, a little goes a long way and your dogs will never feel better than after an application of this cream. Dry and tight feeling goes away instantly. Yes, it is a little pricey, but well worth the extra $$$ ,as it is far superior to all other foot cream on the market. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Works very well for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I apply nightly before I lay me down to sleep and I ask my Lord my Soul to keep....let me tell you why....  I have the softest feet in the world.....healthy skin and smooth as a Baby&#x27;s Butthind.  This is a super product as Most of Gold Bonds are...</li>
    <li> I have heavy calluses and this cream helps keep my feet soft and prevents the frequent cracked heals that I used to have constantly.</li>
    <li> Diabetic issues and really does a nice job by killing the daily normandy assault on my feet and 9 toes. Lost one and trying to keep fron loosibg a foot.</li>
    <li> These Gold Bond people really know wat they are doing!  I apply after every workout/shower with noticeable results! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I also enjoy the deals I get through Amazon!</li>
    <li> This cream penetrates the skin including the callouses, though they will  still need to be filed because you develop layers everyday, and makes the foot hydrated and smooth.</li>
    <li> Within a couple of hours, I had gone from no pain to a tiny pain at the end of my big toe to pain so bad that I was actually limping.  All due split skin at the end of my toe.  After reading reviews on Amazon, I went to local drug store, since I couldn&#x27;t wait for delivery.  Within 1 day (applied it 4 times and wore socks), it hurt only when I pressed the place.  Within 48 hours from start of use (again with application 3-4 times /day), no pain even when I pressed.  Also skin that had looked dead at the side of my toe (and I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to do about it), within 2-3 days looked totally healthy.  Guess that&#x27;ll teach me not to ignore my very dry feet.  I promptly ordered the pack of 3, even though I&#x27;m not finished with my first yet, because I can see that I&#x27;ll be using this foot cream routinely.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this cream too oily and doesn&#x27;t do anything as it advertised</li>
    <li> Soft feet good product</li>
    <li> Of all the foot creams I have used, this has proven to be the best especially for the heels. It is a favorite in my household.</li>
    <li> Best treatment I&#x27;ve found in 10 years for cracked, dry feet, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
    <li> Awesome cream. I wear flip flops or go barefoot a lot, so the bottoms of my feet were dry and cracked and nothing else seemed to work. I tried this based on the reviews and saw a 50% improvement after just a week. Now with, mostly inconsistent, use over the last 2 months, my feet look great. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> tums up on this product</li>
    <li> Really does heal cracked heals... and gets rid of dryness without a greasy feeling...</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but felt compelled to write about this amazing product. I have had cracked heels for 25 years, and most creams helped but never cured.  I saw a commercial for Gold Bond Heel Cream on t.v. and figured I would give it a shot, due to it&#x27;s reasonable price (even better value buying at Amazon in bulk).  It is a miracle, my cracked heels are gone after one week. I use a pumice ($3 at the nail salon) on my heels in the shower every day and apply the cream in the morning and heavily at night before bed (wear socks). I now have smooth heels. My opinion is, this is a superior product but it should be used daily or at least 3x week to maintain your results. I can now wear flip flops and sandals without feeling embarrassed.</li>
    <li> Item as described; works well. Hard to find in the shops.</li>
    <li> This foot creme is the best, for years my husband has had the ugliest feet in the world .  Callused and yellow brittle toenails and cracked heels within 3 weeks of using the foot creme,(which by the way was intended for me).  The yellow and brittle nails are disappearing and the callous has soften so much, it doesn&#x27;t even hurt him any more.  OF course, the cracked heels have gone away too.  Just a little P.S.  He also had the driest hands in the world, and it has helped them too.</li>
    <li> Have had cracking heals for a few years, in the cool dry months. Tried various treatment creams. Nothing worked well. Just tried GB over the weekend. Within 24 hours (only two applications), condition had improved to only 50% of original. Another 24 hours and  almost no pain left when touching the cracked areas. Skin is now much softer, no dryness, and feels good. This stuff is amazing. Very good product.</li>
    <li> I have Hand and Foot Syndrome due to the chemo I&#x27;m on.  My fingertips feel plastic and have peeled.  I use the Gold Bond foot creme and it gives me relief.  I use it on my feet too, really helps keep the pads and heels soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Cannot do without this product -- used it for decades.  Works miracles on feet!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and have found consistent results: my cracked heels are healed overnight.  What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Great product! Need larger size</li>
    <li> Before using Gold Bond, I always had trouble with painful cracking and peeling - even when using &#x27;rich&#x27; lotions. Since using GB on a daily basis, have not had a single issue with cracking. Only wish that it came in a larger container...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m diabetic, and so my feet get dry and cracked, especially around the heels. I&#x27;ve used much more expensive specialty creams that don&#x27;t do half as well as the Gold Bond has done. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days, and there&#x27;s already a marked improvement in the condition of my feet. The best part, though, was when I first put it on. See, my feet get hot, and dry, and they crack and peel (sorry, I&#x27;m not trying to gross you out), and it can be painful. The first time I put some of the cream on my feet, oh, dear mercy, you wouldn&#x27;t believe how great it felt. It was just cool, and soothing. I put some socks on so that the moisture would stay in, and the rest of that day, my feet felt wonderful. I&#x27;m hoping to see even more improvement over the next week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream. It does great, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~John</li>
    <li> Working great,  would tell all my friends, and fanily. Thanks loads, mjenkins616</li>
    <li> I bought this as a part of a gift.  The scent, through the plastic, is MUCH too strong for me...it overwhelmed all that was in the box it arrived in... but the recipient specified this brand and swears by it&#x27;s healing ability.  I mention the scent for others, who, like me, are sensitive to some odors for health reasons.  Receiving this as it&#x27;s own package would have been my preference....4* because it&#x27;s what was asked for.  1*for the fact that all in the box with it is wearing its&#x27; smell.</li>
    <li> I just wish to say that I had tried the to top brands of foot creams, and Gold Bond has beat them all. Hard cracked feet no more...Thanks Gold Bond.&lt;br /&gt;  johnboy</li>
    <li> I always buy this, I think it works the best.  I put it on at night with some socks and my feet are nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I liked this immediately like the other users.  It does help with cracked heels and dry feet.  I would buy it again. **I originally reviewed this as good but after using, I want to change this. It seems to be petroleum based and if not, similar to that. While it appears to moisturize your feet at first, it actually seems to dry them out more in the long run, or to not help. I cannot recommend it after using it for a while.  It is deceptive if you have seriously dry heels/feet, as I do.</li>
    <li> this cream is awesome i can see improvements on my feet . they feel a lot smoother and have less cracks&lt;br /&gt;i am very happy with this cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my feet every night for the past two months. Prior to this it seemed that the bottoms of my feet were always dry and cracked. Within days I noticed a huge improvement. Now my feet are soft and smooth without feeling greasy. I would highly recommend this foot cream to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great foot skin softner</li>
    <li> None better and the price is better than local discount stores.  A &amp;#34;MUST HAVE&amp;#34; for those living in arid climates or walking the beach daily.</li>
    <li> this stuff has been the only product that keeps my feet looking good. i have dry cracked feet without this cream, and the results last all day so i highly recommend for people with foots issues.</li>
    <li> I buy it all the time</li>
    <li> I have found the &amp;#34;Gold Bond Triple Action Relief&amp;#34; to be a significantly better product than the &amp;#34;Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried them both and found that Triple Action product absorbs quicker provides longer relief from dryness where the &amp;#34;Ultimate Healing actually dries out the skin with repeated daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5-stars is there is an even better (but much more expensive) Gold Bond product, &amp;#34;Gold Bond Ultimate Diabetic Skin Relief Skin Protectant Foot Cream&amp;#34; which is the best foot cream product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> i tried several brands over several years, and Gold Bond produces the best results.  &#x27;Nuff said!</li>
    <li> works like a freakin charm!!! my feet are sooo incredibly soft. I feel sexy!</li>
    <li> Gold Bond has always been expensive so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.  My husband needed something for his feet because they always peeled.  He thought it wouldn&#x27;t work so I bought it anyway and He loves it.  This is a few months down the line by the way.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It smooths and soothes rough, cracked feet.  It absorbs quickly.  Pleasantly scent that does not linger.</li>
    <li> Does a fantastic job of making my feet soft and smooth. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering. The best thing about this product is that it actually penetrates the skin! A few minutes later I&#x27;m able to walk around my stained concrete floors without the slippery feet that I do with other lotions!</li>
    <li> I use this on my feet and hands mostly....it works fast and it works well.....haven&#x27;t seen anyting close in performance...this is the best on the market hands down</li>
    <li> Excellnt healing for calluses and  no unpleasant odor  i would recommeNd this product.  To this date all gold bond&lt;br /&gt;Products have been to my satisfaction Amazon service is very good</li>
    <li> love this stuff my podiatrist suggested this. On my feet 12 hrs. a day on a cold concrete floor reeks havoc on my feet, use it rite after a shower ,goodbye callouses and corns keep feet soft . great price too better than some prescription stuff.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream for your feet. It does exactly what it claims to do for your feet... I have recommended this product to all my friends</li>
    <li> Best for my feet I&#x27;ve found.  No more cracked heals.</li>
    <li> Best that I have tried.  I will repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cream!  It has not only made our feet smoother and eliminated the rough areas, but it works on some scalp problems my husband had and leaves my hands feeling smooth.  It&#x27;s the best cream we&#x27;ve found for rough, callused and dry skin.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I have had a dry skin problem since my military days. This is the first product that worked. Very good.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond has for years been a product name I have found that serves its purpose with integrity and the Foot Cream is no exception. Regular use, morning and night relieves the tight dryness of foot skin without leaving a greasy feeling.  The side effect of its application is beneficial to my well-worn gardening hands.  As a rural resident, living 2 hours from the nearest drugstore,  I especially appreciate the ability to shop online and receive prompt delivery via Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> This product is one that I have purchased frequently in the past. However, the price was what attracted me to buying it on Amazon. Thanks for a great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, at a discount, and delivered fast.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond Foot Cream is the best cream I have ever used on my feet.  It is wonderful how good they feel after I apply the cream</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It healed my cracked feet. I tried so many different products and medications but none of them worked. Gold bond foot cream is the best and I&#x27;m it&#x27;s life time Customer.</li>
    <li> Great for weathered feet</li>
    <li> my wife loves this stuff for that heal area keep it soft</li>
    <li> I purchased this for wife which normally buys frog drug store. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I tend to get dry heels during the summer months, maybe because I wear flip flops around the house and out and about more often. This is the first non-greasy product that actually works and works fast. It is perfect to put on before bed and can be worn during the day if you are wearing socks. I love it and am glad I ordered multiple tubes. It also works on dry rough and chaffed hands!</li>
