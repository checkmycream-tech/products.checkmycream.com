      <li>I love the cream</li>
      <li>This works better than any cream you can buy in the store.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>ITS OK JUST OK</li>
      <li>I do love this cream</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
      <li>I contacted the company to find out about the status of my order and was pleasantly surprized by the prompt, curteous, professional, and kind customer service I received (a perk sorely absent from today&#x27;s market).</li>
      <li>This cream had a effect magic light on my face during 2 days.</li>
      <li>proderma light strong is ok,</li>
      <li>First time I used this product the first thing I&#x27;ve noticed was the great smell.  </li>
      <li>Using it 2x&#x27;s a day was too strong for my skin.</li>
      <li>and it worked fine</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a really strong cheap Hydroxy smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is made from chemicals that work great for an occasional spot.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t work until proDerma light came along</li>
      <li>Works great, especially for my head shots as a performer.</li>
      <li>I tested the cream in first during 3 jous on skin more résistente, that of my feet to see whether I were not allergic or that burned.</li>
      <li>Within a a week I saw a significant lightening of the hyper-pigmentation.</li>
      <li>ALWAYS CLEAN THE AREA BEFORE USING.</li>
      <li>It works much faster than Porcelana, Esoterica or Nadinola because it has more hydroquinone.</li>
      <li>however I&#x27;ve been having to use it by itself because I&#x27;m pregnant and</li>
      <li>areas that were more exposed and darker than my normal skin tone.</li>
      <li>It too strong  and can leave a large amount of redness on your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off mixing crusader and movate by far!</li>
      <li>Overall very good quality and definitely works quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 days now and my skin became very yellow and bright fast</li>
      <li>I will update in about another two months to say if it&#x27;s worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nope, smile.</li>
      <li>Thus I tested this cream on my face right 1 heur end of the afternoon</li>
      <li>I was right to be a skeptic.</li>
      <li>I WOULD JUST USE A WARM WET CLOTH.</li>
      <li>First of all.....</li>
      <li>This claims to be higher</li>
      <li>Not too sure if it actually has 10% HQ in it --</li>
      <li>The reason I did that first was to get the color even then</li>
      <li>Definitely works to lighten your skin but it wont even out blemishes alone, so make sure you are using cocoa or shea butter with it.</li>
      <li>Even after I informed them that I had finally received the original order they did not charge me for the replacement!</li>
      <li>, I like to sleep with the face, washed well with soft and oily soap clean.</li>
      <li>Lastly, there&#x27;s not miracle whitening or bleaching cream out there in the market to deliver excellent results overnight, all products claimed it will, but don&#x27;t be naive to believed it.  </li>
      <li>The third days my face started to peel of a very clear very fine skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this for the purpose of evening out my coloring in certain areas and it hasn&#x27;t worked all.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this product to anyone wo is interested in getting rid of scars asap..^_^</li>
      <li>then I have high hopes!</li>
      <li>And it cost too much for it not to work.</li>
      <li>and I think it really works over a period of time.  </li>
      <li>Used the whole jar and saw no difference.</li>
      <li>However, it does absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>Makes your skin very sticky as well.</li>
      <li>i have tried every type of bleach cream out this one really works</li>
      <li>however it really does work though.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think that this product has 10% hydroquinone because that is prescription strength.</li>
      <li>then secondly it really, really works.  </li>
      <li>it really works.i would recommend this to all my friends and family.and co-worker it takes all the scars off of you.</li>
      <li>really works....</li>
      <li>You DON&#x27;t REALLY HAVE TO USE SOAP AND WATER.</li>
      <li>It absolutely did nothing for me.</li>
      <li>but this stuff really works.</li>
      <li>It works very well upon areas which it is needed...  </li>
      <li>the title of this cream is VERY DECEPTIVE.  </li>
      <li>I used two bottles still I haven&#x27;t seen any results.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s interesting to notice that this product doesn&#x27;t label as 10% Hydroquinone as Active Ingredient.</li>
      <li>Ok so I&#x27;m African American and it worked for me a whole lot</li>
      <li>I have some of the most stubborn cystic acne and dark acne scarring EVER.  </li>
      <li>, well it has being two weeks now and most of the dark spot is gone.</li>
      <li>If your gonna be out in the sun on a particular day, shower thoroughly and use Neutrogena 100 spf sunblock and stay FAR AWAY from this cream since its loaded with oil you will burn to a crisp and re-darken all of your blemishes.</li>
      <li>Because my original order was missing, they quickly sent a replacement order.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand fraudulent businesses! And bare in mind, people pay for reviews now! All the positive comments are fake because THIS DOESN&#x27;T WORK!!! Not at all!! I doubt it has 2% Hydroquinone in it not to talk of 10% HQ. The ponds brightening cream even does a better job! You&#x27;re better off mixing crusader and movate by far! BE WARNED!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s illegal to sell 10% HQ (Without Prescription) in the United States. I used two bottles still I haven&#x27;t seen any results.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s interesting to notice that this product doesn&#x27;t label as 10% Hydroquinone as Active Ingredient. Instead, they use \\&quot;10 HQ\\&quot; which doesn&#x27;t mean that it actually does contain 10% Hydroquinone.  It certainly does contain some sort of Hydroquinone (I am confident that it&#x27;s not more than 2%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a really strong cheap Hydroxy smell.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very light skin Indian man, and I have some scars and pigments on forehead. I have used almost everything you can think of. (I am serious). Instead of wasting your hard earned Dollars on Amazon, I would recommend everyone to go see a Dermatologist.</li>
    <li> First time I used this product the first thing I&#x27;ve noticed was the great smell.  It smells like lotion so even if you used it on your arm and people smells you, they say what&#x27;s the name of your lotion, it smells so good.  then secondly it really, really works.  I&#x27;ve used it in the darkest uneven skin tone like my knees, elbows, knuckles, and some dark  liver spot on top of my hand, my neck, my feet.&lt;br /&gt;skin areas that were more exposed and darker than my normal skin tone. The reason I did that first was to get the color even then&lt;br /&gt;I started using it all over my body, the results were beyond what I&#x27;ve expected, exceedingly.  Although it&#x27;s a little expensive but it&lt;br /&gt;delivers what the product promised.  This was my second order and I&#x27;m very, very happy with the results.  You all out there, try this product and give it ample time to work and you will see the results.  Lastly, there&#x27;s not miracle whitening or bleaching cream out there in the market to deliver excellent results overnight, all products claimed it will, but don&#x27;t be naive to believed it.  all products needs time to obtain the proper and best results.  So far this one really works, you need to be faithful in using them twice a day and follow the products instruction properly.  NO SHORT CUTS AND YOU WILL BE SATISFIED. GO AHEAD ORDER IT.</li>
    <li> proderma light strong is ok, I used cream often it little helpful. its no powerful or any cause. Nope, smile.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this. It absolutely did nothing for me. And it cost too much for it not to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed! Wasted my money! I have yet to see at least a slight change. Nothing happened. No ingredients label, no instructions, nothing. This should not be on the market !</li>
    <li> I have used this product inthe pst and it worked fine however they must have taken out the main ingredient.  It does not work anymore.  I have been on three jars and nothing has happpened.</li>
    <li> First of all.....the title of this cream is VERY DECEPTIVE.  Although it says 10 Hydroquinone....that does not mean by any means that it&#x27;s 10% Hydroquinone.  I hope this take this product off the market OR change the title.</li>
    <li> This product does not work...It&#x27;s a scam. Used the whole jar and saw no difference. Please do not buy it.</li>
    <li> I was right to be a skeptic. I go little to no results, and my product is just about gone. Save your money. PLEASE. Thus product is a SHAM! My face is Carmel. I used it with Kojic Acid Soap. The soap was doing the working, but this ugh! Wasted Money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the purpose of evening out my coloring in certain areas and it hasn&#x27;t worked all.  The only effect I saw was that the area became extremely dry.</li>
    <li> I have some of the most stubborn cystic acne and dark acne scarring EVER.  This did NOTHING to fade the acne scars but it works as a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I do love this cream and I think it really works over a period of time.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
    <li> I used an entire jar of this product, &amp; it did not work. I bought a product from the drug store with 3% hydroquinone, &amp; I saw a slight change, but I saw no change with the Proderma Light 10, which supposedly has 10% hydroquinone. There was no listing of ingredients on the Proderma Light product, &amp; when I contacted the company to find out the exact percentage of hydroquinone, I dealt with an exceptionally rude representative, Jacqueline Carter, &amp; she refused to tell me the percentage of hydroquinone in this product, which is a huge red flag. Buyer, beware!</li>
    <li> I been using this product for 2yrs and it works great! I use it at night. Using it 2x&#x27;s a day was too strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> this product didn&#x27;t provide the results I was looking for.  I will continue to search for a product that lightens my skin.</li>
    <li> I used the product two times everyday until it ran out and there hasn&#x27;t been any difference in my complexion. Buyers beware, this product is no good.</li>
    <li> This works better than any cream you can buy in the store.  You just need to be careful where you put it!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these. I&#x27;ve used all of them and after 5 months still absolutely no improvement! They&#x27;re selling a moisturising cream with a fake label. Stay away from these conmen!!</li>
    <li> i tried it for a month, didnt see any effect...ambi works better than this&lt;br /&gt;i do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like it at all,Didn&#x27;t do nothing on my skin,I doubt if it is 105 hydo.&lt;br /&gt;would not advise it.</li>
    <li> Previously bought this product and it worked well,  now it appears diluted.  I don&#x27;t think it is more than 4%</li>
    <li> I am not seeing any change since using this product.  My 2% hydroquinone works better than this! I would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> The product work very good it has a very good prize for the size &amp; large size bottle smell very good</li>
    <li> I have used creams before, I have even used this brand before they made changes…or got kicked off ebay.&lt;br /&gt;It worked back then, it doesn&#x27;t work as well now.  Back then it was only a 4% cream.  This claims to be higher (I think that is a lie).&lt;br /&gt;I use creams like this to clear dark spots on my face.  this one just does not work.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered a product from ProDerma. Unfortunately, my package was very late due to circumstances outside of ProDerma&#x27;s control. I contacted the company to find out about the status of my order and was pleasantly surprized by the prompt, curteous, professional, and kind customer service I received (a perk sorely absent from today&#x27;s market). They bent over backward to accommodate me, which is the reason I gave them 5 stars; their service is excellent. Because my original order was missing, they quickly sent a replacement order. Even after I informed them that I had finally received the original order they did not charge me for the replacement! I know that I can trust ProDerma with future orders, knowing that they care about their customers. At this point I don&#x27;t know how well the product works because I have not used it long enough, but if the product is even half as good as the customer service is...then I have high hopes!</li>
    <li> Not too sure if it actually has 10% HQ in it -- but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  Have been using it nearly thre weeks and it&#x27;s done -- did not see no visible signs of lightening at all -- and I am not a very dark person (carmael) in colour but have a few superficial scars that I wanted to see if this cream would work.  Best of Luck to those who purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a month since I have begun using this product and I have yet to see the slightest results even with me following a very strict routine as well as diet for the skin. Everyone is different so it may work for the next person, but it is not for me.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this two times now.  I am haveing IPL laser done on my legs to get rid of sun damage and splotchy red colors.  This is a probably the best lightening cream you can buy for your body for the price.  I am still in the process of using.  Since it is being used on the legs it does require a lot of product.  It is strong and I cut back to every other day then built up to once a day.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I just started using it. I like that it isn&#x27;t drying like other lightening products. It has a nice smell. It is working fast to fade hyper pigmentation left from bumps on my arms and back.</li>
    <li> Thought this would get out some dark spots, NOT. It has the smell and consistency of Ponds, frankly that is what I think it is. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I feel this was a complete waste of my money and I would never recommend it to anyone.  It did not work!</li>
    <li> I TOOK A BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURE TO SHOW THAT THIS WORKS. IF ANYONE KNWS HOW TO UPLOAD PICS PLEASE HELP ME..... BUT ANYHOW I USE THE PRODUCT ONCE IN THE MORNING AND AFTERNOON. ALWAYS CLEAN THE AREA BEFORE USING. You DON&#x27;t REALLY HAVE TO USE SOAP AND WATER. I WOULD JUST USE A WARM WET CLOTH. BUT I WOULD ALSO LEAVE A SMALL AMOUNT ON BECAUSE IT DISSOLVES INTO THE SKIN.</li>
    <li> Definitely works to lighten your skin but it wont even out blemishes alone, so make sure you are using cocoa or shea butter with it. Also, Be consistent, 2 times a day, everyday. It is very thick so if you do not scrub and cleanse your skin well in the shower the cream will not absorb completely when you go to reapply it (therefore don&#x27;t use Dove soap since its 1/4 moisturizing cream and will not completely clarify the residue from your skin). Make sure not to overdo it, you only need a thin layer, its so thick that a second or third layer of cream won&#x27;t absorb into your skin anyway. If your gonna be out in the sun on a particular day, shower thoroughly and use Neutrogena 100 spf sunblock and stay FAR AWAY from this cream since its loaded with oil you will burn to a crisp and re-darken all of your blemishes. For that matter, anytime your in the sun, cover yourself. Overall very good quality and definitely works quickly. Its not 100% permanent though, so you might need to use something like Ambi 2% HQ to maintain your even tone.</li>
    <li> It seemed to work well when I used it alongside Retin A cream however I&#x27;ve been having to use it by itself because I&#x27;m pregnant and Retin A isn&#x27;t safe for me to use.  by itself its okay. however it really does work though.</li>
    <li> Though not recommended for use on the face, it does work so well that if you are careful, can be used there.</li>
    <li> I used this product two times daily and have yet to see any results. A total waste of money. Does not live up to expectations. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does not work and will not see results at all I followed directions and nothing a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I been applying the cream as instructed for 11 days now and have not seen any  changes. Truly disappointed with the product, I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> The strongest prescription vailable on the market is 4%, and it costs about 50 bucks because it&#x27;s considered a \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; and prescription plans won&#x27;t cover it. Well, this is cheaper even with shipping, and it&#x27;s a miracle lightener for dark scar pigmentation. It works much faster than Porcelana, Esoterica or Nadinola because it has more hydroquinone. The American Dermatology Association does not have 1 documented case of skin cancer or internal cancer in 40 years. True, use sunscreen and be careful, but this is a deal that you can&#x27;t pass up. Works great, especially for my head shots as a performer.</li>
    <li> It too strong  and can leave a large amount of redness on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend a 2 -4% not a 10%</li>
    <li> Been using esoterica for a few years....no changes in age spots.  Tried proderma for one week and all spots have faded.  It&#x27;s really incredible.  I was skeptical as i am with everything but this stuff really works.</li>
    <li> really works....fast results...smells great...highly recommend this product to anyone wo is interested in getting rid of scars asap..^_^ love it</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 2 twice daily for 2 months with no change on hyperpigmentation on arm and face. Can use it on your face if careful.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if changes do occur.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find this type of product with this strength...  It works very well upon areas which it is needed...  I will definitely purchase it again...</li>
    <li> I love the cream it really works.i would recommend this to all my friends and family.and co-worker it takes all the scars off of you.</li>
    <li> My wife says it seems to be working on a dark spot on her arm.  We will probably reorder in the near future.</li>
    <li> Removing dark spots very slow.  very slow for me.  need something stronger and faster.&lt;br /&gt;will not buy again.  try something else</li>
    <li> I DID ORDER IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT CLEARS MY FACE WHICH THEY SAY NOT TO USE IT ON. I USE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT. ITS OK JUST OK FOR THE OTHER AREA. I WILL SEE AFTER I USE THE SECOND, NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSED SO FAR</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;m African American and it worked for me a whole lot so if you don&#x27;t see results in a day just give it time and do as it tells you. If it worked for me it will definently work for you if you are Caucasian or etc with lighter skin tones.</li>
    <li> This works on areas where there are scars or brown spots.  Areas that were not dark when you were born.  It is not supposed to lighten your natural skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those reviews that state that they put it  &amp;#34;all over your body&amp;#34; - stop doing that.  This is made from chemicals that work great for an occasional spot.  It&#x27;s not good for you to be absorbing it into all of your skin tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to make your overall skin color different, it would be much safer to use something natural like tumeric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the smell:  It&#x27;s very terrible and strong to me.  I have bad allergies and would never get something that smells like this.  BUT I BUY IT ANYWAY.  Even though it smells disgusting.  Because that&#x27;s how good it works for scars, freckles, and other unsightly age / dark spots.</li>
    <li> I finished 2 bottles of 10% and one of 5% and sow nothing !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a little difference but probably because of the other things I used. I used it to even my skin after a body fraxel treatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont wast your money. I would recommend glutathione since its safer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 days now and my skin became very yellow and bright fast wow! I love this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on ebay a month ago.For what it&#x27;s worth i can say so far i have noticed a slight change in my complexion.I will update in about another two months to say if it&#x27;s worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today, i have not seen any further changes to my complexion.I really don&#x27;t think that this product has 10% hydroquinone because that is prescription strength.So i will say that this product is not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, it&#x27;s all a hoax!And yes, i used it everyday so far.UPDATED ON 09/27/12</li>
    <li> Wonderful great product works like magic I love this product will buy more love using it best product love it</li>
    <li> I had spots from 3 year bedbug infestation. In 3 weeks I see a DRASTIC CHANGE. Yes I am buying more</li>
    <li> This is is not 10% , this does not work... I had been using this for about 3 weeks and it has not lightened my knees... The ambi with 2% works better</li>
    <li> i have tried every type of bleach cream out this one really works i loved it i have recommended this cream to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Works great on my neck. Within a a week I saw a significant lightening of the hyper-pigmentation. The hyper-pigmentation on my arms are more stubborn. Smells nice and smooth texture. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Product has not done what was advertised,  Would not recommend this to anyone!!! Makes your skin very sticky as well.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get past the smell to use it consistently. It is very strong, and people notice when you wear it!</li>
    <li> I cannot what I think. Can be that each one is different or should make analyze this cream in a laboratory. I explain you, my mother is like Beyonce my father like Steve Wonder. Me I am rather like my father. With the winter clothings my skin cleared up of 3 tons of the neck until before foot like my mother, but does the exposed parts have the ambient temperature even in winter that in summer become darker than my father (perhaps mechanism of defence of my melanin)? feet, hands and my face. What worried me more it is the face, because to put bodystockings and décoltés that my chest shifts digracieusement and my before arm. I tested the cream in first during 3 jous on skin more résistente, that of my feet to see whether I were not allergic or that burned. No result I thought that is just a cold cream. I do not have a skin acne sufferer and my skin is very dry. But the cosmetics cause impurities on my face. However the pomade wilfred with suffers is grease and hot, on my face every three months have a effect light. Thus I tested this cream on my face right 1 heur end of the afternoon, I like to sleep with the face, washed well with soft and oily soap clean. This cream had a effect magic light on my face during 2 days. But the second day I felt the lightning on my face, this cream I supported it only 15min, I washed my face. The third days my face started to peel of a very clear very fine skin. I washed my face with the water-ice floe and the skin of my face became very white and taken off, I floated it with a soft sponge well foaming and all the old skin left, my face was then pink. Three days later became like my chest, therefore I succeeded in having the side portrait with a uniform and goog colour like beyonce or my mother. I understood that one thus needed patience with the feet and the hands. At the end of three weeks they are lost 2 tons without burning and peeling. The surprise is that I do not have problem of skin dark coast articulation of the feet and thehands. I think that in two week still, I will have the feet and the maisn like my face</li>
    <li> Dont buy.  if this was Hydro 10% you would have immediate results and that would be a prescription strength.  However, it does absolutely nothing.  Save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my neck and it leave a dark spot everything i try didn&#x27;t work until proDerma light came along, well it has being two weeks now and most of the dark spot is gone. Thanks to this wonderful cream.</li>
