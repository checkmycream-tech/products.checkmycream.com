<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Saves my face from aging</li>
    <li> I have been using Skinceuticals for years and love almost all their products. They don&#x27;t irritate your skin and do what they promise. I really love the Phloetin CF. My skin looks healthy and not red or irritated. I use one pump and it covers my whole face.</li>
    <li> I use this every day before my moisturizer to protect against sun damage and my skin is glowing.  No more dark spots and improved skin texture.  I don&#x27;t leave home without it!  Doesn&#x27;t have the sticky texture that some vitamin C products have.</li>
    <li> Ilike this product my skin look bettet</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my skin except for make it sting a little when applied, but that I expected from the alcohol it contains.  It is tinted, so it gives the impression your skin is more even in tone, but does not actually do anything.  I have been using it for weeks, not change.  I would spend the money on laser treatments or the cheaper version of this product that is half the price.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a box that had clearly been re-sealed, the contents of the product were dripping throughout the box, there were no instructions within the box (dead giveaway for anyone who buys this product- instructions are always inside the box) and the bottle top was not on securely, or something....it was a MESS! But whatever it was, it was NOT something I would have even considered trying to put on my face, let alone pay that kind of money for. You are better off buying from a retail store, spending the extra $ and ensuring you are getting the real deal.</li>
    <li> Love this product! One of the top products i have ever used! Love the new packaging as it is easier to travel with than the glass bottle. Helps prevent against future sun damage!</li>
    <li> awesome and can already see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I wonder if this product was old. Not same consistency I was used to.</li>
    <li> Seeing results takes time but I believe I&#x27;m seeing them after 2 months.</li>
    <li> these products are fantastic</li>
    <li> My daughter swears she has seen a difference in her skin&#x27;s texture since using this product.  In fact, she now wears no base.  Expensive but what is good skin worth?&lt;br /&gt;Ordering here saved her almost $40! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Sorry to give this product a low rating but it did nothing for me.  I&#x27;m 63 years old and have a few sun spots on my cheek area.  After hearing a doctor praise this product on the Dr. Oz show (she used it herself) I was  anxious to give it a try. I have been using it as directed for 2 months now and have seen no results.  Considering the price, I was hoping to see at least some change but saw nothing.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Its my second week with Phloretin CF. Results started to appear. I hoped to reduce my dark spots, but so far no improvements. I noticed that skin become more elastic and appears firmer than before. I expected immediate effect from such expensive treatment. It seems 30 ml will last for 1,5 month only.</li>
    <li> The crummy vendor has yet to send this product!!  Now what am I supposed to do?  I will have to dispute the charge on my card I suppose.</li>
    <li> Has been my the one product I have been using since discovered a few years ago. Brightens the skin and worth the cost. Lasts about 3-4 months. First time using the gel and so not sure if will last as long or longer than the standard serum. It is nice that is has a pump and you know exactly how many pumps (2 for the face) to use.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested this product!  I&#x27;ve only been using Skinceuticals for 3 weeks, but I am seeing a slight difference in the texture of my skin!  Can&#x27;t wait to to see the end results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this one more than one month, no clearly result, may be need more time? and this is very expensive for such a small amount!</li>
    <li> SKINCEUTICALS PHLORETIN CF IS FOR THE OILY OR COMBINATION SKIN SO IT WORKS GREAT WITH MY SKIN.  THIS HAS BEEN RATED GREAT BY EVERY SKIN CRE SITE I TRUST AND ALLURE MAGAZINE KEEPS VOTING IT AS TOPS I TRUS TECHNOLOGY FOR SKINCARE.</li>
    <li> It is what my doctor told me to get after I had my skin lasered. It is cheaper here and worth it.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for the last 6 months and purchased the original product from an authorized rep for Skinceuticals.  The bottle I received from GEO Marketing is different in its appearance, constancy and smell.  It’s more of a liquid than a gel, has a brownish color to it, where the original product I purchased is thicker and lighter in color and has a distinct smell.  Either the manufacture is very inconsistent or the bottle I received may not be genuine.</li>
    <li> This gel not only makes it feel wonderful e but it looks wonderful too. It appears greasy when first applied but quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
    <li> Great for sun sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Pricey....but good antioxidant serum. I will purchase this product again</li>
    <li> I love this gel. The formulation is easier to apply and there is less waste than the original liquid formula. I just wish the bottle lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I decided to use Skinceuticals as my dermatologist decided that it would help my skin. So far, I&#x27;m very happy with the results. My skin looks more equal and my pores look smaller.</li>
    <li> After spending way too much trying to find the right skin products for my sensitive skin, I now see an aesthetician, who knows much more than I about products.  She recommended this one, and I use it, followed by sun shield, after cleansing in the morning.  My skin feels better than ever.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it for me.</li>
