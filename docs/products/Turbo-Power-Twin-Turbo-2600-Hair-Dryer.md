      <li>I love this powerful light weight dryer.</li>
      <li>Love how powerful it is.</li>

      <li>It dries the hair quickly and leaves it silky.  </li>
      <li>Although it was a good buy, it wasn&#x27;t exactly a bargain as the price was not very far from what I could get on a &#x27;brick and mortar&#x27; store.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for professional quality, this is what many salons use for blow-outs.</li>
      <li>Not as powerful on lower power</li>

      <li>Absolutely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Powerful but light enough to maneuver easily.</li>
      <li>My favorite hair dryer, powerful, totally recommended!</li>
      <li>It gets my hair dry fast and very smooth with few fly aways.  </li>
      <li>and I would never have any other hair dryer or recommend any other one as this one is perfect.</li>
      <li>Be sure to return within the given time period if you find it does not get hot enough.</li>
      <li>I hope it will last many years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My first one lasted almost 10 years.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>I bought my first one from my hairdresser who was using it in her salon.  </li>
      <li>Bought my own 2600 Twin Tubo after my other brand salon dryer burned out.  </li>
      <li>It gets really hot fast</li>
      <li>This dryer blows nicely, but does not get hot enough to dry hair quickly.</li>
      <li>I felt this dryer was well worth the money since I found myself buying new inexpensive ones month after month.  </li>
      <li>If I move it a certain way it works</li>
      <li>Fast drying.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping has lots of power my friend recommended this blower she loves it</li>
      <li>Really like it.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced for the quality.</li>
      <li>I am very displeased with this product.</li>
      <li>First, this dryer was listed as new and was not sent in a box, it arrived wrapped in a plastic bag.  </li>
      <li>lastly when I borrowed it most recently from her for the summer.  </li>
      <li>because not only is it light weight, it cut my drying time down, and it helped smooth out my hair.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so powerful and dries hair so much faster than standard hairdryers and its not even that loud!</li>
      <li>As of know it has been what expected: reliable, and comfortable in hand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fast but gentle at the same time !</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
      <li>Specifically, this is what my Dominican beautician suggested I use for my natural hair, as I had to temporarily part ways with her.</li>
      <li>I did not like my dryer as I am a professional hair dresser</li>
      <li>The dryer is nice and QUIET, but is a bit heavy not crazy heavy.</li>
      <li>I find it last much longer than the cheaper ones , over ten years using it every day.</li>
      <li>I had to super glue it down so the blow dryer wouldn&#x27;t suck hair into the back of it.</li>
      <li>After years of burning out hair dryers, I finally found one that dries my hair quickly and didn&#x27;t burn out after using it for a few months.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used friend hair dryers in the past which are cheap and don&#x27;t last long</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised it lasted that long ...</li>
      <li>This dryer cuts my drying and styling time in half, it works very well</li>
      <li>I am sorry I waited so long to treat myself to such a nice experience.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this blow dryer, I bought it because it&#x27;s the one that the lady at the salon uses.  It gets really hot fast and it has four heat settings (low-cold, high-cold, low-hot, high-hot).  I use it with a round bristle brush and it staightens my thick curly hair in less than half an hour and leaves lots of volume.  You won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0017WNHYG Turbo Power Twin Turbo 2600 Hair Dryer]] I bought this for my mom&#x27;s beauty salon; she had some of these but they were worn out, so basically she knew what to expect from this product.  Although it was a good buy, it wasn&#x27;t exactly a bargain as the price was not very far from what I could get on a &#x27;brick and mortar&#x27; store. As of know it has been what expected: reliable, and comfortable in hand. I (my mom) would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy that I paid 80 bucks for something that wouldnt last me a month. I am very displeased with this product.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful on lower power</li>
    <li> Great purchase, great product, very fast shipment- love it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even remember how long I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer I but it&#x27;s been at least 15 years, I nabbed it off my mum and I have a vague memory of when she had it and I must of been 6 or 7. I&#x27;ve never had to replace it  or any parts and it&#x27;s still going strong and I&#x27;m 24! I&#x27;ve used friend hair dryers in the past which are cheap and don&#x27;t last long and they&#x27;re rubbish in comparison I this hair dryer and I use it at least 5 times a week and I would never have any other hair dryer or recommend any other one as this one is perfect. The money people waste buying replacement ones after a year or so may as well have just forked out up front for this one as you&#x27;ll save money in the long run! It&#x27;s so powerful and dries hair so much faster than standard hairdryers and its not even that loud!</li>
    <li> Super love it.  The best in blow drying!  This is what the Dominican hair salons use.</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer ever.  Bite the bullet and spend the cash.  It stands the test of time.  My sister and I have been sharing her 2600 Twin Turbo for years (11) when we lived at home with the parents, then after college when we lived together and lastly when I borrowed it most recently from her for the summer.  Bought my own 2600 Twin Tubo after my other brand salon dryer burned out.  The Twin Turbo is powerful and all one would expect from a salon dryer.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer !!!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is worth every penny! I read an article by a top hair stylist who recommended this dryer.  So when my over $100 infrared hair dryer broke after one year, I decided to give this one a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did because not only is it light weight, it cut my drying time down, and it helped smooth out my hair. I never knew a dryer could do that, especially when all my other dryers would leave my natural curly hair looking frizzy.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair dryer, powerful, totally recommended!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer! Same dryer as my hair stylist.</li>
    <li> Fast drying. Great product. Good price.</li>
    <li> I did not like my dryer as I am a professional hair dresser it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough it was such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer blows nicely, but does not get hot enough to dry hair quickly. It takes a really long time to dry hair, and it comes up frizzy due to drying it with low heat. I waited too long to return it, so am stuck with it.Going to use it to dry my dogs hair after bathing. Be sure to return within the given time period if you find it does not get hot enough. Mine may be defective.</li>
    <li> Best blow dry that I have ever owned.  Worth the money.  Cord never gets tied up</li>
    <li> The best hair drier I&#x27;ve ever bought! It was recommended to me by my hairstylist! It&#x27;s fast but gentle at the same time ! Just fab!</li>
    <li> Really like it.  It dries the hair quickly and leaves it silky.  It has help improve the quality of my hair.  Would highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works nice.  My complaint is the location of the on/off switch.  I tend to accidentally turn it off as I am moving it around styling my hair.  The handle design could be better.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping has lots of power my friend recommended this blower she loves it so I am very excited to use mine</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer out there! Doesn&#x27;t damage hair, and helps it look great!</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  I find it last much longer than the cheaper ones , over ten years using it every day.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She said that she loves it!</li>
    <li> This dryer cuts my drying and styling time in half, it works very well and I am very happy to have bought it.</li>
    <li> I had this hair dryer for six (6) years. I&#x27;m surprised it lasted that long ...given my previous experiences with other dryers that didn&#x27;t even reach a year of use. Absolutely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. Good delivery.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She has evev reconended to familes and friend. The item has meat all expectations. Thank you</li>
    <li> A must-have for thick, Asian hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for years now and it works just as well as it did the day I bought it. High-powered and hot, which creates the perfect blowout with or without a round brush. I really love this hair-dryer, and I take it with me whenever I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update--- 2 years post review and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying I LOVE this blow dryer!  After years of burning out hair dryers, I finally found one that dries my hair quickly and didn&#x27;t burn out after using it for a few months.  I bought my first one from my hairdresser who was using it in her salon.  My first one lasted almost 10 years.  I felt this dryer was well worth the money since I found myself buying new inexpensive ones month after month.  I gave this one only 2 stars for a few reasons.  First, this dryer was listed as new and was not sent in a box, it arrived wrapped in a plastic bag.  This made me think it had been previously used.  Second, after using it for two years it is not working properly.  It seems one of the wires is loose.  If I move it a certain way it works but then when I move it again it does not work.  Such a pain when trying to dry my hair.  I am currently purchasng another one, this time I am buying the 3200 ceramic and ionic twin turbo.  I hope it arrives unused and lasts for more than 2 years.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer after my hair stylist suggested it.  She said it was what she was trained with at the Paul Mitchell Academy.  It gets my hair dry fast and very smooth with few fly aways.  It is def worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great dryer and is drying my hair faster.  I choose 2600 as I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t feel I needed the 3200.  The dryer is nice and QUIET, but is a bit heavy not crazy heavy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel that this blow dryer works any better than the more cost effective blow dryers. The one annoying thing is the placement of the switches. My hand keeps hitting and switching the blow dryer setting as I hold it to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this powerful light weight dryer. It leaves my hair shinny with lots of body. My granddaughter recommended it to me. She loves her dryer also.</li>
    <li> This is a must have!!! Can&#x27;t thank you enough!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife replacing the 200.00 plus hair dryer which burnt out after only a couple of years. She is very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Purchased this blow dryer based on a recommendation from my hair stylist. One of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in years. Powerful but light enough to maneuver easily. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your arm down. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> this is a great powerful hair dryer</li>
    <li> The wire mesh over the vacuum in the back wasn&#x27;t even attached. I had to super glue it down so the blow dryer wouldn&#x27;t suck hair into the back of it.</li>
    <li> Like many people, I have been buying the very cheap hairdryers sold at consumer retail stores like KMart and Walmart. I assumed they were good enough but they never last very long. I finally decided to get a pro model. This hairdryer is what my hair stylist has so I decided to try it. I am sorry I waited so long to treat myself to such a nice experience. The quality of the air flow, the excellent sound and the overall feel is well worth the cost. I hope it will last many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the diffuser had come with it. However I have one on order. Also I took off a star because I would like high heat on low fan to be just a little hotter.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great seller</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves it. She says she can style it, just the way her hairdresser does.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced for the quality. If you&#x27;re looking for professional quality, this is what many salons use for blow-outs. Specifically, this is what my Dominican beautician suggested I use for my natural hair, as I had to temporarily part ways with her.</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer for the price. My last one I had for 15 years!!!</li>
    <li> Liked it so much, bought two!</li>
    <li> Love how powerful it is. I&#x27;m so glad my hair stylist recommended it!</li>
