<ol>
      <li>I was blessed with the best hair -</li>
      <li>Best product i have used for texturizing !</li>
      <li>In the morning I wake up with the best waves.</li>
      <li>Supposed to be great stuff!!!</li>
      <li>the best one of which is now discontinued.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
      <li>I feel beautiful!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering this product for almost 2 years and loved it!  </li>
      <li>But for 5 minutes and then the beautiful curls fall away</li>
      <li>not as great as i anticipated...</li>
      <li>This product along with the sea salt spray is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works great.</li>
      <li>But adding a touch of water works great.</li>
      <li>I will probably keep searching for a product that works for me, but I would return to using this if my mission isn&#x27;t successful.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit overpowering, but it is coconut, so if you like that smell, it is a good one for you.</li>
      <li>This creates that texture party that curls love to stay for!</li>
      <li>Looking into purchasing more Not Your Mothers products!</li>
      <li>its a great, easy summer style tool.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and makes my hair curl great with a curling iron.</li>
      <li>You need to warm it up in your palms vigorously and then apply.</li>
      <li>This product made beautiful curls but super crunchy.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try out more \\&quot;not your mother&#x27;s\\&quot; products :)!</li>
      <li>This is the first curl cream that I have ever re-purchased---it&#x27;s that good!  </li>
      <li>Sure it has a great smile</li>
      <li>The results are pretty great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure my jeans look better on me now that my hair is so adorable.</li>
      <li>so it will look like it has more oomf...</li>
      <li>i used it with the sea salt spray and it was ok...</li>
      <li>I am sure my daughter wil try it tho, so iI will gift it to her soon.</li>
      <li>I think the spray is better.</li>
      <li>It resulted in crunchy 80s hair instead of &amp;#34;soft, beaky waves.&amp;#34; My friend uses the spray and it works much better, will buy that instead.</li>
      <li>kind of how you apply a wax, get it warm and spread across your hands) and then smooth your hands lightly over/through your hair.</li>
      <li>Will be repurchasing :)</li>
      <li>must say that I am pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I love the way it gives my hair that separated, tousled look, however I think it leaves quite a bit of residue on.  </li>
      <li>and this has been better than the years I have used Aveda and smells better.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this would be the perfect companion to the beach babe spray, it didn&#x27;t do much for y do, but I did like the texture &amp; scent of the product.</li>
      <li>Great for my daughter&#x27;s naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>It also helps to give me good volume, even on the top of my hair (which is usually very flat).</li>
      <li>Light and powerful</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t like putting in any product that won&#x27;t still be good the next day (products that are too oily or crispy).</li>
      <li>It gets stringy pretty easy throughout the day</li>
      <li>I have tried sprays, waxes, creams, serums, oils, and so many different products and this one does it better.</li>
      <li>I get the most lovely, loose ringlets and TONS of compliments!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like it, but I mix it with water and put it on right after washing and conditioning my hair in the shower.</li>
      <li>Im African American and it works great.</li>
      <li>you have the same kind of hair I do, I really suggest trying it out.</li>
      <li>This product is not so great but could be if they changed the icky residue that it leaves in your hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot though because it is pretty goopy.</li>
      <li>I use the Hot Air curling iron</li>
      <li>The price is higher here than at Walgreens</li>
      <li>and it really helps a lot!</li>
      <li>This works really well with the sea spray!</li>
      <li>Reminds you of summer ;)</li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Might work if your hair is VERY oily.</li>
      <li>I really bought this product as an experiment.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair can get sticky.  </li>
      <li>sure to use a small glob, mix it with water in your hands, and make sure to really work it through well....then blow dry.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to wear my hair down, two days in a row, until now.....</li>
      <li>This has worked better than any other texturizing spray I&#x27;ve used!</li>
      <li>But it does give my hair a new sort of feel, and gives it some volume!</li>
      <li>I use this everyday before going to school, so fast &amp; easy to use.</li>
      <li>This cream has blown me away; it makes my hair very soft, and makes my curls shiny, and defined.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your time or money on this!</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s the consistency of snot, but I just add a little water to a nickel sized dollop and rub between my palms, and it is fine.  </li>
      <li>LOVE wearing what little hair I have in big, bouncy waves.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this to make my hair wavey because I don&#x27;t have any natural eave whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect the beachy waves that others will get...but try it for the volume and texture that your hair naturally doesn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>I do have some natural wave in my hair</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is more like a thick paste/glue that ripped out my hairs when I tried to &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; my hands through it, it&#x27;s that sticky.</li>
      <li>I used it in my wet hair like the directions say (even dripping wet right out of the shower) but it was much to sticky to spread and seemed to clump where ever I put it.</li>
      <li>even the next morning it feels so soft.</li>
      <li>has kind of a weird smell to it</li>
      <li>Well, it kind of does, but they are doing it wrong.</li>
      <li>to the bottom half of my dry hair and then give my entire head a good spray down with NYM&#x27;s dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>My hair is long and naturally wavy, but needs some product to encourage the waves.</li>
      <li>I have very long, naturally wavy hair, and I apply this in the shower after I&#x27;m done conditioning my hair.  </li>
      <li>I notice the extra dirt left on the bristles of my brush too and it sucks to clean it off.</li>

<li> Spray all over hair and let dry or dry with diffuser.</li>
<li> Then I wrap it in a towel, and eventually I sleep on it partially dry.</li>
<li> If I don&#x27;t let it dry all the way, I use a diffuser on medium heat and speed and dry it the rest of the way.  </li>
<li> air dry</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single day</li>

<li> It actually does make your hair a little wavy</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with my not wavy not straight hair for a couple years now.  </li>
<li> At the end of the day, I brush my hair and I can feel the residue on it, which makes my hair harder to brush through.  </li>
<li> I have to water this down a bit - it&#x27;s too sticky for long hair.</li>
<li> It DOES NOT make my hair beachy and wavy sadly because my hair texture just isn&#x27;t naturally right for it.</li>
<li> After I&#x27;m out of the shower, I shake my hair a few times and then DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT until it&#x27;s dry or almost dry</li>
<li> Made it incredibly dry!!!</li>
<li> Anyhow, other reviewers complained that this product had the consistency of boogers and dries gross in their hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is not so great but could be if they changed the icky residue that it leaves in your hair.  Sure it has a great smile but that&#x27;s not why you should buy a product. It actually does make your hair a little wavy but it also makes it heavy and sort of oily looking too.  But that&#x27;s not my biggest complaint about this product.  It leaves a white grainy white residue all in your hair that looks like either you have dandruff or lice. If they would somehow eliminate this residue from the product then I would&#x27;ve probably given it four out of five stars.</li>
    <li> I have ultra thick and wavy, frizzy hair.  I use just over a hershey kiss-sized amount of this product and run it through the lower half of my hair after a shower.  I love the way it gives my hair that separated, tousled look, however I think it leaves quite a bit of residue on.  At the end of the day, I brush my hair and I can feel the residue on it, which makes my hair harder to brush through.  I notice the extra dirt left on the bristles of my brush too and it sucks to clean it off. I used several other products that don&#x27;t do this...the best one of which is now discontinued.  I will keep this product around though and will use it up because it does make my hair look the way I want it too.  After it&#x27;s gone I will probably keep searching for a product that works for me, but I would return to using this if my mission isn&#x27;t successful.  I just don&#x27;t like that I feel like I have to wash it out every time I use it because of the gunky coat it leaves on at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is more like a thick paste/glue that ripped out my hairs when I tried to &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; my hands through it, it&#x27;s that sticky. It resulted in crunchy 80s hair instead of &amp;#34;soft, beaky waves.&amp;#34; My friend uses the spray and it works much better, will buy that instead. Do not waste your time or money on this!</li>
    <li> So I bought this product at the grocery store. It was on sale...so I figured, what the heck, and I bought it. I have very fine, straight blonde hair. I didn&#x27;t expect this to make my hair wavey because I don&#x27;t have any natural eave whatsoever. I really bought this product as an experiment. Volumizing creams have never worked for me, and I unfortunately have been cursed with oily hair. It gets stringy pretty easy throughout the day ): I kinda figured I needed to open myself to other products that may boast different results just to see what it would do.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I am pleased with this product. It DOES NOT make my hair beachy and wavy sadly because my hair texture just isn&#x27;t naturally right for it. But it does give my hair a new sort of feel, and gives it some volume! I tease my hair a lot so it will look like it has more oomf...and this helped it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;If you have the same kind of hair I do, I really suggest trying it out. Don&#x27;t expect the beachy waves that others will get...but try it for the volume and texture that your hair naturally doesn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use a small glob, mix it with water in your hands, and make sure to really work it through well....then blow dry.</li>
    <li> This works really well with the sea spray! After they discontinued the JF wave spray (why?!?) I&#x27;ve tried every product on the shelf. My hair is long and naturally wavy, but needs some product to encourage the waves. I put on some Moroccan syling cream, saturate with the wave spray, scrunch this stuff in and go! I don&#x27;t use a lot though because it is pretty goopy. You need to warm it up in your palms vigorously and then apply.</li>
    <li> This cream is sort of a gel-cream combo. I like it, but I mix it with water and put it on right after washing and conditioning my hair in the shower. Then I wrap it in a towel, and eventually I sleep on it partially dry. In the morning I wake up with the best waves. It sounds weird, but it really works. The smell is a bit overpowering, but it is coconut, so if you like that smell, it is a good one for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with my not wavy not straight hair for a couple years now.  I feel beautiful!  It might have even made me appear skinnier.  I&#x27;m sure my jeans look better on me now that my hair is so adorable.</li>
    <li> very thick and sticky...didn&#x27;t make my hair soft...made it crunchy.</li>
    <li> This is the first curl cream that I have ever re-purchased---it&#x27;s that good!  Yes, it&#x27;s the consistency of snot, but I just add a little water to a nickel sized dollop and rub between my palms, and it is fine.  I have very long, naturally wavy hair, and I apply this in the shower after I&#x27;m done conditioning my hair.  After I&#x27;m out of the shower, I shake my hair a few times and then DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT until it&#x27;s dry or almost dry (that&#x27;s the key).  If I don&#x27;t let it dry all the way, I use a diffuser on medium heat and speed and dry it the rest of the way.  I get the most lovely, loose ringlets and TONS of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bonus Tip:  To perk up next-day hair, in a small spray bottle of water, add a small amount of this hair cream and shake until dissolved.  Spray all over hair and let dry or dry with diffuser.</li>
    <li> Im African American and it works great. I ket my hair air dry and it didnt  get frizzy and then the next day it still held. I would definitely reckoned this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried sprays, waxes, creams, serums, oils, and so many different products and this one does it better. I have very thick, wavy, coarse hair. If I want to wear it wavy and not have to straighten it, but want to keep the curls together and avoid having puffy hair, this does the trick. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single day so I don&#x27;t like putting in any product that won&#x27;t still be good the next day (products that are too oily or crispy). Anyhow, other reviewers complained that this product had the consistency of boogers and dries gross in their hair. Well, it kind of does, but they are doing it wrong. You have to put a small amount in your palm and them rub your hands together (kind of how you apply a wax, get it warm and spread across your hands) and then smooth your hands lightly over/through your hair. The results are pretty great. One last note: do not try and straighten your hair with this product in. It makes it extremely difficult. So apply it only if you are committing to the wavy look until your next wash.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy curls that are difficult to manage so keep that in mind. This product made beautiful curls but super crunchy.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy but it&#x27;s a little think to apply.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would be the perfect companion to the beach babe spray, it didn&#x27;t do much for y do, but I did like the texture &amp; scent of the product. It helped keep and define the texture and look achieved by the spray.</li>
    <li> I actually use this in combination with a spray on leave in conditioner. It&#x27;s works great. I have fine hair and makes my hair curl great with a curling iron. I use the Hot Air curling iron</li>
    <li> Feels like glue, so if you&#x27;re going for that look, you&#x27;ve got it with this product.  I tried mixing it with another styling product to see if it would help but didn&#x27;t, also tried using it with a bit of water, that didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
    <li> Best product i have used for texturizing ! I have very thin hair and it really helps a lot!</li>
    <li> This has worked better than any other texturizing spray I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> has kind of a weird smell to it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product for almost 2 years and loved it!  However, my last order had a white seedy or grainy texture that would not dissolve in my hair and actually looks flaky... Not happy with this at all...</li>
    <li> The hold doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour.</li>
    <li> Supposed to be great stuff!!! Turned my hair into a horses mane!!!! Made it incredibly dry!!! Might work if your hair is VERY oily.</li>
    <li> Makes hair sticky and it has a paste-like consistency. Maybe if you want stiff glued hair that looks as if it can&#x27;t go anywhere...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone is raving about. I like the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I even watched videos on how to use it.</li>
    <li> This product along with the sea salt spray is great. I do have some natural wave in my hair so this product just enhances them and gives me that piece-y beach hair I want. I use this everyday before going to school, so fast &amp; easy to use. Will be repurchasing :)</li>
    <li> Finally I found the one product replacing my John Frieda Chunky gel. It doesn&#x27;t leave it hard or sticky, even the next morning it feels so soft. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Allure Beauty Box in the Spring...and this was one of the picks. Holy moly. It changed my life. And turned me onto the Not Your Mother&#x27;s everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse, thin hair. I was blessed with the best hair - just very little of it. This is where hair products make all the difference in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE wearing what little hair I have in big, bouncy waves. You know, like the celebrities. My hair takes to it. But for 5 minutes and then the beautiful curls fall away and I&#x27;m left with what one can only describe as a &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t do my hair this morning&amp;#34; look. Boo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, insert NYM&#x27;s Beach Babe. While my hair is still wet from the shower, I add a little of this...dry my hair as usual. Once my hair is dry, I add another little dab (look, that nickel size amount will go a llloooonnnngggg way - trust me!) to the bottom half of my dry hair and then give my entire head a good spray down with NYM&#x27;s dry shampoo. This creates that texture party that curls love to stay for! Curl my hair and GO! 16 hours later, I still have curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe me? Try it for yourself. At this price, you can afford to!</li>
    <li> So for me its too sticky. I am sure my daughter wil try it tho, so iI will gift it to her soon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Light and powerful</li>
    <li> I got this to try to make my hair look a little beachy. It was so sticky when I used it though. I used it in my wet hair like the directions say (even dripping wet right out of the shower) but it was much to sticky to spread and seemed to clump where ever I put it.</li>
    <li> Great for my daughter&#x27;s naturally curly hair. A little thick so you don&#x27;t have to use much. Looking into purchasing more Not Your Mothers products!</li>
    <li> My grandchild wanted this.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> People that complain of the thickness of the product, must not be emulsifying it enough. You don&#x27;t want to put it too close to the roots and spread evenly. Try a small amount in the front and another small amount, in the back. The price is higher here than at Walgreens and they have it on sale a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I have ridiculous amount of curl and frizz and this has been better than the years I have used Aveda and smells better. Reminds you of summer ;) I have never been able to wear my hair down, two days in a row, until now.....</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair can get sticky.  I think the spray is better.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, and have been struggling for years to find products that work for me. Usually they make my hair feel too stiff, sticky, or they don&#x27;t seem to do much at all. This cream has blown me away; it makes my hair very soft, and makes my curls shiny, and defined. It also helps to give me good volume, even on the top of my hair (which is usually very flat). I got several compliments on my hair after using it for only a few washes. I can&#x27;t wait to try out more \\&quot;not your mother&#x27;s\\&quot; products :)!</li>
    <li> I have to water this down a bit - it&#x27;s too sticky for long hair. But adding a touch of water works great.</li>
    <li> i am not very impressed with this product... i used it with the sea salt spray and it was ok... not as great as i anticipated...</li>
    <li> its a great, easy summer style tool. just wash and apply, blow dry and go!  I use on my short hair</li>
