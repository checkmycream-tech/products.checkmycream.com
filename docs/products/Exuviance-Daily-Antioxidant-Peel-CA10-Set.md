      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have used many times and keep purchasing as I run out.  </li>
      <li>Great purchase and reasonable price</li>
      <li>this is the Absolut top.</li>
      <li>Has pretty good reviews</li>
      <li>The entire line is just amazing - i am so happy with this.  </li>
      <li>I used it for a little more than one month during dermatological treatments for pigmentation damage and it worked perfect as a complement.</li>
      <li>After a month or two, I started using the pads every other day and my skin still looks great!</li>
      <li>Good exfoliator but priced high.</li>
      <li>I liked this product very much and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s firm and looks great!</li>
      <li>Having had many professional peels I didn&#x27;t look forward to the two step, have your travel fan handy to blow cool air on your face or feel the heat peel.</li>
      <li>and I dont see a significant difference yet.</li>
      <li>The skin felt refreshed, squeaky clean and tightened.</li>
      <li>so i don&#x27;t really peel any more</li>
      <li>After using up the whole bottle of pads I will say my skin feels smoother and looks more even.</li>
      <li>This is a cool product.</li>
      <li>it burns a little - which is great.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair skin with red cheeks that are easily irritated by harsh peels and this one does not bother my skin at all.</li>
      <li>and boy was she right.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Be aware that you should stay out of the sun during and some time after using this product.</li>
      <li>and it is soooo much cheaper than Ulta!</li>
      <li>It is my favorite daily face treatment.</li>
      <li>My skin has never looked better, clearer, and the next morning it glows.  </li>
      <li>This is a brand I was first introduced by my Doctor</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE DAILY PEEL!!!!  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get the liquid in your mouth it tastes gross :)</li>
      <li>like you do with something like Retin A or an office-based peel unless your skin is super sensitive.  </li>
      <li>It has made such a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>So far these are my observations: It has very little odor, which is good.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I knew it was working when after a few weeks, several coworkers and friends started saying how great my skin looked and asked if I was doing anything different.</li>
      <li>Outside of that it&#x27;s pretty gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>Actually felt as if the skin became younger and more vital.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never really witnessed a significant difference when trying out a new skin product.</li>
      <li>Not that I couldnt live with it.</li>
      <li>it won&#x27;t work over night but you will see huge differences if you stick to a rountine and religiously use this daily peel.  </li>
      <li>Then I&#x27;ll use my finger tips to smooth the solution around my face down my neck, and I&#x27;m done.  </li>
      <li>Before getting half way through the patches I could see a huge progress.</li>
      <li>If I have a slight scratch or a breakout coming it stings but the sting goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>Very tight at first but very vitalizinly so ones it&#x27;s settled and eased into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you won&#x27;t see major peeling</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry me out completely since I have oily skin, just the amount I want!.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good exfoliator but priced high. I switched to something cheaper and was same results. But it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> If you want a very effective peel for your skin this is your product. I used it for a little more than one month during dermatological treatments for pigmentation damage and it worked perfect as a complement. The skin felt refreshed, squeaky clean and tightened. Actually felt as if the skin became younger and more vital. Very tight at first but very vitalizinly so ones it&#x27;s settled and eased into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that you should stay out of the sun during and some time after using this product. So for the northern hemisphere... Xmas time is a good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the peels I&#x27;ve used at home this is the Absolut top. I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Has pretty good reviews but I didn&#x27;t find it all that great. First of all it burns like crazy, and it&#x27;s not a good burn. Didn&#x27;t see any improvement with my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve never really witnessed a significant difference when trying out a new skin product. My friend told me about this peel. Thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Saw a difference within a couple weeks. I knew it was working when after a few weeks, several coworkers and friends started saying how great my skin looked and asked if I was doing anything different. My skin literally glows. I love it. After a month or two, I started using the pads every other day and my skin still looks great! I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I started having cycstic adult acne at age 25 - tried literally everything out there spent a fortune. If you can afford lazer treatments they are amazing, but this second best. My skin is not sensitive so I could use them daily - I wanted to try something before my wedding and I have never had a breakout again...that was over 2 yrs ago. Sometimes I order the Peter Thomas Roth pads they are about $20 cheaper and work similarly. Don&#x27;t get the liquid in your mouth it tastes gross :)</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Sticky. Does not work.</li>
    <li> I love this awesome product!  My skin has improved dramatically! I will definitely order again and again!  Great purchase and reasonable price</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE DAILY PEEL!!!!  i met the Exuviance rep in an Ulta Beauty store one day and she told me this was one product in the line i could never live without and boy was she right.  it is like a mini-peel every day.  Take the blue bottle and pour the liquid into the jar as soon as you purchase it.  You will have saturated pads on mini-peel.  Use one every day before you go to bed after cleansing.  it burns a little - which is great.  My skin has never looked better, clearer, and the next morning it glows.  The entire line is just amazing - i am so happy with this.  it won&#x27;t work over night but you will see huge differences if you stick to a rountine and religiously use this daily peel.  you won&#x27;t see major peeling like you do with something like Retin A or an office-based peel unless your skin is super sensitive.  My skin has &#x27;adjusted&#x27; so i don&#x27;t really peel any more but i i do tingle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! It&#x27;s like an instant face lift/rejuvenation/firming/anti aging peel all in one.  I love the way my skin glows after using it, it&#x27;s firm and looks great!</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much and would recommend it. I had hyperpigmentation Issues and in one week I saw my skin become more even toned. My husband and son notice my even complexion by the third week and thought I had on makeup. Now they want to use the product. I have one more week of pads to finish. I&#x27;m very happy. now I can leave the house without makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product...packaged perfectly!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product</li>
    <li> I love this peel!! It is my favorite daily face treatment. Doesn&#x27;t dry me out completely since I have oily skin, just the amount I want!. If I use a moisturizer after it my skin is perfect for the day!</li>
    <li> This is a cool product. I was debating between the 1-2 step or this easier 1 step peel. Having had many professional peels I didn&#x27;t look forward to the two step, have your travel fan handy to blow cool air on your face or feel the heat peel. Not that I couldnt live with it. But this one step is just less trouble all around for me.  I use it once a week.  One thin pad will/should contain enough of the solution that I can wipe my face once, and my neck and chest if I want.  Then I&#x27;ll use my finger tips to smooth the solution around my face down my neck, and I&#x27;m done.  Once it dries I add my night cream and eye cream. But thats my preference.  It would definitely be a starting point for anyone who hasn&#x27;t had a face peel.</li>
    <li> Im a 45 year old hispanic woman with few wrinkles but uneven skin from lifelong acne. Ive been using this peel for a few weeks now and I dont see a significant difference yet. I know things take time and we can&#x27;t always have instant gratification so I will continue until I run out of pads. So far these are my observations: It has very little odor, which is good. It consists of pads that are soaked in the liquid (The blue bottle in the picture has the liquid you pour into the container with the pads and then throw bottle away.) I use a pad a day before I put my makeup on and rub in the liquid. If I have a slight scratch or a breakout coming it stings but the sting goes away quickly. Outside of that it&#x27;s pretty gentle on my skin. It says to use mosturizer immediately afterwards so I do (Clinique). My skin is smoother but I can&#x27;t tell if its the cleanser I use or this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....After using up the whole bottle of pads I will say my skin feels smoother and looks more even. I can say I recommend it but at the price I will be using every two days instead of every day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! It has made such a huge difference in my skin. I have very fair skin with red cheeks that are easily irritated by harsh peels and this one does not bother my skin at all. It has a slight sting and tightness to my skin during the application process but I will continue to buy this and it is soooo much cheaper than Ulta!</li>
    <li> This is a brand I was first introduced by my Doctor For my acne this is a very good product!</li>
    <li> Before getting half way through the patches I could see a huge progress. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best product around.  I have used many times and keep purchasing as I run out.  It works wonders.</li>
