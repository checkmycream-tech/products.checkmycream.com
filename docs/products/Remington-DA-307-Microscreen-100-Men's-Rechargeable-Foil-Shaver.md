      <li>Used Norelco Rotary models for 25 years and was fairly happy with them.</li>
      <li>Great electric razor</li>
      <li>I was happy to see that Remington was still manufacturing the DA 307.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>The side pop out trimmer is great for us guys that sport a mustache.</li>
      <li>It also has a flip-up hair trimmer which works great for the sideburns and stray hairs.</li>
      <li>,it&#x27;s a great shaver</li>
      <li>The trimmer works great.</li>
      <li>This razor gives a great shave.</li>
      <li>Good Battery Life  </li>
      <li>I consider this razor to be a good bargain.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this shaver as it had good reviews.  </li>
      <li>I have heard the newer ones aren&#x27;t as good, but that is just hearsay on my part.</li>
      <li>this is one good product for the price.</li>
      <li>, I am very satisfied with the da-307.    </li>
      <li>I ordered 2 of these for Xmas presents, since I personally own the model and think it is good.  </li>
      <li>this is the best one i&#x27;ve found so far and the price is great.  </li>
      <li>excellent razor - particularly for the money</li>
      <li>I still have the first one that I bought 10 years ago and it still gives a great close shave.</li>
      <li>I never had this gasket problem with Brauns and Norelcos, and one would think Remington by now would have a stronger and better fitting gasket - a very cheap fix.     </li>
      <li>This is a very good product for everything it offers.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently on my 3rd shaver from Remington and it is really an excellent product.</li>
      <li>This is mot something respectable company do.   </li>
      <li>I found the cost of batteries would cost more than this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am fully satisfied with this product.  </li>
      <li>It shaved OK but missed longer hair if I missed a day shaving.  </li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to return this, but I just picked up a Norelco rotary to see how I like it in comparison.  </li>
      <li>You can get about five shaves or more on a charge</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a razor for most of my life, with the exception of about a year of using a rotary in my teens.  </li>
      <li>Like many men, I can&#x27;t stand shaving, so</li>
      <li>I bought and guess what, it shaves much better too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m convinced that you can&#x27;t get a better shaver for $25 than</li>
      <li>too many days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I should have gotten a better one.  </li>
      <li>I have been able to find just the screens online,</li>
      <li>completely satisfied, in fact will end up buying another for the office.</li>
      <li>I guess I could pay more for the model that cleans with water.</li>
      <li>I have better things to do then to continue this review.    </li>
      <li>I am a satisfied Remington DA 307 microscreen shaver user.</li>
      <li>This was the reason I have ordered 2 more of this item  </li>
      <li>One to two passes at most on face...</li>
      <li>I am not even sure if Remington still makes this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Face is very smooth and its very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>The washing removes the very fine grit that sticks to your face, and washing before shaving will extend the life of the cutters significantly, because they don&#x27;t get worn by the grit.  </li>
      <li>In fact, for daily shavers, maybe you can reduce the charge time to 3-5 hours instead of the full 16 to cut corners, even if you charge overnight to make the best of this $29.99 shaver.</li>
      <li>: I did get a cheap Norelco and that did a much better job, and it was quieter.  </li>
      <li>It gives a fast, fairly close shave.  </li>
      <li>The powder helps the shaver glide smoothly over your face and produces a more comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>It gets nice and close, lasts for a long time, and feels good in your hands.</li>
      <li>It works fine.    </li>
      <li>Thank you very much!!</li>
      <li>Instead of paying $40+ for this shaver (which used to run about $26 with free shipping), I opted for a $30 Panasonic that is currently receiving great reviews.    </li>
      <li>This is a great shaver for the low price.  </li>
      <li>Also, it provides 40 minutes of shaving, so it&#x27;s important to time yourself when using this shaver.  </li>
      <li>I have always been a Remington man, but when they discontinued the Ultra Smooth ES-1000 Shaver in 2007</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving this away as a gift to someone else who was looking for one of these Remingtons (I guess they can be quite rare and those whose faces it does work well on love these things).  </li>
      <li>I bought this looking for a cheap alternative to razors.</li>
      <li>I know why it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>Thought I might try a foil since it was cheap and had a 30 day return.</li>
      <li>This was a fantastic purchase for me</li>
      <li>go lightly over your face.  </li>
      <li>The 307 fits in the hand well, the trimmer works well, and parts continue to be available.</li>
      <li>I was prepared to spend more and get a newer model, either by Remington or somebody else, but after thinking about how dependable and useful the 307 has been and then reading some reviews at Amazon, I decided to stick with it.</li>
      <li>A truly excellent little piece of equipment!  </li>
      <li>My new son-in-law really was happy when he received this shaver as one of his Christmas gift&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Special washers are a gimmick in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>They really appreciated it and wanted to know where to buy more.</li>
      <li>(they are permanently soldered inside), even though it will cost more than replacing the whole razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I like to shave with a full charge.</li>
      <li>I use it for quick shaves or maybe at the end of the day when I don&#x27;t want my stubbles to sandpaper my ladies face.</li>
      <li>Yes I have used many other popular electric brands.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fast and easy.</li>
      <li>It costs more than twice as much as the Remington and replacement foils and cutter bars cost about $45 which is pretty steep.    </li>
      <li>this age of 3 or more cutters in a shaver, 2 may seem old-fashioned, but they do the job nicely and keep shaver bulk down.</li>
      <li>First let me say that I am one of those people who say \\&quot;no way an electric razor shaves as close as a blade\\&quot;!</li>
      <li>the little brush cleaner for hair remains but its still a great razor.</li>
      <li>It is powerful and does not cause any redness to his chin.</li>
      <li>Overall, I liked the shave on the face but not on the neck.  </li>
      <li>I use the Remington DA-307 shaver for long time and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it  </li>
      <li>That might be worth it.</li>
      <li>cutters)but are easy to find online for a decent price.</li>
      <li>And although this razor does not change my stance I must say it is by far the closest shave I have experienced outside of a blade.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very good razor. Used Norelco Rotary models for 25 years and was fairly happy with them. That is all I had ever used or tried. Thought I might try a foil since it was cheap and had a 30 day return. Amazed at how much quicker it is than the rotary models. Shaves way closer...no comparison! I can&#x27;t imagine getting a closer shave. For $25 it is an unbelievable shaver...not sure why anybody would pay more. My shave time was cut in half if not more. Rotary model was slow...foil very fast. One to two passes at most on face...Chin and neck take a little longer.    Weaknesses...makes a mess in the sink and doesn&#x27;t do as well on the neck or under the chin, but neither do the rotary shavers. I guess I could pay more for the model that cleans with water. That might be worth it. Bargain price at Wal Mart.</li>
    <li> This is the third Remington DA-307 I&#x27;ve owned. I was prepared to spend more and get a newer model, either by Remington or somebody else, but after thinking about how dependable and useful the 307 has been and then reading some reviews at Amazon, I decided to stick with it. And I haven&#x27;t regretted that decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this age of 3 or more cutters in a shaver, 2 may seem old-fashioned, but they do the job nicely and keep shaver bulk down. The 307 fits in the hand well, the trimmer works well, and parts continue to be available. (Regarding the latter, can anyone tell me why the standard replacement kits include a screen and a cutter? It&#x27;s recommended replacing the screen every 6 months and the cutter every 12.... You do the math! I have been able to find just the screens online, fortunately.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this fine shaver 4 stars instead of 5 due to a couple of minor shortcomings: It&#x27;s fairly loud (seems a little louder than my older one) and it&#x27;s strictly a rechargeable type--if you run it down before finishing a shave you&#x27;re out of luck, because recharging takes hours. I have learned to get around this fact by keeping my old shaver fully charged and using it on weekends when the new one gets recharged. Small price to pay in my book to have an inexpensive product that gets daily use and does its job very well.</li>
    <li> other shavers that gave me a close shave also caused bumps to appear.  this is the best one i&#x27;ve found so far and the price is great.  i reccomend it.</li>
    <li> My dad&#x27;s Remington Titanium MS2-370 needed replacement blades, but at the same price we could get the Remington DA-307.  I bought the DA-307.  There is no comparison.  While the MS2-370 has dual blades, the DA-307 has a single double-cutter.  As another reviewer mentioned, you have to go over the same area repeatedly to get most of the hairs cut.  I just used it and gave up after mowing over and over, with an incomplete shave.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing the replacement blades for the MS2-370 after all.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Low Price  Quality Construction  Good Battery Life  Cuts Close  Cons:  Not self Cleaning</li>
    <li> This my second one, and I thought the price and delivery time were fine.  With my previous one (which I still have) I am able to charge the battery and go to England for 10 days and it will still have power at the end of the trip.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver for the low price.  At a similar price I bought a Braun 1 series (150) and i&#x27;ve had to go over the same spots over and over and over.  This little razor got me to switch from the Braun brand and I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a razor for most of my life, with the exception of about a year of using a rotary in my teens.  Like many men, I can&#x27;t stand shaving, so I thought I&#x27;d try this shaver as it had good reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about three months, and now I&#x27;d like to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a thick beard but it grows pretty quickly, and I found I had to go from shaving every other day to using this shaver daily.  I also have curly hair, so I&#x27;m not sure that makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does a very good job of quickly cutting the hair on my face.  Unfortunately, it does a terrible, terrible job around the neck.  When it&#x27;s fresh off the charger and has plenty of power, it can get most of the hair, but usually it leaves dozens of tiny little hairs that need to be trimmed down.  Then it gives terrible irritation as I try to get the remaining hairs.  I have tried different directions, little circles, holding it upside down, pulling the skin, pushing hard, barely touching, and it&#x27;s always a terrible job on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it helps to either pat my face or the foil with baby powder, as that makes the shaving go much smoother.  Lectric Shave didn&#x27;t do anything for me good or bad.  And if I go more than a few days without charging, it slows down and does a worse job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried shaving with a blade again but that caused a lot of irritation.  Overall, I liked the shave on the face but not on the neck.  Unfortunately, I tossed the box so I wasn&#x27;t able to return this, but I just picked up a Norelco rotary to see how I like it in comparison.  It has some larger slots that should get the longer hairs so hopefully that works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I did get a cheap Norelco and that did a much better job, and it was quieter.  I would recommend the Norelco brand of razors over Remington foil razors.  However, I have switched to old school double edge safety razor shaving with a brush and a mug and soap and it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I consider this razor to be a good bargain. It gives me, rather quickly,  a closer shave than other models.  Slight drawbacks:  it is comparatively noisy; and when it is being cleaned, if you do not hold the shaver blades carefully in place, they are apt to come off.  Then, until you get the knack of it, they are tricky to replace.  Price is great: I shopped  and compared.</li>
    <li> The blue shaver pictured is no longer available.  A gray one was substituted without querying me.  Item was received with NO papers for possible return or contact information.  The color may seem inconsequential but if it&#x27;s for someone who&#x27;s 87 years old and doesn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s his shaver if it isn&#x27;t blue, it&#x27;s very important and the only reason I ordered it.  Even though it&#x27;s no longer available, one month later it&#x27;s still on their website and says \\&quot;In Stock\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for three plus years. I replaced the foil and the blades about every six months and the shaver worked flawlessly.     About a month ago, the pop up trimmer stopped working. I wanted to buy another one of these shavers, but Amazon no longer offers free shipping on them. Instead of paying $40+ for this shaver (which used to run about $26 with free shipping), I opted for a $30 Panasonic that is currently receiving great reviews.    In sum, if you get this shaver, you will not be disappointed. Or at least you shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these DA 307s when they first came out, I think back in the late 70s, or maybe early 80s. I have been using it ever since, up until last week, when, sadly, the batteries will no longer hold a charge long enough for a full shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has always shaved as close, or sometimes even closer than blades, such as Track IIs, Quattros, and even Fusions (I have tried them all). I keep going back to my trusty Remington. The only way I get a closer shave is with my Dovo straight razor, and Col. Conk Shaving soap (I treat myself once a month or so with a hot towel shave..). It shaves where I want it to, sharpens easily on the back of a ceramic plate (I have never had to replace the blades, and only replaced the screen once in 30 years...), and cleans quickly and easily. The trimmer works great. Compared to a Norelco Rotary (I have one of those, too), it runs circles around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this is an old Remington. I have heard the newer ones aren&#x27;t as good, but that is just hearsay on my part. I have no personal knowledge of the newer (post 1990) DA 307s. I am not even sure if Remington still makes this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my DA 307 so much that I am thinking of having an appliance repair shop put new batteries in it for me (they are permanently soldered inside), even though it will cost more than replacing the whole razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 30 years old, and it will still outperform most new razors. You just can&#x27;t beat that. Great job, Remington!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because of the price but I should have gotten a better one.  It gives you a very bad shave you have to go over your beard so many times that your face is almost raw by the time you finish and even with all that you don&#x27;t get a good shave.  I would not reccomend this razor to anyone. Buy a better razor don&#x27;t waste your money mine is going in the garbage can.</li>
    <li> I bought this Remington DA-307 Shaver to replace a Wahl Shaver (Bump-Free) that I had just returned to the company because it shaved too close.  I have always been a Remington man, but when they discontinued the Ultra Smooth ES-1000 Shaver in 2007 (I have one that was purchased in 2003, and it still works except for the shaving head coming off when used), I eventually bought the Wahl, and later, this Remington model.  It is not bad in terms of the shave that it provides, but to best utilize it, you may have to use both the shaver and the small trimmer in the back of the shaver to get the close shave that you want.  Just be careful to not scrape your skin with the trimmer...go lightly over your face.  The   shaver doesn&#x27;t cut short curly hair very well, so this is when the trimmer has to be used besides shaping mustaches, sideburns, and thick beards.  One notable setback is the regular charging of the battery before you shave, based on the instructions that came with the shaver (In fact, Remington told me to charge initially for 24 hours every six months and 16 hours in between when I called their toll-free number).  I was hoping to pick up the shaver, turn it on, and shave without always charging beforehand.  With the Ultra-Smooth and the Wahl Bump-Free, I would get, at least, three shaves between charges.  This shaver seems to give me two shaves per charge, probably because I go over the same areas repeatedly.  Also, it provides 40 minutes of shaving, so it&#x27;s important to time yourself when using this shaver.  I have ingrown hairs that grow in different directions, so by washing my face with warm water and drying it, using the beard lifter comb that came with the Ultra-Smooth, and putting on the Face Shaver Talcum Powder prior to shaving, it helps the shaver glide over the beard easily.  Afterwards, I spray with the Shaver Saver Spray to lubricate the cutters and microscreen to keep things running smootly.  While I am still experimenting, I hope to master this shaver soon.  In fact, knowing Remington&#x27;s reputation, I think it&#x27;s a possibility.  In fact, for daily shavers, maybe you can reduce the charge time to 3-5 hours instead of the full 16 to cut corners, even if you charge overnight to make the best of this $29.99 shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a great shave. Face is very smooth and its very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I am fully satisfied with this product.  It it giving a closer shave and doing a better job than I expected.  Thank you, Remington.</li>
    <li> I used the razor for about 3 weeks.  Found it excessively noisy. It shaved OK but missed longer hair if I missed a day shaving.  I sent it back and went back to a mid-range Norelco (much quieter, better if I miss a day shaving, altho more costly).</li>
    <li> The Remington DA-307 as been around for longer then I have been shaving,I&#x27;m 68.It started out as a non re-chargeable ( my father had one ) It gives a very close shave once your beard gets used to it.But you must replace the the foil screen every six months.Here&#x27;s a tip, a new shaver cost about three dollars more then a new foil screen.You can get about five shaves or more on a charge but I like to shave with a full charge.Wash your face,then dry it. Apply some talcum power with a soft brush.I use my wife&#x27;s old make-up brush but you can use the old fashioned shaving mug brush.More often then not one or two hairs that you missed on your last shave have grown too long for the foil to capture it so I touch up with a safety razor on my dry skin.The side pop out trimmer is great for us guys that sport a mustache.Don&#x27;t be turned off my Amazon&#x27;s low price this is one good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Some people rave about these things, but they don&#x27;t quite work well for my face.  It always seems to leave hair behind which i would need to use a straight razor to clear off.  Maybe it is just my face, electric razors never seem to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving this away as a gift to someone else who was looking for one of these Remingtons (I guess they can be quite rare and those whose faces it does work well on love these things).  They really appreciated it and wanted to know where to buy more.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this better than any other shaver he&#x27;s bought, several of those were around $200.GREAT shaver at a great price. Foils &amp; cutters need replacement as specified in instructions (6 mos foils, 1 year cutters)but are easy to find online for a decent price.Excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought a Remington razor several years ago and had problems, then went to Braun for several years.  When away on vacation, for convenience I bought this Remington at a drugstore to replace my Braun, which had a warn-out rechargeable battery.    The problem I had with the earlier one still occurs here: the rubber gasket that supposedly protects the internal parts from the blade unit fits loosely and quickly wears out.  As a result, the whiskers get into the internal motor area and it eventually gets noisier and slower.  You apparently are not supposed to separate the two halves to clean it out, but I did and now they don&#x27;t really snap together again  as tightly as before.  I never had this gasket problem with Brauns and Norelcos, and one would think Remington by now would have a stronger and better fitting gasket - a very cheap fix.     The razor shaves closely but is very noisy (and not due to the fact that I took it apart), compared to another Braun I had bought for business travel purposes (and now for home use).</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver for the price--I would say it compares well with shavers much more expensive</li>
    <li> It works fine.    I have better things to do then to continue this review.    GoodBye,    Bob R.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for everything it offers.  It compares well with  other branded razors with higher prices.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for almost 60 years and have learned a few things.    I have tried blades, but I prefer electrics, and I have owned at least one model of most brands.  In general I don&#x27;t think tilting heads and other such \\&quot;features\\&quot; add much to a shaver.    My beard is about average in density.  It&#x27;s sligtly curly, so I have some problem with in-grown hairs and hairs difficult for a shaver to pick up.      I use this shaving technique:  wash my face, dry it, and apply a light coating of baby powder.  The washing removes the very fine grit that sticks to your face, and washing before shaving will extend the life of the cutters significantly, because they don&#x27;t get worn by the grit.  The powder helps the shaver glide smoothly over your face and produces a more comfortable shave.  (Remington sells a \\&quot;shaving stick\\&quot; that does the same thing, but it will cost you four times as much as baby powder.)  I like the corn starch powder, but the talc works well too.  After going over my face with the shaver one time, I \\&quot;brush up\\&quot; the stubble by running my hand against the grain, and I run over it with the shaver again.  I may do the \\&quot;brush up\\&quot; a couple of times.  This helps get a very close shave.  I clean my shaver with an old toothbrush (dry).  That&#x27;s fast and easy. (But be careful you don&#x27;t pick it up to brush your teeth as I have done once or twice.  Yuk) Special washers are a gimmick in my opinion.  As far as I can tell, brushing the cutters is all that&#x27;s needed.  I don&#x27;t have much use for charging stands either.  I would appreciate a nice travel case, but most of the cases provided are pretty poor.    I haven&#x27;t found much difference in the number of shaves per charge.  I&#x27;d like to get a simple cord type shaver and avoid the hassle of charging, but I can&#x27;t find any on the U.S. market.    Here&#x27;s a rundown on the shavers I presently own, starting with the Remington DA-307.    Remington DA-307:  Produces a fast, close shave, the next to the closest of those I&#x27;ve tried or owned.  The trimmer is first-class.  Very little irritation.  The only drawback of this shaver, is that it doesn&#x27;t have a slot-type cutter that helps pick up curly or long hairs.  At a price of about $30, it costs less than replacement foils and cutters for many shavers.    Braun 1775:  This is the lowest price Braun.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the Remington.  It&#x27;s two other drawbacks are 1) it \\&quot;bogs down\\&quot; when it hits an area that has heavy beard (like on my chin), and 2) it has no slot cutter that would help pick up curly hair.  I would not recommend this shaver even though it&#x27;s travel setup is excellent - protects the shaver well and keeps it from getting turned on by accident.    Wahl 4000:  It gives a fast, fairly close shave.  It comes with three different (double) foil heads, labeled \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;, \\&quot;close\\&quot; , and \\&quot;super close.\\&quot;  They all work well for me except that the \\&quot;super close\\&quot; produces a little more irritation.  I can&#x27;t tell a major difference in the closeness of the shave produced by each.  I think they should really be labeled \\&quot;fast\\&quot;, \\&quot;faster\\&quot;, and \\&quot;fastest.\\&quot;  It also does not have a slot cutter.  In my experience, the Wahl is not as durable as others, but it does come with a two-year guarantee, which I have not had to use.    Panasonic ES7037:  This has two foils and a slot bar.  It&#x27;s one of Panasonic&#x27;s medium-upper-priced shavers.  It produces the closest shave of any shaver I&#x27;ve tried.  It takes a while to do this.  For me it takes about seven minutes to shave with the Panasonic as compared to about five and-a-half for the Remington or Wahl.  It&#x27;s also quieter and has the least vibration, if that&#x27;s important to you.  It costs more than twice as much as the Remington and replacement foils and cutter bars cost about $45 which is pretty steep.    Norelco:  The one I have is no longer on the market, but it takes me a very long time to shave with a Norelco, so I haven&#x27;t been buying any lately.  They are very quiet, have virtually no vibration, and producelittle irritation.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for the same style razor I previously used for 20+ years (i.e. a DA-107) which is the same body sytle as the DA-307, just not rechargable.  The plastic head piece that holds the screen had broke.  The charges on the DA-307 would only last about 4 or 5 days.  After ~2 weeks using the DA-307 and losing a charge in the middle of a shave, I could&#x27;nt take it any longer.  I swapped the new head, screen, and blade onto my DA-107 and presto - back in business.  I never really wanted to get a rechargable in the first place.  Other than that, I really like the Remingtons.</li>
    <li> I think this product may be a \\&quot;rip off\\&quot;. Compared to my old razor of the same type, it sounds funny, too fast and too high pitched.  At start up, it smells like an electrical appliance that is overheated.</li>
    <li> This shaver met all my needs!!!  Great product.  I have a problem with in-grown hairs and this shaver solves that problem for me.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome electric shaver.  My first one lasted 8 years...the beard trimmer blades finally got dull.  Luckily, they still make the same model so I&#x27;m back in business.  It truly \\&quot;shaves as close as a blade.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband. He just loves it. It is powerful and does not cause any redness to his chin. Also, one single charge can last for a whole week. At this price, I really think it exceeds the value.</li>
    <li> Mine has just stopped working after about 12 months - and it now shaves as well as it did when it was working.  The trimmer didn&#x27;t cut long hairs and the normal blades didn&#x27;t cut short hairs - just irritate my skin.    Suspect I know why it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> My new son-in-law really was happy when he received this shaver as one of his Christmas gift&#x27;s. He had been using this brand for several years and really enjoys the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently on my 3rd shaver from Remington and it is really an excellent product. I&#x27;ve tried many others but the Remington is the only one that gets a very closer shaving. I really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor works excellent.  Replaced a expensive Braun razor i had with this and am very happy.</li>
    <li> The shaver was EXACTLY what I was looking for. The seller shipped it immediately and I&#x27;m a very happy camper!  The price was right and I once again am getting the best shave of my life!!</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington Microscreen DA 307 Shaver. I still have the first one that I bought 10 years ago and it still gives a great close shave. I now keep it in my flight suitcase for business trips . The new DA 307 is now my everyday home use shaver. I was happy to see that Remington was still manufacturing the DA 307. With a new screen and blade every six months it works just like new. Here&#x27;s the best part,it&#x27;s a great shaver and it&#x27;s very affordable. I am a satisfied Remington DA 307 microscreen shaver user.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  It truly is the new workhorse of the Remington shavers.</li>
    <li> The DA-307 is an excellent shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that the shaver did come&lt;br /&gt;with even a cleaning brush and protective&lt;br /&gt;head cover. No carry case either. These 3 items&lt;br /&gt;came with all the previous Remington foil shavers&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased over the years, which is several.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the item was received with the foil head&lt;br /&gt;detached and bouncing around in the box. Luckily&lt;br /&gt;the foil was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Dodd&lt;br /&gt;10/05/12</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced that you can&#x27;t get a better shaver for $25 than the DA-307. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 3 years. I&#x27;ve tried the other razors that claim to give you a super-close shave, ie: norelco 3-head, and I find that their idea of a super-close shave is to strip the skin off and give you razor-burn. This razor will give you a close shave but you&#x27;d have to try very hard to give yourself razor burn. It also has a flip-up hair trimmer which works great for the sideburns and stray hairs. I&#x27;ve replaced the blades several times and it still holds up well.Its small enough to fit in your carry-on and though I&#x27;ve never tested the limits of the battery, I&#x27;ve gone through 5-6 shaves without charging in between.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I am one of those people who say \\&quot;no way an electric razor shaves as close as a blade\\&quot;! And although this razor does not change my stance I must say it is by far the closest shave I have experienced outside of a blade. I use it for quick shaves or maybe at the end of the day when I don&#x27;t want my stubbles to sandpaper my ladies face. Great electric razor and if I had to give up my blade it would be for this razor. Yes I have used many other popular electric brands. I won&#x27;t knock them but this one is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for a cheap alternative to razors. I couldnt be happier right now. It gets nice and close, lasts for a long time, and feels good in your hands.</li>
    <li> I use the Remington DA-307 shaver for long time and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it  I am travelling allot thus using the fact that it is 110V &amp; 220V  This was the reason I have ordered 2 more of this item  When I got it I was very surprised to see that Remington kept the same model number but change the shaver  Now it is only 110V.  Remington admitted that to my Email investigation   This is mot something respectable company do.   They had to change the model number.</li>
    <li> The battery gave out on an older Norelco. I found the cost of batteries would cost more than this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought and guess what, it shaves much better too. Gives a quick and easy shave especially if you don&#x27;t let it goes too many days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am completely satisfied, in fact will end up buying another for the office.</li>
    <li> What a seller!  Felt like I barely pressed enter and the box was at the door - LIGHTENING FAST SHIPPING!!!  Dad&#x27;s very happy!</li>
    <li> Died in first week I had it. Remington user for years. NO more! Screen, possibly defective, ripped after first use!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these for Xmas presents, since I personally own the model and think it is good.  The package came quicker than I thought and the price was awesome (much less than what I paid for mine at Target last year!)...  Great experience!</li>
    <li> A truly excellent little piece of equipment!  Really does what it should do and does it well.  Thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> I wish it came with the little brush cleaner for hair remains but its still a great razor. If you cant get to very small hairs the trimmer on the back works nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m asking a question. Is this a good shaver for African American men? Is it a close shave? I would like to get some details before I buy.</li>
    <li> This was a fantastic purchase for me I am an African- American male and shaving can be a problem with bumps . The Remington DA 307 has been a life saver</li>
    <li> I purchased this for an alternative to my Husband &#x27;razor&#x27; shaving, thought he might like it when he was in a hurry, or just for a touch-up, he really likes it, he rates it a 3 star as it is adequate, but for use everyday, he would probably want a more expensive one.  For the price, however, and his needs at this time, it has performed well.</li>
    <li> excellent razor - particularly for the money -   Gives just as good (if not better) cut than my  expensive one...</li>
    <li> My da-307 replaced a da-407 that I have had for 12+ years.  The battery on da-407 died a long time ago but I was very happy using it corded.  However, my new da-307 will not run corded.  Once da-307 battery dies I will need to replace the entire unit even though the rest of the mechanics work fine.  This is not an environmentally conscious design.   Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the da-307.    Edit:  I ended up returning the unit.  I did not like the fact that it would not work corded.  I purchased a Remington F720 instead.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS BUY REMINGTON, VERY GOOD PRODUCT HAVE HAD  2-3 IN THE PAST 15 YEARS AND ONLY REASON TO REPLACE WAS JUST TO GET A NEW ONE.</li>
    <li> hard to find these in the stores, so took and chance and ordered it - great product, but wish they were lower priced.</li>
    <li> This product gives me everything I&#x27;m looking for in a razor.  Think of it as a disposable electric razor....one you use everyday for X amount of months then toss.  It&#x27;s cheap enough to just keep buying new ones whenever you need them.  I could care less about the features, I just shave my face and that&#x27;s all.</li>
</ol>
