<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this for travel.  I like the foldable and retractible cord design because I can store it in a drawer.  I have a lot of fine hair, and I&#x27;ve had a pixie during the entire time I&#x27;ve had this.  During certain times of the year, I don&#x27;t use it because I live in Phoenix, and why in the hell would I stand underneath a source of heat on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since April 7, 2012 (when Amazon tells me I purchased this) I&#x27;ve had no problems at all.  I generally use it on the cool or low setting for a short period of time.  Yesterday (10/13/14), it stopped working altogether.  This morning, I forgot about yesterday, and I tried again.  It was intermittent, so there&#x27;s probably a fray in the cable within the cord somewhere, due to being pulled in and out for somewhat daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were looking for a travel unit, I would find this a bit bulky. As a daily unit, it was fine regarding size, but not regarding longevity.  Then again, $30 for 2.5 years is not a huge investment. I may actually buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: So, I did buy another one, and the hair dryer function is working properly, but during the first month or two, I heard a snap while folding it for the day, and now the handle is relatively loose in the unfolded position.  The cord doesn&#x27;t actually retract all the way into the unit.  I store my hair dryer in a drawer, and a full size one doesn&#x27;t fit, which is why I love this one so much.  However, now I just get mad at the darn thing every morning when I go to put it away.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer stopped working after 7 months. Called Conair since it has a 2 year warranty and they wanted me to pay for repairs. First and last time I will buy Conair.</li>
    <li> Cute and functional but it is heavy and somewhat awkward.</li>
    <li> Love the retractable cord! This dryer does a nice job drying my hair. It is comparable to others I have used, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord tangling!</li>
    <li> If you have thin hair that takes 5 minutes to dry, you&#x27;ll love this hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if like me, you have thick hair that requires time and effort, don&#x27;t waste your money.  This hair dryer continually shuts down on me, never at a good time.  Is there ever a good time?  Is there anything more frustrating than being 3/4 of the way done and getting shut down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, I bought this particular model because I have an older model that still works.  I need a blow dryer that operates on dual voltage for traveling and I was delighted to find an updated version.  I was tricked.  I hope you won&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: Good drying capability, dual voltage, long cord, comfortable grip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: Not enough heat/speed settings when used in 220V mode.  This is a big limitation.  It also do not come with a comb accessory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> This dryer is compact but heavier than I thought it would be. I like the way it folds, the retractable cord makes packing easy. The dyer is fast.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job. Temperature settings are awesome. You won&#x27;t regret buying it. I havent tried in any of the extra style dryer.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair dryer!!!! Apparently I got one of the last ones before the cost went up to $700.</li>
    <li> I had the perfect blowdryer... that was until I moved. Nonetheless, I was pretty worried about getting a new one. I have been through a fair share of terrible no good hair dryers. Looove this one! It&#x27;s lightweight, only 1.7 lbs compared to some that are 2.5 or even 3! I like that it has a retractable cord, which will make for easier traveling. That goes for the folding handle as well. The HIGH is actually really high powered, I was surprised. And the settings are perfect, in my opinion; the warm isn&#x27;t too hot (like some I&#x27;ve experienced).</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this blow dryer has a retractable cord. Another added feature is the folding handle. It does a great job.  Doesn&#x27;t get too hot. I love everything about it.</li>
    <li> I was very shocked at how big this dryer is given that it&#x27;s designed to be a travel dryer.  It&#x27;s the same size as a regular dryer (on the larger side).  The retractable cord mechanism seems a bit flimsy as it was not rewinding very strongly even after a few use.  The button to push the cord back also seems difficult to push.  I had to push a few times to the cord back in.  When I sit on my bed to dry my hair with it with the outlet just below my bed, the cord seem a bit short and I had to tuck at the extension cord a little.  I guess that&#x27;s the tradeoff for having the retractable cord.  Overall, the design is very clumsy and not slim as it should be for traveling.  However, I do like that it has 3 heat settings, 2 blower speed, and it&#x27;s ionic.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer, the only issue is that it overheats if on high for longer than 5 minutes. When it&#x27;s working it works really well but a few days ago it shut off and will not come back on regardless of how many times I reset it. I do not recommend it if you&#x27;re going to use it for longer than a few minutes on low heat.</li>
    <li> Finally had to break down and buy a new hair dryer and I was worried I would not find one as powerful as the one I had.  I have long thick hair so power is a must!!  I love that it fold like my last one also. The retractable cord was a bonus.  Only draw back is it was bigger and heavier then my cute little one but I love this new one hair dries quick!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a quick blow dry situation, a light weight dryer, and it stores easily. Does not retract all the way, but for the price, I really dig this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Died within a few months. What gives? Even the cheapest of hair dryers last years - is this a counterfeit?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no hairdryer expert, but this fit my needs perfectly. It folds and retracts nicely and dries my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this blowdryer due to it&#x27;s light weight and compactibility . I love the retractable cord and the folding handle. Perfect for traveling!</li>
    <li> NOTE: It will work in foreign outlets but you need an adapter! HOWEVER, you cannot use the drier on the HIGH setting while it is accepting 240 volts. Only the low setting is available but when I used it in Russia. The low was pumped up to about 80% of the high setting, however (the increased voltage). Hope that makes sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very nice Revlon drier that I LOVE. I *only* bought this Conair drier because it works with European voltage and I used it in Russia and Finland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt dry and puffy and my Revlon drier does not cause that at all. I don&#x27;t know why the Conair is causing it. It also took much longer to straighten it out with the drier and round brush. Lots of frizz when I finally finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retractable cord function works great though the \\&quot;Press\\&quot; button is weird/sticky and the cord needs a little help inside. The \\&quot;folding\\&quot; action is VERY tight. I thought I might break it trying to get it to fold in half and the unfold it again. Feels like it isn&#x27;t meant to fold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high setting is pretty mediocre while using in the US. In Russia, it&#x27;s even less powerful. The temperature settings are accurate. Hot is pretty hot, cool shot works great. Drier is quite light which is a bonus for traveling. The weight and the dual voltage are the two reasons I took this drier overseas. The shoddy build and poor strength are the two reasons I intentionally LEFT it in Russia. Wasn&#x27;t even worth the space in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how old/worn out my old dryer was until I received this one and had options for heat and low/high powers.  This is a great dryer.</li>
    <li> The retractable cord is wonderful for storage.  Power is great.</li>
    <li> The retractable cord is wonderful, no winding and unwinding. This is my second one. First one lasted 5 years of daily use. Drys hair fast and leaves it soft and shiny. A real bargain at this price!</li>
    <li> The chord doesn&#x27;t retract and the power is touchy after 2 years of use.  Buying the girlfriend a new one.</li>
    <li> Bought this dryer for my girlfriend and she loves it. Great style, easy to carry when on the go and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Works 100 times better than the old hair dryer. I&#x27;d definitely suggest it.</li>
    <li> this is my fav hair dryer! works better than any kind ive ever used before and i love the fact that it folds up for more compact storage.</li>
    <li> I turned on the dryer and it turned all the lights off in my house i guess its too powerful, it works but be careful when buying since its too overpowering. I have to send it back since i cant make it work in my house without blowing the circuit breaker :(</li>
    <li> I think this is the third one of these dryers that I have owned. I&#x27;m guessing that something about the foldup mechanism wears it down after awhile and causes the dryer to stop functioning - just guessing. I believe my previous one lasted a year and a half, which is definitely not long enough. But the thing is - I love the features on this dryer. I love the retractable cord and the ability to fold up the handle. It still isn&#x27;t small, but I can set it on top of the little cabinet in my bathroom, and that&#x27;s good enough for me. It&#x27;s inexpensive enough that I don&#x27;t seem to mind buying a new one every 18 months. And this dryer is one of the few that really handles my thick coarse hair well. It dries my hair well and dries it fast. The different speeds and temperature settings work well. I would give it five stars if it didn&#x27;t break down after such a short time.</li>
    <li> bought this for my girlfriend this past xmas and she loves it. she says it cut the drying time of her last blowdryer easily in half and i can tell it makes her hair look silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I chose this hair dryer specifically for the travel features...folding handle &amp; retractable cord. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a little larger and heavier than I had hoped for; about 24 oz. but it worked well.</li>
    <li> Works great, and the cord winds up into the handle at the touch of a button, plus the handle folds down so it takes up less space when it&#x27;s put away. Solves my pet peeve about hair dryers. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, so I bought an extra one just in case they stop selling these (heaven forbid).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my upcoming overseas trip to Paris as this blowdryer was cheap and fit my criteria of being dula voltage with ceramic technology. I have average hair that does get pretty wavy (sometimes looks like I took it out of a braid) Plugged it in and it started right up here in California. Will probably use this blow dryer more instead of straightening my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works well&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair smooth and frizz free&lt;br /&gt;Retractable cord is convenient&lt;br /&gt;Speed and heat settings&lt;br /&gt;Folding handle&lt;br /&gt;Switch to switch over to different voltage is easy to find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Haven&#x27;t found any lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit heavier then my other blowdryer but nothing that I would complain about. Will update this once I use it in Paris. I did read in the manual that when used in the 210-250V areas the settings have to be kept on Low and on Hot but we&#x27;ll see if it is an issue.</li>
    <li> It was very easy to fold and light for travel.  Nice to have it on hand as I never like hotel hair dryers.  Quiet and flexible.  Nice buy</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great! It showed up pretty fast. It comes with 2 attachments that can be used for a variety of things. the BEST thing about this blow dryer is the speed and temperature controls on it. It has 4 temperature controls. I got this to replace a Conair like it with the retractable cord and folding handle. This one is more light and plastic, but works way better. The Conair I had before lasted 30 years these ones are lasting about a year with everyday use. I love the price and the product.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer works fine and  is powerful. However it is a bit loud and the retractable cord is a bit difficult to use at first.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hairdryer.  It is lightweight and I love that the cord is stored inside and the handle folds.  It is not overpowering and dries my hair very quickly.  I would highly recommend it.  It is easy to pack if you want to take it with you on a trip.</li>
    <li> I love this Hair Dryer. I have thick long hair and it take around 5 mins to dry my hair.. Love it</li>
    <li> I never realized how much my old hairdryer sucked at drying until I got this one.  Within 30 seconds my hair has gone from wet to mildly damp.  With my old one I was drying for a good 2-3 min before my hair moved to damp.  This is the best purchase I have made.  The only downside is it is a little heavier than my old one but sooo worth it since I won&#x27;t be holding it near as long as I did the old one.</li>
    <li> Pros: Lots of nice features; fold up handle and retracting cord. Really does make my hair feel soft and seem healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s not as lightweight as I would have hoped or some other reviews have said. It&#x27;s also not as quiet as other reviews have stated, the noise is average, not any quieter or louder than others that I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with it, especially for the $25.00 price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 04/16/13 - owned for over a year and still going strong.</li>
    <li> This is a top of the line blow dryer with many settings. The bonuses are the folding handle and the retractable cord. Love it!</li>
    <li> Just bought this hair dryer for my upcoming trip - I needed something with dual voltage. It arrived in approx 30 hours through Prime Shipping. Tested it out tonight and LOVED it. I have thick-course hair that generally dries moderately straight, but I straighten it to smooth it down. This hair dryer nearly eliminated my need to straighten my hair! It dried quickly and straight! No frizz, hardly any flyaways, and super soft! I&#x27;m very pleased and definitely recommend this product! Just hope it&#x27;ll hold up to the English weather!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a travel dryer with dual voltage for use in  Europe.  I was disappointed in the large size, heavy weight and the fact that the hot setting on low speed was not hot. I have decided to take my own dryer to use on the cruise part of my trip and take a chance on the dryers provided by the hotels I stay in.</li>
    <li> Less than two years of use and this thing just stopped working. Aggravating!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an ionic dryer that would eliminate frizz. I also wanted one that featured a cool shot button. What sold me was that in adition to my \\&quot;musts,\\&quot; it folds for easy storage. Oh but the fact that it has a retractable cord makes it even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was NOT expecting and which made me a happy camper was the versatility of the settings. According to the product description, it has 3 heat/2 speed settings. For a newbie like me, that was a bit vague - pardon my ignorance. But it turns out it has the \\&quot;low/off/high\\&quot; speed switch on one side, and on the other side you can adjust to \\&quot;cool/warm/hot.\\&quot; That&#x27;s in addition to the cool shot button!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if that&#x27;s not enough, the package includes a chart that I find to be very helpful for selecting the speed/temp according to hair type:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOW/COOL - Delicate, thin, easy to style hair&lt;br /&gt;LOW/WARM - Average-to-thick or treated hair&lt;br /&gt;HIGH/HOT - Thick, coarse or hard-to-style hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot temp works fine with me, and my hair falls into the \\&quot;average-to-thick\\&quot; category. It took less than 2 minutes to dry my shoulder-length hair, with about half the time having it on low/warm and the other half on high/hot. And it wasn&#x27;t as loud as I thought it would be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One down side (the only one I can find) is that it&#x27;s a bit bulky and on the heavy side. If that&#x27;s not an issue, I would recommend this product, since it&#x27;s the best one I could find at such a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many features for a reasonable price, you can&#x27;t beat that. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I got this hoping it would be a good replacement for my last blow dryer that i loved, and had for 3 years. I like the bendable handle and retractable cord. the setting are nice BUT it randomly shuts off while im using it!!! Ill have it on medium heat on high and its like it over heats or something. Its horrible for when im in a hurry getting ready for work because it takes at least 10 minutes to cool down enough for it to turn back on. And its not the outlet, or the fuse, i can take it to every outlet in my house and it still wont work until it cools down. But for the price i guess i shouldnt have expected any better.</li>
    <li> I am actually pleasantly surprised that this dryer is as nice as it is.  I was a little concerned about the quality because of the price.  The way the buttons are took a little getting used to.  I like that the handle folds in and the cord winds in.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Very well constructed and aesthetically pleasing. I would recommend this product to anyone who appreciates top quality at a reasonable price. WNC</li>
    <li> I love this product because it does a great job at drying hair with multiple drying settings, but mainly it is great in that it is not bulky like most hair dryers. It folds in half, has a retractable cord, and is fairly light.</li>
    <li> I really love this hairdryer.  It has a lot of power which is a must, but it has some fun features.  I love the fact that the handle folds up so it takes up less room in my bathroom cabinet!!  My favorite thing about this hairdryer is that it has a retractable cord because there is nothing I hate worse than cords everywhere in my bathroom!!!  I am very pleased with my purchase, and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a 2-week trip to Chile.  Worked well on their 220 volt system though it cannot be used on High Heat and High Fan when operating on 220.  Once I got home to the US I moved my current hair dryer to the guest bathroom and am using this one now.  It has a strong fan and the heat options are accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retractable cord and folding handle make it less cumbersome in the suitcase and it&#x27;s easier to store at home too.</li>
    <li> This dryer does really make a difference in a fuller head of hair appearance using the sonic property of this dryer.  The heat and intensity choices work great and the retraction of the cord is a nice feature!</li>
    <li> Ok hair drying but the heat setting don&#x27;t quite work perfectly. The hot setting on high air setting messes up my curls a little, but the hot setting on low air doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. other than that it is great for travel and unlike a lot of the reviews about the cord retraction  problem I didn&#x27;t find that a problem, you just need to pull it out all the way and hold the button steady for it to gain momentum. Sometimes I have to help it with the last inch or two. but definitely it&#x27;s not a big issue. what more can you expect from a tiny motor of this size. I would rather have this than a good motor that would also make the hair dryer heavier.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with what I have got for this price, I still think as far as travel dryers go this the best one I have seen so far.</li>
    <li> While it looked good, and probably would work fine in the US, but overseas it was a piece of junk and useless on my trip overseas.  The 120v &amp;#60;&amp;#62; 220v switch could not be moved, so I took the handle apart, moved the switch, put it back together, and then the switch moved back when my daughter held the dryer in her hand.  Could not move the switch back again.  Cord could not be retracted either.  Threw the whole thing in the trash - not worth talking up space in my suitcase a second time.</li>
    <li> Three Conair dryers.  First one went on fire during use.  Second one didn&#x27;t make it a year before the button broke off to retract the cord.  E-mailed Conair and they responded with lengthy instructions on how I can fix it.  Instead, I threw it away and bought the 260PX.  Although it worked well, it stopped working after 13 months.  I contacted Conair and was given instructions on how to get a new one under the limited warranty.  With the cost of shipping both ways, it would cost me the same to buy a new dryer.  So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing...just not from Conair.  Will never buy another Conair product!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item from MJ Entertainment. They sent me a cheaper hair dryer that wasn&#x27;t even this model. When I contacted them to rectify the problem, they insisted the blame for the error is Amazons &amp; they wanted me to pay further money to send it back to them to fix the problem. When I replied to them they sent a form letter requesting me to spend further money. They are obviously not concerned with ethical business practices nor providing good quality customer service especially when the mistake is obviously theirs &amp; a mistake they can avoid easily but refuse to do anything to solve it, other than request me to send the wrong one back at my expense. If you decide to purchase this item, I suggest you try a seller that stands behind their products &amp; performs honest business practices. I will never purchase anything from this company &amp; recommend whomever reads this does themselves a favor &amp; stay clear of MJ Entertainment and any products they sell. Its definitely worth a couple more dollars to deal with a seller that understands customers &amp; good customer satisfaction ethics is what will get a business to thrive &amp; prosper.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works just fine but it was not as compact as I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that with the ability for the cord to retract, they had to make the handle part fatter.  For someone with smaller hands, it&#x27;s a bit more effort to hold the dryer up.  And on top of that, the dryer is pretty heavy which makes it even harder to hold it up straight for an extended time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are smaller built and want things small and light, then this may not be the dryer for you.</li>
    <li> I really liked this hair dryer.  After about 3 months, the cord would only go in part of the way.  At 7 months it would cut out and then eventually didn&#x27;t work.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> oh my i really love this item i live in the bahamas so item was very costly for me to get this item here but i would pay the same price or more if his item got stolen thats how much i love my blow dryer and the combs is so like good for my hair type and its not painful to use the comb get your own to really appreciate what am saying</li>
    <li> I am in the military stationed in Europe. I thought this would be great because I could take it home with me when we move back to the States. The only problem I&#x27;m having with it is that it is really hard to keep it plugged into a converter. Converters typically have a round insert for your plugs, sadly this hairdryer is like most and has a rectangular plug. I do have thick hair and it takes me about 15mins to dry my hair. This is normal for me so no big deal. However using 225 you can&#x27;t use the high heat setting. The hair dryer locks the heat setting so you can&#x27;t damage it. Overall as long as I don&#x27;t move around to much I like it.</li>
    <li> This Hair Dryer Folds Up Nicely, The Cord Retracts Smoothly &amp; The Settings Are Also Perfect And Do Not Burn My Hair.</li>
    <li> Slightly larger than I hoped but works for me. Does not pack down very small.  Does dry my hair fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my old Conair folding handle dryer. That one was a bit more compact, which I liked, but this one isn&#x27;t bulky and works really well. I appreciate the ability to control both the temperature and speed of the air. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> No complaints on functionality but it is WAY bigger and heavier then I expected based on my previous cord-keeper folding handle Conair.  I supose I should have paid more attention to the size specs before ordering but I guess I assumed a style that folds up would be space conscious all the way around.  If you own a seperate hair dryer for travel, this could be a good option.  I think it would be best for the teen age crowd, it is awfuly pink too.</li>
    <li> I love that the cord is kept inside the hair dryer.  No more tangled cord. Glad I bought hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Conair use to be a great product, and due to the fact of personal use over thirty years of different hair dryers, I purchased this model. The folding andel, and retractable cord were attractive to me, but the dryer did not last a year. I used it every morning for three to five minutes, but everything now a days is built cheap, and doesen&#x27;t last. Same with this model. Great size for travel, or small storage, but don&#x27;t expect it to last.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer for the price, and was sent out and delivered to my house ultra fast.</li>
    <li> I love it. Love the retractable cord. My husband says it&#x27;s too loud when he&#x27;s still asleep in the next room, so I took away one star.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I had a better hair dryer (which isn&#x27;t fair because I paid double the price for it). I bought it before moving to London for its dual voltage capabilities. It&#x27;s quite lovely with its folding handle and its cord keeper.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries my long hair quickly and efficiently.  I even notice less frizz than I used to, which is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great dryer! The button that is used to retract the cord is a little stuck sometimes, but that is a minor drawback.</li>
    <li> As is likely with all hair dryers that have the retractible cord, it already quit working and I bought it in October 2013. Eight months later already quit. The two stars it got is for ease of drying your hair.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best retractable dryer I&#x27;ve purchased.  I always seem to go through these really quickly.  I like that the cord retracts so I don&#x27;t end up wearing away the wire.  This unit retracts great!  Much better than previous dryers I&#x27;ve purchased.  Dries very quickly and looks great!</li>
    <li> There are four thickmaned, long haired females in our household and this hair dryer has been fantastic in tackling drying and styling! It&#x27;s also surprisingly quiet which is a bonus for early (5am) hair-prep. When our other hairdryer goes up in smoke, I&#x27;m going to get a additional Conair.</li>
    <li> Not too much I can say about this little gem. I purchased it mainly because of the good reviews, and the fact that it came with a diffuser for my very curly hair. It&#x27;s inexpensive, but I&#x27;d bet it would hold up to any of the much pricier dryers. Don&#x27;t hesitate to get this one.</li>
    <li> Had it for 2 months now... It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Love the look and the accessories/functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a retractable cord...GOT IT!&lt;br /&gt;I needed a diffuser....GOT IT!&lt;br /&gt;I needed it slightly quiet....didn&#x27;t really get it. It&#x27;s a hair louder than I like but not detrimental.&lt;br /&gt;Stability....still unsure. The way the handle folds makes it a little wobbly. Not my favorite feature but I guess the others out way....I haven&#x27;t had a week so it a cpl months the handle may be the worse feature or not cause any problems.</li>
    <li> Works great, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This dryer has good air velocity, but the air isn&#x27;t as warm as I would like it to be. Also it has a higher pitch whine than I would have expected for a dryer of this size. I have a little portable dryer and this one sounds almost identical. I do love the retractable cord. It&#x27;s nice not having a bunch of loose cord everywhere. I also like that it folds down to a smaller size for packing away.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is a very powerful unit that exceeds all my expectations. I am so glad I got this unit from Conair. The dryer arrived before the specified date and I use it all the time to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and it only lasted a few short months. I could&#x27;ve used the warranty to try and get a new one but decided not to bother. I ended up getting her the Conair Silverbird which she loves!!! I was disappointed because this hair dryer is perfect for travel too.</li>
    <li> everything about this blowdryer is 5stars. from the power it puts out to the dual setting for speed and heat/cold. it also has watts setting which came in very handy on our trip to the beautiful islands of greece :) would definitely recommended</li>
    <li> It had all the things I was looking for in a travel blow dryer. It has a folding handle, retractable cord, both attachments and all the proper heat and speed settings. It folds down small enough for me, but others may think it&#x27;s not small enough to be considered a &amp;#34;travel blow dryer&amp;#34;. I may end up using it as my everyday blow dyer. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> It works great! I love that it is compact and the cord is retractable. My only complaint is the cord is not very long. My outlet is above my sink in my bathroom so the length of the cord is fine for me there, but if I were using an outlet close to the floor I would not be able to move as freely.</li>
    <li> I have this same model...but a much older version.  I&#x27;ve probably had it for at least 8 years.  I never had any problems with it until the last year or so.  The button to retract the cord broke within this last year.  But the dryer continued to work.  Lately, it has started to get hot while using it and if I turn it off it won&#x27;t turn back on until it cools down.  My husband says it&#x27;s because it has a lot of dust in it.  He could take it apart and clean it out and it would probably last for several more years, but I miss the retractable cord.  I am looking for a new hair dryer and will very possibly get this same model.  I think I paid less than $20 for it.  You can&#x27;t beat that for value in a hair dryer that lasted so long.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and she loves it! Works perfect dries hair fast and makes it look shinny and smooth!</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I bought a Conair dryer with the retractable cord. I&#x27;ve been so pleased with it, I looked for another just like it when mine finally gave out after using it for over 10 years. The 260PX has more settings and a folding handle (I haven&#x27;t used that feature yet). I haven&#x27;t had it a long time, but it is working fine for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer; the handle folds down for easy compact storage.  I also like how it is dual voltage, but I&#x27;m not sure if the 1875 will withstand the wattage overseas.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an affordable hair dryer and picked this one based on other reviews, and its worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;You can change the settings enough to get any kind of speed or temperature, and since you can fold the handle it&#x27;s easy to store in a small bathroom drawer.&lt;br /&gt;The retractable cord is a plus too, and it doesn&#x27;t get all tangled up with your other junk. No complaints!</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly and just as advertised. I love it.....it dries my thick hair in a flash. Try it!</li>
    <li> Wife bought it for trips abroad and the voltage selector is basically impossible to move to the 220-240v slot unless you have a screwdriver handy. Even after we selected the correct voltage it just wouldn&#x27;t work. I guess it&#x27;s a little bulky as well and doesn&#x27;t heat fast enough. So she is now using the regular dryer when home. One good thing is this has retractable cord. However, pretty useless for travel since it didn&#x27;t work in 2 different countries we tried. Avoid.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is fast, it folds down well my only beef is that is sometimes sticks and the cord soesnt retract all teh way. but only by about an inch or 2 not a huge deal!</li>
    <li> I love it cause it&#x27;s pink. I love that the wires are retractable - I received a few compliments from my friend regarding my hairdryer. Lastly, it&#x27;s a rather powerful dryer! For the price I&#x27;ve paid for this, it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a folding handle hair dryer with a retractable cord and this one is perfect! It has more features than I expected, based on the online description. I was pleased to find out there are multiple temperature and speed settings, and it is so much more quiet than other hair dryers I&#x27;ve purchased. I love it!</li>
    <li> Like most other reviews, that I now have read through, this hair dryer is less than acceptable. At first it was great... I loved the retractable cord and folding handle, it was very easy to store. The hair dryer worked well, it was hot and dried my (very long) hair within minutes. Unfortunately, after only 6 months of use, it became intermittently useful... I suspect it has a problem with the power cord. Sometimes it turns on but most times it does not. I have managed to finish off the winter with some patience... however, now that the weather is warm and I no longer need to dry my hair, I am trashing the hair dryer. Not that my opinion matters, but  I do not recommend this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for a trip to France and the Czech Republic, hoping I would only need an adapter instead of an adapter &amp; converter since this dryer is dual-voltage. Turned out that I did need the converter which was disappointing but otherwise it worked just fine. It has all the features I wanted: dual-voltage, folds up, retractable cord, and diffuser attachment. Surprisingly that was hard to find so I was just happy to find a hair dryer that offered the features I wanted. This hair dryer didn&#x27;t exceed my expectations but it did meet them. Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Great little hair dryer! Gets my thick hair dry pretty quickly and leaves it really shiny. I don&#x27;t use it often but I&#x27;ve had it for awhile now and always recommend it to my friends. I love that the handle folds for easy storage and travel.</li>
    <li> Lasted 9 months ... purchased December 14, 2013 .. Died September 25 2014.  What happened to the hair dryers that used to go for 10 years?  This one the cord started heating up and then it just stopped working.  Probably the 4th hair dryer I&#x27;ve bought my wife in 5 years ... I guess they are just a disposable item now.</li>
    <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s strange coming from me, but I&#x27;ve purchased 2 of these and it&#x27;s still my favorite blow dryer!&lt;br /&gt;I used this dryer for more than 4 years and never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a second one because I gave the first one to my fiance&#x27;, who lives in Japan!&lt;br /&gt;Her mom fell in love with it, didn&#x27;t bring it to the States so I had to buy yet another ConAir blow dryer :).&lt;br /&gt;But now she has my second one, and won&#x27;t accept the ConAir Infiniti Pro I bought for her.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, because I miss my cordless action :(&lt;br /&gt;But I can still blow dry my hair after taking the braids out, because this is by far the best dryer ever.</li>
    <li> I use it to dry watch and clock parts!</li>
    <li> Love love this hair dryer. Folds for easy storage. Would buy it again.Have had similar hair dryers with the retractable cords, but the folding handle is great for travel.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money!  I used it for 16 months and the reset button stopped working!  Called Conair, and they say Consumer pays to ship it to them for repair/replacement since it is still under warranty, and Consumer pays $7 for return shipping.  That&#x27;s $14 for a $22 hair dryer that only lasted a little over a year!  Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
    <li> my wife has long hair and said this didn&#x27;t dry it as well as her current hair dryer. However she will keep this for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5 stars. Great design will retractable cord and folding handle. poor performance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need any special hair tools that cost $100. I have thick, wavy hair and this works just fine, especially with the diffuser attachment. I love how the cord retracts and the handle folds up - it makes storing it wonderfully easy. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Super cute. I love the cord retract feature and the fact that it folds to save space in my cabinets. The settings are just right and the diffuser is perfect for my curly hair</li>
    <li> This item works great for me. I have thin hair and it dries in a matter of 2-3 minutes with this hairdryer. Love the heat control, retractable cord, and that it folds up.  Great item.</li>
    <li> In the past, I spent $50 on a hair dryer, and because I can&#x27;t have nice things...I would drop them violently, or hit them repeatedly again the countertop when I was blow drying my hair upside down. Finally, I said to myself- \\&quot;Enought is enough\\&quot;, I was buying $50.00 hair dryers every 3 months! I bought a $15 Conair (not this exact one) at Target and it lasted for 5 years and through out all my violent tendencies with hair dryers--but all good things come to an end. I got a puppy and she chewed through the cord! So I had to buy another one. This lady at Ulta suggested a Vidal Sassoon one...It folded and the cord came up. I loved it, but it stoped working after a month!  So, I went to the trusty amazon and found this gem.  So far, so good. I&#x27;ve had it about a month, and my hair feels better than the Vidal one, and my previous Conair! I highly recommend this, and I&#x27;m hoping Conair doesn&#x27;t fail me now.</li>
    <li> I have used this item before and really like it. My last one did not last very long so hope this one has a longer shelf life. Do use caution when you retract the cord as it does fly back quickly and will snap you in the arm or hand. But it sure beats having a loose cord in the drawer or having to wind it around the dryer. The fold up handle is great too for using up less space in the drawer.</li>
    <li> Searched high and low for a good quality,  stylish and affordable hair dryer. This is perfect....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it a while now (over a year) and I am still happy to have found this.  I really love the folding handle and retracting cable with the push of a button - allows me to pack it away nice and easily.  Everything else works as described.</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer..!!  I have a narrow drawer for my hair supplies and because this has a folding handle, it fits right in the drawer..!!  And, it has super power drying my think hair..!!  I bought an extra one so I have it once I wear this one out..!!</li>
    <li> What can I say? You turn it on, heat comes out, stuff dries. Has a bunch of settings. Also, is my wife&#x27;s I have short hair so I have no need for this. She told me 5 stars so that sounds good to me.</li>
    <li> I loved it. It does the job that I needed done.I will not change to any other dryer as long as I can purchase this one.</li>
    <li> I cannot fault this product on the way it functions. Plenty of air, choice of temps and the retractable cord works well, once you get the knack of it.( You have to hold down a button, pull the cord, then guide it back in while still holding the button down) However, it is much bulkier than I expected, and a bit on the heavy side.I was attracted to this item by the cord feature as I thought it would fit more neatly into one of my vanity drawers or a suitcase. But, it is too bulky,even with the handle folded, so has to go in the linen closet.Also, the location of the controls are such that I have to stop the hair drying to change a setting, as this requires both hands.Because of the weight and bulk, I find it very awkward to brush my hair while holding the dryer. It does do a good and quick job of drying and, hopefully, I will get more comfortable with it, in time.</li>
    <li> This is a good dryer while it lasts. Quiet, good heat, not too heavy. But I have owned it less than six months and yesterday it stopped producing heat, just blew cold air.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice to be able to have the cord wind itself up inside the dryer and out of the way.</li>
    <li> For home use, this dryer is okay. it works fine. I like the retractable cord. It&#x27;s bulky and would take up way too much room in a suitcase. The diffuser barely fits in my bathroom drawer with this dryer. I&#x27;m either returning it donating it to a homeless shelter.</li>
    <li> I really like that the cord retracts.  Good force of air.  Nice that you can change speeds and/or heat settings.  I like that you can set it to cool or if you are using a heat you could do a blast of cool with the button.  Slightly heavier than I would like but not unreasonably so.</li>
    <li> I have put up picking up a new hair dryer for 2 years now. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long!!! This thing is great. Enough settings to please my hair. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to toast it. The price was spectacular. I travel a lot between Detroit and Toronto and needed a dryer that I could fold up and toss in a suitcase. This does just that!!!! It came with a few pieces as well which work great. The diffuser seems to give my hair nice body and a beautiful shine. Plus it&#x27;s pink and black....how cute!!</li>
    <li> This dryer was great while it lasted.  Purchased July 20, 2012 ~ quit working Sept 16, 2013. It has a 2 year warranty, but they want me to ship it back at my expense along with $7 to cover shipping back to me.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product, because I don&#x27;t really like folding handles... but it is just perfect. It works very well and the retractable cord is great (a bit short, but that is fine). It is a bit heavy, but that is ok. It is as big as regular hair dryer. I am very happy with this purchase. I will update my review with information about how it works in Europe as soon as I go there!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing. My hair gets frizzy by being in the same room as a normal hair dryer, much less using one. This dryer keeps my hair from frizzing. It&#x27;s perfectly sized for my gym bag as well.</li>
    <li> Terrible....lasted only 6 months. Only used this like 1-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite blow dryer. I had it for a few years and then it died on me. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore so I turned to Amazon. Yay! Got my fav dryer back and it works perfectly :)</li>
    <li> The hair dryer seemed great, but after opening I realized it only runs on 60 hz.  I bought this for travel outside the U.S., and needed dual voltage and 50 / 60 hz.  Be careful if you are purchasing for countries that only run on 50 hz because this hairdryer won&#x27;t work for you.  Sadly I had to return it and keep looking.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after reviewing all the critiques and criticisms. They said buy this model rather than the least expensive model but I am not impressed.  The low heat (which I use most having short hair) feels too cold. The hot setting is hot but the warm setting isn&#x27;t warm enough to dry my hair. It is too cool and takes too long to actually dry my hair. It works great and each setting is different in heat and fan speed but the warm setting doesn&#x27;t dry fast enough and the hot setting is too hot.</li>
    <li> my hair dryer died after 1 year, very disappointed This is the second one from Conair that this happened to, the other died after 6 months. Going to try a different brand</li>
    <li> I got this product for my mother who was living in south america where the electricity is 220. When I changed the settings to support the high voltage overseas, the high speed feature was disabled. You can only use the blower on low speed and warm heat, however, it is enough to dry your hair. When mom brought it back to the US, we change the voltage again and all the features, High, low, hot warm and cold completely worked. I love the retractable cord feature and the fact that it folds. It made it very practical to carry around.</li>
    <li> Retractable cord, folding handle and cool shot are great features.  Variable speeds is also nice to have.  Powerful enough too.</li>
    <li> I love anything that can put away the cord in a snap and dries my hair half the time as my other regular hair dryer - they are right, ionic technology does work!  I have no regrets buying this item.  It works as advertised!</li>
    <li> After going through 3 Revlon dryers within a year, I decided to go back to good, old, faithful Conair. This dryer is just like my previous ones--- very powerful. I love not having to spend 15 minutes drying my hair. I can get it done in 5 with this dryer. Thankfully it only takes that long because it is EXTREMELY heavy!,</li>
    <li> It came extremely fast. I was shocked to see it had come so soon. It came in the package and works amazing,</li>
    <li> I have this same dryer from years ago.  I was shocked to see the same model was available.  It&#x27;s is modernized a bit, but same great function as the original.  I love that it folds up for travel and storage and that the cord stores inside.  Temp and blower are very strong and love the cold button.</li>
    <li> My previous Conair blow dryer had a retractable cord and I loved it.  It was great for easy storage and my storage space is limited and cramped.  After years though, that blow dryer died and I needed to replace it.  I always go with Conair because they make a trusty, yet inexpensive, product.  I chose this one because of the retractable cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage.  I figured that if the retracting cord helped with storage, the folding handle has to be even better, right?  Plus, I&#x27;m traveling internationally this year, so I thought the folding handle would be good for a suitcase and the dual voltage would be good for international power conversion.  While I had high hopes for his blow dryer, it has really been nothing but disappointing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blow dryer itself works great, like any other Conair I&#x27;ve owned.  The retracting cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage switch, however, do not.  The joint on the folding handle is quite flimsy.  The top of the blow dryer wobbles a bit back and forth and I&#x27;m sure this will only get worse over time.  This feature doesn&#x27;t seem built to last.  The retractable cord also doesn&#x27;t retract.  It gets stuck halfway through and still leaves about a foot and a half of cord sticking out of the end of the blow dryer.  It&#x27;s not a huge deal since the blow dryer still works, but it is definitely irritating since I bought the blow dryer specifically for this feature.  I don&#x27;t know for sure, but in my opinion, I think the retractable cord doesn&#x27;t work right because of the folding handle.  It just seems like that whole area is made flimsy and I think the cord is getting stuck inside the blow dryer near the joint of the handle.  And finally, the dual voltage switch--I can&#x27;t, for the life of me, get that thing to switch over.  I&#x27;ve tried using my acrylic nails, a screwdriver, my boyfriend, etc. and nothing has worked.  Unless you&#x27;re traveling with Thor, I wouldn&#x27;t count on this feature.  Luckily I have a power converter for other electric items, so I can use that with the blow dryer...if it makes it that long.  I may chuck the thing out a window next week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anybody is interested in the Conair blow dryer I had prior to this one, it was the Conair YOU Cord Reel 2-in-1 Hair Dryer.  It last me years and the retractable cord worked great!</li>
    <li> One of the best purchase. I also love the color. Quick and easy to use. The price is also just right!</li>
    <li> i got this for my girlfriend for her birthday and she loves it she says it works very well and fast</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter 5 months ago. She loves it especially over the one she used to borrow from me. It dries her hair very fast and the folding handle and retractable cord make it great for travel. I am thinking of getting one for myself once mine dies knowing this is a good one.</li>
    <li> 30 year old conair finally acting its age. This one is good, the only reason for 4 not 5 stars is due to cord retracting button that pushes hard. It works but harder than expected. Other than that, product is light, nice selection of temps and settings, and handle fold up just fine.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair dryer that would fit in the cabinet when I&#x27;m not using it. I bought it because it had a retractable cord and folding handle, but the folding handle does not work so I returned. I thought it would be good because of the Conair name.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 4 star rating because this hair dryer offer&#x27;s everything you need in one. It has numerous speeds and heat settings, gives out more than enough heat also. The cord retracts and then the hair dryer can be folder for traveling. It has all the necessary attachments also. I&#x27;ve had one myself for 2 yrs. and love it. I bought 2 more for my granddaughter and daughter for Christmas gifts as they requested a hair dryer. I&#x27;ve tried a lot and this one is the best for me. I would have given it 5 stars, but I think the cord could be just a little longer.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite hair dryer yet. It folds and it has retractable cord!! The cord never gets hung up like some of the other models I have had. Drys fast too!!</li>
    <li> It works great, it arrived on time! it&#x27;s very conveninan for traveling. I recommend it to everyone i konw :)</li>
    <li> I have owned this for a little over a year and it&#x27;s been working on and off for a few months now. At first it was fine but I may need to replace it soon. I use this about 1-2 times a week. Longer when it worked for winter.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It drys my hair real fast and it is easy to store with the folding handle</li>
    <li> It has it all: ionic, high heat, low drying sound, cool shot, foldable and the cord keeper. Nothing much else to say except that---wish it lasted longer!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer a little over a year ago and did not use it often (a few times a week).  It already died.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Love the retractable cord and the folding handle! Sturdy unit with good power. Would definately recommend!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works extremely well and folds and stores neatly in a drawer. The retractable cord is easy to use with just a push of the button.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer! The multiple heat and speed settings are great. It is a little heavy,but that&#x27;s coming from a travel blower. The retractible cord is awesome but could be a little longer.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer was a fine replacement (while it lasted) for my wife&#x27;s old (used for 8+years!) Conair dryer that she loved.  She figured sticking with Conair would be a safe bet, given how long her mini travel dryer had lasted.  WRONG.  She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We&#x27;ve never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.  She just had to toss it and will have to buy another one far sooner than she expected she&#x27;d have to.  Conair should make better quality products than this!</li>
    <li> It rewinds every time!  Has the usual features, is priced well and except for the purple exotic feature, it blends well in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product. It works as advertised. The Amazon&#x27;s price was awesome. I recommend this product. I wish I bought this in a different color.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS ONE BECAUSE I HAVE THE VERSION BEFORE IT AND THIS ONE IS LIL ON THE HEAVY SIDE BUT GREAT FOR THE PRICE</li>
    <li> Perfect hair dryer, does the job. Comes with 2 add-on&#x27;s for scrunching hair or blowing it out straight. The retractable cord is a space-saver life-saver!</li>
    <li> This is a good solid hair dryer. I seems a little heavier than others we have had and likes to slip of the counter and fall to the floor. It takes a blow and keeps on blowing.</li>
    <li> I liked it for performance and hot/cold options. The different speed options are also good but its so big, not convenient for travel or to carry around</li>
    <li> My Conair folding retractable cord dryer I&#x27;ve had for years finally kicked the bucket so I upgraded to this version. I love it! This on has more setting options and drys quickly and without frizzing.</li>
