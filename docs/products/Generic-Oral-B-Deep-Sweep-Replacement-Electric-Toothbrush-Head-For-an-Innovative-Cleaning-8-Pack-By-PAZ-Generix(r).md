      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Great Product!!</li>
      <li>Works great with my husband&#x27;s OralB toothbrush!</li>
      <li>The best Oral-B replacement heads I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase!!</li>
      <li>Works very good.  </li>
      <li>fits well and works great.</li>
      <li>These sould work nicely for a very good price.</li>
      <li>hacent yet had to use them, but Im sure they will be great when i do!</li>
      <li>These fit my electric toothbrush perfectly and cost a fraction of the name brand refill brushes.</li>
      <li>feels good.</li>
      <li>.. don&#x27;t understand how it got good reviews that got me into buying.. contacted the seller and was told they would accept return if not opened..</li>
      <li>They fit onto my electric toothbrush like a glove!!</li>
      <li>Good for the price and fit prefect.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRICE for 8 of these, very cost effective would buy again</li>
      <li>Fits our tooth brushes just fine!</li>
      <li>One of them ended up with a metal rod protruding out of the top, which could have caused injury, had I not noticed it before brushing.</li>
      <li>Finally a great alternative to the expensive brand name, an a great price too!!</li>
      <li>Works just the same as the name brand, great price too.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>POWERFUL!</li>
      <li>it seems in this case &amp;#34;Generic&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;not as well made as the original Oral-B Replacement Toothbrush Head&amp;#34; . . .  </li>
      <li>It hurts my gum, but the original Oral-B won&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>for they say, they&#x27;re right!</li>
      <li>Just as good, bristles don&#x27;t fall out, an feels the same.</li>
      <li>At first I thought maybe some toothpaste got under the brush, and paid special attention to rinse out the interior.</li>
      <li>Then I thought maybe it was because the brush head became loose during use, causing damage to the interior, so I made sure to check that it was fit on snug before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very please with my purchase can&#x27;t beat the price !</li>
      <li>This replacement head lasted maybe a week and the top section stopped swiveling and then the entire brush head stopped all together.</li>
      <li>Things stop working after first couple of uses</li>
      <li>ok  only in the price</li>
      <li>I love to save money as much as the next person, but I guess this is one of those situations where you get what you pay for . . .</li>
      <li>Been using for several weeks just to be sure before I posted a review... arrived fast</li>
      <li>I have been using the first one for about a month now and is holding up very well.  </li>
      <li>Thanks guys</li>
      <li>they are very well made and you wont notice the difference with the originals,</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and</li>
      <li>The brush has a larger degree of rotation than the original manufacturer.</li>
      <li>The first one out of the package apparently had some sort of flaw that prevented it from providing the type of movement produced by the original toothbrush head that came with the Oral-B Deep Sweep electric toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>the second one is working so far, but I will NOT purchase these cheaply made replacement toothbrush heads again.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t clean, loose tip keeps getting off while brushing, hurts my gums</li>
      <li>It did not work at all, and immediately found a new home in the wastebasket . . .</li>
      <li>Work and fit like the originals at MUCH less cost.</li>
      <li>Too early to give a valid review.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a toothbrush, other than the right price, what else can you say?</li>
      <li>(if it was an option, I would give a score of zero), since more than half of the replacement toothbrush heads quit working properly after just a few days of use.  </li>
      <li>These are very soft and don&#x27;t last long.</li>

<li> 8 heads will last you a long time.</li>
<li> I like that these are gentler than the regular round brushes and the sweeping action</li>
<li> Decent brush heads, but it does tend to slip off if you push too hard.  </li>

<li> /&gt;Unfortunately, i&#x27;m through another 2, half way through my second pack now.</li>

<li> Works just like the Oral B brand, yet costs fractions less.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t recommend this, as it performs too poorly for even a generic.</li>
<li> waste of money &amp; not healthy at all..</li>
<li> Not a good idea to buy these.</li>
<li> Then the head stopped sweeping, like there was something inside broken.</li>
<li> Basically, the brush would stop rotating, probably because something is broken on the inside.</li>
<li> ALSO TONS OF FAKE REVIEWS ON HERE.  </li>
<li> I have had bad luck finding a cheaper substitute to the expensive brand name, but rest assured, these will end your search.</li>
<li> bad experience..</li>
<li> how can anyone know they are worthless without trying?</li>

    <li> Works great! POWERFUL!</li>
    <li> Decent brush heads, but it does tend to slip off if you push too hard.  Not really an ongoing problem though, but I gave it four stars instead of five.</li>
    <li> I thought that I would save some money. These are very soft and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Fits our tooth brushes just fine! Works great!</li>
    <li> Hey! it&#x27;s a toothbrush, other than the right price, what else can you say?</li>
    <li> Works just the same as the name brand, great price too.</li>
    <li> This replacement head lasted maybe a week and the top section stopped swiveling and then the entire brush head stopped all together. Not a good idea to buy these.</li>

    <li> Bristles not as firm as the actual Oral B brushes but for the price they will do.</li>
    <li> It is too big for my mouth and the front row moves around</li>
    <li> Works just like the Oral B brand, yet costs fractions less.</li>
    <li> The brush has a larger degree of rotation than the original manufacturer. Some people may not like that part of it, but I thought that was a +.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 2 packs I ordered, the majority of the brush heads would fail within the first few days, if it isn&#x27;t already malfunctioning. Basically, the brush would stop rotating, probably because something is broken on the inside. At first I thought maybe some toothpaste got under the brush, and paid special attention to rinse out the interior. Then I thought maybe it was because the brush head became loose during use, causing damage to the interior, so I made sure to check that it was fit on snug before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, i&#x27;m through another 2, half way through my second pack now. The problem still persists. I can&#x27;t recommend this, as it performs too poorly for even a generic.</li>
    <li> Things stop working after first couple of uses</li>
    <li> Too early to give a valid review.  See what the dentist says the next time they check my teeth.</li>
    <li> They work as well as the OEM.</li>
    <li> Bought these and they worked just likes the original.......for about 2 weeks. Then the head stopped sweeping, like there was something inside broken. The second one lasted about 5 days, same problem. Don&#x27;t waist your money on these, they&#x27;re junk.  You get what you pay for they say, they&#x27;re right!</li>
    <li> Refill as I need them</li>
    <li> they are very well made and you wont notice the difference with the originals, ok  only in the price</li>
    <li> works, slightly loose but works.</li>
    <li> These generic brushes are comparable to name-brand brushes!! I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase!! They fit onto my electric toothbrush like a glove!! Save yourself some money!!!! 💸</li>
    <li> The best Oral-B replacement heads I&#x27;ve ever used. They work just as well as the actual Oral-B replacement heads and cost way less! Fast shipping and when I had to change my address with the shipper it was no problem. 8 heads will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Works very good.  I don&#x27;t know at this time if this brush will last as long as the Oral-B brush but I have been using it for about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Just 2 months working. It was losing strength until stopped. Not recommended. I will give a star.</li>
    <li> These fit my electric toothbrush perfectly and cost a fraction of the name brand refill brushes. I like that these are gentler than the regular round brushes and the sweeping action feels good.</li>
    <li> I love to save money as much as the next person, but I guess this is one of those situations where you get what you pay for . . . it seems in this case &amp;#34;Generic&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;not as well made as the original Oral-B Replacement Toothbrush Head&amp;#34; . . .  The first one out of the package apparently had some sort of flaw that prevented it from providing the type of movement produced by the original toothbrush head that came with the Oral-B Deep Sweep electric toothbrush.  It did not work at all, and immediately found a new home in the wastebasket . . . the second one is working so far, but I will NOT purchase these cheaply made replacement toothbrush heads again.  I am changing the score to one star (if it was an option, I would give a score of zero), since more than half of the replacement toothbrush heads quit working properly after just a few days of use.  One of them ended up with a metal rod protruding out of the top, which could have caused injury, had I not noticed it before brushing.</li>
    <li> It hurts my gum, but the original Oral-B won&#x27;t. Just used once...</li>
    <li> hacent yet had to use them, but Im sure they will be great when i do!</li>
    <li> Work and fit like the originals at MUCH less cost. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> These are great for ripping the crap out of your gum line, a 5 star torture device. Send these to your enemies!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t clean, loose tip keeps getting off while brushing, hurts my gums.. don&#x27;t understand how it got good reviews that got me into buying.. contacted the seller and was told they would accept return if not opened.. i tried 1 from each packet.. how can anyone know they are worthless without trying? bad experience.. waste of money &amp; not healthy at all..</li>
    <li> Works great with my husband&#x27;s OralB toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Finally a great alternative to the expensive brand name, an a great price too!! Just as good, bristles don&#x27;t fall out, an feels the same. Great Product!! Will definitely order again. Been using for several weeks just to be sure before I posted a review... arrived fast an packaged well. I have had bad luck finding a cheaper substitute to the expensive brand name, but rest assured, these will end your search. Thanks guys</li>
    <li> Stay away, doesn&#x27;t spin properly if you apply even a slight pressure.  Cheaply made.  ALSO TONS OF FAKE REVIEWS ON HERE.  Buyers beware!!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE for 8 of these, very cost effective would buy again</li>
    <li> Good for the price and fit prefect. Recommended.</li>
