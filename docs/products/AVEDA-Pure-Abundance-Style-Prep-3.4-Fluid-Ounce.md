<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was introduced to Aveda&#x27;s Pure Abundance Style Prep this summer and I don&#x27;t know how I ever made it through life without it before. This stuff is the BEST! It keeps the frizz away, and I can make my hair look however I want when I use it. It&#x27;s the perfect product for hair!</li>
    <li> I love how this product adds volume to my hair.  It is not sticky and is still soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This literally just did nothing for me hair. I bought it because I had purchase the straightening cream and loved it, so I thought maybe all Aveda hair products might be worth the price and hey, even if it doesn&#x27;t boost my volume, I can just use it as a detangling spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do either for me. I notice no difference at all in the volume of my hair vs when I don&#x27;t use any product at all (I have medium thickness, long hair that tends to sit flat on my head). My hair tangles so incredibly badly that it falls out in masses when I brush it - and I HAVE to brush it or it looks like a rat&#x27;s nest. This product is zero help, even though it claims it is supposed to detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept putting off returning it and unfortunately missed the window, so this was an incredible waste of money.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for fine hair. 2 little spritzes is all you need. Massage it into the roots and blow dry.  Great lift...</li>
    <li> Super styling...great fragrance.!</li>
    <li> AMAZING VOLUME AND VERSITILE PRODUCT:  HEAT PROTECTOR, VOLUMIZER, REFRESHER, ACTUALLY MAKES FINE HAIR LOOK MUCH THICKER. IT WILL ALWAYS REMAIL IN MY MEDICINE CABINET. IN FACT, IT WORKS ON ITS OWN AS AN EXCELLENT VOLUMIZER</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product when ordering something else from Aveda and fell in love with it.  My hair is soft and fine and this product just sprays on and immediately I saw volume results.  Depending on what you are trying to achieve, you can spray it directly on roots for more lift and volume.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and walking out of the salon, my hair was swingy and bouncy with this product in it. But the next day, my bangs had started to look piecey (read:greasy looking)... not a good look.  The next day I used Phomollient and everyone at the office agreed my hair looked WAY better.&lt;br /&gt;I would use this product only if I was out of everything else.</li>
    <li> Adds just enough volume and bounce when blow drying with a roller brush.  I love Aveda.  They make great products!</li>
    <li> Just a couple spritzes on wet hair before blow drying adds a lot of extra thickness.  Too much spray will weigh hair down, so don&#x27;t overdo it and you will enjoy.  Scent is nice also.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for thin, limp, no body hair which is what I have.&lt;br /&gt;Spray it on when hair is wet, let sit for minute and then blow out.&lt;br /&gt;It really does give body to the hair.</li>
    <li> Pure Abundance helps with styling in this humid Louisiana climate.</li>
    <li> Baby fine hair, and thin too.  This product actually does provide me the volume as claimed.</li>
    <li> This I found in Florida and it&#x27;s a wonderful product.  Styles wet hair for drying without the frizz.  Not sticky.</li>
    <li> Always gives great volume without the weight.</li>
    <li> Another fantastic Aveda hair product. I have fine hair that is thinning a bit, and this really pumps up the volume. I will be coming back for more.</li>

    <li> Makes my rather think hair appear abundant and thick!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Not very fond of the smell.  However, works so well!! I mist my roots with it after I towel dry my hair.  The next morning, my hair had so much more lift!  Don&#x27;t even need to blow dry. It&#x27;s the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased it and will again.</li>
    <li> Every woman who lives in a humid area should buy this product!</li>
    <li> Was introduced to this product several months ago and I love it.  It helps hold style on my fine, limp hair.</li>
    <li> It was okay but WAY too expensive for what it did.</li>

    <li> I Spray on after  hair is done and it really adds volume. Not sticky and smells nice. Does not dull hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products to give my hair &#x27;lift&#x27; at the crown, and this works the best for my hair. I have tried various foam root lifters and powder type products but nothing compares to this Aveda product, I love it!</li>
    <li> First bought this at my Aveda hair salon.  It goes on post shower wet hair and adds volume while blow drying. I&#x27;ve had to go without it while traveling and my hair turned out flat and lifeless.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> Great styling gel and great price.</li>
    <li> Adds a nice bouncy fullness to my very fine hair.</li>
    <li> Nice for a pickup between shampoos.  Rather expensive.  Does not spray well, liquid kind of pops out.</li>
    <li> just what i expected. i wish you could get this product in stores or have sample trials of them to make sure it is what you want.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel ratty</li>
    <li> I use all Aveda products and this one is my favorite!  It&#x27;s wonderful for fine hair as it adds tons of volume.  It works best when you spray at the roots and then blow dry.  It&#x27;s great for humid weather!</li>
