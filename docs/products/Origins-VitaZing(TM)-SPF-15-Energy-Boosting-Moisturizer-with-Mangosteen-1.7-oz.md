      <li>I love this, because it is so natural, not just a cover up, but great moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more and use a good product now, then spend oodles of money when I&#x27;m older trying to reverse [irreversible] damage.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t love the wonderful effects of hydrating lotions and skin protecting sunscreen, but I can&#x27;t handle the icky greasy feel that most leave.  </li>

      <li>It seriously is the BEST.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer, I have normal to oily skin and acne prone.</li>
      <li>HOW EAST AND FAST IS THAT!?!</li>
      <li>You can still get several more days out of the product!</li>
      <li>I have a light complexion, and really dont like to go out with out</li>
      <li>and i just laugh and say that I dont do that at all.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on really smooth and you really dont need very much.</li>
      <li>While I would have said this was a 5 star product two months ago, I&#x27;m currently using Beauty Balm (BB) and I like it way better than this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t accidentally use too much like I did!</li>
      <li>After growing up in the Sunshine State and years of playing outdoor sports, I finally decided that it might be good to incorporate an SPF moisturizer into my daily makeup routine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Price is reasonable as well.</li>
      <li>I NEVER wear a real foundation anymore</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Not irritating.</li>
      <li>and I really just cant live without this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Origins Halo Effect Instant Illuminator, Golden Potion, .17</li>
      <li>(is that normal??).</li>
      <li>Since the move, my skin became oily and blemished, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a new moisturizer to wear on my face and neck that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to sweat it off right after putting it on or giving me a greasy, unwashed sheen the entire day.</li>
      <li>I live in the tropics and it works well for me.</li>
      <li>Start off with just a tiny bit when you first start using it</li>
      <li>After the second time I used it I noticed that my skin is becoming unusually rough and bumpy, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing it.</li>
      <li>I use this moisturizer immediately after showering, and even my fingers feel soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>I really cant explain it, cuz when you put it in your hand its a white color, but it does something when you put it on your skin that makes it match your skin tone.</li>
      <li>Have sensitive skin and rosa era.  </li>
      <li>and my skin is almost back to normal.</li>
      <li>Now my entire facial cleansing routine consists of gently washing with a 10% peroxide cleanser in the shower and using the VitaZing moisturizer afterwards.</li>
      <li>I love putting it on after waking up from a late sleep and voila!</li>
      <li>Goes on white and adjusts to your natural skin tone.</li>

<li> I actually bought another one, thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t last me that long, but it&#x27;s been at least 4 months since I purchased the first one, and it&#x27;s still lasted this long!</li>
<li> no soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few brief moments</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> There&#x27;s no need to towel off my fingers to get rid of the slippery texture that other products leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;Not only it mimics your skin tone, it actually gives your tired skin</li>
<li> It does not, however, have any sort of burning sensation, even if you accidentally apply it over a small cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need less than a pea-sized amount to cover your entire face.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s air tight.  </li>
<li> , the Origins VitaZing moisturizer makes your skin feel a very slight tight, tingly feeling, like you had just faced the sun for about thirty seconds.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also tinted so a few times I&#x27;ve just gone out in this vs. foundation, powder, blush, etc.  </li>
<li> My everyday \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; routine is Origins VitaZing, mascara, and chapstick or lip</li>
<li> One small complaint is that my face gets oily after a few hours of wearing this (and I have dry skin).</li>
<li> hey so.. what does my skin look like when I&#x27;m NOT wearing it.. pale?</li>
<li> The worst part was that it dried my face out way more than it moisturized</li>
<li> at least a little makeup on, but when I put this stuff on I dont even need to put makeup on.</li>
<li> Not sure if there&#x27;s a way to do away with that,</li>
<li> Was cakey and left my skin looking patchy and bad.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have time in morning, or I&#x27;m running late, I&#x27;ll put this on my face and just leave the house!</li>
<li> I do not use this cleanser at night, as the SPF seems unnecessary.</li>
<li> It is a bit on the expensive side, but it is my face we&#x27;re talking about.  </li>
<li> They make me feel like I&#x27;m suffocating</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely loved this product! It&#x27;s so great that it gives you an even tone while moisturizing. While I would have said this was a 5 star product two months ago, I&#x27;m currently using Beauty Balm (BB) and I like it way better than this moisturizer. I do recommend this product, but definitely give the BB a try, it&#x27;s so great and awesome fo ryou skin!</li>
    <li> The VitaZing moisturizer by Origins is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used that does not make my skin feel greasy or oily after applying. I use this moisturizer immediately after showering, and even my fingers feel soft afterwards. There&#x27;s no need to towel off my fingers to get rid of the slippery texture that other products leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lived in Connecticut/New York my entire life until two years ago. Up north, my skin had always been flawless. I never had problems with acne or breakouts until I moved to Louisiana. Since the move, my skin became oily and blemished, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a new moisturizer to wear on my face and neck that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to sweat it off right after putting it on or giving me a greasy, unwashed sheen the entire day. Now my entire facial cleansing routine consists of gently washing with a 10% peroxide cleanser in the shower and using the VitaZing moisturizer afterwards. I only need apply it once a day. I do not use this cleanser at night, as the SPF seems unnecessary. Instead I use Eucerin&#x27;s Original Healing Soothing Repair Lotion (in Rich) after washing my face with water and a cloth; no soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few brief moments, the Origins VitaZing moisturizer makes your skin feel a very slight tight, tingly feeling, like you had just faced the sun for about thirty seconds. It does not, however, have any sort of burning sensation, even if you accidentally apply it over a small cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need less than a pea-sized amount to cover your entire face. Start off with just a tiny bit when you first start using it so you don&#x27;t accidentally use too much like I did!</li>
    <li> This product acts like a tinted moisturizer.  Great for summertime when you want something light.  Blends to your skin tone, which I find amazing.  I have an olive complexion and my skin tans in the summer easily, this will change along with my skin.  I love to mix this with [[ASIN:B004NA31MM Origins Halo Effect Instant Illuminator, Golden Potion, .17 fl oz]], then apply it to my face.  Gives me a nice glow for summer, and a pick me up in winter.</li>
    <li> I SUPER LOVE VITAZING! This moisturizer is packed with wonders--- creating a radiant look in a flash!&lt;br /&gt;Not only it mimics your skin tone, it actually gives your tired skin a healthy, dewy glow. I love putting it on after waking up from a late sleep and voila! My skin looks glowy, rested and energized!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect as is, or as a primer for your favorite foundation. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this product--it moisturizes, but also serves as a light foundation, changing to your skin color!  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.  One tip:  when you can&#x27;t get anymore out of the tube, cut off the bottom and slip it into a ziplock bag so it&#x27;s air tight.  You can still get several more days out of the product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my must have, I don&#x27;t wear foundation, just this. I live in the tropics and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> Have sensitive skin and rosa era.  This is fast in am goes on without great care and protects skin.  Not irritating.</li>
    <li> This comes out of the tube white, but automatically adjusts to my skin tone/color. I am exceptionally fair and don&#x27;t have a lot of yellow pigment (more pink) and this just works beautifully. I NEVER wear a real foundation anymore, good coverage and if I need to I add some concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer, I have normal to oily skin and acne prone. This moisturizer is light and does not make skin look shiny, or clog pores. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. It helps even out my redness and give your skin a beautiful dewy, non-greasy look. Great moisturizer. It is a sheer tint and has done wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> Actually bumbled out about the price. This retails for $36.00. I work for Origins, and this is a BB or CC cream. Not a moisturizer. While it does have moisturizing properties, it&#x27;s still a color cosmetic. For those who got an instant radiant boost, this product is tinted, and if it left you feeling &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; it&#x27;s bc you need skincare. This is in Lou of foundation.</li>
    <li> Was cakey and left my skin looking patchy and bad. Didn&#x27;t like it. Returned it, went back to Suki, and now, skin looks amazing again! I switched because I wanted something with SPF... just have to add some later.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I walked into the Origins store, looking for a light, tinted moisturizer. What I got was this incredible product, which matches your skin tone perfectly!! It doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and when I sweat, it doesn&#x27;t come off! It is the best foundation/moisturizer that I have ever used, hands down. It&#x27;s really perfect, it&#x27;s my miracle! Prior to Origins, I had been using M.A.C., and my foundation was totally noticeable. But this moisturizer isn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s so light, and smells great! (like oranges!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I don&#x27;t have time in morning, or I&#x27;m running late, I&#x27;ll put this on my face and just leave the house! It seriously is the BEST.  You have to buy it! For the scent, lightweight-ness, and good price! I actually bought another one, thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t last me that long, but it&#x27;s been at least 4 months since I purchased the first one, and it&#x27;s still lasted this long! I highly recommend this product for anyone!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this, because it is so natural, not just a cover up, but great moisturizer.  Goes on white and adjusts to your natural skin tone.</li>
    <li> Lovely glow and great moisturizer.  I can actually get away withbusing only this in lieu of foundation.  A little goes a long way.  SPF is a great bonus! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I never ever had a reaction to any of the products I used and I never had any allergies. I tried a free sample of this moisturizer and initially I liked it. After the second time I used it I noticed that my skin is becoming unusually rough and bumpy, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing it. On the third day my husband made a comment about the bumps all over my face and I couldn&#x27;t believe how ugly my skin looked. I stopped using this product 3 days ago and my skin is almost back to normal. I only wish I knew which ingredient caused this reaction.</li>
    <li> I read about this lotion in Mens health and decided to give it a try - it almost feels like a clay which I didn&#x27;t like.  The worst part was that it dried my face out way more than it moisturized</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazing!!! I have a light complexion, and really dont like to go out with out at least a little makeup on, but when I put this stuff on I dont even need to put makeup on. It goes on really smooth and you really dont need very much. I like that it has spf in it too. I really cant explain it, cuz when you put it in your hand its a white color, but it does something when you put it on your skin that makes it match your skin tone. It makes my skin look dewy and just healthy! I love origins products but this is probably one of my all time favorites! Highly recommend. I found the best price at sephora.</li>
    <li> After growing up in the Sunshine State and years of playing outdoor sports, I finally decided that it might be good to incorporate an SPF moisturizer into my daily makeup routine.  Here&#x27;s the thing though, I loathe lotion.  And sunscreen.  It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t love the wonderful effects of hydrating lotions and skin protecting sunscreen, but I can&#x27;t handle the icky greasy feel that most leave.  They make me feel like I&#x27;m suffocating (is that normal??). Well, that&#x27;s NOT a problem with this product.  It goes on like my foundation--not greasy, spreads easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I have goop on my face.  It&#x27;s also tinted so a few times I&#x27;ve just gone out in this vs. foundation, powder, blush, etc.  It is a bit on the expensive side, but it is my face we&#x27;re talking about.  I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more and use a good product now, then spend oodles of money when I&#x27;m older trying to reverse [irreversible] damage.  Also, I only use a pea size drop each day so this tube--while small--lasts me a good 3 months.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have combination skin and this moisturizer is so light and I really just cant live without this product. I like that it changes to match your skin tone so you look healthy and radiant in seconds. My everyday \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; routine is Origins VitaZing, mascara, and chapstick or lip gloss. . . . HOW EAST AND FAST IS THAT!?! The Vitazing does not cover up blemishes or under eye shadows like a fondation or concealer does but it evens out your skin tone. I use a concealer over the VitaZing on blemishes and just blend the concealer in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My co-workers and friends are always commenting that they just dont have time in the mornings to put fondation and powder on like I do and i just laugh and say that I dont do that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly hope this review helps you if you were on the fence about getting this product. In my opinion... MUST HAVE!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product -- automatically matches your skin and gives you even skin tone and a bit of a tan glow. People always tell me I look &amp;#34;so healthy!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;so great!&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m wearing it (which leads me to think.. hey so.. what does my skin look like when I&#x27;m NOT wearing it.. pale? Crappy? Oi vey.).  One small complaint is that my face gets oily after a few hours of wearing this (and I have dry skin). Not sure if there&#x27;s a way to do away with that, but I have to remember to check myself in a mirror and blot if I&#x27;m wearing this.</li>
