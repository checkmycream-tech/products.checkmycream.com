<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Having tried quite a few of the non-prescription, over-the-counter, remedies (Nonyx Gel, Tineacide Cream, Peda Brush on Fungal Nail Renew, etc.) for fungal nails - especially toenails, I have so far found this European product, Kerasal, to clearly be the most effective one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like it says on the packaging, you really do start to see some notable improvement in about two weeks time and things just keep getting better from that point on. I am still on my first tube (3-month supply) of Kerasal and I do expect to be applying this preparation for 6 months or so before the final verdict is in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the other remedies mentioned above, Kerasal is also more convenient and easier to use since only a single daily application - at night before going to bed - is needed. The other products usually require two daily applications. Furthermore, Kerasal comes in a tube with a handy dandy applicator tip at its end which makes adequately coating your nail(s) with the liquid preparation a very simple task indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To achieve greater success during the fungal nail treatment process it is a good idea to buy one or two steel pedicure/manicure tools made by Body Toolz (such as the Curette Double Angle Nail Cleaner - see my review) that are specifically designed to help in clearing/cleaning out the softened nail debris (keratin) that accumulates behind the nail. This will help future applications of Kerasal or any other medicine to be more effective in achieving the ultimate outcome of once again having fungus-free happy feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extremely thick fungal nails a more radical approach can be effective. This involves mechanically grinding down the especially thick and bothersome fungal nail(s) with a device like the PediNova III Electric Pedicure/Manicure Kit (see my review here on Amazon.com) and its conical attachments on a regular basis until the desired nail thickness is achieved. Individuals preferring a manual means of accomplishing this same task can look into using a Diamancel #3 (coarse) nail file, also available here on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applications of Kerasal or any other antifungal nail treatment are then much more likely to be effective.

    <li> Great product! Had issues for a long time &amp; this stuff is easy to use &amp; only 1 time a day. You will probably need to go thru 2 tubes for a complete healing. My toes have not looked so good in a long time :) Can&#x27;t wait till I am done, want a pedicure!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Useless. I was using it for 7 months and get zero results.</li>
    <li> Have used it for 4 weeks and it appears to be doing the job of eliminating the toenail fungus. Probably will take another 4-6 weeks to be totally effective but, it the best over the counter remedy I have found.</li>
    <li> Works very slowly and you cannot miss a day. Not very effective</li>
    <li> Rating it three stars only because definitive results are not yet in. This product takes a number of weeks to show results.</li>
    <li> Works for nails with psoriasis</li>
    <li> I want to take back my first review,I did over react, it is a very good product and the customer service do over the line to satisfy you,thank you</li>
    <li> This really works. Effective results in two weeks. Must keep applying forever. I do not see any side effects as I would potentially with pills</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I have had strange toe nails since I was in high school and that is much longer than I would care to let anyone know.  This stuff really works.  It take awhile and you do have to use every day, but it really works.</li>
    <li> Nice material and fit.</li>
    <li> I have been to different dermatologist Drs, and they all wanted to take my toe nail off to the point of it not growing back again, or give me a&lt;br /&gt;Pill for this strange fungus, which causes a healthy person to have a Messed up Liver! No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;The side effect I had to find out for myself. Drs do Not tell you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The type of fungus I have caused me to have a ingrown toe nail (only on one big toe)..I&#x27;m a women and my toe nails are&lt;br /&gt;manicured, and are Not long.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this once a day for a year when I come out of the shower in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;It has saved me great pain, but I still have the problem!! (thought it was going away)&lt;br /&gt;That said, after all this time, now my toe is itching me!!&lt;br /&gt;Now I do not use this very often. Instead I&#x27;m using more and more Trind cuticle balsom on&lt;br /&gt;all my toe nails, but this one, more down the corners..this has also helped my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerasal does last a long time. I just bought another bottle after a year to keep in the house, as I do use it once in awhile. I have&lt;br /&gt;never tried a different type..&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing to do with trind, wish I did cause its pricey..</li>
    <li> A worthwhile product.  Be patient and consistent with use, as severe fungal infection takes many months to clear up.</li>
    <li> Apparently it&#x27;s best to get something else to take care of it and with another product it takes less time than this product.</li>
    <li> Need more  time to  see  how it works</li>
    <li> This product worked very well, I really like it, I have tryed everything there is out there and this works the best.</li>
    <li> Product works very well I would highly recommend it to anyone with nail fungus problem. My toe nails fell off and I kept applying it while the new ones grew back</li>
    <li> OK stuff. No sure it is really effective??</li>
    <li> very good product delivery, have not seen results yet but just started using. would recommend to anyone in need of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping for a product which works faster. This takes months to work, eventually improving the nail.</li>
    <li> Have ordered and used about three other types of treatment for nail fungal.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the only one I found to bring about significant results.&lt;br /&gt;Actually can see toe nails getting lighter.&lt;br /&gt;However, you have to keep using it continuously; otherwise problem comes back.&lt;br /&gt;May have to keep using it until problem TOTALLY gone before you can stop using.</li>
    <li> Always have had problems with my big toe nail....omg, this stuff totally works!!!!!!! I am in shock! My toe looks so good now!! I&#x27;m using this on my husbands toes now.</li>
    <li> I cut my nail open when it&#x27;s wet and soft, and appllied kerasail several times a day (instead of once daily). It definitely removed the blackish/brownish ugly rotted parts in two weeks. I have yet to see if the infection is eventually removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a whole bunch of Zeta Clear before after reading a review by an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard. I&#x27;ve tried several months and there was no sign of any improvements. Simply a waste of money and time! I&#x27;ve tried acidic solution as well, and did not see expected results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keralnail worked, though I&#x27;m not sure it will eventually eridicate the infection. I bought two tubes when I placed my order. the tube I used still have a lot left. It&#x27;s good, but perhaps I never need the other one. I&#x27;d recommend that new customer just buy one at a time.</li>
    <li> After a whole tube, my nails look just as bad</li>
    <li> Item was new and fast shipping</li>
    <li> It is doing better than any other product that I have tried including ones recommended by my doctor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had toenail fungus for many years.  No product until now has helped soften my nails.  I&#x27;ve only been using Kerasal&lt;br /&gt;For 3 week, and it&#x27;s wonderful!  I believe it works because it is applied directly on the nails.</li>
    <li> Everyone who battles toe nail fungus knows that once you are rid of it, you are often not really rid of it.  For example, nail polish aggravates the condition big-time.  However, if you use Kerasal every day and use nail polish only for short periods at a time, you can keep the condition pretty much under control.  Don&#x27;t expect this product to cure a bad infection.  You will need to see a podiatrist for prescription strength-products for that.</li>
    <li> Really need to see a foot doctor.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a month and so far not much improvement</li>
    <li> working slow but sure..</li>
    <li> This product did lighten the discoloration unlike many products I have used.  However the color comes back if it is not used continuously.  If you have a product that does help get rid of the fungi, then I suggest using it with this product.  If this product penetrate the nail, then it will also help medication get to the fungi.  This product is more of a cosmetic quick fix.  Seeing the continued requirement to apply it, I would guess it would be a lifetime treatment.  It does not get rid of the fungi permanently.  So I would say I am satisfied with the product, however, I see a big expense in the long run with continued use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 weeks and it does help a little bit but don&#x27;t expect miracles.  What it did do for me was lessen the thickening and brittleness of the nail so that I can at least trim it.  Anyone with a nail fungal problem knows that the thickening is what makes it difficult to cut.  So I will give the product credit for that.  However, if you are expecting the nail fungus to disappear, you might be disappointed.  If you haven&#x27;t had a fungal problem for very long, maybe it will help you.  Because I&#x27;ve had the fungal problem on one nail for over 25 years, I don&#x27;t fault the product for not completely working.  I bought it knowing it would help a little but it&#x27;s going to take something more than a topical treatment (laser treatment possibly) to get totally rid of my nail problem.  Bottom line is maybe the product is a 5 star for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a severe fungal infection and it has been a recent problem.</li>
    <li> Out of all the med&#x27;s out there for toenails, this works the best.</li>
    <li> water did as much !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The only reason for only 4 stars is the price for a very small package. But it works. My toenail has been a problem for at least 2 years. I have tried everything including a doctor&#x27;s rx. This is the first thing that has given me results. Within 2 days, the layers started pealing off. Still a ways to go, but I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> Great product to get your feet ready for the summer.  Helps clear fungus quickly.  I would recommend it over other products.</li>
    <li> It seems to work on toe nails to some degree.  Have not yet seen any improvement on fingernails.</li>
    <li> 3rd tube still waiting for results</li>
    <li> This product does work but it takes time and alot of patience. I am begining the 7th week of nightly use and there is a signicant improvement  from when I first started. It helps to clean out the dead skin and keep the nails trimmed short. Once this issue is resolved, I plan on using on a regular basis.  The instructions state from 3-6 months of usage and if I am fortunate this will not take that long.  Good Luck if you begin treatment with this product but remember Alot Of Patience.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working as claimed</li>
    <li> You really need a prescription or an ANTIFUNGAL ointment to actually get rid of toenail fungus.</li>
    <li> Although i&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months already I don&#x27;t really see a big improvement on my toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like it does something, kills dead skin under and around the nail.</li>
    <li> This has worked wonders on my husbands toe nails! He has had awful fungus for atleast 8 years. We went to the pediatrist to have him thin down his toenails which helped this treatment work better. He saw results in 2 weeks! We researched quite a few options like medications and this was the safest and most effective. Definitely try this first over medication so that you don&#x27;t mess with your liver or have to stress with frequent blood tests.</li>
    <li> I have used this for two years and am about clear of any problem . Since all options take forever I am pleased to have saved money by avoiding Doctors charges it was well worth the $500 I paid for the materials . You must be very patient and use it after every shower or daily whichever is more frequent . Painfully slow but will work . One Laser treatment might cost $1k so $20 a month is nothing though at times I found it much cheaper . Good luck .</li>
    <li> I was fooled by the advertisement.  This stuff didn&#x27;t work for me.  If you have serious nail fungus, see your doctor.</li>
    <li> This was good and I have seen results, but not as fast as it claims.</li>
