<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for about 6 mos. It is light weight, moderately moisturizes. Works really well under foundation!! Probably not the best night cream, but great as a \\&quot;Day Cream\\&quot;. I have really sensitive eyes and this works well for me, plus it smells nice. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have only recently started wearing Neutrogena products, and am really enjoying them. No irritation. they make my skin look soft and dewy without being greasy. They aren&#x27;t harsh, and don&#x27;t dry my skin. They don&#x27;t make my skin red, or break out. They are affordable. Other than the &amp;#34;miracle&#x27; that we are all looking for in an anti aging product, this is pretty good. I am noticing softer lines than before. I know all skin types are different, but this is pretty good.</li>
    <li> LOVE! I have a combo skin and wear full make up daily. I&#x27;ve added this to my regiment because it&#x27;s light on the skin, and provides the right amount of moisture for both dry spots and oily zones.</li>
    <li> This product feels great on your skin, not heavy or greasy.  I love the smell.  For the price this is a very good face cream.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised by how much I liked this cream. I put it on at night before going to sleep, and I actually look forward to it- that&#x27;s how much I like it. It hydrates my skin, and I can actually feel how soft it is in the morning. Unlike my day-cream which sometime feels irritable on my face, this cream is light and lets my skin breathe. I highly recommend you buy it- its 12 dollars and just like an expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now along with the netrogena purifying cleansor and mult vitamin day cream. This line up  not only has it kept my skin mositurized and gotten rid of dry and rough patch but it leaves your skin soft and silky smoolth. Its great to use in the winter time when your skin gets more dry and refreshing in summer.</li>
    <li> I liked the feel and the moistuizing aspect very much, but the smell was a deal breaker for me.  I expect things that have &#x27;natural&#x27; in the description to smell like somthing natural (fresh, clean, green?)  - this one smells like very sweet candy, yuck.  Other than the unappealing smell, it worked very well and did not cause my very sensitive skin to break out.  I will stick with my other Neutrogena night cream - Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration - for now anyway.  It&#x27;s getting hard to find so I suspect they are discontinuing it.</li>
    <li> Love it. My face absorbs it instantly like it felt thirst for a long period :)) The skin became more fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a perfume like bubblegum from my childhood. My husband love it :)))</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. After I get done washing my face with Neutrogena face wash (of course), I put it on and it makes my skin so soft and i can really see a difference between this night cream and others. I love this one because its light feeling, doesn&#x27;t smell, not sticky, and it leaves my skin clear and soft.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all....</li>
    <li> Given the mixed reviews, I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;ve never used a night cream before, but decided to give it a go. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few nights in a row. The overall texture kind of reminds me of sunblock, in a sense that it is thin (a little goes a long way!) It&#x27;s not greasy though, which is great. I saw that some people were not fond of the scent, but it didn&#x27;t bother me. It kind of reminds me candy I guess. It is sweet, but I didn&#x27;t find it overpowering or annoying while wearing it. I suppose it would be dependent on the person&#x27;s preference. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, but I did find that my skin is sensitive now. I wore a light day moisturizer the following day and it was stinging a bit when it normally doesn&#x27;t. Overall, I do believe it is a good product, and I would continue using, but I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great night time moisturizer! I am only in my twenties so I do not know how this would work on mature skin. Also, I have oily skin so I was skeptical about this. First of all, it is noncomedegenic, meaning it wont clog pores!! So with my acne prone skin, this is a BIG plus! It goes on very easily and smells GREAT! It feels very thick at first so I was nervous about it. But then as it sinks into your skin, it starts to feel less and less greasy. I would think it would work better for dry skin types but since I have oily and acne prone skin I know it works for that skin type too. In the morning when I woke up, my face felt as if I just exfoliated! And I have noticed that my skin is becoming more even toned. This is a miracle for me! I highly recommend this for anyone who needs a boost to their skin! It makes it look more vibrant and really brings the life back to my face! I will repurchase this!!</li>
    <li> bought this at target and loved it. bought in from amazon and it smelt different.</li>
    <li> I use this product for almost 4 months now. There are much better products out there but it doesnt work for everything. it makes the skin feel beautiful and its great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> ...but read the label. Fragrance? In my opinion the scent is so cloying that I am hard put to understand why the manufacturer would want to add a non-natural mystery ingredient to a product that otherwise seems to be attractive. A little sniffing around (yes, pun intended) online reveals that Neutrogena is currently defending a federal class action lawsuit for misleading advertising. In fact, it is alleged, the only product in this line that is all natural is the lip balm. So kudos to Neutrogena for using cruelty-free, sustainable methods and moving toward use of all-natural, safe ingredients. But shame on them for misleading customers and forcing us to play detective as we read their labels.</li>
    <li> Glass jar packaging--and exposure to light, air, and fingers required to \\&quot;get at\\&quot; the product--nearly spoils this moisturizer, another almost all-natural product from Neutrogena. \\&quot;Almost all-natural\\&quot; means 97% of ingredients are naturally derived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rich cream feels good on the face, leaving it soft and moisturized. There&#x27;s no heavy feeling left on the face after application. Just a few dabs are needed to moisturize the face throughout the night. It has a pleasant tropical (pineapple &amp; sweet orange) scent with a hint of additional citrus; the glass jar contains 1.7 ounces of product. Allergy tested and will not clog pores. Not tested on animals. Contains no harsh chemicals, no sulfates, no parabens, no petrochemicals, no dyes, and no phthalates. Sustainable packaging. The packaging, however, is a major problem: it&#x27;s in a glass jar, that gets exposed to your fingers, light, and air...all work to break down many of the anti-oxidant benefits of the product. The product looses major points for its attractive, yet unnecessary formula-spoiling packaging. I will be switching to a similar cream in a tube (providing superior protection from the above-mentioned eroding factors) in the Neutrogena Naturals line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product... I was so thankful to find something so affordable and accessible that isn&#x27;t secretly packed full of harmful ingredients.  Shame on AVEENO for their \\&quot;natural\\&quot; looking packaging, I was about to pick up their night cream instead, but read it contains parabens on the label.  Yay for Neutrogena! It&#x27;s exactly what I want at the price I don&#x27;t mind paying.  I appreciate that the packaging isn&#x27;t trying to pull one over on the consumers... What you see is what you get.  This line is leaps ahead of the other products on the shelves of major discount retailers. The night cream is rich and extremely hydrating without leaving my face greasy. I love that it won&#x27;t clog my pores and isn&#x27;t tested on animals. I think the sustainable packaging is very pretty as well, but would rather see it sold in packaging similar to boscia.  Love it.  I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> It does not burn. i have tried other night creams but really am not satisfied. I like this one it smells nice.</li>
    <li> From all kinds of products I used with different brand (facial cleaner, night cream, moisturizer, etc), I trust Neurogena the most. The price is total acceptable plus it really solved my problem. I have very sensitive skin with acne, this product didn&#x27;t make my face breakout. The smell is good, plus it contains vitamin B,C,E. Most night cream product only contains one kind of vitamin. Now I am using Neurogena acne control facial clearer, acne spot treatment and night-cream. It significantly reduce my acne， made pores smaller. I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about one year and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad that Neutrogena come out with a SLS, paraben,and fragrance free product. This does not irritate my skin at all whereas other organic natural skin creams have. Great for those with allergy prone sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, in my 40s, with problem dry skin on my face. Just a couple of weeks of daily use of this product already made a difference. Now on my fourth month, my face looks like it was given a new life. I will definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> I thought the \\&quot;naturals\\&quot; label meant natural ingredients. The product smells sweet like candy..not what I was expecting from this product. Then, I applied it to my face. This was the first facial lotion/cream to make my skin start burning and stinging. I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin either. I think I&#x27;ll try Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I have super - sensitive 40-something skin and it works pretty well for me. The &#x27;natural&#x27; part works for me in both senses; the cream doesn&#x27;t feel filmy or stiff, nor does it increase my redness, clog my pores or burn. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love how I can put it on at night and let it work  while I sleep and can wake up with beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> Trerrific, as always!</li>
    <li> I started using this a few months ago and loved it. It&#x27;s the only thing I use at night now, and my skin feels awesome as a result.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, works well, but ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; has no legal meaning, not all ingredients in here are indeed what one means when they search for products that are all natural!</li>
    <li> moistens skin well and has reduced breakouts dramatically</li>
    <li> I have a severe cosmetic allergy, most cosmetics cause me to enter anaphylaxis - hives, throat swelling, and severe itching. Using the wrong product has landed me in the ER, but I can comfortably say this is one of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; cosmetic products that I am able to use without getting any sort of allergic reaction, not even a little bit of itching. If you have skin allergies and are looking for a good, reasonably priced night cream, give this product a test (be sure to patch test and wait a day first). Note that it isn&#x27;t fragrance free, so be careful with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was a favorite of mine before my allergies developed, and was one of the first products that I tried using after discovering my allergy. Like others have said, it DOES burn the skin a few minutes after applying. This might be uncomfortable to some, but I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;*Not overly thick (could also be a con if you are wanting a thick night cream)&lt;br /&gt;*Does not cause breakouts (I am acne prone, so this is a plus)&lt;br /&gt;*Clears complexion&lt;br /&gt;*Smells good, slightly fruity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Burning sensation for a few moments after using&lt;br /&gt;*Feels slightly greasy&lt;br /&gt;*Not fragrance-free, beware if you are allergic to fragrances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer won&#x27;t be for everyone, but I will probably continue to use it in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> At first, I really liked this product. It smells nice &amp; it lacks harsh chemicals. It made my skin feel smooth... After using the product for a few weeks, I noticed that my face would sting real bad as if it were sun burnt after application. The burning/stinging feeling caused by this product would last for hours before it would go away. After a few times of this, I discontinued use. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, nor have I ever experienced side effects like this from any other product. It could be that I have an unknown allergy to one of the ingredients in the product or maybe something in the product is harsh on the skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to those who do have sensitive skin, especially after having a reaction to it myself.</li>
    <li> I have mature skin that is sensitive to chemicals, dry and prone to breakouts if I don&#x27;t baby it. I recently had a facial and after getting my pores all cleaned out I was looking for something to buy on my way home from the salon that: (1) was inexpensive, (2)  wouldn&#x27;t irritate (or clog) my newly cleaned skin and (3)  didn&#x27;t contain soy or any artificial / petroleum derived ingredients. In the old days Neutrogena was my go-to product line and so, when I saw this I decided to give it a try. I used it that night after my shower and it didn&#x27;t sting or burn my face. I can apply it almost immediately after lightly scrubbing my face with an exfoliant (I alternate between a sonic scrubber, natural AHAs, bamboo grains) with no irritation. It is heavy enough out of the jar to provide a barrier to cold weather and when diluted with wet hands before applying it is light enough for heat and humidity. When I wash it off in the morning there is no greasy residue, in fact my face squeaks! I am on my second jar and paid $15.99 locally. The price here on Amazon is much more reasonable and I will purchase it here from now on!</li>
    <li> I would recommend any Neutrogena Naturals product to anyone who asks.  When this cream is used along with the foaming facial scrub and the Multi-Vitamin nourishing Moisturizer it keeps my face completely clear and glowing.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my daughter.  She loves it.  What do  expect from all Neutrogena products?  They do what they say.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great value. I have spent much more on night creams with no better results than this cream. It is not greasy either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good night cream to use.  I bought this product thinking it would be great since it&#x27;s a natural product.  My face is somewhat sensitive to lotions and I figured this would be a good choice.  However, every time I put the lotion on my face it causes my face to turn red.  My face turns red and starts to feel really hot.  Other than this fact I like the cream.  It&#x27;s not super heavy or feels like it weighs my face down.  It&#x27;s just that after about a minute it causes my entire face to turn red and inflamed.  If you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love it!! great for my skin :))</li>
    <li> Really good night cream, no oily face in the morning, just great</li>
    <li> Very light on the skin, clean fragrance, don&#x27;t need a lot to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I have problems finding something feels good not heavy but soft on my face. I have rosacea and dry tight skin. this works great for me.</li>
    <li> perfect for aging skin!</li>
    <li> great product, will order again and again</li>
    <li> Below is a list of the ingredients. I googled them to see what they are, and none contain vitamins B or C, as the product claims to contain.&lt;br /&gt;Water, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Heptyl Undecylenate, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Llex Paraguariensis Extract, Tocopherol, Stearic Acid, Gluconolactone, Maltodextrin, Sclerotium Gum, Benzyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Fragrance</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I use ROC retinol products which leave me face looking red.  I apply this moisturiser for a burst of healthy goodness before I go to bed and it calms the redness and leaves my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fruity smell and the knowledge I am putting something good for my skin on my face.</li>
    <li> If everyone would read the labels it says the percentage of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products in it. Therefor telling you it is not completely natural. I believe this is a wonderful product and have had no problems with it. If you truly want a natural product grow a garden and make your own, also please do your research online before purchasing anything.</li>
    <li> This product has a sweet coconut smell, which I actually like.  I normally don&#x27;t really like face products that have a scent, but this scent is ok.  The big problem with this cream is that I didn&#x27;t like the feeling of the product on my skin.  Kinda made it feel greasy and hot/sweaty an it made me break out a little.  I recently purchased Aveeno night cream and it works a lot better.  I now use this neutrogena night cream on my hands instead.</li>
    <li> I do like this cream but I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference from the Neutrogena naturals daily moisturizer. I wonder why it comes in a glass jar. As I travel often, I prefer a recyclable plastic tube.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin- it is oily and prone to acne breakouts at times but also is very dry. So, it&#x27;s tough to find the right balance. I was using Cetaphil facial moisturizer several applications morning and night to try to achieve a decent amount of moisture without causing additional oiliness. Then I discovered this Neutrogena cream. I apply one thin layer of the Neutrogena at bedtime and then I only need 1 layer of Cetaphil moisturizer in the morning before make-up and my skin has stayed perfectly hydrated throughout several seasons (even the dry winter months). Every now and then if I stayed outside a while in the winter I&#x27;d need to do 2 nightly applications or add a layer of Cetaphil over the Neutrogena, but that&#x27;s no big deal to me. Been very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having some dry patches on my cheeks, but was really afraid to try anything too moisturizing because I do have a very oily t-zone and acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have very high expectations when I bought this product but after the first night, I knew this was a good one. The product absorbs super quickly and you cannot feel it after about two minutes. However, you will notice sooner than you expect that the overall appearance and feeling of your skin has been improved significantly. A lot of people have been commenting on the smell and I must say it&#x27;s actually one of my favorite things about this product. I can&#x27;t quite tell you what it smells like because it&#x27;s very particular but personally I LOVE it and it feels so good to put on your skin. I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re just looking for an affordable hydrating night cream. This cream has seriously become my favorite skincare product.</li>
    <li> Very light and not greasy I also use for a daytime moisturizer .</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Highly doubt it&#x27;s natural. As soon as I put it on my face turned bright red and started to sting. It literally looked like I got into a fight with someone.&lt;br /&gt;I used such a tiny amount too!</li>
    <li> wish it came in a larger size....I go through a jar so quickly that it becomes very expensive.. They need a economy size version!</li>
    <li> This cream absorbs well, leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not sticky or shinny.  I will be purchasing this again next time.</li>
    <li> I bought both face wash that goes along with this product. i have noticed after about a week my skin looks clearer and softer including my neck which i have never had acne on before but my skin has gotten so soft. My skin drys very easily and can be very sensitive especially when living in New York where we can have brutal winters. My skin feels great! Not a lot is needed so this stuff totally comes with more the needed.&lt;br /&gt; My pores do not feel clogged which is the first thing i noticed after using it once. Again this is my first time using this and i love it. i plan on buying way more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and it&#x27;s mostly natural! I&#x27;m taking retina  and needed a good moisturizer to get rid of dry flakes. Here it is.</li>
    <li> im 13 years old and i bought this a week ago and used it everyday since. when i oped it up and smelled it, i was not happy with the smell, although i figured i would get over it and that it would be worth how weel it would work. i put it on after i washed my face that night. it is a thick night cream. at first it soothed my skin...ahhh. suddenly, ouch! this burns. it only did that for about a minute. and it only did that on the first time i used it. the very next morning, my skin was really smooth and didnt look dried out. i still use this and i am happy with it, although i just can not stand that smell. i mean its not horrible, it just smells bad, like i cant explain it. i mean it doesnt smell bad like poop or trash or throw up or anyhting like that just a different unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Have been on a quest to find a night cream that would not irritate my overly sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many other creams (Cetaphil, First Aid Beauty, La Mer, etc, but always something in the ingredients bother my skin, i.e. fragrance or other chemicals).  The only night cream that seems to work for me is Elemis Collagen Marine Cream, but it&#x27;s very expensive per jar and I have to use that sparingly to make it last up to a few months.  Otherwise, discovering Neutrogena Naturals has been a God-send and am glad that it&#x27;s been working well for my overly sensitive skin.  Have also used the other products (lip balm and moisturizer) with equal satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will point out that some others have complained about the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; of the cream.  I would have to imagine that this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; cream would have an mineral smell due to the natural ingredients, but there is a pleasant, citrus overtone (at least that what it smells like to me) that does well to mask the mineral smell.  This citrus scent is fine for me and I actually like it alot, but I guess not everyone will like it.</li>
    <li> My skin is acne prone, but this cream keeps my skin moist and acne free. I use it both at night and morning (and I would layer with my sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this Night cream and yes, I believe it is a high quality product.  However, as an experiment, I bought the Neutrogena Naturals Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Moisturizer, 3 Ounce (almost double the amount as the night cream) for a similar price, just to compare and see what differences exist between them.  No, I don&#x27;t operate a lab or chemical testing facility, but my conclusion is that both products are the same thing, minus the \\&quot;perfume scent\\&quot; that the night cream has.  Even a look at the ingredients of both products appears to be identical.  Just an FYI.</li>
    <li> my skin is dry and sensitive to most of cream. This one can really moisturize my skin and keep for the entire night.  I will keep using it in the future</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would make my skin look younger, and this stuff works! way better than other anti-wrinkle creams i&#x27;ve used and it makes my dry skin just a little oily, in a good way like it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
    <li> My skin is probably in the mature category, even though I suffer from acne. Last winter my regular moisturizer just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick anymore. My skin was just looking tired. All the other heavier night creams I tried made me break out terribly. This had a very short ingredient list, as natural as you can find in a big box or chain drugstore, reasonably priced, so I tried it. Love it! My husband travels and goes to very cold dry climates and he was complaining about his skin. I convinced him to try it, now he&#x27;s hooked too! Has a light fresh almost fruity scent. When my skin is really dry I apply a thick layer and let it sit for twenty minutes, makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I love Neutrogena! Light texture, light pleasant fragrance love it, love it, love it. Makes the color of the skin better, brighter, shiny. Beautiful cream.</li>
    <li> An excellent cream. Not loaded with a bunch of chemicals, leaves your skin soft and moisturized. Little bit on the heavy side for my skin type though, I use it during dry, cold winter months.</li>
    <li> I started using this product for my sensitive skin about 4 months ago. it&#x27;s great. it goes on thick but by morning my skin is soft and moisturized. Even the skin around my eyes looks smoother and younger. No breakouts, clean smell and great feel. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I broke out so bad its astonishing. I thought it only contained natural ingredients :( read the label. Is should have known when i smelled it. It smells strong!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; to put on my skin. I don&#x27;t care if this product works because I can&#x27;t get past the overwhelming scent that smells like a 7th grade bathroom. I mean, usually your nose gets used to scents after about 5 minutes but this stink seems to be setting up shop in my nostrils. Headache city, ladies. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one; that is unless you want to smell fruit stink/ tween spirit/ puberty all night long.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product, I use it at night. It does feel a bit sticky/ tight when it starts drying , but that quickly goes away. It leaves my skin smooth and glowing. Pleasant smell. My husband actually started using it too!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and have very dry skin. this is a nice cream but not moisturizing enough for me. better suited for a younger, more hydrated complexion. i also have very sensitive skin and did not have any irritation with this cream at all.</li>
    <li> Just wish this cream had some SPF</li>
    <li> Read the label. It&#x27;s on the box not the jar. When i first opened the jar i got a strong wiff of Fragrance. It was at that point i decided i wouldn&#x27;t be putting it on my face. It literally smells like candy. i refuse to waste it though. I use it on my feet /; Also, Neutrogena is being sued for false advertisement... hmmm. I won&#x27;t be using any neutrogena products until they get this figured out.</li>
    <li> First moisturizer I&#x27;ve used regularly.  I&#x27;m 22 and figured it&#x27;s time to build some good habits with regards to skincare, especially since I live in a hot, arid dry climate (Nevada).  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see a difference (mainly using it to prevent skin damage), but in a few weeks I noticed my skin looked a lot better.  I didn&#x27;t even use it every night, but just using it about 80% of the time resulted in no more dryness or flaking, and a more \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; look.  It does have a scent to it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;m not the type of person that likes to put a lot of stuff on their face (wear very little, if any, makeup) but this is very light and seems to blend in easily.  Great price as well.</li>
    <li> I am so happy since Neutrogena came out with their naturals line. This is one of my favorite products of theirs. I use it every night, and since I started my skin has become noticeably firmer, softer, and less spotty from all the sun I get going to the beach every weekend. If I had wrinkles before, they are gone. I cannot recommend this enough. I am 32 and my skin glows since I started using this.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin very soft .I still have some wrinkles but they are less severe.</li>
    <li> This is the closest I can find to a purely natural face cream without parabens and other unnecessary and dangerous chemical additives.  There are other creams which are organic but have a terrible fragrance and/or cost way too much.  This cream is just the right weight for a night cream but could also be used during the day (but it has no sunscreen.)</li>
    <li> I am allergic to formaldehyde which is a common ingredient in many makeup products so I am always careful about the products I purchase to put on my skin.  I love this moisturizer.  I use it at night and during the day.  I have been using it for about a year now and I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to it.  I love the way it feels when I put it on and I love the way my skin feels in the morning after I sleep in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter was complaining about dry skin this winter and I had her try it.  She loves it too!  She uses it at night and says it makes her skin feel nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t make her break out.</li>
    <li> This cream made my skin and eyes sting.Yes, I was careful not to get it in the eye area. Tried it three nights in a row, every time  my skin turned pink and stung. This jar is going in the trash!&lt;br /&gt;It has a smell that I didn&#x27;t like either, too strong for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;I do have slightly sensitive skin, but I normally use over the counter products with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon, but wanted share my opinion where a lot of people can see and benefit.</li>
    <li> A magazine I receive recommended this product for serious moisturizing. I have to admit it&#x27;s great! Smells great doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, very happy with this</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. I look forward to applying it each night because of the light fragrance and easy application. After exfoliating, I don&#x27;t want a heavy, greasy cream on my face for bed. This product is light enough to sleep comfortably while leaving leaving my face feeling moisturized and nourished.</li>
    <li> Smells like the cleaner they use in airport bathrooms (not joking), &amp; it made my face burn &amp; itch upon first application. Gross. Will be going back to the Aveeno positively radiant night creme.</li>
    <li> I use this product for almost 6months now. It&#x27;s okey though it doesn&#x27;t remove allllllll the rashes and minor pipmles on the face, but it is better than not using it or using other products. But it makes the skin soft and it&#x27;s good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> nice smell,good night cream</li>
    <li> Fantastic cream. Rich, not loaded with a bunch of chemicals and it really shows on your skin, leaves it soft, moisturized. I have mixed skin (oily on T-area), but this cream does not make me break out or anything. An excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Light on my skin and love that I can use it while nursing</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new night cream that wasn&#x27;t thick and heavy. This is really the perfect cream for me. It feels really rich, and it still lets my skin breathe. I&#x27;ve even noticed my complexion looks a lot more even during the day, and I&#x27;m attributing it to this cream. It has a really nice light natural scent. It&#x27;s really a pleasant aroma. I have a tendency to get super greasy with moisturizers, and this leaves me perfectly moisturized. Awesome cream!</li>
    <li> This product works well to hydrate skin and smells great too. It is not super thick but thick enough for a night cream. I am trying to avoid harsh chemicals and to clean up the rest of my beauty products.</li>
</ol>
