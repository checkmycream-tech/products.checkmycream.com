      <li>This product is phenomenal, I used it as I was starting to grow a bald spot on the back of my head, within a few days, new hair started growing!</li>

      <li>I was very surprised to find that this product does actually work.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have horrible thininig hair. I seriously shed after washing my hair after brushing my hair my brush has to be cleaned out becasue there is so much fall out. I began my search to find a shmpoo that might help. I came across the Hair Regrowth Shampoo Maximum strength read the reviews and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy when i got it that I opened it right away and went to wash my hair. The first thing I noticed, was the smell I cant quite put my finger on it but it smelled great. The next thing I noticed was the texture of the shampoo. I have had some shampoo&#x27;s that was really think and runny.. this was thick and held onto the hair good. It latherd well and again smelled amazing,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for a week or so I started noticing a difference in my hair. I dont think it was groth right away but I was not losing as much as before. My hair looked healthy and shiny. Overalll, I really liked this shampoo and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t reached the visibly thinning stage, but I wanted something to head it off, every time I brushed my hair I noticed tons of hair in my brush! This made my hair soft, shiny, and visibly stopped the damage almost immediately. My hair feels thicker and shinier.</li>
    <li> I bought and tried out many many products before but NONE of them seemed to be working.&lt;br /&gt;When I found this however, I gave it some time and BOOM, I started to regrow hair!&lt;br /&gt;I grew more confident and many people asked me how I did it.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
    <li> Wow!! This product is phenomenal, I used it as I was starting to grow a bald spot on the back of my head, within a few days, new hair started growing! This is absolutely worth more than what it is priced for and I would recommend this to any of my friends who need a hair regrowth product :)</li>
    <li> Day by day my hair is becoming thin. I spend lot of effort in different nostrums, but of no use. I started using BFE hair re-growth shampoo, observed my hair is no thinner. With the use of BFE shampoo I was literally happy and my hair is becoming thick day by day with no side effects. One of the trust worthy shampoo for re-growth of hair.</li>
    <li> These reviews are suspicious, NOT ONE is a &amp;#34;verified purchase&amp;#34; by Amazon?</li>
    <li> Fantastic product with such great quality and amazing deal, helped my hair to become was healthier and feels better overall, recommend it for people looking for an amazing hair for such a great price.</li>
    <li> For most of my life I had thick hair. When it started thinning slightly I was distressed. This hair regrowth shampoo seems to have reversed that. I use it every other day, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out either. It&#x27;s the first shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that was marketed against hair loss, but I doubt I&#x27;ll need to try another. This one works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. Doesn&#x27;t do crap</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo, conditioner, and serum or a month and have noticed no new growth. I would like a full refund for my purchase, since there was a 100% guarantee.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo alongside the conditioner and I&#x27;ve been using them every couple days for a while now, myself and my partner began noticing differences very quickly. My hair is now very silky smooth and smells unbelievably fragrant, I can go out feeling enthusiastic about my hair now!</li>
    <li> Problems with my hair no more. Talk about a self confidence killer when you don&#x27;t even want to go in public. I was having serious issues with damaged and strayed hair. I decided to try this extra strength hair regrowth. I was looking for the fastest and most effective solution. It truly worked.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t felt this good in years! As of the last couple of months I&#x27;ve been having a couple of issues with my hair. I&#x27;ve tried multiple products but none of them really did what I needed and how I needed it to be done. I use this shampoo and the conditioner by the same seller. This is beyond impressive results.I have zero complaints about their product line and do recommend it to anyone who suffers from hair loss or hair thinning.</li>
    <li> All of you probably started to lose hair already or know somebody who is, right? Well I&#x27;m in that same boat, I just found out my father was trying to find products to regrow his hair, but had no luck finding any good products, but a buddy of his recommended this products, and I can definitely see why, his friend had amazing results, full head of hair just like mine! But anyways my father picked this up after hearing amazing things about it, and let me just say this product is a miracle product, in just under 2 weeks he&#x27;s already growing hair back, obviously it&#x27;s not a full head of hair just yet, but I know in at least 1 month or so it definitely will be.</li>
    <li> Me and my brothers have had hair loss problems since we were 14 years old. When we bought this shampoo our lifes became much better! After a while, our baldness issue is so much better than before. I seriously recommend this product to all those people who suffer from hair loss.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo as one of my friend recommended. May be because of climate or changing weather, I experienced too much hair fall. I started using this shampoo, felt the result in some 2 to 3 weeks. Hair fall reduced. Got thick, shiny, longer hair. Loving my healthy, stronger hair.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised to find that this product does actually work. I noticed that my hair has stopped falling out significantly which is good! I haven&#x27;t seen much growth yet but Im happy its not falling out like it was. The product itself does not have such a pleasant smell, but everyone is different in that opinion and it does not really lather but it does work to stop hair from falling out. Overall I am glad I tried the product.</li>
    <li> All the reviews are fake!</li>
    <li> Perhaps I had an allergic reaction but I lost almost 4 square inches near the back and thinning towards the front in several weeks. I had rapid shedding. I discontinued the use of the product and my hair is growing back slowly. If you feel itchy right away when put the product in then you may have an allergy as well.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift (along with the serum) from family after having my second son. I honestly didn&#x27;t think much of it &amp; stored it away until about 4 months after giving birth (a second time). I noticed my hair coming out in chunks &amp; the doctor explained that my hormones plus no longer taking pre-natals was a lot on my body &amp; this would occur. I finally decided to try these treatments (shampoo and serum) &amp; I admit I LOVE my hair again! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or the serum or the combination, but I LOVE my hair again! It&#x27;s not coming out in clumps &amp; now that I&#x27;m starting to run out, I NEED to get more. Absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I seeing quite a bit of hair in my brush after combing it.  I decided to try this to help correct his before it got to bad.  I must say this worked beyond what I ever imagined it would.  I have used it for about a week and the hair loss is almost totally gone.  My hair not only is regaining the thickness but looks much healthier.  This is absolutely a product I would purchase again.  Gladly giving 5 Stars!!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very great and smells good too. It really helps to make your hair reach its maximum growth level. The ingredients in the shampoo as well are very good and nourishing for your hair. In a couple of months you will have softer and longer hair.</li>
    <li> Beauty Facial Extreme’s hair regrowth shampoo came to us roughly a week ago and my husband was excited to try it. As a man in his 30’s hair loss has already taken ahold and he’s tried so many products already on the market with little to no success.&lt;br /&gt;This hair regrowth shampoo is a bit different, in our case we ordered the trio of this (shampoo, conditioner and “serum”) as well. Using the 3 together my husband has noticed that his hair feels much thicker and fuller. While we haven’t seen any new hair regrowth yet, we definitely notice the hair he does has is much healthier.  We hope that in a few weeks we will start seeing his bald spots feel in, but with this set we feel extremely hopeful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for my review however my opinion is my own*</li>
    <li> This product helps my hair so much. I love it.... I have always wanted long hair and I am getting it with this product. I will be recommending this product to everyone I know. When I run out I will be restocking my medicine cabinet. I appreciate that neutrogena brought this to. Thank you.</li>
    <li> this gives major dandruff, been using it for about a month now still no result.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! My hair has always been quite thin and i have tried so many Shampoos to try and sort it out but nothing! I actually starting giving up even trying to buy a decent brand shampoo as none worked. My wife was browsing amazon and kept nagging me to give this one a try, so I did! I had to thank her so much for making me try it! My hair now is more thick and feels just a lot better. This shampoo is amazing and I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was getting some hair loss problems and I tried a multitude of products but many seemed to be scams that didn&#x27;t actually work.  I was surprised to find that this product worked better than I could ever imagine.  My friends have commented that my hair looks far better than it did previously.  I feel great and have seen no side effects since using this product</li>
    <li> As a bypass patient, I suffer with hair loss and I am looking to help treat my concern with loosing hair.  This product seems to help reduce the hair loss process. As a female, my hair is important to me and I am looking forward to trying this product</li>
    <li> I bought this product and trial. Shortly after the first time it gave me really great impression. Quality than expected and is suitable for all hair types. No irritant ingredients and reasonable prices. 5 stars for this product and you should buy now</li>
