<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> defective &amp; damaged as received</li>
    <li> Excellent product!, easy to use, good for trimming beard to the desired style</li>
    <li> Catches loose skin after it has been running a while, and doesn&#x27;t cut very close. Also I have only had it for a year and continually have issues with it just stopping working, and it not lining up flush when screwing the battery cover back on.</li>
    <li> I recently used this item to touch up my beard when I was traveling for a month. It worked very well. Easy to use, convenient, fine results, space saving for travel. Highly Recommended. Received quickly from seller.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one of these I have purchased. The first one I have been using for about two years and it&#x27;s still going strong. This was on sale for $10 so I bought another as a backup in case my other one craps out.</li>
    <li> Amazingly gentle if you want to give your &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34; a quick trim.  Easy to clean afterwards too.</li>
    <li> Excelent product ! Thank you</li>
    <li> Loved it.. Great stuff..</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; quality. My husband loves!</li>
    <li> good product for in between haircuts is all i have to say! could probably go an extra week or 2 by using this (only facial saving though). not good if you trying to shave your head</li>
    <li> I am really excited about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler.  I actually got one for free via a program run by Gillette.  I plan on using it as my traveling/camping razor. It&#x27;s so compact and the attachments fit neatly on the back.  It&#x27;s small enough to fit into a bag to take along.  I think it works great.</li>
    <li> At under twenty dollars, the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Pack may be one of the best investments and most necessary item i own. I love this thing, 2 AA&#x27;s and your set for a while.The attachments are amazing for the beard and sideburns a must get for any hairy man!!!</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program run by Gillette. I was skeptical that a trimmer with such a small head and battery powered could do the job. I wound up being pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;  The Trimmer comes with a handy stand, with little shelves in the back to hold the trimmer attachments. Since they are only shelves they can fall out when tilted but once you find a spot for the stand you shouldn&#x27;t have to move it much. The stand doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter or in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;  As to power, the ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer has it! Sideburns&#x3D;gone in one pass. The blades to the trimmer are sharp and powerful. The handle itself is solid and has decent heft. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy. The teeth on the combs seem a little fragile but if you use the trimmer for its intended purpose you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems. I think this is meant to be used to frequently trim and manscape. For that purpose the ProGlide Power Trimmer works great: grab it, turn it on and do your thing. The power of this trimmer makes frequent trimming a breeze. If you let things go for a while, it&#x27;ll take you a little longer and more effort. This trimmer isn&#x27;t meant to handle the heavy stuff, just the everyday touchups.&lt;br /&gt;  Care is easy: after use, rinse it off, dry it and put it in the stand.&lt;br /&gt;  The razor itself is a Gillette Fusion head I&#x27;m familiar with and have used frequently. Having it attached to the trimmer makes it longer than a regular razor handle so it felt strange as I shaved. I didn&#x27;t feel I got as close as I would with a normal Gillette razor but that may change as I get accustomed to the longer handle. As an added bonus the handle accepts a razor blade that fits on any Gillette Fusion, Fusion ProGlide, or Fusion ProGlide Power handle.&lt;br /&gt;  A razor and trimmer for under $20 with the quality of Gillette is a good buy. Right now there&#x27;s even a $3.00 coupon making the decision that much easier.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for a man touched by nature. a man&#x27;s man, one that was slapped on the rear by Poseidon at birth, with a chest Chuck Norris would be proud of...&lt;br /&gt;now all that is good and grand; unless your woman wants to brush her perfect [yet overly-sensitive] face across any part of you...this is where the power trimmer steps in..glides in...lands ever so eloquently on your testosterone riddled body. this product cleans you up so quickly and effortlessly, it seemingly coddles you like a grizzly bear to a cub.&lt;br /&gt;take the leap, try this incredible miniature barbershop for yourself..try it for your woman..or your favorite grizzly bear.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler through a program run by Gillette and have been absolutely thrilled with it. I had been looking to replace an old trimmer I had that the battery would no longer hold a charge. So far this has been an awesome replacement. Starting off with the cons, there are really only three complaints that I have with it. First, the trimmer head is a bit narrower than I would like, although that does allow more precise cutting. Second, the angle you have to hold it to get the best cut possible is different than any other trimmer I have used, but it DOES allow for a better view of what you are cutting. Third, the power button does take a bit of playing with to figure out how to get it clicked in the whole way (may have just been mine). But on the plus sides, it is extremely well constructed overall. Feels very sturdy and works great in the shower. While it has no problem cutting thicker hair, it is still gentle enough to not bother sensitive skin on face or body. The blade attachment is also a very nice touch to be able to use fusion blades on it as well. All around a great trimmer and I would gladly recommend it to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer, from the packaging to actually using it. First and foremost, the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof makes me weak in the knees. Everyone,  and I mean everyone, has tried and FAILED at using their beard trimmer in the shower. With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer, that&#x27;s not something you need to worry about. But what has me falling head over heels in love with it is how close it trims on its own.  You don&#x27;t necessarily have to shave, unless you want to. Although I was provided this razor for review by Gillette, I plan on buying another one to keep in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome for being under $20.  You can fit the whole package in an overnight bag...also fits in my medicine cabinet.  The shelves on the back of the unit are so convenient!  You don&#x27;t have to worry about where you&#x27;re going to pile all the attachments, when the unit hold all of them perfectly. I hope Gillette continues with the free razor program.  Without the program, I doubt I would have even found out about this product.  One shave with the free razor I got from the program Gillette was running was all it took to hook me.  Closest shave without any resistance!! Another plus is my skin is super smooth / soft afterwords.  My girlfriend loves touching my face right after I shave, she makes me shave on a daily basis now.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with the Proglide attachment.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler power trimmer to try via a program run by Gillette. Upon first receiving it and having a good look at the package, I confirmed that it was shower safe and water resistant. I planned on using it mainly for its razor function in place of my regular Gillette Fusion 5 (non power). I planned to use the extra trimmer features to clean up sideburns and other facial hair. Opening the package was pretty easy and upon inspection, I was amazed that this could get wet. Secured really well in it&#x27;s packaging housing, although a little hard to remove. After a few days of using it, all I can say is that I absolutely love it. It outperforms my regular razor for my regular shaving needs (love the fresh feeling and close shave from the vibrating power function) and the added benefit of the trimmer is a huge plus (especially since I can use it in the shower!). The one part of the power trimmer that I have mixed feelings about is the size. I love the ergonomics and the way it fits in my hand, but it is also too large to fit in my mirror mounted razor holder and takes up a larger footprint then a regular razor. In the end, I am happily willing to give up a little more shower real estate for this incredible hybrid razor &amp; trimmer device. Goodbye regular razor, hello Gillette Power Trimmer - 5 stars for this one!</li>
    <li> I received this via a Gillette sponsored program and I am super glad I did. This product gave me a clean and close shave that made me and my girl really happy. The sharp angles and smooth lines were a definite plus to the ProGlide Styler. I would recommend to give to any gentleman as a gift.</li>
    <li> Yesterday I received this Gillette product and the night I got it i decided to try it out and I gotta say I&#x27;m really impressed with what it did to my skin the styler doesn&#x27;t cut you or anything I think it&#x27;s really safe and you don&#x27;t have to worry about any cuts on your face. Before I got the Gillette styler I used  the wahl brand styler and it would always make my skin red and sometimes give me cuts i really am glad I got the Gillette styler! Definitely gonna buy this in the future.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide free as part of a program run by Gillette&lt;br /&gt;I got this trimmer today in the mail tried it right away and i was amazed with how easy it was to trim my chin strap. it also does a great shaving job..</li>
    <li> I Just received my Gillett Fusion Pro Styler free via a program run by Gillette and it is the best groomer/razor I have ever used.  It delivered the closest, most comfortable shave outside of a Barbershop.  The edger delivers precise lines on the sideburns and the ability to take it into the shower made it perfect for grooming those delicate areas.  The attachments were very easy to switch out and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.  The stand holds the attachments in a very functional way.  To say the least, I was skeptical but, Gillette has won me over with a great product.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I had received one for free in the mail last week from Gillette and I am very impressed with it. The trimmer worked very well on my sideburns and eyebrows. It left them clean shaved and was very precise.</li>
    <li> I never used a power trimmer before. I thought about purchasing one, but never got around to it. Lucky for me, Gillette had a program that provided me with one free to test out. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is like no other. Usually, you would have a regular cartridge razor, and an electric razor to clean up the edges, especially for growing facial hair. This razor takes care of both those needs. One head gives you the excellent Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridge razor, which dermatologists recommend as the best razor for your skin. If you remove it, you can put on an actual trimming guide, one you can cut hair with but leave at a certain length. If you remove that, you have a very precise, and gentle set of electric clippers, to get real close to the skin. Gillette has always been my go-to brand for shaving needs, and with this new release, they keep reminding me why that is. I would recommend this to everyone. It runs on AA batteries, and even works in the shower!</li>
    <li> My wife complains that my mustache is always big and that I need to trim it, well in receiving my Gillette fusion proglide trimmer today free from Gillette. My mustache looks its best now. It didn&#x27;t tuck at my hair and there&#x27;s multiple sized heads. They are easy to take on and off too!</li>
    <li> I received the free razor was via a program run by Gillette in the mail and my 10 year old son opened it. He&#x27;s getting into the grooming phase. He shaved a little on his face, then wanted to shave his leg hair, THEN he shaved his head! I have to say, it works really well. He just shaved a chunk of hair out of his hair and had no problem doing so. The razor and trimmer both work really well and leave you with a very close shave</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first when using this product but was pleasantly impressed. Having the convenience of the trimmer and razor is really handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing keeping it from a 5 start is that it is a little bulky when using the shaver. But for this price it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> the trimmer is not as powerful as I would like but its not to bad for the price would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> i recently received the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Styler razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette. and im so happy that i did receive it. its great to the touch , its accruate and lightweight so that means i can travel with it. it got my beard looking real nice and its precision is the best. i would recommend this to all my buddies.</li>
    <li> I received my trimmer for free via a program run by Gillette and I have been using it now for about two weeks.  What I love about the trimmer is that I&#x27;m able to do my own lineups using one machine.  I don&#x27;t have to switch from a trimmer to a straight edge razor.  The ProGlide has everything you need in one machine.  Another great things about the ProGlide is that it comes in it&#x27;s own case which holds all the attachments needed to get the job done without taking up too much space in your bathroom.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i receivedThe gillette trimmer from gillette and it works very well to keep my facial hair looking clean and sharp I really like the stand as it keeps all the pieces nice and neat my only problem is the cost of replacement razor blade great trimmee good razor worth the mobey</li>
    <li> I got my fusion proglide styler through a program Gillette was running I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a while and was tired of using big bulky shavers on my face and head cause I shave my head down to the skin I figured ill give the fusion proglide power trimmer a try so I used it it did great on the face and the head I didn&#x27;t need any help like usual so I will be recommending this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> So far this Gillette Fusion trimmer works well.  Tried it only on facial trimming so far.  Easy to use and handle.  Great if you like to trim side burns, and neck hair.  Worked great.  So far a good product to use.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure up front I received the Proglide trimmer as a free trial from Gillette. With that out of the way I was very impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very solid. You can tell by the weight that it is a well made tool. It runs on one AA battery and surprisingly very powerful for what is powering it. It would not be able to shave a full beard down to stubs, but who would use it that way? It is perfect for cleaning up areas and keeping sideburns, facial hair and anywhere else neat and trimmed. I have been looking for a tool like this and it completely fills the need. For a price under $20 you cannot go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solid 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> I just received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free in the mail.  AWESOME.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and actually really like it.  At first I thought it was too big, when compared to my regular razor, but now I really like the feel of the handle and its weight.  There&#x27;s plenty of rubber grips in all the right places and the best part is you can use it in the shower.  So far I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer by itself and the razor attachment.  But the included length guides look like they&#x27;d get the job done just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re curious about getting one give it a shot.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> This styler was amazing. I have rather large hands it the grip on this styler was so comfortable and perfect! I shave my head on a bi-daily basis usually with a hair trimmer. I received a free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. This gave me a great chance to try the product. I can truly say that I am hooked! I am constantly looking for something that fits comfortably in my large hands. Not only does this do the job the Trimmer razor really did a great job shaving my head down to the length I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The styler comes with 3 blade attachments for various hair lengths. I do now have a beard or mustache. I shave my face and head. The styler really did the trick for me. I did not use any of the attachments since I like a really close shave for my head.&lt;br /&gt;If you are not sure about this product I suggest that you purchase it. It is great for travel, fits comfortably in my hands (and I have large hands), and shaves great!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is AWESOME !&lt;br /&gt;This body groomer from Gillette is great. It is a quality product. No razor burn or bumps ever.  I highly recommend this product , you need to try it !</li>
    <li> Received this for free. Now I don&#x27;t have to wait for my haircuts to trim my beard!  Very impressive product! Highly recommended. Comes with everything you need.</li>
    <li> The power trimmer works great and is easy to use. Also it comes with a free razor from a special program run by Gillette. This trimmer is easy to use and is a must have. This trimmer allows for you to adjust your facial hair to any certain look that you are going for!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this razor as I got it free but I was happy to have this Gillette razor. It is very easy to use no matter where you are shaving &amp; for me this is very important. You will not go wrong if you purchase this razor</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use as your daily shaver or just to touchup some areas. The model is VERY light and I was shocked at how easy it is to use. There is no charger included and it is operated by battery only which makes it so light. I also found the attachment and stand included to be very helpful as they keep things organized without taking up too much space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is also waterproof so I was able to use it in the shower. I did get the product for free.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Company really got it right with this one. I recieved a free razor provided by a program ran by Gillette. I can say that I am happy with the product and plan to purchase more of this product. The razor cuts really close and I am amazed with the accurate cutting with the razor. I like the way its designed with with the rubber grip and its almost like you dont have it in your hand. All in all I am very impressed with this product and will tell family and friends.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I shave in the shower just for convenience.  The problem was that I have a goatee and had to wait until after the shower to trim the rest of my facial hair.  It was a hassle having to make sure my trimmer was charged and dealing with multiple attachments.  That is why when I was offered to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program from Gillette I was intrigued and excited.  As it turns out this product is great for me.  For starters this product is water proof which means that I can do all of my personal grooming in the shower.  The razor attaches over the top of the Braun trimmer very easily and securely.  I have to say that the handle was bigger that I am use to for a razor but I got comfortable with it quickly.  I had the clean close shave that I expect from Gillette razors.  After the shave portion was complete it was quick and easy to remove the razor and attach the comb for trimming my facial hair.  I did not expect much from the trimmer but was pleasantly surprised and how powerful it was.  It was able to handle the 5 days of growth on my goatee with ease.  Another great feature is that this is powered by a battery.  That eliminates the worry I had of whether or not the trimmer was going to have enough charge the next time I use it.  The trimmer, combs, and razor attachment all fit in to the convenient holder that is about the size of a shampoo bottle and fits nicely on my shower caddie.  At the end of the day I would say that this is a great trimmer and razor combination.  I feel that I have found a product that will make my life much more convenient and will allow me to do away with my old trimmer.</li>
    <li> This Gillette style is phenomenal.I got this thing via a promotion from Gillette. Its light, quiet, and the trimming head isn&#x27;t to bulky; so I can hit those harder to reach lines. I like that I can use it in the shower for less clean-up. Its quiet so I can use it in the early mornings when my wife is still asleep, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about waking her up; the water runs louder. The little holder thing isn&#x27;t too big, fits nicely on my bathroom counter. I honestly can&#x27;t think of any downsides to this product. I give my full recommendation for it.</li>
    <li> I have a goatee and i&#x27;m usually content with just shaving my face with my electric shaver for the most part.  I also have a body hair trimmer that I use to keep it short but never really got that precise because it was too much of a hassle.  I received the ProGlide Styler via a Gillette program and i&#x27;m super stoked on it.  Now I can dedicate my other hair trimmer for my \\&quot;private\\&quot; areas and use this device for my facial hair which works WAY better.  With the razor I can get a close shave, and use the trimmer with one of the 3 included guides to trim my goatee to the length I like.  The trimmer without the guides on works really well to clean around any edges.  Anyway, super cool little device, i&#x27;ve wanted one since i&#x27;ve seen the commercials.  Glad I finally got it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great trimer and shaver mix. And I have we t through alot of them till I come acrost this one... It works the best out of every shaver I have every used</li>
    <li> My girlfriend appreciates that I keep my body trimmed, and this was the perfect tool! The guards help from going too short and it was powerful enough to not bog down in thicker hair regions. I received my free trimmer through a program by Gillette, and it would be worth buying!!! There were no cons to the list of pros.... I thoroughly enjoyed the trimmer!</li>
    <li> I got to try this trimmer for free but after using it I would have gladly paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself felt solid, like it would hold up to everyday use. The only thing I could have used was a small brush to clean out the blade area after using it.</li>
    <li> I just received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. (I received the razor free via a program run by Gillette.)  It was a little challenging to get out of the package, but once it came out, it was easy to configure to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was close and comfortable and I really like that it can be used in the shower. It worked well on my sideburns and (much to my wife&#x27;s pleasure) cleaning up my neck was a breeze. It works well on body hair too. The chest cleaned right up. My wife appreciates that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to trim any type of body hair.</li>
    <li> I have always used scissors to keep my moustache trimmed but after receiving this styler for from Gillette&#x27;s program I have now put my scissors away.  This styler is excellent!</li>
    <li> I received this for free from Gillette and i couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  This is all you need to keep yourself well shaved and trimmed.  The trimmer feels great in your hand and the rubber grips keep it from sliding around.  The trimmer worked amazing on my neck line and sideburns.  The shaver attachment paired with the trimmer gave me a nice smooth shave.  The shaving head ejects like a normal raiser, so you only need to buy the standard refills.</li>
    <li> The proglide styler provides a quick and easy way of touching up while on the go. It&#x27;s compact size and ease of use make it a must for anyone that travels frequently. PROS Easy to use, compact, battery operated, can take it in the shower. CONS Heats up if you use it too long. Must have.  I&#x27;m grateful that Gillete provided this to me for free as it has made me a fan.</li>
    <li> I was invited to test the Gillette ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette. The ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is Braun-engineered for ultimate maneuverability and effortless, even trimming. The Trimmer comes with three exchangeable combs to adapt to the contours of your face and body. The Trimmer&#x27;s handle is ergonomically designed to maintain grip and control from start to finish. The ProGlide blades are thinner and finer than ordinary razors, which replaces the tug and pull of shaving with an effortless glide. Gillette&#x27;s innovative Microcomb guides hair to the blades for effortless, against the grain closeness, and the precision edged blade creates crisp, defined lines. Gillette has created the #1 Dermatologist recommended razor to give you the smoothest, most comfortable shave ever offered!</li>
    <li> I received the razor via a program run by Gillette.  The razor is great and gentle on the skin, with the power trimmer able to really style as need be.  It&#x27;s also slim enough to get into all areas of the body without discomfort.</li>
    <li> I received this for free via a program run by Gillette! Nice and smooth shave, Works Great! comes complete with everything you need even a Duracell battery! It works great and no cords. WOW!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I don&#x27;t have a beard, so my concept of how this does on that, or the value as it compares to other products in the &#x27;beard&#x27; category might not be helpful to you.  However, I do keep my body hair clean and found this trimmer to be a highly effective tool at a good value.  Other tools that I&#x27;ve used or have considered using fell short in one area or another.....too big, too expensive, can&#x27;t be used in the shower, etc.  This one is the right size, feels sturdy enough to last a long time, has an attachment for a razor, and works in the shower.  I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion Projlide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack to anyone who likes to keep their body groomed and isn&#x27;t looking to clutter the shower or their bathroom with tools.</li>
    <li> Used this to trim up my armpits, worked nicely to clean up the mess of hairs and add some control to that part of my life.  I liked the smaller size vs my other trimmer, which made it easier to see where I needed to trim.  I really liked how I can trim in the shower which makes clean up a breeze, vs trimming above the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a free product from Gillette to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con is that the device is not rechargable.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works great and it&#x27;s very useful considering that I shave almost everyday and do different things with my facial hair. The only con about the whole set is where you store the trimmer heads. I feel like if i push them in to hard they will break but if I just slide them in there they will fall out. Other than that great product and I have definitely been missing out.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver. I received this as a promotion from the Gillette and the product works excellent. I have a pretty thick beard and it cuts through it and trims it like nobody&#x27;s business. I will continue to suggest that everyone purchase one of these awesome shavers.</li>
    <li> I received the Proglide Styler for free through a promotion run by Gillette and found it to be a great trimmer. While it may not be built for every day use or thick hair, it is the perfect travel companion thanks to it&#x27;s compact size. Highly recommend for the frequent traveler!</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to have got this item free via a promotion from Gillette. The very stylish package Contained: 1 Trimmer, 1 ProGlide Power Cartridge, 3 combs, 1 battery, and an organizer. My first concern was how to know how long or short the combs were. It was recommended, by my wife, to try the combs on my legs in order to get a gauge on that. After having done so, I decided that I would be using the #2 Comb to get the look I was after. The trimmer handle is quite a bit smaller than my Phillips and the trimming head is also smaller. This made the trimming on my face and body take a bit longer than I was used to. However, it did trim my facial hair evenly and easily. I followed up with out a comb guard to attempt to get that precise edge on my neck and lip line. It preformed flawlessly and with the smaller head than my Phillips the tighter places were slightly easier to get to. I also used the Proglide cartridge to shave up the neck area and my upper cheek. I was really impressed with it. While on the trimmer the Proglide vibrates slightly giving a noticeably comfortable shave. It can be used in the shower, which is nice, but, I didn&#x27;t use it this way at first. I do plan on trying it out there too, something my Phillips cannot do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this trimmer, it is slim and sleek looking. I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t give me the look I am after but, it did so quite nicely. It doesn&#x27;t have as many settings as my other trimmer but, for the price, it is a great option. With the smaller size, battery power, and integrated razor I see myself using this as a travel trimmer. I feel this is a great entry level trimmer that would always be a good standby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading another review, I would say if it has been a while since you manscaped, you might want to bring out the big guns, this trimmer is a perfect light duty tool.</li>
    <li> I got to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide styler for free thanks to Gillette. I hate having to trim my beard, its just a huge pain. Well this product makes it so easy. You dont have to mess with plug-ins. That drives me crazy. I never remember to charge my trimer until I want to use it and its dead. This is no longer a problem. Also its just the right size, small enough to trim little spots and large enough to get the big areas. This is a very unique product and now its my favorite!</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide for free via a program run by Gillette.  As a woman I usually use razors made for men, because I feel they give a closer shave.  I did use the razor and I didnt feel that it gave as close of a shave as I usually get with other Gillette razors.  The trimmer my boyfriend used and he thought it worked very well.  Overall it was a pretty good product that my boyfriend would definetly buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been using the the run-of-the-mill Fusions for several years now and love them. I was very excited to get my hands on the ProGlide Styler model with the finer, thinner blades and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint! The blade does a really nice job getting as close as possible without chopping up your face until my face feels buttery smooth. The Styler comes with detachable faces, one for the razor, for your beard (I don&#x27;t have one) and down to the nitty gritty to help with side burns and lining up your neck. I say BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the cost of this in stores. I received it to review from Gillette but went to see the actual cost in stores and was thrilled! This set is great for a quick buy and shave in a hurry.</li>
    <li> When I received my free razor that was ran by a program ran by Gillette I was kinda skeptical by the size but the way it shaves it was smooth. I would recommend to anybody this is because its very cheap to buy and it shaves any style.</li>
    <li> I have recently been looking for a new beard trimming system since my old one has reached it&#x27;s end.  I then saw the program run by Gillete for a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer and figured I&#x27;d give it a try and I am glad I did.  My old trimmer used to really pull and tug on my hair, but the Gillette power trimmer is super smooth and doesn&#x27;t miss a spot.  I have yet to try the razor and clipper attachments but that is soon to come.</li>
    <li> I recently received the new Gillette power trimmer for beards through a free trial program from Gillette.  The trimmer is great for trimming precise lines in hard to do spots.  I was pleasantly surprised how much power this trimmer has being that it runs on one double A battery.  It&#x27;s size is also a plus.  Small and sleek, allowing it to get to normally hard to get to spots.  The three extension pieces make it great to vary the length you need.  For the price and effectiveness, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the high quality of this trimmer.  I got my trimmer from Gillette in a promotional giveaway, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I was skeptical about the shaving attachment, but I found that I actually prefer this to my normal razor due to the weight and thickness of the handle.  The docking station is a nice addition as well since I have a habit of \\&quot;misplacing\\&quot; small attachments.  Overall I am very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Gillette provided me with a free sample and I think I&#x27;ll switch from the Schick I was using.  The blade gives a good shave without feeling like you are shaving at all, just glides across the skin.  The trimmer works fine, though because I have a more expensive, adjustable, larger one I&#x27;ll continue to use that and use the Gillette trimmer when travelling.</li>
    <li> I have had the razor for about a month now without any issues.  The trimmer does not pull at you and is easy to clean and maintain, it comes apart easily.  The trimmer also comes with a blade to attach so you don&#x27;t need to have a second razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with a beard or body hair.</li>
    <li> This little bullet of a trimmer is a great addition to my beard trimmer repertoire. I have owned more expensive beard trimming razors and they have done a good job, but you pay a hefty price for that. With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Trimmer, you get the versatility of a small piece of equipment. However, you do not get a wide variety of trimming lengths to choose from. Overall a great trimmer for the price!</li>
    <li> It has been a pleasure to use the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Styler. It has cut down on my grooming time and allowed me to stay clean and trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;It is not perfect by any means nor will I recommend to do a massive grooming but for the price it is definitely a great tool.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it to trim my beard, mustache and the tiny neck airs between haircuts.</li>
    <li> first off I&#x27;d like to thank Gillette for hooking my up with this trimmer for free.  i porbably wouldn&#x27;t have bought one on my own, but but i&#x27;m glad i have it now.  i like it way better than my old trimmer.  It&#x27;s small and easier to handle and the grip on it is nice, not to mention you can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Gillette products so when I had the opportunity to try out this free &amp;#34;styler&amp;#34;  as a part of a program run by Gillette, I immediately jumped on the opportunity. My first impression when opening the package was how sleek the device was. It had a very modern look! But what I really liked was how close of a shave it gave me! The vibrating tool in the styler helped stimulate the hairs on my face and chest so that it gave me an incredibly smooth shave. Better yet was how well it worked in the shower! I always shave in the shower, so I was a little hesitant at first with a more electric type razor, but this one blew me away! The hairs fell off the blade with no problem and it consistently trimmed the hairs on my face and chest regardless of how I was moving the styler. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the way it fit in my hand. Though the look was very modern and sleek, it didn&#x27;t fit comfortably, which may be due in part to my large hands - who&#x27;s to say. Great product overall!</li>
    <li> I recently had the privilege to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program that is run by Gillette. This trimmer works great! It deserves a slot in your morning routine. The trimmer comes with three different size attachments to cover most facial hair needs. This trimmer can handle any facial forest. I have thick and course facial hair, and the trimmer handled it without any struggle. The trimmer head is a good size. It&#x27;s about an inch in diameter which should cover all your trimming needs. The trimmer itself is very easy to handle. The grip feels almost like tire tread, which means a good slip free grip. That is any guys nightmare. Putting the finishing touches to whatever style that you just created and the trimmer slips leaving you with something that Boy George would like. That won&#x27;t happen with this one. The power trimmer is also shower friendly! For me it wasn&#x27;t really a big deal. I&#x27;m not the type to trim my face in the shower. The good thing I found with this was when I am trimming, and can wash it off in the sink while using it! That equals less facial trimmings landing on my chest or worse in the crevasse of my elbow. Nothing is worse then getting a facial hair sliver, yes this has happened before! After using the trimmer the head pops about a quarter inch back so the inside can be cleaned. The trimmer uses one AA battery to keep it going. It is very easy to replace. Unscrew the bottom of the trimmer and there is the battery. It would be better if it was rechargeable, but you can&#x27;t have everything. Another feature that I really liked was the case it came in. It has a slot for everything, and isn&#x27;t cumbersome or oversized at all. The three size attachments have slots in the back of the case where they fit snuggly as not to come out unless wanted. The front holds the trimmer upright, and behind the Fusion Razor cartridge attachment. The case is neat and actually looks good on the bathroom counter! Over all this trimmer is great! This trimmer will keep any style easy to manage and maintain! Another great product from Gillette!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Trimmer works terrific.  I find that it does a great job trimming my beard, sideburns, and neck hair.  Best product on the market for the money!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer before my cruise to the Bahamas, and what I loved about it was that it is all there for everything you need to trim or shave. I usually bring my electric shaver, a razor, and the trimmer side of the electric shaver to trim my sideburns. With the Gillete power Trimmer and the free razor provided by a program run by Gillete I was able to just bring my Gillete power trimmer for everything I needed. The Trimmer is real nice, it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like some trimmers tend to do, and it has a real nice grip that doesn&#x27;t get slippery even when used in the shower. The attachments are nice, as you don&#x27;t have to be a barber to use it, and it works great to trim down goatees as I have, or those bushy sideburns. I like that you can just attach your razor to it and not have to bring two different items with you on vacation. Although attaching the razor makes it a bit longer than your usual razor, it doesn&#x27;t really affect your shaving technique or give you less grip. I would say if you are one who needs to shave everyday or once a week and likes to keep their goatee trimmed neatly, this trimmer is for you. Not only does it save you time, but it is quick and easy to change from shaver to trimmer without any hassle. I was looking for a trimmer that was economical and easy to use, and after going through a few trimmers, i finally found one that is a keeper...Thanks Gillete!</li>
    <li> love it would buy another one</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Ever since I got it, I have been playing with different styles to see what it can do. It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the small form factor you can really get into those hard to reach areas. 42  The razor attachment works with any Gillette Fusion ProGlide refill, which is good because this is the only grooming tool you will ever need for sculpting and keeping your beard well kept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from a gillette promotion and have to say The manual blade leaves much to be desired for anyone that has a beard but the electric spot trimmer is awesome for around the ears, eyebrows, undereye, and the nape of the neck. Where smooth as a baby might not be the look you&#x27;re going for its nice to know you can shave the neck and cheeks and still leave a well trimmed beard in place. While the whole reason to get the beard trimmer and razor combo was for the razor I&#x27;ll keep the trimer for sure.</li>
    <li> As a man I am always trying to look my best and use products that help me to achieve that goal. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer helps me to accomplish that goal. Recently, I received The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free through a program run by Gillette. I love the trimmer because it is lightweight and has a sturdy easy to grip handle. It helps me to get straight edges and angles along my goatee and sideburns. It has long lasting results that are different from similar products. My face is smooth and stubble free. I love this product because it is relatively inexpensive and provides rapid and smooth results. I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in achieving a great look at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Style Power Trimmer is awesome.It was easy to use even in \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot;. I had another trimmer but I think I am hooked on the Gillette, it gave a much nicer shave and had more accessories to make getting different areas easy to do. I got this razor through a program run by Gillette.Gillette has been and will be the only brand for me.</li>
    <li> This product has not ceased to amaze me yet. After using this product for several weeks now, I can honestly say it reaches beyond my expectations. The trimmer allows me to shape my goatee the way I like it without any awkward positions. Trimming has become more of a leisure time with this product that I have used previously. I would recommend this to anyone, it is the closest thing you will get to that of a barber.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it was just was hi-fi razor ! but it turned out to be a the best grooming tool ever ! shaves and trims all together !</li>
    <li> I received a free Fusion ProGlide-In-1 Styler Power Trimmer from Gillette to evaluate. First let me say that it is the best trimmer I have ever used. It will quickly and thoroughly clean up your sideburns, beard and any other places you need a little maintenance. In the shower, was the perfect place for me to clean up all my unruly hair! I have used this trimmer several times now and will keep on using it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a clean look.&lt;br /&gt;The shave was incredible! It was the closest shave I have ever had. I tend to shave in the morning and am usually in a rush but this razor really delivers! No need to go over any places twice and you get an incredibly close shave without any irritation! The Special Pack has everything you could possibly need!</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Styler for free via a program run by Gillette. Both the shaver and edger met my expectations. However, the trimmer did not. I would not use the trimmer in sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> I freekin Love this trimmer! My stache is sooo sweet and ready for Mustache Month!I keep it right keep it tight!</li>
    <li> This is the best of the best. I received a free kit from a special programs hosted by  Gillette. This kit comes with everything you need to shave, trim, edge, and groom your manly hairs. It is extremely easy to use and cost effective. The blades are interchangeable with the push of a button. It comes with a stand to hold all the blades, and also comes with the batteries so no need to purchase any. At the push of the power button, you can begin to use as desired. The kit comes with 3 trimmers blades numbered 1-3. They are all washable and reusable.</li>
    <li> I got to try out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it I opened it up and put it all together and was immediately impressed by the compact all-in-one design of the holder.  I work out at least once a day so I have a gym bag that has to go with me everywhere and the Proglide Styler Power Trimmer fit into my bag without taking up almost any room.  It also worked great fitting wherever I have space when I&#x27;m showering and cleaning up after my workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked how I could use it to trim my sideburns, get confidently to the edges of my goatee, and then put on a razor head and shave everywhere else.  It helped me keep my chest hair trimmed down without being prickly and was nice to just do all at once when I was working on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The convenience of this tool is really great, I usually have to trim up at the house and then take razors to the gym with me, but this was one tool that did it all, fit into my gym bag, and even more importantly, fit into the hectic rush of my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will keep using the Power Trimmer and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Style Power Trimmer comes conveniently packed with a variety of heads. My girlfriend always complains about my overly ruly sideburns and the hair growing down my neck between haircuts, but now with the Proglide Style Power Trimmer, I am able to maintain my under-managed mane and sideburns. I found the number 2 trimmer to trim off the perfect amount of hair without leaving me too bare. The razor alone, helps to keep my face cleanly shaven everyday for a demanding dress code at work. This convenient system allows me to shave and trim hair in the shower.. just need to bring in a mirror! Thanks Gillette for giving me the opportunity to test the Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. Without this opportunity, I would have continued to keep my shaving razor and grooming tools separated.</li>
    <li> I received the sylter as a promo item from Gillette.  As with the other fusion products, I find the styler easy to use and helps provide a clean comfortable shave without the nicks and cuts that I have experienced with other replacement blades.  The interchangeable guides are keep to make your own unique style.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving. I hate shaving so much that I have a beard year round. I do like to look put together and well groomed all around however. The main trimmer itself is a good size, powered by one battery and is very powerful. I have used it for grooming, shaving my face and trimming up my hair line. The power helped reduce the irritation on my neck and provided a very defined edge to my hairline. The size of the trimmer with the razor on top was a bit much though and took some time to get used to. The trimmer itself was great for trimming my beard to the perfect length and was so powerful it cut down on the time it took to trim up. The trimmer did not pull hair in more delicate areas and was great! I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Because I always keep stubble on my face and keep the rest of my body pretty well groomed, I was looking forward to trying the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. (Gillette kindly provided me with one so I could see how well it performs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t love it. It works pretty well for precision trimming on the face, but it&#x27;s not as multifunctional as it aspires to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start the experience, one must open the package and get the trimmer out, which takes a solid five minutes of undistracted focus. At best, it&#x27;s complicated. When you finally assemble the contents, the small flimsy rack in front of you holding a tiny trimmer and a few hastily designed attachments is an anticlimax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to actually using it. Like I mentioned, I use trimmers for stubble. The device I normally use can alter the length by .2mm at a time. This is not that. The trimmer blade on its own cuts very short leaving almost nothing (good for cleaning up around a beard), while the shortest attachment leaves too much to look clean and maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments would be better served for body hair, but that must also be fairly precision oriented due to the small size of the trimmer. Useful for underarms and one&#x27;s personal area, but for the chest or larger spots, the process is too time-consuming. I also found the trimmer blade not to be quite sharp enough. A couple times it got a little caught in my beard but that may be user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the razor blade attachment for a moment but there&#x27;s just something about vibrating razors on my neck that scares me. A regular razor with as many blades is likely just as good without the buzzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a compact device that does precise trimming of small areas and can get wet in the shower, this is a pretty good choice. If you&#x27;re after a stubble or body hair trimmer, look for something bigger with better attachments.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this gillete proglide styler. It does the work it suppose to. I get a good close shave and a nice trim on mustache. A few cuts but nothing to change my mind about purchasing this item again. It is perfect in size and fits on my bathroom counter. Thanks gillete for letting me try out for free. I will be recommending to all my family and friends thanks.</li>
    <li> I got the gillette fusion proglide styler power trimmer for free, provided by a program run by Gillette. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be that great- it looked a bit small and flimsy to me so  I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work, but boy was I wrong. It&#x27;s incredibly light-weight and efficient. It works great and is so easy to hold and use- not bulky at ALL and no cord to worry about. It&#x27;s an unbelievably smooth shave for a trimmer and is super powerful- to my surprise. The holder it comes with for easy storage on the counter top and the 3 comb attachments are a big plus too. All in all, great product.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a recent program Gillette had I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler for free. I immediately fell in love with the container that holds the styler and its attachments. Unlike the black bag that other trimmers have the container keeps everything in simple access for you. I had decided to allow my goatee to grow a little wild before I used the trimmer to do any styling. I found that the exchangeable combs were so easy to use and the way they attached to the styler kept them in place. The trimmer has smaller teeth the the other trimmers that I have and this is a big plus as it does not seem to pull out my hair. Then the ease of cleaning the trimmer was amazing unlike other trimmer that I have used you cant submerge the trimmer head. Even when wet the trimmer worked like a charm, no pulling or even slipping out of the hand. Thanks Gillette for another awesome product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack several time and liked it. The trimmer was great to keep the lines straight on my face. The shave was smooth and easy to take on and off the trimmer. I would recommend this to anyone. My wife liked it too.</li>
    <li> I was given this razor/trimmer to try out.  I must say that the instructions were a little less than I would have liked but all in all this little combo kit does a great job.  My goatee is looking nicely trimmed without stray or uneven hairs.  It is nice to be able to just switch out pieces and continue on my way.  My teenage son has had some fun with it by shaping designes into his \\&quot;chin strap\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Recently, I was lucky enough to receive a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a free program provided by Gillette. After my first use, I could immediately contrast it from any other typical trimmer.  The kit includes three snap-on combs, a modular shaving/trimming blade, a convenient stand to hold your razor and accessories, and a AA battery to power your trimmer. I noticed that the ProGlide trimmer is very comfortable to hold and makes for a clean and close edge up. After using it for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve realized that this trimmer functions as advertised and is very durable. I highly recommend the trimmer whether it becomes a bathroom staple for you or even if it&#x27;s simply used as a travel companion.</li>
    <li> This is the best grooming product I&#x27;ve ever used. My dad used it and liked it so much, I went and bought him one, as well!</li>
    <li> I was given the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler to try for free via a program run by Gillette. I must say this is by far the best multipurpose razor i have ever used. It is easy to use and just as easy to clean. It comes with 3 different size hair trimmer attachments plus the handle is a close up trimer. It also comes with a razor atachment and an organizer. The handle appears to be bulky but it alows for a frim grip and gives you full control of the razor. This is a must have if you have hair anywere on your body.</li>
    <li> As a lifelong Gillette user, I was thrilled to have the chance to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a program run by Gillette.  At first glance, there it seems like there are a lot of options, but after you try it out, you find out just how useful of a toll it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shaving goes, it worked fine with the attachment on the trimmer...just takes a little getting used to.  It feels different then your standard razor, but once you get by that, you get the same great shave as always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I particularly liked was the edging and trimming aspects of it.  If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll miss a spot every now and then, or want to trim around the edges of your beard, and this works great for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really convenient having everything in one device, where you can shave, easily change the attachment on the end, and do whatever trimming/edging you want.  In the time I&#x27;ve had it, it&#x27;s made shaving much easier, and I can&#x27;t wait to keep on using it!</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this item, for free as a promotional offer from Gilette, I was a little skeptical, as my whole life, any time I have shaved I&#x27;ve gotten razor burn. Using the razor blade attachment I had no razor burn and smooth, closely shaven skin. When i used the length attachments to trim my mustache and goatee it was nice and easy. Definitely worth the money for sure. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something different than toilet paper balls on cuts and itchy dry skin from a dull razor!</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer free from Gillette, as my manly beard was deemed wildly enough for a complimentary trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is anything you get out of this review, let it be this:  I have replaced my electric trimmer with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Why would you act so boldly, oh bearded one?\\&quot; You may be asking yourself, and I&#x27;ll gladly tell you.  This power trimmer was made for a man&#x27;s mighty fist, first and foremost.  It has rubber grips that feel like tire tread and a desirable weight/balance to it.  This trimmer is like an extension of my own arm as I&#x27;m slaughtering my facial hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A much overlooked feature is that you can bring this trimmer into the shower with you!  No longer must I endure long and harsh lectures about beard stubble littering the sink, as I can watch them all sink away down the tub drain.  It is truly a double-win here for the wife: A clean sink when she wakes up, and a neatly landscaped beard on my face instead of a raging forest.  Who could possibly not benefit from using this trimmer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer may have too many words in it&#x27;s name, but I have come to realize that there are simply not enough to describe how awesome it is to use.</li>
    <li> So I gave this product 4 stars because it&#x27;s not perfect, but I definitely think men could benefit from this styler. I received this set to try out through a Gillette program. I was impressed with all aspects of this styler. It has Convenience, power, portability, and attachments, which includes an actual razor.  Great for traveling, but more importantly, I find myself using it in between haircuts to clean up around my neck, ears, and my side burns. I also use it on my son. I use it to trim my chest, and it is so light, and the perfect size for better precision. For under $20.00 you just can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product. Another bonus is that you can take it in the shower, and its easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This product was pretty good for the price its sold for. I received it through a program that Gillette is running and tried it out. I have to admit I was shocked at how clean the trimmer worked on my beard. It shaped it just like going to the barber and I was able to line myself with no trouble.  Its seriously a product that I&#x27;ll be keeping around for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure if the characters from The Hunger Games were real they would use a Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler. I&#x27;ve only used my Proglide Styler for a few weeks, but it&#x27;s pretty amazing. I was surprised how straight and precise it trims.  I normally used hair clippers to trim my beard, which works ok, but this trims and you can create perfectly straight edges. The best part is that it&#x27;s lightweight and cordless. It comes with attachments so you can trim your beard to different lengths and a shaving razor attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing about it is that it is so precise it&#x27;s easy to trim too far and takes a little bit of practice.  The first time I used it I was trying to thin out my beard without having an attachment on and took a small chunk of hair out and I had to trim my beard back to stubble. But once you get the hang of it.. you&#x27;ll be trimming your favorite football team&#x27;s logo into the side of your best friend&#x27;s head in no time!</li>
    <li> I received A free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler from a program ran by Gillette. After a week of using my Styler I was thrilled of the Proformance on the ease of using it. The combs (3) of them I got to choose the lenghts I wanted my beard to be. I was able to trim with out any tugging or pulling. When I was done with trimming I finished up with the razor blade attachment to get a close and nick free shave. I would recommend the Gillette ProGlide Styler any one that uses multiple tools for there grooming.</li>
    <li> i was hesitant on a trimmer like this.  i have to say that after years of using fusion products, i am surprised by the power of this little trimmer!  i only use it for trimming, not for shaving as it is too bulky for that.  great to use in the shower and very portable. this was a free program from gillette for my to try.</li>
    <li> I received my free ProGlide Styler kit in the mail from a program ran by Gillette just last week and I am extremely satisfied. Right away I took the power trimmer out and decided to trim down my body a bit which I had been wanting to do for a while. I was immediately impressed with the grip and shape of the Styler. It was small, simple and fit really well in my hand, perfect to take anywhere I want without being a hassle. It also came with three different size attachments which seem perfect to me for any size of facial hair or any hair on the body. I decided just to go with the size one on my body. It was a little shorter than I wanted it to be but, as I am in the military, was perfect for my side burns and trimming around my ears and neck. Although it was shorter than I wanted it worked incredibly well on my body right away. I was able to trim everything down in just several minutes in the shower without any longer hairs sticking out in random spots. It was very precise. I also had no problem going over the contours of my body. It went right over everything with no error. I was beyond satisfied with my first trimming experience with this product and my wife loved the look of post-hairy me. Even though it was a bit shorter than I wanted I couldn&#x27;t argue with how consistent the shave was. I don&#x27;t like to brag but, I looked pretty damn good after that shave. I finished up and washed off the trimmer and all of the hair came out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last kit cost 35 bucks but didn&#x27;t work half as good as this simple kit. I cannot recommend it enough. If you are newer to trimming like myself or want something that is more simple but near perfect you should pick this up. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great all-in-one device!  It&#x27;s great for everyday use, and is very convenient for travel, as I now can just bring one device.  The trimmer is perfect size for my goatee with the 3 different size clips.  I received a free razor from a program offered by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and what&#x27;s even better is that I received it for free! It was a promotion Gillette was running. Even if this product wasn&#x27;t free I still would have gotten it because this product is great. The trimmer is perfect for lining up your hair in between haircuts. I use it daily for that purpose. Where this product really shines however is if you have a beard. It&#x27;s perfect for edging those crisp lines in a beard or goatee. This product also comes with a great comb that attaches to the trimmer to get the perfect length cut every time. Overall I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have used a product like this one - it was extremely simple to use and I really like how well it trims to allow to have different levels of scruff to even just trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first use I was a little skeptical, but then I got the hang of it. The little instruction booklet was helpful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really enjoyed this product. Two aspects I didn&#x27;t like, however; one was that the way in which the pieces snap in can be difficult, and often seem to be snapped in but aren&#x27;t. The plastic for the pieces are extremely thin and brittle, and seem like they would easily break if you aren&#x27;t being really careful connecting it. Oddly enough, the rest of the product seemed much more durable (not sure this key component wasn&#x27;t as durable as the rest of the product)&lt;br /&gt;The second thing was the actual razor attachement. It was a good shave with the multiple blades, but I found myself preferring the power off because it didn&#x27;t really assist using that blade. I would rather just use a regular gilette razor to finish up my styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hey this trimmer truly works I love how my beard came out thanks ones again go Gillette fusion proglide  3- in 1</li>
    <li> Started using Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler as part of a trial campaign from Gillette and I must admit I&#x27;m impressed. This one beats them all. I found out that the trimmer is powered by Braun and designed for ultimate maneuverability and effortless, even trimming. It comes with three exchangeable combs that adapt to keep length consistent also its ergonomic handle helps you to keep grip and control guaranteed from start to finish.</li>
    <li> Works well and is definitely a time and space saver. 5 stars from me! Works extremely well. I received this to try for free through a program ran by Gillete. I was impressed and will definitely be using this/purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product for free through a program run by Gillette.  I thought the trimmer on this product, as well as the trimmer options was fantastic.  When using this product to shave, however, it was not as close as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> mcelheneyd here... using my wife&#x27;s Amazon account for my review. I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free via a program run by Gillette. I had never used a power trimmer before trying this one. It&#x27;s great! In the past, I had just shaved with a regular razor, but this trimmer allows me to trim what I need to at a much faster pace. I&#x27;m a busy guy, so it&#x27;s great to have something I can use quickly. My wife is much happier as well when I&#x27;m taking up less time in the bathroom! :) If I were you, I would defintiely give it a try!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Trimmer for free from a program run by Gillette.  I did like the small size of the handle, it was easy to manage at different angles.  I also liked the different sized attachments.  I did not use them all but I thought it was a good range.  I also used the trimmer without any attachments and I feel that the shave could have been closer.  Other than that I have no issues and think that it is a well made product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I received the power trimmer for free from a Gillette program and therefore I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from the actual quality of the trimmer. I was delightfully surprised to see that the trimmer is of good quality for its price point. I have used the trimmer on edging the hair line on much shaved head and keeping my chest hair under control and have actually used it on my eyebrows too. I can really appreciate the price of this product considering most electric trimmers are very expensive and this product is a great way to get yourself used to electric trimmers and what versatility they have to offer. I like the different guard for this trimmer making the product even more valuable. At this price you can&#x27;t go wrong with giving this a shot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for a few weeks now. I received it for free in a promotion from Gillette and I&#x27;ve been loving this trimmer. It has been terrific for maintaing my goatee and side burns, and my wife has been using it to trim the hair on the back of my neck. The size is great. It is small enough so I can be very accurate with it, but large enough so I can trim quickly.  The guards are good at helping me maintain length, and the razor blade attachment is great so that I have one handle that can trim and shave. This is a terrific trimmer and I am happy to be using it.</li>
    <li> Complete package, works as advertised and priced right.</li>
    <li> I usually have to shave, like every 7 days because irritation but with the trimmer function I can have close end, like that 3 afternoon shadow</li>
    <li> I loved this pro glide razor it gives me the clean shave and the trim I want. I&#x27;m also able to trim my beard easily so I don&#x27;t have to shave it off and so my wife wont complain either. It is a amazing styler and I recommend to all my family and friends. I received this razor free from a program by Gillette and whenever this one stops working I will spend the money for a new one since I think this one is worth it.</li>
    <li> I recieve this free from a program run by Gillette. I recently took it with me on an extended camping trip. I love how everything is combined into one nice package so i didn&#x27;t need to pack a bunch of stuff to keep me from looking like Grisly Adams. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this 3-in-1 Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler to try for free via a program run by Gillette. I was excited to try this styler. I can nicely trim my beard and goatee with this trimmer. It is a breeze with this trimmer. it is the perfect size for me to trim. I get a perfect shape every time. There is one thing I don&#x27;t like, and that is because the hair clogs up everything and it takes quite a while to clean them, but for a trimmer this great it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.  I would defiantly recommend this to everyone who is looking for a great trimmer. I can shave and trim my goatee with out taking another three razors in my hand. I can do it all with one styler.</li>
    <li> The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, I thought, might as well just experiment with it. Initially I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. But after trying it out, I was really impressed with the features and how this little gadget has quickly become my new favorite tool to groom with! It is awesome for shaving. As I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation after using it unlike some others. It would be nice to have a charger along with it.  Size is nice, handle is comfortable to hold. Overall it is a great product from Gillette!</li>
    <li> I recently received this product for free through a program run by Gillette. I have been pleasantly surprised by all this little trimmer can do. While trimming body hair isn&#x27;t my thing, I am finding it very handy to trim the hair near my ears to keep it tidy. I am so glad I was able to be part of this program! I will be using this product quite often in the future.</li>
    <li> When I first received my razor as a Gillette promotion I was a bit skeptical. There were a lot of pieces and it seemed complicated. Who knew that a razor with a power trimmer attachment could work so well. I have been a Gillette customer for years, but I also have another electric razor for quick touch ups. The power trimmer makes that redundancy a thing of the past! The attachments were easy to use and change out and I really like the close shave of a Gillette blade so that was a great bonus as well.</li>
    <li> Been using this Razor for a few weeks and its worked great. The Beard Trimmer is very useful. Also the Stand keeps all the pieces together well on my counter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Gillette man. I&#x27;ve tried other razors in the past, but Gillette has always given me the exact results that I look for in a razor. When I was given the opportunity to try the new 3 in 1 styler, I jumped at the offer. I&#x27;ve never been one to \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; but with this product I figure I would give it a try. The first thing I did was trim up my side burns a bit. I was blown away by how easy it was to get them exactly like I wanted. My wife even used it to trim up my chest and back more to her liking. This is a great product, and one more reason that Gilette will ALWAYS get my business.</li>
    <li> I love that I can use this thing to shave, trim and edge, yet it&#x27;s tiny and didn&#x27;t cost much. Got rid of a so-so beard trimmer and a very expensive electric razor in favor of this one device. So far it does a good job of all three tasks. I use rechargeable batteries, and don&#x27;t shave too often so they last a long time. I&#x27;m not sure the vibration while using the manual shaver makes any difference, but it feels nice. The best part is that if something happened to this, I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about buying a new one--more than I can say for much more expensive &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; alternatives (which were also bulky and involved swapping out multiple heads).  One criticism: having only three comb sizes is a bit limiting. You&#x27;d better hope your preferred beard length matches one of the three, or you&#x27;re SOL.  EDIT: I still really like this thing, but the blades are of course super expensive. It&#x27;s like buying a cheap electric toothbrush and then realizing the brush heads cost way more than they should. That&#x27;s clearly where Gillette is making their money.</li>
    <li> I bought couple of them from this seller. I love the &amp;#34;Styler&amp;#34; itself. It is wonderful. Should have price checked it before ordering. I could have picked it up from Walmart for cheaper and got it 2 days in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 stars though is for the packaging. It is bulky compared to the standard packaging and doesn&#x27;t give any additional value. The content in Special Pack is exactly same as the standard packaging. So should not be called Special Pack.</li>
    <li> I tried this product recently.  It took me one shave and I was hooked.  And for the price it makes it twice as nice.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I look great for my proglide fusion I like soo much I think this product is the better an use on mi life, I want buy that an time this is finish!!</li>
    <li> I have previously bought a Wahl trimmer and liked it hit the batteries need to be changed often. I revieved the Gillette fusioun trimmer for free from a program ran by Gillette. Since I have used it three times now it still isn&#x27;t dead nor does it seam like the batteries need to be replaced. I trim pretty much my whole body, it doesn&#x27;t bog down and trims evenly in my course hair.. I like it alot...</li>
    <li> I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free in the mail from a program run by Gillette. It gave me a close shave and tight trim on sideburns. I even used it on my eyebrows to keep them from being unruly. It delivers a close trim for my neck in between haircuts. It is not the same as hair clippers but it does good for the touch ups.</li>
    <li> I loved the compact, yet powerful design of the trimmer. I liked the fact you can take it in the shower with you. I liked the different attachments. The different attachments along with the power, gives you a customized shave everytime. I also liked the fact you could use the power trimmer for places other than your face.</li>
    <li> Styler is built in a small and compact size, light weight and operated by a standard battery. Blades are too expensive.</li>
    <li> I received my power trimmer as part of a free Gillette program for my review.  There are many things I liked about the trimmer, first of all the blade attachment was very nice to tough up quick shave areas or to create a nice straight line on your sideburns before using the power trimmer.  I also really liked the comb attachments for thinning out the sideburn hair.  I think this would be great for beards also.  What did disappoint me was the battery life.  I only got to use it 5 times after inserting a brand new AA battery before the trimmer was dead.  Considering what a small amount of it time the power trimmer is turned on, I think the battery should last a long time.  I like its compact size but maybe 2 batteries would give it more power and a longer battery life.</li>
    <li> I used the fusion proglide styler as soon as I got it from Buzz agent. I use it in the shower and its water resistant a definite plus. It uses disposable razors and batteries which is a good thing, so it can be reused for a really long time. The guards were easy to change and it gave a close trim. Perhaps an extra guard that is one size longer.</li>
    <li> So I received my Gillette Proglide Styler about four weeks ago from Gillette themselves. And having spent about a month using it I have to say I don&#x27;t see myself changing anytime soon. To be perfectly honest I have been a fan of the Gillette trimmer line since I started shaving. But this one so far has taken the cake! It comes in this nifty plastic case doesn&#x27;t make it feel cheap. Not only do you get the Gillette quality that we all know and love(certainly I do!). But this little guy is packed with a lot in its little display case. It comes with one trimmer, a five blade razor head, 3 combs(for trimming). It is water resistant. All combs are attachable and come in 3 different sizes which are nice for the ones who like the clean cut look or somewhat of a messy look. I love this thing; I don&#x27;t feel bad leaving this trimmer on the sink since it comes in its own storage stand. Doesn&#x27;t look cheap or messy. All in all I have recommended this razor to all the males in my family and no one so far has had anything negative to say. So if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive all in one razor/trimmer I say your first stop should be the Gillette Proglide Styler.</li>
    <li> I was recently provided the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler as part of a program run by Gillette. I have owned several trimmers that are able to shave and trim but for me, this product does both better than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend about 70% of my weeks on the road for work, and that means a lot of time living out of luggage. Any time I can save some space and make it easier to pack things I get excited. This styler appealed to me instantly because I wouldn&#x27;t need to pack the handle to my Pro Glide, and it was more compact than the electric trimmer I usually pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a user of the Pro Glide products, I was already familiar with the cartridges and how effective thay are for close shaving. They work well on the face or off the face... I&#x27;ll post a more detailed review of the cartridges in that product area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric styler is pretty foolproof and is great for the things it is designed to do. Bear in mind that there are limited guards and you do not have infinite adjustment like you would find with some other options, but if the size you need is included, you will be all set. For me, I use the large guard for my goatee and sideburns, and the straight trimmer to edge my lines and make sure my moustache is trimmed around my lips. I&#x27;ve done the maintenance on my facial hair about a half dozen times so far and the battery is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery option is another thing to take note of. I pack a couple of spare batteries for my gadgets and stuff anyways so being able to pop out an old battery and swap in a new one to keep on going is appealing to me. No waiting for a charge, and never need to worry about a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the storage solution that comes with the styler, because it hasn&#x27;t been used. I tossedthe styler into my toiletry bag and it hasn&#x27;t come out since... but it has been to three countries :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought for the price advertised that an extra battery or cartridge would have been nice. You can get battery trimmers for around the same quality but a little cheaper. I will suggest this product to my friends though, since it combines two essential products most men rely on regularly and you really do get best of both worlds... the closeness of a real razor without screens or foils, and the horsepower of an electric trimmer in a compact package.You can get battery trimmers for around the same quality but a little cheaper.

    <li> This product was provided via a program run by Gillette.  It is a definite purchase item for any guy.  I loved the look of it and the feel of it.  It fits well in your hand and gives you the control that is needed.  It might not have all the power in the world but it definitely has enough power to do anything it was designed to cut.  The holder that comes with works well. It is not a huge ugly thing that sits on you counter.  It looks stylish and is functional with it&#x27;s storage of the items.</li>
    <li> I was able to try The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillete.It is the perfect trimmer with a shave attachment.It glides effortlessly over my thick facial hair and allows me to really style my hair.It comes with the trimmer,battery,shaving attachment,3 different comb attachments,and a nice organizer.I would definitely recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer.</li>
    <li> My husband used to spend more money on his hair than me until he got this product. He&#x27;s able to give himself nice lines on his facial hair with this product. He can detail his goatee and sideburns with crisp sharp lines.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  Received product free through Gillette, and have to say, I am very impressed.  Having a goatee, it&#x27;s nice to have a product that can provide so many different styles.  What is especially nice, is there are three different blade size attachments that allow you to trim very close, or leave room for the grown out look with a clean look.  No need to go to barber, everything I need is in my bathroom with the Gillette fusion proglide 3 in 1 styler.</li>
    <li> This was a really good design. With the trimmers you can pretty much trim all your hair. I love Gilettee products becaue the last forever</li>
    <li> My experience with the free GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER from Gellette was good and bad.&lt;br /&gt;First, it is a really great shaver. Cuts really close and the blades last long.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the trimmer to me was short lived.. The batteries dont last long and the trimmer over all is not as good as it says. The trimmer requires me to pass over cut areas more than once and attachments are not user friendly..&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I have ever used.  It works great for shaving and grooming.  I received the razor free in a program provided by Gillette.  The only issue that would cause me any concern is the initial price of purchase, but based on the performance, I would definitely spend the money.</li>
    <li> I received a new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a trial program run by Gillette.  I was excited as my trimmer is getting a little long in the tooth and probably needs replacing.  The pros are waterproof and small trimmer head is easy to maneuver.  The cons are a little more lengthy..... A non rechargeable battery, trimmer although sleek didn&#x27;t actually trim through my facial hair, manscaping performance was a little better, but no where near what a real trimmer can do.  I use the fusion razor religiously, but am sorely disappointed with this product.  My facial hair is not very think and I could not trim it evenly with this product.  I would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program from Gillette. My preference is to keep a beard but maintenance can sometimes become a burden. This trimmer has really helped me keep my beard well groomed and offers a high degree of flexibility. The small form factor makes the trimmer easy to maneuver and fits conveniently in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 3 different comb attachments to control beard length. Each can be snapped on or off as needed. The storage base even has compartments for each to keep them close at hand. The trimmer can also be used without combs to trim down to the skin level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer to be enjoyable and easy to use. Its overall design is very user friendly and it belongs in every man&#x27;s medicine cabinet. This is a well made product and will be used extensively by me in the future.</li>
    <li> This razor was made available to me for free in a program run by Gillette. I was skeptical of small trimmers like this, not seeing much value or practicality. It turned out to be a handy little tool, the highlight being several different attachments you can place on it. I enjoyed using the razor attachment with the power trimmer to make my shave slightly smoother. First time trying a blade that vibrated. Quality wise, this product is sound. As with a lot of Gillette products, my only complaint is in regards to price - though it is not far from the status quo. A sound product.</li>
    <li> This is the first kit that has let me use a manual razor without keeping the electric one around for trimming. It&#x27;s easy cleaning, just pop the top open and spray with water. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap so it&#x27;s not too shabby sitting there on the bathroom counter, and the little storage stand/caddy isn&#x27;t a crappy gimmick. In fact, the section for the razor attachment even has a small hole cut out so you can put the razor away without messing up the lubrication stripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the size of this would make it awkward to hold and use, but i actually feel i have a better grip on it than the pencil-thin razor handles you usually get. I&#x27;ll put a more in-depth review of the razor in the cartridges product listing, but in short i can&#x27;t complain. The single \\&quot;precision\\&quot; blade on the back of the cartridge is not the face-shredder i thought it would be and lets me get in closer than the Schick precision-mode on their Hydro 5. The 5 blades on the front clog easy with hair and at first were hard to clean until i thought to blast hot water from the back. The precision blade can be a bit rough to clean though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because the only thing that would disappoint me is if the expensive blades don&#x27;t last long, but that will be reflected in their own review. This product fits its niche well and if you get it knowing that instead of thinking you&#x27;ve found a way to \\&quot;beat the system\\&quot; with an inexpensive product, you&#x27;ll be just as happy as i am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit was given to me free because of a promotion that Gillette put on!</li>
    <li> I was recently provided the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette and, I do not think this is overstating it, I have never been more impressed by a razon/styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the packaging and presentation of the Styler passed the look test as soon as I saw the package and most importantly, the performance was fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am certainly a man who has no shortage of \\&quot;contours\\&quot; or hair and the Trimmer was a perfect fit to keep me trimmed and maintained consistently and easily.  The fact that I could also use the trimmer in the shower was a tremendous time saver and efficiency builder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit hesitant to use the Trimmer in the shower initially, but after my first time I am certainly a converter to this method of \\&quot;manscaping.\\&quot;  I guess I did not realize that the Trimmer had regular batteries (not a chargeable unit), but after some use this minor suprise proved to be a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly impressed and would definitely recommend the use of this Trimmer.</li>
    <li> Even before i received my GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER in the mail for free via a program run by Gillette I knew I would love it. I had looked it up and reviewed it on the Gillette website and knew it was everything I wanted in styler.&lt;br /&gt;It was so easy to handle and comfortable to hold. I always do my shaving and trimming in the shower so this was perfect for me, No slips, nicks, or cuts and it was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are trying to get a clean shave or just a trim this is a great product to use</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.  My 5 year old son and I have matching buzz cuts that I do at home.  This is a ritual every 2 weeks and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is great for trimming sideburns and our neck line.  I use larger clippers to cut the majority of his hair but the noise and vibration makes him nervous close to his face so this trimmer is perfect.  Oh and did I mention I got this razor free because it was and provided by a program run by Gillette. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> I really like this razor and the attachments are easy to put on and take off. It gives me a real close shave and it lasts for almost a week. I only have one drawback in that it is very hard to clean the small hairs out of it. The main part will not open far enough to clean it unless I am missing something. But other than that I really enjoy my new razor system.</li>
    <li> I receive the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 Styler from a program being conducted by Gillette. I have quite course and dense facial hair so I was a bit skeptical at first. Over the years, I have tried most razors and trimmers on the market, some with better results than others. After using the Fusion Proglide, I am very satisfied. I get a wonderful smooth shave, which pleases me as well as my wife. The thin blades glide over the skin and stubble nicely, the handle is a perfect size which makes it easy to get a closer shave. I especially like the trimming feature. It is powerful enough to get the job done, yet, easy to use and makes sharp distinct lines. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Posting from my wife&#x27;s Amazon account: The Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-in-1 styler packs a punch.  It&#x27;s great for quick trims and lasts for long periods of time on the road, making it a great item to take along on business trips.  I wish I could get a closer shave with it, but as a trimmer it works great.</li>
    <li> I have a beard that is thick this item is not good for thick beards. It gets bogged down when trimming. Does a great job for getting a clean edge. The combs are far to short for my style of beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many but all fail to even come close to what this can produce. My next option will have to be a larger hair type clippers, to get the results I am looking for. I would suggest anyone with a beard that is thick to look for more powerful clippers!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month, and since then it&#x27;s my best friend, because is so good with my hair, i used for shave my head, face, underarm,and other, and let skin so smooth and has a gentle touch, other never done what this GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER PACH, has done, definitely recommended</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a Gillette campaign. I believe it has great balance and I have not experienced any razor burn. My sideburns are easily trimmed while shaping around my mouth is pretty quick and painless. The handle is not cheap plastic like I expected, but has a nice feel to it. I personally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a All in One tool that every man must have. I got this product from a program run by Gillette and I am very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Trimmer is powerful&lt;br /&gt;b) The Blades are awesome&lt;br /&gt;c) The lubricating strip for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette. I have since used the trimmer several times and am overall satisfied with it&#x27;s results but not blow away. It is a handy little trimmer and a good value for the price I have seen it listed at. While it is a good value, it is just that, it will not provide the results expected of more expensive top of the line trimmers. The most issue I have had with the trimmer is it needs to be cleaned out multiple times during use.</li>
    <li> While I received the razor via a Gillette program, I was surprised how well this little unit performed for the price point. It does a decent job of trimming, though its small size prevents it from doing large areas at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a nice appearance and feel, with some padded grip areas in the right places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with three attachable combs of different lengths, allowing you to groom facial hair to various lengths. They are not as convenient or adjustable as some more expensive trimmers I have used with one, dial-adjustable comb, but the three give you some level of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic stand holds the various attachments, but they can (and often do) fall out of their assigned locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the folks at Gillette should be including a travel bag with this unit and marketing it as a travel accessory instead of a full-use trimmer. It is a perfect size for this kind of use, and includes the standard razor head attachment so you can use it every day while on the road.</li>
    <li> First things first i have never been a fan of gillette, when i received this product free by a program ran by gillette id thought id try it out. I had nothing to lose since it was free. After a couple uses i really enjoyed shaving with it. The body hair trimmer made it an ease to shave my chest hair. No razor bumps. Over all i really liked it. I will be using this product as long as it sold in stores.</li>
    <li> wow gotta say im pretty immpressed with this proglider, i got this item free through a program of Gillette, best ever, i have a goatee so having the razor, and the trimmers really help out to groom myself i dotn have to keep jumping back an forth with items all i have to do is change the cartridge from razor to trimmer. the razor really gives a fine shave clean an no bumps or burns, and the trimmer is strong my goatee grows fast and thick an this trimmer really does the job well. very immpressed.</li>
    <li> I got a free Gillette fusion proglide 3-in-1 styler from a program run by Gillette. I would say this is one of my top stylers, I have tried other ones but I like this one the best. It is easy to use. I was kinda thinking this maybe like the rest but after trying it I will stay with this one. Thanks for letting me try this out and I this everyone should give it a try becouse it does work really well.</li>
    <li> First off, I received the Fusion Proglide Styler free from a program run by Gillette.The Styler is very sleek looking with its blue and black color combination.After picking up the styler for the first time,it seemed a little heavier than the other trimmer I had been using,but you can tell by the feel of this one..that it is made way better.I use it to trim my sideburns and keep my mustache in check.The best feature that I like is the styler comes with a blade attachment which is attached to the trimmer very easily once you read the instructions.My first thought was this new blade from gillette can&#x27;t be any different from the others I had been using, but I was definitely wrong.It shaves so close and does NOT irritate my skin at all,another nice thing about the blades is that they don&#x27;t get plugged up with hair as easily as my old one.The hair rinses out real easily when you let the water flow into the back of the blades and run out the front... no more banging the blades on the sink trying to dislodge the hair in them.Oops I almost forgot to mention the whole styler is waterproof.That&#x27;s right, you can trim and shave in the shower with no fear of ruining the trimmer/razor.Gillette has made a believer out of me with the Fusion ProGlide system and it has become the only razor I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> This product works really good. I have used it every other day since i have got it. I have even cut my hair with it twice since i have had it. I would tell everyone to get one.</li>
    <li> I recently received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler from Gillette. It is a fantanstic product that allows you to do all of the man grooming that you need to do. The shaving heads are quick to change, so its easy to go from shaver to trimmer to styler. I like how I am able to still use all of the blades from Gillette proglide razor with the styler. Most companies would change the blades so that they could make you buy more blades to replace the ones you already have. Great product overall and will continue to use it until it dies.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be given this product free as part of a promotion run by Gillette. I&#x27;ve used the manual Fusion razor for quite a while, and always though the idea of a \\&quot;powered\\&quot; manual was silly. Well, this is a little different than the regular Fusion Power as it also has multiple facial hair trimmers. I&#x27;ve used it primarily as a razor, but have tried some of the various trimming heads. I was incredibly happy with the shave this product provided - much closer than my manual. It also appeared to cause less irritation when compared to the manual Fusion. The one complaint I would have is that the razor heads need replacing very quickly. They claim that when the lubricant strip turns white, it&#x27;t time to change heads. Well, I made it though about 8-10 shaves before the strip turned white. I&#x27;ve continued using the same head, but the shave is noticeably less comfortable.</li>
    <li> When I tried this product I was skeptical at firsts because of the small size of the trimmer. I must tell you though it did a great job on trimming my beard and side burns.  I can not blame the product for my inexperience on shaping my beard (as I just started growing my beard a week and a half before trying the product.) It was powerful and sharp enough to do a great job.  The razor itself did an awesome job as well. I have been a die hard Mach3 user up until trying this product, I have now told my wife I prefer this razor over the other. My only complaint is the battery died within 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Really good shave. Versatile tool to have in your bathroom. Close shave that last longer with low irritation.It is great for sideburns and line up. Comfortable grip and it comes with 3 clippers clips. I would defianetly continue to buy the refills. Great product.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer is awesome!  I keep a goatee and before this product I would have to shave my  my face with my old faithful Gillette Mach3 and then touch up and edge up my goatee with a separate electric trimer.  Now I can shave, trim, and edge all with the same product.  Great product and save me a ton of space on my bathroom couter to boot!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from a program provided by Gillette...and I will never switch razor&#x27;s again! I love that this razor has the three in one system for more hard to reach places or a quick trim. I get razor burn often when I use a regular razor at times but with this razor not razor burn at all. I also grow a goatee so I like to use the trimmer part the leave the length the way I like it. I would recommend this razor to everyone! Even the ladies my girlfriend tried to steal mine so I had to go buy her, her own and she loves hers just as much as I love mine! Order this razor guys, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I just tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide styler and it works great. It gave me a nice clean shave and I didn&#x27;t have to go back over it. The blades are smooth and glide across your face gently without any knicks. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler gave me the professional look I was hoping for. Got it free from Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received this from a program run by Gillette to test out.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it would be all that great because I don&#x27;t have a beard.  However I found that this thing is great for any trim job one needs.  I seem to have a lot of hair that grows where is shouldn&#x27;t and this Gillette fusion proglide styler prower trimmer helps to keep everything under control.  I use it to trim my slowly encroaching unibrow as well as keep my eyebrows under control.  I also use it to trim the hair growing on my ears which is great because I used to try and pull them which was a pain.  It also works great for trimming my hair. The best part is you can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide Styler for free through a Gillette program and I&#x27;ve been able to spend the last 2 weeks with it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have very fast growing facial hair so I found myself mostly taking advantage of the razor rather than the trimmer. It was a very smooth and pain-free shave but admittedly not the closest shave I&#x27;ve had with other simpler razors.&lt;br /&gt;I used the trimmer without a head for a bit of man-scaping and found it easy and fast. One of my biggest problems with man-scaping is the tedious task of constantly clearing the hair off of the razor but it was almost instantaneous with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it every day so far and haven&#x27;t run into any battery problems (and it comes supplied with the necessary batteries as well).</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer free as part of a program Gillette was running. After it came in the mail it sat on my sink for several days, glaring at me. Glaring at my stubble and other body hair. Glaring, I say! By the fourth day I&#x27;d had enough of its incessant taunting so I picked it up, pushed the power button, placed it against my quivering beard and began my body hair-taming renaissance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For such a small device this baby sure has some good cutting power. In the past when using other trimmers my facial hair would get stuck and instead of trimming it would simply pull the hairs out by force. Not good. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler worked exactly as intended. The razor blade attachment glided smoothly and left my sensitive skin not nearly as razor burnt as the current razor I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Though this may not be perfect it worked perfectly for me and filled the niche in my grooming routine that I didn&#x27;t know I had been missing.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler is great for someone with a mustache or a beard. I received the free razor from a program run by Gillette. I thought the design was well thought out. All the attachments can be placed in a convenient holder. The trimmer worked well it cut fast and efficiently. The shaving attachments worked well. I liked the verity this package offered. The razor blade worked well the first time I used it. The second time, however, I went to shave my face and the razor was scratching me. I looked at the razor and the moisturizing strip on the razor had melted together forming a hard plastic tag that made the razor basically unusable. I did like the Gillette Fusion I think it&#x27;s a great tool to have. I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler, from Gillette.  I use it to style my beard and trim around the edges.  The handle is very comfortable and easy to use and sized right for almost anyone&#x27;s hand.  I used to use scissors to style my beard.  Now I don&#x27;t think I could go back.  I keep my beard a little longer than the beard attachments so I&#x27;m still working ways to adapt it to my length of beard, but I love the way it cuts. Longer comb attachments would be a great addition. Thanks for the opportunity to test drive this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler and Power Trimmer to try from Gillette, I have used the trimmer to trim only.  I have used the attachments to even cut my hair on my head, creating a smooth transition from my beard to my head.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have to be clean shaven for my career, I only get a chance to use the trimmer on the weekends.  With that said, I have used the attachments for the trimmer only, BUT I am looking forward to attaching the razor also to shave with.  This would be a great tool for anyone looking to keep their neck trimmed up and your cheeks while mainting a bearded look on your face.  Between the trimmer and the razor, this is a one-stop-shop tool that any man shoud have in their toiletry area.  It eliminates bulky handheld trimmers or other trimmers that come with attachmentes, but no razor...this one has it all!&lt;br /&gt;This weekend I am going to use the razor instead of my Gillette Power ProGlide razor.&lt;br /&gt;I will follow-up next week with more insite.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Styler from a free promotion from Gillette. I began to use the product and was extremely pleased with the results. Its great for cleaning up beards and facial hair. The three different size guides make the trimmer great for any length. Without the attachments the trimmer is great to get hard to reach places like the back of the neck. I have only good things to say about this product and can see myself using it for a very long, well styled, time. Thanks Gillette for letting me try a great product for free!!</li>
    <li> The ProGlide Styler is GREAT for detailing. It cuts sideburns very fast and easy. The attachments are kinda difficult to get used to. Once I was able to figure out the attachments it was easy to manscape with ease. If your looking to detail your self this is a good buy. If your looking for a haircut, go to a barber. I got this product through a promotion from Gillette, but would definitely  recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got the razor via a Gillette campaign a month or so ago and since then have used it a few times but honestly have only found the detail trimmer to be very useful. That said, I&#x27;m fairly old school when it comes to shaving. I use a butterfly hinged safety razor and disposable blades, which are tricky to use but I think my pride would never allow me to turn back now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detail trimmer really is handy, well designed and compact so if you&#x27;re looking for something along those lines, this is definitely a good one. The other two features of the 3-in-one however, they seem more like a gimmick than anything else.</li>
    <li> My wife was always complaining about the hairs that seem to have been popping up lately in my nose and ears but I couldn&#x27;t find a good way of grooming then. I also had long eyebrow hairs that were always extremely noticeable. My only way off taking care of those was plucking and that was always awful. I never really wanted to groom them because I was afraid of looking too groomed. With my new Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler I can get all the those pesky nose and ear hairs with ease and I don&#x27;t hear any complaints from my wife. As for my eyebrows with the long attachment I can easily take care of them without looking overly groomed. I have seriously never looked better! Thanks to Gillette for allowing me to try it free as part of one of their programs!</li>
    <li> Ive tried a few much more expensive trimmers and this one works better for a fraction of the cost. Also the battery life is awesome,  and if it dies just change the battery and you&#x27;re back on your way.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free through a promotion sponsored by Gillette.  I was pleasantly surprised to see all of the attachments that came along with it.  The styler worked great as a trimmer, with plenty of power compared to a Remington trimmer I had been using, which seemed sluggish at times when the hairs would get caught in the blades.  No such issues with the Gillette FPS.  It left a nice even trim on my goatee, sideburns and mustache.  The handle was comfortable and feels sturdy.  I really like the stand that came with it to hold the different attachments.  Our counter space is limited, and it is nice to have a place for all the pieces.  Having tried the product I think that it is a good value for the price.  My only reason for 4 stars is the razor blade attachment, which for me, I had trouble putting on and off and just feels awkward while shaving, however it still does a nice job.</li>
    <li> The overall trimming quality is good, but the clipper width is very short so it takes more passes than I&#x27;d like.  The worst part of this is that the battery life is exceedingly short.  I get maybe 2 uses out of it before I have to replace the battery - that&#x27;s not ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to use very quickly for small areas - go for it, otherwise I&#x27;d try to find something with a rechargeable battery.</li>
    <li> This is great razor that I was able to use without the aid of shaving cream.  I primarily don&#x27;t shave with cream, but have had many problems with other razors.  This razor provided to cuts and a smooth finish.  I will continue to use Gillette razors always!!!</li>
    <li> I am completely happy with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. I received the free razor from a program run by Gillette. First of all the Trimmer is made pretty sturdy. The handle is comfortable enough for trimming up even the biggest of jobs without hurting your hand. And what I liked about it is it&#x27;s not too loud. That way I can shave without waking up my wife and kids. And it&#x27;s waterproof so I can shave in the shower without having to clean up that big mess all over the sink. The trimmer works great! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack is really close to the perfect trimmer. The trimmer works incredibly fast and offers standard length settings. Can be lugged into and out of the shower and is super easy to clean. I received the Proglide 3-In-1 Styler free from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a bit of trouble changing out the different guards, but that&#x27;s probably my fault. The battery life was a little weak, and no indicator as to how much battery is left or whether performance is being effected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things work exactly how you would expect. What else could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer free as part of a promotional program run by Gillette, and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s a great and handy little trimmer for keeping my beard well groomed and in check, and there was no pulling like I&#x27;ve found with other trimmers. Everything was quick and easy. The plastic guards are a little flimsy feeling, but they haven&#x27;t broken yet and have done their job well, just may be worth being a little careful with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend it. Great product, easy to use, and does the job well.</li>
    <li> This is really good for clean up&#x27;s between barber visits. I was able to touch up using this. The handle has a good rubbery grip so it&#x27;s easier to hold than my regular trimmer. It cleans up easily. I used the small trimmer. The blades are very sharp also. I can&#x27;t say it replaces a trip, but you can go longer in between visits. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I think this has the best razors on the planet!  the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.  What was good about the power trimmer was its precision. Nothing was bad about it after using it!</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a great job trimming facial hair, maneuvering around the contours of my face easily.  I like the fact that it has 3 guards to choose from, giving me the ability to really customize my look.  It comes in a very compact case that keep the guards and trimmer stored away - looks nice on the counter, not taking up much space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Styler to test for free from a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free from Gillette through a program they were running.  I have used the Fusion razors before so I was used to the great shave I get from them.  I have a goatee that I like to keep trimmed up and have waited until I go to the barber to get cleaned up.  Now I dont have to wait as the Power trimmer cleans me up great!  The trimmer and attatchments are very easy to use and give me a nicely groomed appearance.  Having all the tools in one unit make this product very convenient and a great space saver especially for travel.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best all around trimmers I have used. The razor takes some getting used to with the larger handle. The trimmer cuts smooth with no snags. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an easy one stop hygiene solution.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free through a program run by Gillette. First of all, I really liked how it came with different sized combs to get the cut just the length I wanted it. I liked to be able to trim my chest hair short instead of shaving it all the way off. Didn&#x27;t have the painful regrowth from a close shave and my girlfriend was happy that it wasn&#x27;t super long. It was nice to be able to use this in the shower so I didn&#x27;t get the hair all over my floor and counter. Overall I really liked this product and would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Well I began with the [[ASIN:B003KWO3UI Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual 1 Up Razor]], then moved up to the [[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package]], then went out the other day and got this Styler. Not only can you use the same cartridges which snap onto the top, but the power shaving is phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun trimmer has three snap-on combs (for hair lengths) as well as just using the trimmer alone for around the ears and sideburns. Plus you can pop on the proglide razor using the included special attachment to shave as well. After using the [[ASIN:B006DR2BO2 Schick Hydro 5 Power Select Razor]], I had more razor cuts than I&#x27;ve seen since I was a teenager. This was a new razor, a new cartridge, and the Schick left me bleeding in three places. That has NEVER happened with a Gillette razor product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, it is a bit larger than a typical razor, but it&#x27;s hardly heavy or cumbersome. I would not use the trimmer for cutting large swaths of hair as it&#x27;s not intended for that. Beards, mustaches, short and curlies, and ears are all perfect for this trimmer. Anyone who&#x27;s every gotten a haircut will recognize the trimmer for what it is: cleaning up around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, for the price you pay, the fact that the whole shebang is waterproof, and it&#x27;s easy to manipulate, is backward compatible with fusion cartridges, makes this purchase a no-brainer. I got mine at CVS and paid much more than what it sells for on Amazon, so if I ever need another one I&#x27;ll be getting it here. I&#x27;m just unhappy it doesn&#x27;t have an attachment for nose hair!</li>
    <li> This is truly a neat little gadget, especially when all you need is a few hairs trimmed here and there.  I have thin hair and really just need some trimming every other month.  This does the trick.  Thank you Gillette for allowing me to try this through your free give away!</li>
    <li> It just stopped working one day. I guess i will need to find other ways to win over Kate Upton.</li>
    <li> The free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was provided via a program run by Gillette. Here is a list of the Pros and Cons: PROS- sleek design, easy interchangable heads, four precision blades, easy to rinse out, trimmer styled my soul patch well, razor attachment shaved head and chest well. CONS- needs better storage for attachments, doesn&#x27;t fully release hairs from four blades (could use a press like on other blades), unsure about battery life (used it daily for 4 weeks and still is going strong). Overall, a solid product.</li>
    <li> I love this styler. It gives me everything I need to take control of my face. I keep a beard and it can go from neat and trimmed to an unruly mess rather quickly. I keep this by the sink at all times and it can do what I need to keep up with my beard. I work sales so I have to be very image conscious and don&#x27;t always have time to run to the barber for a professional trim, but now I can handle it myself and save the money. I was able to get a free sample of it through a promotion Gillette had but between you and me I was about to get one anyway. Instead I purchased one for my dad for Fathers Day.</li>
    <li> I really loved the way this product worked. I would recommend it to all of my friends and family. My wife told me that I looked amazing after the shave. She really loves when I shave she does like me to have a beard or a mustache. Thank you Gillette for the amazing freebie.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to start using my provide 3-in 1 styler when I first received it. First of all, I was impressed with the style of the product and how cool,it looked! It contained a holder for the trimmer as well as all the attachments which was pretty nice. I like to stay organized and that was very helpful to me.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend was able to keep my haircut looking fresh by using the trimmer to clean up hair growth on my neck and behind my ears. As far as the razor goes, however, I was a little disappointed. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my face to begin with but after I used the blade a few times, it became very dull.  If I was tending tomamfull grown beard and mustache everyday, I would understand but I only shave once every two or three days and it did not hold up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the product though.  I love the variety of uses I can get from this one product.  It saves me money and time which I like as well.  I would definetly reccomnend this 3-in1 styler to other dudes who need to do a lot in a little amount of time and on a budget.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide trimmer for free via a program run by Gillette and it was just what I was looking for.  So easy to use and it was exactly what I was looking for.  Great product for someone like me who is always busy and needs a quick trim and/or shave on the go.</li>
    <li> I received a free styling blade in the mail by Gillette to test out their product. So far I love this blade. It trims hard to trim spots that you are unable to carve out with a regular razor. It also works in the shower. A blade also attaches to the tip for a close shave. In my opinion it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Got a free razor as part of a special program put on by Gillette. I would recommend purchasing this item to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;&gt; Nice stylish packaging. Catches the eye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;&gt; Size &amp; weight are just right for a styler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;&gt; Trimmer was easy to use for trimming my beard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;&gt; Operating noise was reasonable for this type device&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;&gt; Instructions were not clear about whether the trimmer already had one head installed.</li>
    <li> I received this razor was sent to me from a program run by Gillette.The three exchangeable combs that adapt to the contours of your body to keep the length you want were very helpful. The blades work very nice and don&#x27;t leave razor burn on my tender face. This uses a single AA battery that has enough power to the trimmer, which allows you to trim and shave yourself. The battery life, I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer everyday for the past month and the trimmer is still running strong. You can trim around your mustache and goatee with ease.It is even great for your sideburns when cleaning them up.This razor even comes with a plastic case for storage for the razor and the 3 attachment.I definitely would recommend this razor for the price and comfort and ease of use.</li>
    <li> I am always presently surprised by the quality vs cost that Gillette offers its customers. I was overall very pleased with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler that I received free from a program run by Gillette. First off it comes with my favorite blade and the little storage stand helps keep all the little pieces organized and keep the bathroom looking nice. In fact, the section for the razor attachment even has a small hole cut out so you can put the razor away without messing up the lubrication stripe. I love that it&#x27;s water proof for use in the shower and that it includes 3 different style \\&quot;combs\\&quot; to attach to the shaver so you can style your side burns, beard, mustache, anything else you&#x27;d want to trim. The trimmer works great and my face is always looking sharp!</li>
    <li> I received the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler from a promotional program from Gillette. The handle is bigger than your traditional razor and smaller than most  trimmers but its multipurpose use and interchangeable trimmer lengths make it a great addition for grooming.  I was pleasantly surprised at the closeness of the shave and how smooth my skin felt.  Over the last two weeks I do not have any  razor marks, bumps or irritation.  The blades last much longer than I expected.  I would recommend the Fusion ProGlide Styler.</li>
    <li> This product from Gillette is fantastic - whether you casually shave off facial hair or are interested in grooming a certain style, the combination of this pack allows you to achieve whatever you wish. Different combs allow customizable lengths, while the trimmer is very helpful in shaving a moustache. A great choice for anybody looking for a convenient and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> received this razor through a program run by Gillette and I am glad I received this gift. First off I loved the packaging and how it all came in a handy stand. Most groomers end up laying in a draw. The Fusion Proglide stands and keeps the razor upright. This is important as the lube strips do not stick to the draw. I used the razor after not shaving for a few days, this is always a challenge and I end up with sore skin. The razor was smooth and the vibrating helped massage my skin. The shave was clean and smooth, no irritation. Included in the kit was a groomer with different guards for cutting side burns and other hair. It was great helped keep my side burns in check, was also easy to clean rinsing under the water. After using this for a week now I am very impressed, would recommend the product and will be purchasing new blades, not making it a victim of the razor grave yard in my draw,</li>
    <li> I had recieve the new Gillette Fusion style trimmer I can say its has a really nice set of blades, combos, and trimmer. I used the trimmer about four times a week to keep the fine trim. It doesn&#x27;t pull snug or grab while you are trimming. It is less time comsuming then ordinary clippers that you buy for a cheap price. I recieve the trimmer style from a promotion that I enter in. I recommend for guys to take out the time to go buy the Gillette fusion style trimmer and see what is like with a new face.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler is a bit pricey but I would recommend them to anyone. They give a great close shave &amp; the blades don&#x27;t get dull as quickly as most razors I&#x27;ve tried.For a good shave, wash skin before shaving, then hold a HOT towel to the hair/skin area you&#x27;re about to shave. That will soften the hair and open the pores.let&#x27;s start with the fact that it uses pro-glide fusion disposable cartridges, how amazing is that? The cartridge snaps right onto the top of the styler, and with the press of the on button, it vibrates just as well, if not better than the standard power handles on the disposable shavers.The handle is nicely molded, very clean look and provides maximum grip. The black is actually soft rubber, not hard plastic, so you won&#x27;t find yourself dropping the styler or having it slip out of your palms. The power button is very small, but easy to press to turn the shaver on and off, the LED light is also nice and not blinding. also Using cold water on the area after shaving will close the pores more quickly and help avoid razor bumps and dirty pores, i also received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for FREE via a program run by Gillette. :)</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Styler for free via a program from Gillette. It is average for some basic grooming but I don&#x27;t see it replaced my other grooming tools, but supplementing them.&lt;br /&gt;The design is good, it fits in your hand well. It is great for trimming around facial hair but for a battery operated shaver its not powerful enough for anything thicker than a few day old stubble.</li>
    <li> I got this as a bzzagent campaign and love it. It was easy to use and doesn&#x27;t weigh much. It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair and has a great battery life.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is probably one of the best ones I have ever found. Used it about 4 or 5 times now. I started out with insane beard (my girlfriend was calling me a lumberjack), but once I was done using this trimmer after the first time, I was able to perfectly shape how I wanted my facial hair to be. And keeping in that way is super easy.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product via a program run by Gillette. I was hesitant at first to try this product since it looked too bulky and the attachments seemed useless. Then I found that the product was a great innovation that took care of multiple shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked most about the product is the the thick, strong handle. I prefer this one to the narrow handles that shavers usually have. It allows me to have more of a strong grip for, ironically, the spots on my face where I need to be more gentle. The attachments are also useful when I don&#x27;t want a full shave but a small trim. Especially when I do the sideburns. I no longer have to use multiple products for my facial routines. All-in-one products are the way to go these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about this product is the buzzer feature. When I put razor guard attachment, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could use it with the buzzer on. It problem was my fault for not reading the instructions careful but it seemed like the button can be turned on for all attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a good product for men&#x27;s facial needs. The price may be a bit much but considering it does a lot, you save by not needing to buy multiple shavers.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free through a program run by Gillette and I was very excited to try it out. It was very neat and I like how it came with removable parts.I shaved, and it left my face smooth, and I used the trimmer which worked perfectly. The only problem I had with it is that it says that it&#x27;s shower safe, which it is, but after a few uses, it wouldn&#x27;t turn back on. I only got to use it like 3 times. I suspect it&#x27;s the battery that doesn&#x27;t work, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is great. The balance in my hand and build quality is excellent, I am able trim my hair with ease and without worry. Shaping around my ears and trimming sideburns is quick and painless. I highly recommend this product. Under $20 makes the Gillette Styler this a deal you can&#x27;t beat. The styler is cheap in price, very good quality, comes with many accessories, and it does a good job. It would make a great gift, or a gift to yourself...My trimmer was provided on a program by Gillette and I would have no hesitation purchasing myself.</li>
    <li> Good Evening,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that there have been a ton of reviews on this product recently, as I to was given a free sample by Gilette. I will start out by saying thank you and note that this may influence my review, so if it does in anyway please leave me a comment. Also, it would be great if you leave me a comment before giving me a thumbs down. Helpful comments help me, help you with better and more accurate reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without further adieu, here goes. This set is extremely well packaged. It really is. It comes in this nice almost display like casing, nothing like I have ever seen before. Gillette sure knows how to make a grand impression and for that they must be applauded. Sure, it could be environmentally destructive, but the thick plastic casing serves as the perfect travel companion. In fact, I took this razor on a trip with me packaged in the box. It arrived with no damage, whatsover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor itself, it comes with three blades for trimming and one for a nice clean shave. The three blades are a great addition and make this ordinary shaving tool really interesting. You can literally customize your beard in all different shapes and sizes. It actually does a good job with hair on your head, if you really want to give that a shot. Switching out blades is easy, just push the button and the blade tool pops out. As for the battery, I have found it doesn&#x27;t really much to enhance the trimming or the shaving, but that included functionality gives you additional customization. Much appreciated. Overall it&#x27;s great, but this brings me to the downsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major pitfall and why this ended up with a 4 stars and not a perfect five is the razor blade itself. At least, when I first saw this, I felt that it&#x27;s first and foremost a razor. Sadly that was the biggest let down for me. I have used other Gilettes and Schlicks and nothing has caused me this much itch in a shave. I was surprised and a bit stunned at what happened here. This is supposed to be the latest, yet at one point I thought I was bleeding. It&#x27;s really a bit irritating and I would much rather just use a regular razor. With that being said, I think this is important, but not a deal breaker, as everyone has different preferences. I would try this blade on a different Gillette razor and see if it works for before jumping in on this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product really is amazing. There is no getting past this that Gilette has helped to push the limits of an already overly saturated market and for that they should be applauded. It is really worth a second look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again thanks and remember comments do a lot more good than thumbs downs. Thank you for your understanding and look forward to addressing your complaints about my review.is is supposed to be the latest, yet at one point I thought I was bleeding.

    <li> To preface: this review was written by my husband, as he used the trimmer.  We share an account and he didn&#x27;t want to create a new amazon account simply to review products when he could do it from our shared one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Proglide trimmer free as part of a Gillette promotion. This product worked well for straightening sideburns. It is easy to use, trims nicely and closely and gets the job done quickly. I found it made my morning routine a lot faster, because of the efficiency of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric trimmer didn&#x27;t shave through facial hair that well, in comparison to the sideburns, but it was convenient to have the razor in the same product for facial hair. It took a little time to get used to the thick handle for shaving, because it differs from the trimmer handles to other razors, but overall I like the Proglide trimmer.  I continue using it in my daily routine, and think it&#x27;s worth a try, especially for the detailing on sideburns and other &#x27;manscaping&#x27; needs.</li>
    <li> I received the Styler free through a program run by Gillette. This was my first time using a power razor. It is a much smoother feeling shaving experience over a manual razor. For that alone, I recommended this over a manual razor. The trimmer attachments are easy to use and do a nice job at what they do. I like that the attachments are not very wide. It makes it easy to get under the arms and in my case I keep my eyebrows trimmed with it. The Styler comes with a holder to organize everything. It holds the handle nicely in the front and the blade on the top. In the back is where the comb attachments go. The wells for the combs are not very deep and in my opinion would benefit from a more sloped angle if they ever decide to redesign that. I just leave the combs sit out loose. This is not a reason for me to deduct any stars as it is just an extra piece.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trimming my facial hair with the same tools my barber uses for a few years and they work very well so my expectations for this styler were fairly low. It&#x27;s actually decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 blade razor works well and I like the edger on the back when lining up my sideburns/hairline. At first it feels a bit odd to be using a razor with such a thick handle, but it doesn&#x27;t make it unusable and just takes a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works. It just doesn&#x27;t cut as easily as other tools and has a sorta slim width which makes grooming take longer. It&#x27;s nice that the whole thing is waterproof when it comes to cleaning or if you feel the need to shave in the shower. Switching between attachments is very easy. I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times and the single AA battery is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product mostly as something handy to take with you on trips as it&#x27;s compact, battery powered, and will get the job done at a good price.</li>
    <li> I was given this product as a sample and was amazed by it. I don&#x27;t normally &#x27;&#x27;style&#x27;&#x27; my beard, but I found it very useful for trimming my sideburns and lightly trim my hair. I haven&#x27;t tried trimming any body hair with it, but I suppose it would go smoothly, given it&#x27;s power. It&#x27;s compact, but powerful.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature is that you can use the Gillette Proglide Power as a Razor, especially because of its thicker body, which makes it easier to grip while I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow.  I got this free razor via a program run by Gillette which was a great incentive to try it.  I was shocked when I came to Amazon and it was listed at $20 because it felt like this should have been a $50 package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it comes with everything you need - a razor, trimmers, battery, and even a stylish storage container to house all these guys in when I&#x27;m not using it - my girlfriend wont mind it on our shared sink since she has all her makeup everywhere already.  Another great plus was that I was previously using the Gillete Fusion Proglide Power razor and had literally just went out and bought 8 replacement razors.  If you&#x27;ve used this guy before, you know these blades are not cheap - and they worked in the Fusion Proglide! Sweet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer was amazing.  I got a little carried away with it when I got it and started trimmer my finger hair - eeewww, but it worked so well! On top of that, I used the razor to shave and it seems to give a lot better result than my previous razor with the same blades.  It came with 3 additional heads to trim any other facial hair. These are small and I was able to get a great, precise shave.  My other trimmer was large and bulky and sometimes left behind some stragglers.. ALl in all, a great product! Especially for &lt;$20!!!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was provided free via a program run by Gillette. This is the first trimmer I have used. It is lightweight, compact, and powerful enough to take care of my body hair. You can get the job done fast and the different guards provided allow you to get that perfect look that you are looking for. It has a stand so that everything is in one spot when you need it and you don&#x27;t have to go searching for parts.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette fusion proglide styler in a promotion they were doing. I have never had a better trimmer. It demolishes all of my unwanted hair and straightens up nicely any thing else I need touched up. It has several different attachments for length and also has a razor attachment for a really close and smooth shave. Not only is it small and compact it has been running strong for several weeks now on one double-a battery. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free via a program with Gillette. What I really enjoyed about this product is the versatility of being able to shave, trim or style whatever part of my body I want. The best part is that it works in the shower, which means no more hair on the bathroom floor (my wife really loves that)! I&#x27;ve used the trimmer on various parts of my body and it definitely did the job. The power trimmer is light-weight and thin, and a nice size to hold when shaving areas that a bit hard to get with other bulkier models that I&#x27;ve used in the past. The handle is ergonomic and doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands while wet. Cleaning the hair out of the razor is super easy and just takes seconds to rinse the opened trimmer door, under running water. Also, no need to charge, this trimmer is battery operated.  All components of the razor come together in a packaged case, which makes it great when on the go or traveling.  If you&#x27;re looking for a power trimmer that doesn&#x27;t break the bank and does what it promises, this is the trimmer for you.</li>
    <li> This one is really good, I tried out this free Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 styler special pack that was provided via a program run by Gillette.  Before writing this review I wanted to try it out a few times. It gives a really close, smooth shave. I like the trimmer for doing other body hair, all around this is the best shaving product I have ever used. I would definitely recommend to any family or friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had facial hair for quite a while and I&#x27;ve used plenty of beard trimmers in the past, and so far this one is my favorite. I was given this product through a Gillette promotion recently and have been using it for a few months now. Its great for all around facial trimming and does a nice even job all the way around. Other trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past made the work of art on my face patchy and uneven. Its also lightweight which makes it fairly easy to travel with, the rubber grips is a nice touch. It runs off a AA battery so it can be done on the go. Three different trim options allow various lengths, it also comes with a Proglide razor cartridge. I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor like this before so this offered a great opportunity to try it, personally I&#x27;d rather shave manually. Plenty of different options here, all around solid product. Personally I would like to see a nose hair attachement on the next one, but thats me being a guy reviewing a mans grooming product.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer free to try from a program run by Gillette at the perfect time. My hockey team is still in the playoffs, but my playoff beard was getting a little too out of hand for work. My old trimmer broke and I was looking to get a new one. The trimmer on the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler comes with three combs that are great for being able to choose different lengths. I was able to experiment with all of them to find the one that I liked the most. The handle felt very comfortable in my hands and the build quality seemed greater than the price would lead you to believe. It shaved through my several week old growth with ease and gave a nice, neat look for my beard allowing me to still keep it until the playoffs are over. It even includes a great little stand that holds the styler and all of its accessories. The only feature I wish it had that it doesn&#x27;t is a couple additional longer combs for leaving a longer beard. This trial blew away my expectations for it and it is now my go to styler and razor.</li>
    <li> Got this for free and was so surprised how well it works. The different attachments are great for shaping and styling, hence the name. Really think this is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> Lasted for years. Only had to get a new one because my ex wouldn&#x27;t clean out the hair so it wore the motor down faster. But I had it for almost 4 years before that happened.</li>
    <li> Best product for the money - allows me to skip every other barber appointment : I use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler to trim, shape, clean the lines.  So I stretch my grooming allowance by 50%!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is by far the best trimmer I have gotten. I recieved this off a promtion Gillette  was running and let me tell you, I love this item better than  my other trimmers I have used. The way it styles and cuts is nice. To think I would always pass this up at the store shocks me. I highly reccomend this to all the men out there (single or not). Its a easy way to clean up before an important event.</li>
    <li> I received this free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler via a program sponsored by Gillette in return for my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first comment that this Styler comes with 3 different size combs to give you various options on how close (or not) you want to trim. I tried all 3 to see the difference and was impressed. This works great on facial and body hair and even your eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle fits well in the palm of your hand (not too thin, another words)which allows for a good grip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this styler and will be using it quite often!</li>
    <li> Received it via a program run by Gillette and I&#x27;m really liking it thus far. Perfect for keeping your sideburns maintained, trimming your beard and shaping your mustache. It has everything.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had issues with my sideburns growing too long in between haircuts. I would try to trim them with a comb and the trimmer connected to the back of my electric razor. I actually had to end up asking my wife to help me because I couldn&#x27;t trim it evenly. So when I got this free trial from Gillette I was immediately interested. It has all the basic trimmer lengths and even has a face shaver with it. I found the holder to be very convenient to store all the parts. I simply snapped on the proper length combs and after a few times going over my side burns I was finished. Clean up was a breeze too. Since it is waterproof I just open the trimmer door and rinse out all the hairs. Quick easy trim, something I could actually do in the early morning rush of the day. It even uses a AA batter instead of having to worry about replacement batteries that cost more than the product does.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product. I liked the fact that it is all in one. Don&#x27;t have to have 50 products around to get the job done. Great shave and a great trimmer. Also like that it is from Gillette a name I trust. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of getting this razor/trimmer package as a promotional tool to help out Gillette, and unfortunately I was pretty unimpressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a goatee for 5+ years, and have used a pretty heavy duty trimmer to cut down the coarse hair on a weekly basis.  The only downfall was I have to use a comb as there are no length guides to the trimmer I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length guide was the one thing I was impressed with about the Gillette Fusion Proglide trimmer.  But I was looking for more than short - shorter - shortest lengths... (1/4\\&quot; is the longest I think??) I mean the picture on the box has a dude with a pretty lengthy &#x27;stash, and there&#x27;s no way he trimmed to that length with what was in the box...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guides aside, the power of this trimmer is pretty darn weak.  I have to go back and forth over the same area 3-4x before I can trim all of the hairs down.  The time that I thought I&#x27;d save with having the guides just turned into frustration as I went over the same area again and again until I finally used my comb/trimmer combo of old to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dunno, if you have fine straight hair that needs trimming this might be your ticket... but my burly beard needs a trimmer with more behind it to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-in-1 styler as gift, and I love it. Works great to trim my sideburns, and keep unruly hair at bay. I also used it to trim my eye brow hair and it worked wonderful.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Styler as part of a program from Gillette.  I was excited to try this product as I&#x27;ve used both Gillette and Braun and this product was a combination of both.  My first impression was that the razor/trimmer appeared to be high quality.  The trimmer has a slight heft to it with rubberized grips that allow for a secure hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the product to be adequate in \\&quot;razor mode\\&quot; (blade attached).  It was a comfortable shave but I must admit I managed to nick myself several times.  This could be because I&#x27;ve been using an electric for years and I am probably out of practice.  I found the larger handle to be a little in the way for wet shaving.  While I was able to hold it securely, the thickness of the handle felt a little awkward to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strength of this product is in the trimmer.  I found it to be excellent in trimming sideburns and any other stray hairs.  It takes a single AA battery so charging it is not an issue, and traveling is simplified.  The width of the trimmer head is perfect for small jobs but if larger scale deforestation is necessary this might not be up to the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I received this free from Gillette for review and I have to say that this is a great product for trimming and keeping your beard in check.  Also I used it to trim my side burns and the back of my head when I shave my head...great product and easy to use.  Highly recommended by me and I have lots of hair to trim...everywhere and this is the tool for that.  I really love this little trimmer and think that I will buy one for my son so he stops stealing mine.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer for free as part of a promotion from Gillette.  I have used other more expensive trimmers for grooming my facial hair; side burns, mustache, etc. and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide kept up if not out performed the others i had tried.  the guides are easy to use and do their job well, i used them mostly to maintain my sideburns in between haircuts.  The trimmer itself works quite well.  The blades cut well and quickly and the small cutter heads allow for precise trimming.  I have even been able to use the trimmer to maintain that 5 o&#x27; clock shadow look in between shaves.  I really have enjoyed my time with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide so much that it replaced the trimmer i was currently using.  This trimmer is a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Well, to start i loved the packaging and look of the trimmer. It includes a stand with spots for the tools. I like that the trimmer can be used with the razor attachment in the shower. It works well, i haven&#x27;t had an issue with it. It has 3 blades for length some people may think that isn&#x27;t enough, but I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d need any other lengths? overall a good product that I was able to receive for free through a promotion from Gillette. If i could change anything it would be the stand for the blades, they fall out easily.</li>
    <li> This product came in handy. My Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer came with a free blade from Gillette, which was a plus. It was provided through a program provided by Gillette. I have been using the phillips norelco trimmer for years. I feel this product is much better for edging and more defined work. It left my skin smooth and was very easy to use. The only drawback is, I think it should come with a nose hair trimmer. Overall though, a very solid product.</li>
    <li> I got one of these for free through a program run by Gillette, and I must say I am impressed. Does a great job trimming and shaving, its small, good for travel and at only $20 its a great bang for your buck. I will definitely be back for another one when mine wears out.</li>
    <li> The trimmer operates well.  It cuts very finely and seems to have adequate power.  I like that it can get wet to clean it.  The attachments fit well.  Overall a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received product for free via a Gillette promotion but views are my own.</li>
    <li> I was provided a free razor by a program run by Gillette, but I have been using Gillette razors for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased by this trimmer.  I love that the head opens up for easy cleaning and the different length attachments make styling easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I am slightly nitpicky about (hence the loss of a star) is how long the trimmer is one the razor attachment is connected. It takes a little bit for you to get used to the unwieldiness of the trimmer with that attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a great trimmer with great features and good grip!</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy this again. The handle is comfortable to hold. The blades work great and it is easy to switch out the tops. However, the tray that holds it all isn&#x27;t that great. I got his as a freebie from a Gillette promotion. This has to be one of the coolest little gadgets to keep in the car for a quick little fix up before a date or a meeting.</li>
    <li> I must admit that the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 styler was given to me for free through a program run by Gillette. I was skeptical at first to believe the smaller sized trimmer would be able to replace my older large trimmer (different brand). Well let me tell you. I have always liked to style my beard, gote, sideburns etc depending on the temperature, season, and or function I am attending. I spent a solid month using the 3 different styler attachments ( 1,2, and 3) I found that I am able to get a closer trim below my nose, around my ears, and also my eyebrows. While using no attachments I found the Gillette fusion power trimmer to be a great alternative to my normal bulky trimmer. The head flips up for easy cleaning. A very simple on off switch for the vibration while shaving for an even closer shave. I am pleasantly surprised with this unit, and I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Styler for free, through a program run by Gillette. I had seen it before in stores, but never purchased it before because I was skeptical if it would be a worth while product or not. Luckily it was.&lt;br /&gt;It includes a stand for the trimmer that has a spot for the attachments, and extra razors. This is great for me since I do not have a large sink area, and it only takes up a small space.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the trimmer a couple of times for general manscaping and facial upkeep. I think it works just as well as other expensive trimmers I have had in the past. I will definitely get a lot of use from this product and would recommend it. I am happy to finally have an all in one solution for my shaving and trimming needs.</li>
    <li> While there is nothing about this product that can&#x27;t be replicated with something else, there is no one other product that I have tried before that does everything as well ... that makes this a space saver as well as a time saver.  I like very much how easy it is to transition from side-burn trimming to brow trimming.  Though I do not have other facial hair that I use this on, I can see how good the functionality would be.  It is also very handy that it can be used in the shower.  Yet another time saver.  Clean up doesn&#x27;t get much easier either ... open the top and spray with water.  It&#x27;s a nice looking set too so if you leave it out vs. hiding it in a cabinet it doesn&#x27;t cheapen your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to keep in mind that this is a day-to-day grooming product.  This is not something to use to remove a full beard or shave off a full head of hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it to shave your chest the first time but it does a nice job of trimming and thinning body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the price ... you just aren&#x27;t going to beat this.  Not in quality, not in functionality, not in style/appearance/quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler free as part of a program run by Gillette.  They did not pay me for my time or my review and my opinion is a true and honest expression of my experience with the product.</li>
    <li> When I got this styler I was pretty excited. The system is looks great but I was disappointed when i starting using it.  This styler wasn&#x27;t powerful enough for what I need. I also had some problems with the attachment falling off. I never used it a second time.  The razor itself isn&#x27;t to bad.  It gives a closer shave than just using a standard razor.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor provided by a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Power Trimmer has a lot of features. Even a few that I don&#x27;t normally use.&lt;br /&gt;It feels a lot bulkier than my usual razor and it was awkward at first to use, but it didn&#x27;t take too long to get used to. The shave and trim were both smoother than anticipated. The product is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using the Trimmer, I felt like the power button was in an awkward location. I turned it on a few times without meaning to. It&#x27;s the same with disengaging the blade attachment. It was awkward using it and I had to remember to hold it a certain way. It works well in the shower, the Trimmer just rinses right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trimmer comes with a nice looking stand that holds everything it comes with. I thought this was a bonus too.</li>
    <li> I have bought more expensive shaving and trimming kits in the past, not only were they expensive but they were bulky and hard to store. The new styler proglide kit(provided for free by a program run by Gillette) from Gillette is very easy to use and to store. It all fits into the box, though not as easily as I would hope, but it is very small in comparison to others. I like how it fits in the medicine cabinet and the amount of variety that it comes with in the pack. It trims very evenly and does not pull on the hairs like others do. It is very comfortable to hold (even with wet hands) and does not suck the juice out of batteries. The head is a perfect width and maneuvers the face well.</li>
    <li> I recieved my free ProGlide trimmer as part of a program run by Gillette.  From the moment I opened it, I was impressed.  The packaging is robust enough to keep as a case for storage - important when you want to keep tabs on all the included trimming attachments.  But hey - that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3-in-1 system is ready to go right out of the box - and being powered by Braun it certainly didn&#x27;t disappoint.  The standard trimmer is great for keeping your haircut fresh - maintaining clean sideburns and trimming away neck hair.  It&#x27;s also great for keeping those eyebrows neat.  Adding any of the included height attachments is a breeze - just takes a little trial and error to find that perfect trimming length.  I found the trimmer made short order of anything I threw at it and cleanup is a snap - just run it under some warm water and put it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included ProGlide shaver attachment is nothing less than perfect.  With four blades, shaving is a dream with little to no discomfort.  Though it feels like more of an afterthought to the trimming system, it&#x27;s nice to have it available to have a shave when you&#x27;re done with everything else.  And again, the system is water resistant.. so if you like to shave in the shower (like me), you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price - every guy should have one of these in his medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> I received this pack from a Gillette promotion. Really like it but with a tough beard it was somewhat a challenge.  Everything works great needs to have a strong blade because i use it for face and head. i would recommend this item, for people that have softer beards.  This did OK on the head and worked great on chest.</li>
    <li> My Gillete Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer came in the mail a while ago and I waited to write a review because I wanted to really get a feel for the product and test it out fully.  I received the trimmer free of charge from a program that Gillete had for users to test out their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first held the trimmer, I realized it was not a flimsy product and it could withstand a small drop.  I used the trimmer without any of the included attachments because I wanted to see how easily it would give my beard a buzz cut and I must say I was pleasantly surprised!  After 2-3 passes it gave me a close shave.  After, I used the razor to get an even closer shave which did the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, the Gillete Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer was really a product and I was pleasantly surprised at how effective it was.</li>
    <li> I recently was given a Fusion ProGlide Styler by Gillette and like the product for its ease of use and portability.  The Styler worked well as long as the hair isn&#x27;t too thick that you are cutting.  I have thick hair and had to keep unclogging it when I was using the lowest setting guard.  Once I used the longest guard and worked down, it was a better cut and less clog.  If I keep up with the Styler, then it works great and is easy to use.  It comes with three length settings and a great carrying case that holds everything.  It has a sleek design and a comfortable grip with the power button easy to find while shaving.  I would have given it a five if it was a little bigger for chest and arm shaving.  It works great for neck and beard shaving.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor/trimmer!  I really like using this for my sideburns and getting those hard straight cuts clean across your face.  It&#x27;s super light weight, battery powered, great that it doesn&#x27;t have a cord.  Also it has attachments to length the cut.  It fits easy into my travel bag and I can use it everywhere.  Great razor, glad that I got one from Gillette</li>
    <li> This was a free product sent to me via Gillette program. Love this product, works amazing for many things. Love the fact that its a 3 in one product.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer to review for Gillette. I  thought I would give it a try.  I have a difficult beard - very difficult and found the Proglide Styler to be a great razor and overall is a great and versatile tool. The trimmer is well-built and easy to use.  It&#x27;s great for trimming sideburns and even the back of my neck.  The handle is larger in than a traditional razor blade and very easy to hold (it has a really nice rubber grip that helps).  The trimmer uses a single AA battery and is light weight.  The trimmer comes with 3 sets of guards for facial hair. I really like that it can be used in the shower, where I actually do most of my shaving.  Overally, this is definitely the razor I&#x27;ll be using from now on.</li>
    <li> I received this for free as part of a promotional campaign from Gillette.  This trimmer does a great job on my sideburns.  Convenient, easy to use and efficient.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillete Fusion Proglide was provided free via a program by Gillete.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the trimmer, was easy to use and run&#x27;s on a AA battery and could rinse razor under water. I don&#x27;t now if I would buy replacement blades for the razor they didn&#x27;t seem to last that long with my facial hair but the trimmer work very well</li>
    <li> I loved the way this styler has multiple attachments so my body grooming can be done with only one device. I used it daily to get a close shave and it left a smooth, clean look.  i have bought multiple razors over the past year and none were as easy to use and gave me a close shave.  I also like the good looking holder the product comes in.  There were no nicks or cuts using using this styler and I would recommend it to everyone.  Who wants multiple razors laying around your bathroom sink?  Not me- that is why this product is so great.  No bathroom clutter!!!  I reviewed this product while in a program sponsored by Gillette and the product was given to me for free.  But, my review would still be the same if I had not.  Buy it!  You will be pleased!!</li>
    <li> My husband received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free as part of a campaign run by Gillette.  He loved how easy it was to change combs and razors and was virtually painless.  Also, the product is very sturdy with great balance.  He would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> As a result of being fortunate enough to have received the Fusion Proglide Styler through a free trial campaign run by Gillette, I have been using this product for a weeks now. I actually have nothing negative to report.  I&#x27;m a 33 year old guy who has been shaving and trimming for quite a many years! Gillette usually only has superior quality, and with the Proglide Styler--tradition continues.  I get a nice and close shave when it&#x27;s time to shave, and it is a convenient tool to be able to trim my goatee on a consistent basis, which allows me to maintain a professional appearance at work.  I have just purchased a second Fusion Proglide Styler for my father as a gift.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer. It&#x27;s great for getting my tracer nice and close and straight. The only complaint I have is the holder is a little flimsy, especially the part that holds the razor blade. Other wise great Gillette product.</li>
    <li> I just received mine.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer functions pretty good (better than expected)&lt;br /&gt;The organizer is also very useful and I especially love the cartridge space on the back of the thing.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a bit fat but very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;The shave quality is very good as with other fusions.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My son loves this, he has had it over a year and still uses it all the time. Very high quality</li>
    <li> I got this product through a program run by Gillette. I did not have high expectations for this product as I have tried several other trimmers of this nature and not had good luck. The product looks somewhat cheap with the flimsy plastic attachements. I learned that looks can be deceiving. Despite what I initially thought, the power trimmer worked remarkably well. It comes with 3 length attachments which clip-on/come off quite easily. I also used the trimmer without any attachment for sideburns etc and it worked very well. This trimmer also worked in the shower with no problems! My only complaint is that I wish the trimmer itself was a bit wider because if you are trying to shave a large body part it could be a bit time intensive. All around great product for the price point.</li>
    <li> First off, the product was supplied to me free from a campaign sponsored by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle/trimmer performed well. It trimmed sideburns longer stubble well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor blades are where the proglide products really shine. Smooth is the only way to describe them. There is no tugging, or scraping my sensitive skin. Just a smooth shave for a smooth face.</li>
    <li> I received this Gillette Fusion pro glide prowler trimmer from Gillette for free for a promotional program that they had going on. So when I opened the package it was very manly looking, nice blue color. I unpacked it and picked it up it had a nice weight to it motto heaven and not to light either just right. It battery operated, it came with 3 different attachments for your needs depending on how long your hair may be. They are easily attachable, they look and feel as thought they may break easily but it has broken n me as of yet so that is a good sign. I turned it open and started using it on my face, it cut the hair easy and I was able to miniver the trimmer without any problems. The trimmer didn&#x27;t get hot to touch. It also came with this nice great stand to place your trimmer on for easy reach and access. This is great for travel too it&#x27;s not to big but it gets the job done. My son seen me using it and he is at the age where is is getting facial hair, so I thought is would also be a great tool to introduce him to the life of a mans world.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide is really good. It give me a clean shave every time and I recommend every guy to get this</li>
    <li> Everything works well. I own a fusion razor and got this because of the trimmer. The trimmer is fantastic and cuts nicely.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product through a free trial program with Gillette. I have been using the razor for about a month now to see how worth it all the attachments and features are. When first receiving this razor it was really exciting to see how well thought out and designed the product was it clearly took a lot of though and research to get it right and provide all the pieces for a reasonable cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the buzzing feature for regular shaving is more powerful than your standard mach 3 and the blades seem to be of comparable quality (but more expensive for refills). Overall, I am pleased with everyday shaving with this product, but somewhat felt that for a more expensive blade that it should last slightly longer than a typical blade, but I really don&#x27;t think it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the month that I have had it I have yet to use the trimmer, I think I will use it on occasion, but that is probably it. So maybe this feature is not something that I absolutely needed, but I think it is better than actually buying a separate trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I travel regularly for work so I would definitely not consider this as an option for traveling. It is heavy and thick and not ideal for packing among other items, especially if you bring the attachments. So, I&#x27;ll stick to a more standard razor for traveling!</li>
    <li> Great Product. Love the handiness of so many tools in one place. Will definitely pass on the good word about this product.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised by how good this product is.  Was given this product free thru a promotion thru Gillette.  The 5 blade...blade...is excellent and was able to use about 8 times...which is a high number considering my heavy beard.  I was also able to buzz my whole head with buzzer attachment ...very impressed by the size and weight of this unit...well designed and weighted for job at hand.  THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! I have been using it for weeks now and the battery is still going strong. I have used much more expensive packages from department stores and I think I get better results with the Proglide! It has yet to give me razor burn or scratch up my face and my skin is pretty sensitive. My wife used it on my son to give him a buzz cut for summer baseball season and to trim up both of our sideburns. I tend to keep my facial hair to a minimum with usually just a flavor savor so I cannot comment on Santa Claus beards and 20 year old mustache trimmings, but for my purposes it works great!</li>
    <li> THIS LITTLE PACKAGE OUT PERFORMS NORELCO BODY GROOMER.  NORELCO BODY GROOMER NICKS ON SENSITIVE AREAS, BUT THIS LITTLE FUSION PACKS SAILS SMOOTHLY THROUGH</li>
    <li> When I got it I was super excited to try it my wife and I read over the stuff the product had and got even more excited about trying it. The thing I thought was pretty cool about this razor was that it has the little touch up razor on the flip. I wouldn&#x27;t have even noticed it though if I hadn&#x27;t read the packaging. I love this razor it has replace the one I was using before!</li>
    <li> This Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler was provided to me via a program ran by Gillette. I have used many different hair trimmers in the past and I was expecting this one to be about the same as the other ones that ran on batteries. I was pleasantly surprised that this one trimmed in better and in tighter spots then my previous ones. I was a little skeptical about the wide handle and using the razor head to shave with. I figured it would be harder to deal with since I was used to a skinny shaft razor. The wider grip of the ProGlide Styler actually allowed me to control the razor better with less bumps forming on my face after shaving. I was also pleasantly surprised that the head of the razor is wider than my previous razor which allowed me to get a smother shave quicker with less passes on my face.</li>
    <li> I really like how I don&#x27;t have to pull out my big bulky clippers to clean up my beard. I just grab my Gillette Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 Styler off of my counter and going from a clean shave with the razor to grooming my beard with the trimmer and cleaning up my side burns with the edge trimmer. this is the best tool I have ever owned, I got it for free from a program through Gillette to try out and I have used it EVERY SINGLE DAY! I love this thing and the price is great.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is all the tools you need in one pack. You can go from trimming to shaving in seconds and clean up is very easy. The best part is that its waterproof for the shower. I am very happy with the Styler Power Trimmer thank you Gillette for this free sample.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-in-1 Styler Special Pack in a free promotion from Gillette. I would not personally have chosen to purchase this but I am so glad I got this! It is the most amazing razor/styler I have ever owned! It is an all in one that makes traveling so much easier. I don&#x27;t have to pack an assortment of trimmers, clippers, and razors! This little kit has everything you need to keep trim and neat! The best thing I like about this, besides it runs off ONE AA battery and is waterproof, is the storage case it has. Unlike many other trimmers I have paid a lot more for, this comes with a great little rack that actually keeps everything in it and your not chasing the pieces around!</li>
    <li> I recently participated in a program by Gillette in which they provided me with a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer and I was able to test it out. I am going to have to say that I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few moths, I was looking into buying a new trimmer/styler when I received an invitation to this program. When I first got it, I was very happy, and I still am. They as advertise that this is a 3-in-1 product, but I see it as a 4-in-1. You can trim, style, shave, and even power shave. I love this item. It even includes three different height levels to trim the hair, reducing the need to guess and end up with uneven hair. The super plus side, is that it is even shower safe! Which means that you can use it in wet or dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this product and would definitely recommend it to 10 out of 10 people, especially for the low price that it can be bought for.</li>
    <li> I received my Trimmer from a program ran by Gillette. I have tried many trimmers some very costly and some not so costly and nine of them was very effective. But when I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Trimmer I was very surprised. The shave was the closest I ever had and the trimmers actually trimmed my moustash without pulling and I actually got the trim even. It is an unbelievable product that I will be using for years to come!</li>
    <li> I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette. When I received the unit it was well packaged and easy to open. I liked the adhesive tape that kept the packaging closed up tight, but was easy to remove. I had the unit out and assembled in less than 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial thought was the styler was well made. It has some weight to it that makes you feel like it will last for a while. Attachments come on and off easily. The design of how they attach is pretty neat. With the slide of a switch the attachments come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the trimmer and the razor work well. The razor has 5 blades for a close smooth shave. I have sensitive skin and had no  razor burn with the blade. The trimmer does have a little problem cutting when there is lots of hair to deal with. I think it&#x27;s best suited for regular maintenance of your beard and other parts. I would not use it to get rid of your Grizzly Adams look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the unit and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is simple to use, and works great. Fits in my bathroom bag. The gaurds snap off and on easily. Lets me maintain a neat and trimmed beard for work. Would my a great buy for yourself or a gift. You wont be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I received this shaving system as part of a free campaign from Gillete.  This system really is a must have for the guy that likes to manscape.  One tool to shave, trim and shape facial hair.  Waterproof as well so you can take care of everything in the shower.  Easy clean up and everything works great right out of the box.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer for free from Gillette as part of a promotional program they ran. I have purchased several inexpensive trimmers before in the past- One a Phillips Norelco that ran me about $15 and another a mini trimmer by Remington for about $12. So I must preface this review by admitting that I do not have experience with any of the pricier trimmers. However, I have seen this Gillette trimmer on sale in Target for as little as $15, so I am in a good position to compare it pretty fairly with other trimmers in its class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression when I took it out of the package was that it was much more substantial than I expected, considering its size. It has a nice rubbery feel and some good heft to it. It feels very comfortable and well balanced in your hands, and it comes with a nice little stand. I was a little disappointed to see that it used a regular AA battery at first (like the little Remington trimmer I have), but as long as you have some rechargeable NiMh AAs around you should be all set. And I suppose this way you don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery dying out and not being able to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer has one feature which really sets it out above others in its price range, and that is the fact that you can use it in the shower. Even my Phillips cannot do that. In fact, I have not seen this feature in trimmers under $40 or so before, and it is a welcome addition. At first I couldn&#x27;t believe that it would really work, and I&#x27;m still reluctant to really try putting it under the water flow for fear that it will mess with the blade&#x27;s lubrication, but I did try shaving my face with it in the shower, and it worked pretty well. I&#x27;m not sure that I would want to use it for body hair in the shower, since it&#x27;s harder to trim hair when it&#x27;s wet and lying flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my absolute favorite thing about this trimmer is its size. The size of the trimmer blade is about halfway between my little Remington and my full size Phillips, andit&#x27;s just right for trimming just about anywhere. The blade teeth are big enough to cut smoothly but not so large as to be frightening. I found that the size makes it perfect for dry shaving my face. I have taken to using the trimmer (without any of the guards attached) as a replacement for disposable blade wet shaving. It definitely doesn&#x27;t get as close, but you can avoid cuts, razor burn, and the like, and I actually prefer having a little bit of stubble. And the Gillette will give you a pretty nice, even stubble. I have had absolutely no issues with the blades pulling on facial hair or getting caught up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a couple gripes (although none of them were big enough to cost a full star): I was a little surprised that the trimmer came with three separate guards instead of a single adjustable length one, which is less convenient. However, I&#x27;m pretty sure the reason is that having a different mold for each means that no matter what angle you use the trimmer at, you&#x27;ll still get the right length. So I&#x27;ll let it slide, although I wish there were more of them. The number 3 is still pretty short, so your hair length options are somewhat limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the trimmer also comes with a regular wet shaving razor attachment for the ProGlide Razor cartridges (which I also received and will be reviewing shortly). I have always been skeptical of the \\&quot;more blades are better\\&quot; marketing scheme, and the ProGlide razor has given me no reason to change my opinion. I have been using the BiC Metal single blade razors for a couple years now (which are sadly the only disposables on the market of their kind and very hard to find... Gillette would do well to take note and come out with a product to fill this void!) and I find that I can avoid razor burn with them 90% of the time with the single blade--and they don&#x27;t clog or pull, whereas the 2, 3, 4, and 5(!) blade razors are rough on the skin and leave me with a red face and breakouts the day of (or often the day after) I shave. All that being said, there is no requirement that you use the razor with the trimmer, and it really has nothing to do with the rest of the product- it simply turns the trimmer into a handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there is no attachment for nose/ear hair trimming, so you&#x27;ll have to use something else for that. But the case can be made that this device is designed to do one thing and does it well. The lack of attachments probably has something to do with keeping the product water-tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now the only question is whether it will hold up over time (especially using it to shave my face every morning). But so far so good, anyway. The blade is holding up a lot better than the mini Remington I have, and the AA it came with lasted longer than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with this product.  I have used it to manscape my chest and armpits.  It is very easy to do, and does a great job.  This is a great value.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this system is more effective than the bigger more expensive electric shavers. With the blade attachment I was able to get a close shave very quickly. I don&#x27;t like to spend more than 10 minutes getting ready so this was a plus for me. Its small size is also great for travelling and the extra attachments fit nicely with the included base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I love this razor set.  I am a manger at a restaurant and I need my goatee to be straight and tight.  This groomer makes it possible to do this as quick as I can.  I would recommend this to any one who needs a great shave!</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Proglide trimmer from Gilette I had tried a few other grooming products and it was a hassle losing the blades and the trimmer became useless. The Proglide 3 in 1 is so easy to use with no fuss, it comes with a nice little standing holder that holds all the pieces in place so you dont loss them I just wish I had it years ago! You can use it in the shower which is a HUGE plus for me. Cleaning is easy as rinse and store. My favorite part of the Proglide is the fact it uses disposable razor blades makes this a must have for any man with or without a beard.</li>
    <li> For the money, it&#x27;s a good product. There was a little pulling as I trimmed my goatee, but all in all it worked great. I got to try mine for free from Gillette, and I&#x27;d purchase it again. I don&#x27;t usually use an all in one powered trimmer, but this worked great for grooming everything. I just switched out the various heads and was satisfied. If I were to complain it would be that the blades are a little dull, but not terribly. I still ended up with a great trim on my side burns, and smooth skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I got to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free from Gillette. I have to admit, it is awesome! I loved the size of the razor and the ease of use. I also loved that it is battery powered and doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in. It also looks as though it will be very easy to change the batteries in it. Its very cool that it is waterproof. The electric shaver cuts very well and I love the additional attachments. The attachments worked very nice for a good, even cut. They snap on and off with ease. All in all, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a ton of facial hair. I would imagine it wouldn&#x27;t be as awesome to someone who has a thick or long beard. I look forward to recommending it to all my buddies.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide styler works as advertised. I received it free through a program. It has more power than the trimmers that I have owned in the past. I have a coarse and thick beard and it had no problem making its way through it. The attachments are useful as well, the razor attachment  was my favorite and it came free with the trimmer. only con that see is the trim on the razor that limits your options for trimming. Im am super satisfied with this trimmer!</li>
    <li> I have seen this product in stores and online but didn&#x27;t know if it was worth it so I never got it. When I was offered to receive this product for free via a program run by Gillette I signed up immediately! This is the best multi purpose trimmer I have ever used. There are a variety of attachments for different uses. The head of the trimmer is not to big or to small. I am able to get straight precision lines to keep myself looking good and clean and fresh. I am not overly hairy and don&#x27;t like completely shaving. Trimming is a great alternative and with this makes it easy. You go over quickly and it evenly trims body hair where it looks consistent. Looks great love the product!</li>
    <li> I have another trimmer from another company, but I wanted to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer to see if I liked trimming my gotee and sideburns in the shower. It was a new feeling for sure, but the cut was as good as if I had done it outside the shower. The Pros are that the trimmer is usable in water or with wet hair. I really liked how the attachments popped on and off with ease as well, my other trimmer I had to kind learn how to twist other attachments on. The cut is smooth and does a good job. The Con for me was how over all small it felt in my hand something to get used to I guess. I have big hands and the Proglide is a little big bigger then a Gillette Mach 3 razor. Other then that I was impressed with everything else that this product does. Two thumbs up for Gillette providing a free Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer to me to test out.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me a free Fusion Proglide to test out.  This razor/trimmer combo is an innovative and great concept!  I was able to trim my chest and then proceed to shave my face!  I did not have to fiddle with a separate razor to get the job done.  The trimmer did a fantastic job however I would like to see it get a closer trim.  Besides the trim length, this is a superb razor!  The shave on my face is the closest I have ever gotten!  I may end up retiring my electric shaver and using these manual razors permanently.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer as a promotion program by Gillette.  First off, I must say this is an amazing compact shaver/trimmer.  What makes this trimmer so amazing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits comfortably in my hand.  It is just slightly thickly then a normal razor, which is great since I have large hands.  The handle grips are great; the trimmer doesn&#x27;t slip while shaving and it is easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little gem performs both tasks of shaving and trimming with a simple switch of the heads.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer comes with four heads.  Three of the heads are for trimming or maintaining different depths of your facial/body hair style, while the four head is a razor for shaving where closeness counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this shaver/trimmer is, its waterproof, which makes shaving/trimming a snap in the shower and cleanup is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was definitely the first time I have ever used a battery powered trimmer with a shaver (razor) blade head in power mode. It cut super close and left my skin feeling smoother than it&#x27;s ever been; even my girlfriend noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer performed.  I thought that it would only be good for a couple of trims or so, but here it is numerous trims later and it is as good as it was when I first used it.  I have tried numerous different trimmers (mainly for my facial hair and side burns) throughout the years.  I have tried expensive and inexpensive trimmers and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is the best that I have come across.  I was fortunate enough to try this trimmer free thru a program run by Gillette.  I found the trimmer to be very easy to maneuver against the nooks and crannies of my skin.  It \\&quot;glided\\&quot; right along the various contours of my face.  Surprisingly I was able to achieve a close, smooth trim without any nicks and cuts - something that has never happened with other trimmers.  I also like the aerodynamics of the design of the trimmer and the fact that the battery doesn&#x27;t make it too bulky and heavy.  I appreciate that the design is slim and cool.  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is easy to use right out of the box, doesn&#x27;t dull, and is simply well worth the price.  This product makes trying new facial styles effortless and fun.</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide Styler free from Gillette. This Gillette Fusion trimmer looks really cool and fits great in the hand too. It has a rubberized feel, and is battery operated, running on 1 AA battery, which is included. Battery operated trimmers can be a bit of a double-edged sword, since you need fresh batteries to give it all the cutting power that it&#x27;s capable of. This trimmer comes with 3 different guards for beard trimming at different lengths, and a 4 blade shaving attachment as well. The trimmer is sharp and did a good job tidying up my beard. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using the 4 blade shaver much, but it&#x27;s an interesting idea to have it as an attachment on a trimmer. Everything&#x27;s color coordinated, and looks good, and functions well too. It&#x27;s nice and compact and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on my bathroom shelf, which is a plus. The base has compartments to hold all the attachments as well. The trimmer is not overly noisy which is also a big plus. I hate trimmers that rattle and buzz really loud. Here&#x27;s a helpful manscaping tip: put the longest guard on the trimmer, and run it over your eyebrows, so you don&#x27;t look like an unruly sasquatch! Oh and while we&#x27;re at it, trim your ear and nose hair too sometimes. There&#x27;s devices better than this for those purposes, but if you don&#x27;t have the appropriate ear and nose trimmer, this will make do. I&#x27;m always surprised at how many men walk around with disgustingly long ear and nose hair; and I&#x27;m not just talking about older men. It&#x27;s gross, guys, and doesn&#x27;t make you look cool or tough. Overall, this is a great little trimmer, and would be excellent for travel, given the size.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer free via a program run by Gillette and over all I think it is a good trimmer/razor and it does its job well when it is a small job or just for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use this to completely shave my beard and it took much longer than I would have liked to get through it but the razor attachment is great and I think this would work wonderfully for those who want it just for trimming and maintenance but those who want to start over clean shaven need to find something else.</li>
    <li> This trimmer, provided to me free from Gillette, is better than the more expensive rechargeable unit I own. It is versatile, comfortable, and gets the job done. It is so convenient to be able to use it in the shower and just swap attachments to go from trimmer to razor. I would recommend this trimmer/razor for anyone looking for a useful product for daily upkeep on their beard, sideburns, mustache. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer actually works as advertised!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was given to me  by Gillette  to try it and give my honest opinion, so here we go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really thought this was a great product I was so glad to try this. Very smooth shave and the trimmer worked wonderfully as well. Now I can shave and trim my mustache, and it has 3 options for you to choose from. Also I like it can going in the shower. Would of liked it even more if it was rechargeable but then I guess I&#x27;d have to give on the waterproof aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all great all in one product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Do not post many review , but this product is worth it. One of the closet shaves I have ever had. Love the Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer was easy to use and work great. the vibrating handle help to also provide you a close shave. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. Real good product</li>
    <li> cant believe i got this product for free to try from gillette. its handle is easy to move around the face, perfect fit for your hand and extremely light in weight! It sure is a pro when speaking in terms of razor handles! and the free blade that came with this handle left no cuts nor tugs on my beard...why? because of the handle! the best thing is once your done, you have your own palm size styler to trim, align, and loosen any and all loose ends of that tamed beard! Grrrr</li>
    <li> The best razor ever made.the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. Any thing free is worth trying, but I would absolutely buy this razor. Easy to use, even sensitive skin and no problems, gets in all nooks and crannies</li>
    <li> First, I must mention, i received this product via a program run by Gillette. Not that it matters. If i knew beforehand how awesome this razor was going to be, i wouldve even opted to buy it myself. For the price, I dont think you can beat it! It just glided through my facial hair with such ease, i couldnt believe it! No snagging,no cuts! I like to think my facial hair is bushier than most,therefore i always struggled with shaving it. It was not a fun experience. With this, I was able to actually ENJOY shaving my face. Imagine that. I truly dont have anything bad to say about it. Way to go,Gillette!</li>
    <li> I gave the Gillette fusion proglide styler power trimmer with Gillette fusion proglide power blade cartridge a try, which was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a battery operated unit, which requires 1 AA battery - which was included. There is no AC outlet option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snapping the cartridges on and off was a cinch. There&#x27;s a big button on the back of the neck of the handle that makes interchanging really easy. It doesn&#x27;t accept a backwards facing cartridge, so it&#x27;s easy to get this right.&lt;br /&gt;The power button is directly opposite the accessory release button, and sometimes inadvertently gets triggered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with 3 different clipper size guards, 1-2-3, which are comparable, if not the same as common clipper guard metrics. 1 is for a close trim, 2 for a little bit less, and 3 won&#x27;t even cut unless you&#x27;ve got some hair flowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display case easily stores all accessories and is easy to access and exchange said pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the cartridge and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction manual doesn&#x27;t say much. It mentions that there are 3 blade systems...for those of you looking for the edging blade, you simply use the backside of the proglide power blade cartridge. It&#x27;s definitely sharp and there isn&#x27;t much need to use the battery power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most razors are a solid, non technological, stagnant, rock solid piece. Like some other fancy \\&quot;bro\\&quot; inspired razors, this one&#x27;s cartridge pivots and attempts to harness the curves and planes of your face&#x27;s shape. It seemed difficult to cut myself, which is both good/great in terms of safety, but we are talking about a razor here, a dangerous, sharp tool for chiseling facial masterpieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with some other reviewers that their blades should be replaced with sharper stronger ones. The pivoting action makes you really push down hard to get close shaves, which seems counter intuitive. I want the first pass to cut some hairs, not have me press down so hard that I feel like I&#x27;m going to split my skin open, even then, it still doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is about half the width size of traditional clippers. Making it seem miniature, however it functions pretty well. Without the guards, it&#x27;s pretty easy to shave edge lines, once you figure out the motion and direction that the trimmer needs to be facing in order to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the unit was comfortable to hold, pretty cool looking, and it functions like a champ, once you figure it out.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a program that is run by Gillette. All I can say is WOW! The trimmer is small, but powerful. I did not try it in the shower, but I am sure it will work just as well there. It trimmed my goatee quickly and professionally. I could tell an immediate difference after I used it for the first time.</li>
    <li> I received a Fusion ProGlide Styler from Gillette to try out and review. I was honestly expecting no more than an overwrought, overpriced, over-engineered curiosity. It has turned out to meet most of my grooming needs with one bulletproof package, however, and the Amazon cost for this thing is pretty damn reasonable, considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package comes with a battery powered trimmer, a multi-blade razor, several guards, and a stand, all of which I use. That the trimmer works, and really well, was my first surprise. It levels off and shapes sideburns effortlessly. It clear-cuts downstairs without pulling or getting caught up. The guards I actually use to keep my scalp hair away from my ears. I just throw one on the trimmer and run it around every week or so. The razor is simply Gillette&#x27;s proven design that has been around for years. All in all a great package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides involve the razor heads. Gillette&#x27;s lubricating strips have always been inferior. They lubricate for a shave or two, and then dry out and start shredding. I am one that, considering how expensive these things are, likes to use these razor heads many times, and the strips just don&#x27;t hold up. Speaking of expense, the cost of the refills is patently ridiculous. That is why, while I love this product, I probably will not continue to use it unless I can find refills somewhere at a steep discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use a safety razor AND an electric. This package replaces both for a less money, and takes up much less space. Long term, however, the cost of refills are a black cloud on the horizon. Depending on how you do your thing, and with what, this is probably worth a go, if only for the short term.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler via a program run by Gillette. Using the power trimmer with an attachment didn&#x27;t work so well for me when my hair was thicker. It took too many passes to trim the hair and I had to use my old ones to finish. Now without the attachment it works well for trimming and edging.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Styler was provided to me by Gillette, and that thing is worth its weight in gold it performs better than any other trimmer style product I have owned including Norelco hands down I really love it. It is great in every way it is small and compact, easy to handle, just overall excellent.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free via a program run by Gillette. It works great! It&#x27;s perfect for shaving or trimming, not only facial hair but any body hair. The handle is sturdy and solid and I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s battery powered making it much more convenient to use than my regular trimmer. It cuts evenly and makes styling so much easier.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free from a promotion that was being ran by Gillette. This is a wonderful trimmer/razor. Keeps me looking cleaned up everyday for work. Does not give me razor burn and gets really close to my skin. The razor trimmer doesnt pull or tug. even my Gf loves to use my razor. I recommend that you give it a try if you are looking for a great razor!</li>
    <li> For as cheap as the Gillette styler was, it quickly became my favorite tool to groom with! It&#x27;s got a lot of nice features that more expensive stylers have, but for around only $20, plus it&#x27;s water proof for use in the shower! It uses pro-glide fusion disposable cartridges! The cartridge snaps right onto the top of the styler, and with the press of the on button, it vibrates better than my normal razor used to. I say used to because Gillette Fusion Proglide Sytler is my new go to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle provides maximum grip. The black is actually soft rubber, not plastic, making the handle easy to hold and not drop. The power button is very small, but easy to press to turn the shaver on and off, the LED light is also nice and not blinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the standard blade directly on ur skin without worrying about bumps or burns. It&#x27;s sharp, but only for your hair. It also includes 3 different style \\&quot;combs\\&quot; to attach to the shaver so you can style your side burns, beard, mustache, anything else you&#x27;d want to trim. The packaging it comes in doubles as a stand and accessory holder for the styler itself, and all the little attachments included.  I will never use another razor! I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler!</li>
    <li> Well, I have to admit I was really skeptical about this, because it looked to me like adding blades on top of the trimmer would make this way too bulky to use, and the little attachments would get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finally getting the thing open, (I received it free from a Gillette program and they packed it in case of some serious handling during shipment!) I skipped the directions and fired it right up, as I needed to trim the sideburns. Grabbed the guide from the back and trimmed up the goatee and then since it went smooth as silk finished off with the shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man, having all of the unit/accessories in once device/stand is really a sweet deal, as normally I have to hunt through the shave basket to find which one I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is ok, and I&#x27;d recommend drying it out after use.&lt;br /&gt;All-inclusive device with a small counter footprint for a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer for free as part of a program thru Gillette and I can say if I had to return it I would rush out and buy one!! This trimmer is great! I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of it, especially for the price, but I was definitely in for a surprise. The tool itself is very comfortable to use and looks nice. The guards are perfect for any grooming needs and this thing is powerful enough to handle any manscaping you may need to do! Now you are not going to be able to smooth shave ZZ Top with this, but it will handle the average grooming perfectly. It gets a very precise cut on the side burns, stache, and anywhere else you need. It is very easy to maintain and clean as well. I also got the smoothest shave every with the razor attachment. This is the best trimmer/groomer I have owned. You couldn&#x27;t ask for a better quality product for the price. Gillette really out did themselves on this item!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works well and I have used it quite a few times since I received it.  It trims nicely and gets to places I have trouble reaching with a razor.  I really recommend this to others that need to trim their facial hairs and other body hairs.  I have used this to trim the hairs on the back of my neck and it was helpful to not reach with a razor and risk nicking myself when I reach behind.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler free from a program sponsored by Gillette.  I thought that the razor worked quite well and it was extremely easy to change the different stylers out. The blade did get caught in my beard which was uncomfortable but overall I am pleased with the outcome.  I had a clean, close shave and felt very satisfied with the product.  The retail price is also a plus.  It works very well considering that it isn&#x27;t overly expensive.  I will continue to use the product and could see myself purchasing another or even the extra blades in the future.</li>
    <li> Pros: Compact, ergonomic grip, good trimmer, can replace your separate razor and trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Bulky handle for a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from Giletter for free as part of a consumer feedback program.  It&#x27;s a good thing I did. I replaced my Norelco trimmer with this.  It is slimmer and more comfortable than the Norelco, while also feeling much more solid.  It&#x27;s a bonus that the trimmer also includes a razor so you don&#x27;t have to have space for both a trimmer and razor. However, I felt the handle was too bulky for the razor, and prefer my standard Profusion razor.</li>
    <li> I was provided this shaver via a program Gillette ran. I was orignally thinking this shaver was going to be light with a cheap plastic design with a chepy motor,Boy was I was wrong! This shaver is very heavy duty in the hand,Very solidly built and the vibration moto/trimmer is amazing! It shaved through thick facial hair with easy and never snagged nor got caught up in all the hair. It is also very easy to clean,You just press a small button and the trimmer pops up and just run water to wash all the hair out. That easy. The best part is you can take it in the shower and not have to worry about getting it wet or ruining it. I have had friends notice how my sideburns are much cleaner cut now and they are now going out to purchase one for themselves.</li>
    <li> This product is not for me. It works, but that&#x27;s the only good thing I can say. It&#x27;s about as good as what you&#x27;re paying for it, but personally, I don&#x27;t think a beard trimmer is something you should skimp on. My beard is robust and needs a little something more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different razor&#x27;s in the past but I have to say that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is my favorite. The different attachments for the trimmer make keeping my mustache trimmed so much easier. I even use it to keep my eyebrows inline. It was easy to clean and I never cut myself with it. Plus it comes with a great little stand.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Have beard and mustache and trimming with most products is hit or miss.  You can do almost all you need for proper grooming.  Gillette always makes great product.</li>
    <li> This razor from Gillette is great. It is a quality product. It has excellent balance and I can trim my body hair with ease and without worry. No razor burn or bumps ever. My goatee is easily trimmed and shaping around my nose and mouth is quick and painless. Other unwanted body hair is also a snap with this body hair trimmer. I highly recommend this product. Best one on the market in a long time~</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free via a program run by Gillette.  The razor has 2 jobs: shaving the face and detailing facial hair.  I have a goatee and LOVE the ability to shape and trim it with the ProGlide styler.  They other feature is an attachable vibrating shaving razor.  I have very sensative skin and the vibrating motion of the razor cut my skin in multiple areas.  While I will not use the razor, I will definetly use the sytler feature!</li>
    <li> I use the trimmer to get the hair of my moustache that tries to curl onto my upper lip, i put on the clipper attachment #1 to keep hair close and neat This was a Gillette promo item that does as much, or as little, as desired! Great product!</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer for free through a program run by Gillette. I think this trimmer can run against the other electric trimmer I have. I really like that it came with three combs and I only have to use one razor/trimmer now.</li>
    <li> Upon reading about this product before I ordered it, I was a bit skeptical at first. I guess it was lucky that I got one FREE from a program sponsored by Gillette! I didn&#x27;t believe that it could do everything they said it could without a lot of issues. I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holding container is durable, it even stands up to my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s abuse. The shaving quality itself is as to be expected. It trims my beard and mustache better than I thought it would. The handle is comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hands, which is something else I was afraid would happen as well.&lt;br /&gt;cky&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say I am pleasantly surprised and happy with my acquisition.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion 3-in-1 styler was given to me through a program by Gillette. I gave this product a 5 because the only thing I found is that it&#x27;s a little bulky but not enough to mark it as a 4, once you use it a few times you get use to it. The title is smooth no grit because the blades both the razor and shaver are so smooth it is like using 400 grit sand paper instead of 80 grit. I have very course hair and the 3 blade razors pull before cutting, also with the 3 blade razors I only get about 4 shaves then I have to throw it away but with this one I am on #7 and still going, again I have very course beard hair, I am not sure how much longer it will last but hey I have twise the life as the other razer. Another great thing about how smooth it shaves I could never shave after a second day I would have to wait 3-4 days to shave again because it would hurt so badly, not with this razor I can shave any day at any time. [bonus]  The shaver also is a very nice smooth operating tool cuts close and does not give you any after burn, nor does the razor. It is water resistant and cleans up easly, I have other shavers but they are louder, don&#x27;t cut as close, and are messier to clean, won&#x27;t be using them any more. The stand that comes with the unit is nice it holds all the tools so you don&#x27;t lose them. all in all a great product I so glad I have one.</li>
    <li> This Product works I really enjoy the many functions and uses for it. It is great if you just want the stubble look by using the trimmer feature with out one of the three guards, It gets close and leaves just the right look, I would recommend this razor to anyone, I got the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a Gillette promotion. I&#x27;ve been a Gillette user razor user for many years. When it comes to using an battery powered razor while in the shower I was a bit skeptical at first, but it did not disappoint with a nice smooth shave on my neck. I was hoping to use this as a replacement to carrying a bulky beard trimmer with me that is a few years old and the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. Unfortunately, the beard trimming capabilities of this trimmer are severely lacking. It might be okay for a quick touch-up of a mustache, but if you want to take your beard down from a #3 to the largest attachment, it took almost ten minutes. I was not a fully length beard or anything, but i would expect it to be able to cut off a few mm of hair. It does do the job, just took me a much longer time than I would want it to. Also, when it came to doing the chin line, i did have some lack of confidence in where to place the razor (as with previous Gillete fusion blades that had a single blade on the opposite side)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I would suggest this as a great razor for men who want a full shave, but its not what I would call beard friendly.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Proglide Styler was provided to me for free from Gillette for review.  Needless to say the Fusion Proglide Styler exceeded all my expectations.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a product at such a low price point.  I&#x27;ve had this product for almost a month and put this to the test.  I don&#x27;t usually grow facial hair but, I was so curious on how this product would work that I was compelled to do so.  The trimmer is exceptional.  I love the fact that it comes with different length combs so you can get that perfect look. The fact that it is also water proof is a plus.  Overall this is definitively a 5 star product.  Good job Gillette.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler I thought  of  it as an interesting idea which I was not so sure about. I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free from a program run by Gillette. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler could be described as a grooming system that is smaller and has less power than the average styler. It needs a battery which is included and has a decent lifetime. Like I said before, the power of the styler is not the best but works and the way the razor fits into the styler is kind of funny. The styler and razor works fine but it is nothing out of the ordinary. At first the styler seemed to have almost no purpose for me until I had to travel. Traveling with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is a great idea, it  is small and has enough power to groom yourself, while at the same time having a razor. It made a huge difference in my traveling ideals. It gave me the confidence and possibility to do anything I would like to while not carrying several items. I was able to groom myself thousands of miles away from home without a problem.</li>
    <li> Honestly can&#x27;t say enough about the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer. The versatility, the closeness, and the feel are all top notch. I&#x27;m so glad Gillette provided the Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer to me, as I was skeptical to try due to the cost. That being said, I think this is the best trimmer I have own to date and would totally buy another one, if the opportunity arises. My guess though is that might not be for sometime, as this product is very soundly made, so much so Gillette has made it so you can take it in the shower with you! If that isn&#x27;t a sign of a well made product then I don&#x27;t know what is. If I had one complaint, it would be how hot the trimmer gets after an extended use, not hot enough to burn, just hot enough for you to know its there. All and all I&#x27;m very happy with Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer and would recommend it to friends and family, as well as any Amazon readers who happen to read this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many-a-trimmer before and never have I come across something as compact and easy to handle. The three different length options allow you to have full control of your facial hair. I usually have a decent amount of scruff going on and this product helps me maintain it, while still looking professional. This is a fantastic product all around.  And I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler for free through a program run by Gillette.  It looks promising from the start and I was glad to find out it lives up to it&#x27;s expectations.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and maintain, and it gives me a clean, smooth shave.  I got very little razor burn or nicks from using it.  I liked that&#x27;s a light and portable size so I can take it with me while traveling frequently.  The 3 combs of different lengths come in handy for styling.  The price is right on it as well, which adds up to a great option for your daily shaving routine.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed to say the least when I opened this product. I was expecting a cheap trimmer that would last through a few uses. However after using it for 2 months I found that this is a very reliable trimmer. It can be used in multiple ways and stays sharp. I like the compact size of it And for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. I will definetly buy another one when/if this one ever dulls or dies on me.</li>
    <li> Close shave and very nice grooming  and styling capabilities. I would recommend this to anyone. The attachments included work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free through a promotion sponsored by Gillette. Being a 3-In-1 package it came with different attachments to handle many different areas of my face and other areas. The styler works great as a trimmer, with plenty of power to handle this task easily.  It had no problems to trim off my sideburns precisely as I like them. The handle feels good in your hand and has a nice grip to hold it comfortably. Putting on the the razor attachment allowed me to get a nice close comfortable shave. The new blade technology makes this possible along with the lubrication strip along the top. It comes with a nice stand to hold the unit and the attachments that come with it. It doesn&#x27;t take up much space so makes it handy to have everything available to use. The Gillete Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 can handle several tasks so it saves me time from having to use different tools. It is a great value for the money. Thank you Gillette for a good product!</li>
    <li> I recently use this and did a full shave. My face felt like a baby butt that I haven&#x27;t felt in ages! Makes me feel and look young again. The plastic shift changes for the razor though seem like their not going to last that long as I hoped. It really depends on how much you use this to see how far it goes. Other than that it gives me that facial hair feature that I haven&#x27;t seen in ages like I said. The grip of the razor is pretty advance as well. I love it that it came with the Gillette Fusion razor along with it so if you need to get that extra 5 razor edge. If it  wasn&#x27;t for Gillette that I got it free from a program run it really gave me ideas for  detailed facial hair type. Great product overall! :)</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is the perfect accessory for almost any man. The capability of the trimmer allows you to style for any occasion with three different lengths. I found the trimmer was most useful to get in small spaces and to trim sideburns. This free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I generally don&#x27;t use electric razors and stylers, but I&#x27;ve always had faith in Gillette putting out quality products, so I thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: first to my surprise, this styler is actually stylish!  Not that looks alone should determine whether you buy it, but a lot of stylets are more bulky and clunky, while the Proglide Styler is actually sleek and lightweight.  My actual shaving experience was also impressive.  The Proglide Styler is easy to maneuver and has almost no drag, even against the grain.  It&#x27;s responsive handling allows even minor, miniscule corrections without making you feel like you need to just shave everything off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the actual accompanying razor blade worked quite well.  Sharp and slick, it similarly allowed a fast, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: the trimmer attached to the razor blade was difficult to use properly, and did not feel as responsive.  Also, while not particularly loud, the Proglide Styler does have a distinct buzz, and I wake up early and have an infant.  While its sound is not a deal- breaker, anyone living I&#x27;m a small apartment or with noise-sensitive roommates/family should be aware of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a similar product from Schick for over a year now and I got my hands on the Fusion Proglide Styler through a program run Gillete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of the Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;1. Feels light and handy compared to the Schick 3 in 1 product.&lt;br /&gt;2. The motor that powers it is pretty powerful. (I&#x27;ve tried using it on a week old beard and it still works like a charm!)&lt;br /&gt;3. The rubberized grip is bang for the buck (does not feel cheap like the Schick one)&lt;br /&gt;4. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month now, and the battery life is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of the Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleaning the trimmer is a bit of a hassle. There are crevices which are hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;2. A bit bulky compared to the Schick product.&lt;br /&gt;3. I hate that the trimmer attachments will have to be carried separately along with the trimmer itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus:&lt;br /&gt;I really like the holder that comes with the product. Good thing that it ships with it :)</li>
    <li> I was suspect this thing would do any good, but I was willing to give it a try, since my typical beard is only good for about 1 day between looking like a child and growing patches everywhere. I received the kit as a free promotion from Gillette and it actually worked very well in helping me trim my facial hair in a way that wouldn&#x27;t make me want to hide from the public eye. It&#x27;s a good product that I recommend.</li>
    <li> Thought the product was ok not really for me the motor was not strong enough and it&#x27;s really not for coarse hair</li>
    <li> I was provided with this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a program ran by Gillette. I was using another battery operated trimmer before using this, so it took a bit to get used to. The Gillette trimmer seemed like it wouldn&#x27;t have enough power to trim hair, but it does. It feels a bit smoother while cutting and misses fewer hairs.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is pretty good. I got it through a special program that Gillette was running. It made quick work of my winter beard. I was able to quickly trim down the beard, then stick on the razor attachment and get the close shave that I want. It even has a single blade for fine edging. I found it worked great...even in more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, and my only complaint would be that with the trimmer attachment on it is a little long and awkward. But it is a small complaint for a great product.</li>
    <li> Really glad I got this razor/trimmer combo. I was lucky to get it through a Gillette run program. Much easier for me to shave and trim my goatee all at once.  The razor attachment is easy to get on and easy to get off.  The trimmer works perfectly.  The trimmer combs are good if you like a shorter beard. I wish there would be some longer combs as I like to have my goatee a little longer. Easy to clean after use as the trimmer blade conveniently pops open.  Overall I highly recommend this for anyone with facial hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite trimmer. I really like the thick handle. It makes it easier to hold on to the product, it doesn&#x27;t slip in my hand. The attachments are everything I need. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I received my proglide trimmer shaver it (looks like real man tool cool. so I put it through the test. I really like the way the trimmer fits in my hand. it&#x27;s light weight has interchangeable size heads. I can maneuver it to a perfect goatee trim. to finish my sculpture goatee I switch the head to the razor. this is one more great invention by Gillette. I just love it!!!! [[ASIN:B0062IWQVU Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack]]</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a new a trimmer but then I saw the slim new modern look of the Fusion and figured why not? This trimmer is much slimmer than my current trimmer helping me hit all the angles and contours I need. What you should know before you purchase this product is that it is not such much a beard trimmer as it is a styler. So keep that in mind, it&#x27;s great for fine tuning, sculpting and shaping, but not so much for fighting down a monsterous beard.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler as part of a promotion run by Gillette.  Trimming body hair is not only for cosmetic appearance, it is a necessity! I wear Kevlar 40 - 60 hours a week and keeping cool under that is a major challenge.  Cooling tee shirts and trimmed body hair is essential.  Over the years I have tried many different styles and brands of trimmers with my current trimmer being a pricey rechargeable model with interchanging heads.  I must say that when I first examined the Gillette Styler, I was struck by how good looking it was.  Normally I concern myself with functionality more than appearance, but this package was very manly.  The handle was nice size with the rubber grips in the right places to allow a firm, without squeezing, grip. ( much like new grips on a golf club allowing a lighter grip for a smoother swing.)  The holder allows all of the pieces to be placed in an orderly position.  The three piece comb/guide set allows trimming for proper lengths.  The battery supplies ample power for all of my needs.  The Gillette Styler did as good a job in trimming body hair as my current trimmer that cost 3 times as much.  I did not care for the shaving cartridge attachment.  Putting the shaving cartridge on top made for a very bulky feel to shaving and I&#x27;m just not a fan of the five blade Gillette Fusion cartridge. Cleaning the Styler was easy for the most part.  Although the razor opens around the blades for cleaning, I still found it slightly difficult to remove all of the hair from around the blades and internal mechanism.  All in all, this is a very good product.  I like the styler and will continue to use it.  Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great trimmer / shaver for the money. It&#x27;s battery operated and compact and does a great job!!</li>
    <li> Gillette gave me an opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free! This product has all of what any guy could need. With the addition of a great blade cartridge and the styler, this product is a must have. Having all of the tools one needs for grooming, it is a convenient and cost effective way to keep clean shaven and in style. I have used this to trim hair in those unwanted places like ears and also to keep my earls and neck lines clean and sharp. From shaping eyebrows, shaving face, trimming chest, ears, nose, back, arms, and wherever else you might need, having it all in one tool is the best way to go. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I Received this razor free via a program run by Gillette. It&#x27;s a Great Trimmer powers threw my beard with no trouble which has been a problem for me with other trimmers. It comes with a stand 3 different size guards and a Gillette Fusion Proglide razor that clips on. The Razor attachment takes some getting used to with the trimmer as a handle if you&#x27;re used to a slim handle razor. It shaves very close and has a single razor on the edge for getting a nice tight edge. The trimmer outlines very nicely. The guards make it easy to keep an even length all the time. The batteries last a long time. The base has a place for everything making it and its attachments easy to keep everything together and in a small place.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Style Power Trimmer is awesome. My girlfriend has been asking me to \\&quot;man-scape\\&quot; and I was skeptical as I have never done this before. It was easy to use even in \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot;. I got this razor through a program run by Gillette. I have been using Gillette products since I turned 18 and it is great to see that they still will give you a good product.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler was provided to me via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely a great value. It&#x27;s a battery-powered styler as well as a razor. It comes with a stand for the styler, several styling clips and the razor attachment. The styler works well at maintaining a low goatee and the razor gives you an option to take it all the way down to clean shaven when needed. I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a versatile way to maintain their facial hair without the necessary cost.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this styler to try out and review. I&#x27;ll admit, despite it&#x27;s little size, it works for every last nook and cranny on your body. Arms, legs, under arms, etc. etc. etc. are all a breeze with this little guy and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I appreciate the size and look of the styler too, and appreciate than it&#x27;s battery operated so I don&#x27;t need to pull out the gigantic clippers I used to use to keep my manscaping in check. For price, and convenience, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is so awesome. It works so well that I went out and bought one for my son, He loves it and so do I</li>
    <li> I was in the only plug in era of beard trimming and did so only once every 1-2 weeks (when it got out of control) mostly because it was a pain to get all the equipment out and clean up the hair afterwards.  With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer, all that is behind me!  I received a free razor via a Gillette program and will never go back to the old school trimmer.  I can now trim up in the shower daily and keep my look fresh!  I couldn&#x27;t do that with my old trimmers because they were not water resistant and the obvious...they plugged into the wall.  I have not tried this trimmer after 1-2 weeks of growth, but with the ease of using this trimmer, why would you even wait that long?  I use this on my bread, mustache and side burns almost daily.  It sits in the shower and is ready every night when I get back from work.  I love the versatility and ease of use from the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer.  I will never go back to my old razor!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette fusion proglide styler power trimmer free from Gillette as part of a promotion to try it out. I found the power trimmer quite useful, I would use it to touch up my beard or to trim down my sideburns. It was very simple to use, worked great and is useful because of its size and ability to place different size combs.</li>
    <li> I have tried the new Gillette Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 styler.  It works great on side burns and getting those little hairs that are hard to get.  I love my new razor !</li>
    <li> So, Gillette offered up this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for me to try for free and I was pumped to give it a shot. I really like the compactness of the total package. Everything fits nicely tucked away and doesn&#x27;t take up any counter space. The trimmers do a nice job on my chest/underarm hair and it seems pretty solid. I tried it in the shower and the internal parts stayed nice and dry thanks to the nice o-ring seal. Detaching and attaching the clips are easy with a release button. The razor blade that comes with it isn&#x27;t the greatest. I&#x27;ve been using the original Mach 3 blades since they came out and have tried all of Gillette&#x27;s blades that followed. I have a very thick beard.  I tried out this razor after not shaving for 2 days and it yanked the S&amp;*^T out of my face. Every stroke was painful, but the end result was the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve every had. I&#x27;ve used the same blade for about 5 shaves now and it&#x27;s still painful, but the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to have worn; thus the 3 stars. This is a razor for someone who shaves everyday or doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; 3 hours in advance.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer free from a program run by Gillette. I was very pleased with the product. First off if you&#x27;re looking for a professional trimmer this is not it. But keeping your expectations reasonable this is a really nice product. It&#x27;s a very powerful and versatile trimmer and one of the best features is that you can use it in the shower.It comes with 3 interchangeable combs which allows you to maintain or create a variety of looks. It also works great on body hair as well. I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a quality yet inexpensive way to maintain body and facial hair of all kinds.</li>
    <li> As a guy with a beard, keeping it trimmed is necessary not just for looks but for comfort (having your mustache growing over your lips can be irritating!).  I&#x27;ve used other trimmers in the past, and they work good enough but many of them have to be charged or even plugged in to use and while that seems like a small issue, every second counts when you are in a hurry in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to receive this free from a program offered by Gillette, a trusted name in shaving and this time they teamed up with Braun to make a trimmer with the best technology for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer worked well, trimmed the beard evenly without pulling hairs and was easy to use (just snap on the one of 3 included combs) and comfortable to hold (Nice grip, not too small, not too bulky) I like the fact that it comes with the battery already as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any girl (or girl!) looking for an inexpensive, easy to use solution to trimming hair.  This is my new go-to tool from now on!</li>
    <li> Usually, grooming is so time consuming trying to use standard buzz clippers and razors that I end up either just growing out a beard or shaving it all off!!! After receiving my free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette, I decided to give grooming a real try!&lt;br /&gt;With the trimmer, it is so easy to shorten, style, and \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; that I find I can change my look so easily when I want to. It&#x27;s great - go from a fuller beard, to a light all-over beard, to a highly stylized circle beard. The trimmer allows me to keep a clean jaw and neck, and also is precise enough to make sharp lines for a defined look. I love this grooming tool, and so does my wife!!! She loves the clean, sleek, sexy looks I create! Two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;-Dariusz K.</li>
    <li> This styler kit is amazing! A must have! You can bring it anywhere and even with you in the shower! You can trim, cut, shave, do it all in one kit. My fiance likes it because it is neat with the kit it comes in, I don&#x27;t need to have 10 different tools lying everywhere! Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite grooming tool. Gillette Fusion created a Proglide Styler Power Trimmer that allows me to do much more than shave. It allows me to trim any and all hair any way (and length!) I choose. The package is very nice; it is a clear case that showcases the trimmer, razor attachment, 3 trimming guides, battery, and the holder that is small enough to sit on my shower shelf and holds EVERYTHING that is in the case. Genius! After inserting the battery and turning it on, I immediately felt the power in my hand. This is not a cheap, sub-standard trimmer. This trimmer feels like it can cut through bear hair (lucky for me!) yet it is very easy to use and manage. The guides clip on and a touch of the button allows you to remove them. Same with the blade attachment. Once I have the attachment that I want in place, I just hit the front button with my thumb, and a trimming (or shaving) I go... I love that it is waterproof. I keep it right in my shower and it is always handy. I have even caught my wife using it! Thank you, Gillette, for the promotion that allowed me to try this Power Trimmer for free. I have actually purchased one myself so that I can have one in each bathroom. This way, I am never without my Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer. I am also going to purchase one for my Dad, he currently uses a Gillette Fusion razor and is in for a treat once he receives the Power Trimmer!I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a great shave and trim without hassle.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a promotional giveaway from Gillette.  After having used it for a few weeks, I have to say that I really like it.  It is something that I would actually purchase.  The shape and feel of it were perfect in my hand and made trimming my beard, mustache, and sideburns very easy.  It took a few tries to figure out the right attachment, but no looking back now.  I like how easy it is to change out the attachments, and also how easy it is to clean.  So far I am still using the same battery that was included, so we&#x27;ll see how long that lasts, but I do like not having to have something plugged in.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program run by Gillette, I had the opportunity to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Trimmer. Prior to receiving this sample, I was using a rechargeable trimmer for my grooming needs, but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Trimmer is a great alternative (especially for travel) because it runs on batteries. It was very easy to take care of my grooming needs both in the shower and out. It provided a close and consistent trim on both wet and dry skin. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I loved the way this styler has attachments so my body grooming can be done with one device.  I used it daly to shave my beard leaving a smooth, clean look.  Secondly, I used it for my chest and back grooming.  The trimmer worked really well and gave me a close shave.  There were no nicks or cuts using using this styler and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing it really precise it helped with sharp lines and corners. i like the multiple level caps that came with that helped shape my beard.</li>
    <li> Having all in one is amazing they should done it before fusion proglide styler take&#x27;s care of you whit all your shaving needs to leave you looking clean .</li>
    <li> I was supposed to receive this item as part of a Gillette promotion and write a review.  I would love to review except item was never received.  I am supposed to write a review but when I contacted the promotion they said it was mailed and didn&#x27;t have any replacements.  I am trying to keep my end of the bargain regardless.  I can say that it looks like a interesting good product.  What I am really concerned about is how long it would last?  I would like to see other reviews on this question.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> I got a free one from Bzzagent. I was super excited for it. When I got I was impressed how neat it looked and that it was a trimmer and shaver in one. I tested the trimmer on my sideburns and my beard. Not bad, didn&#x27;t catch my hair in the blades. Then I tried the shaver, I was happy that I didn&#x27;t have to double shave and was good to go after one shave. Disappointed that the shaver didn&#x27;t last long. I need to shave everyday for my job, scruffy face allowed. expected the shaver to last the month but threw it away after two weeks.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an amazing grooming kit, then of course Gillette has the product your looking for. I give this product 5 stars for the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It has a crisp and cutting edge design, grip and blades. With my sensitive skin, these blades offer smooth gliding and I dont have to worry about getting bumps or even the blades getting caught in my skin like many grooming kits do. The quality of the vibration is perfectly distributed to all the blades making it possible for a crisp shave and cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It comes with three different shaving options that allow you to decide if you want to fully get rid of your beard or just tone it up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Its powerful yet gentle and it can be used all over the body not just the face. Its easy to clean and the holder it comes with, makes it easy to store.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Syler Trimmer is amazing!  My eyebrows give me a lot of problems as they are very bushy!  I am always scared to use a pair of scissors on my eyebrows because if I make one mistake I could poke my eyes out. As a result I would usually leave them bushy which did not enhance my appearance.  My wife and daughter hated it! I found this product very easy to use and it gave me the security I need to get the job done.  I am grateful to the Gillette Company for providing me with a free razor to try during one of their programs.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I got this product free from a promotion from Gillette, and wanted to try out the Power Trimmer function while in the shower. This is a waterproof system, run by a single battery in a watertight compartment. I jumped in the shower and lathered up, hit the power button on the trimmer and it did a remarkable job compared to my other trimmer (which isn&#x27;t waterproof, so I would never dare to try this in the shower). Easy to maneuver, quick to take care of my unwanted hair, I fully recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First off, I received the Fusion Proglide Styler free from a program run by Gillette.The Styler is very sleek looking with its blue and black color combination.After picking up the styler for the first time,it seemed a little heavier than the other trimmer I had been using,but you can tell by the feel of this one..that it is made way better.I use it to trim my sideburns and keep my mustache in check.The best feature that I like is the styler comes with a blade attachment which is attached to the trimmer very easily once you read the instructions.My first thought was this new blade from gillette can&#x27;t be any different from the others I had been using, but I was definitely wrong.It shaves so close and does NOT irritate my skin at all,another nice thing about the blades is that they don&#x27;t get plugged up with hair as easily as my old one.The hair rinses out real easily when you let the water flow into the back of the blades and run out the front... no more banging the blades on the sink trying to dislodge the hair in them.Oops I almost forgot to mention the whole styler is waterproof.That&#x27;s right, you can trim and shave in the shower with no fear of ruining the trimmer/razor.Gillette has made a believer out of me with the Fusion ProGlide system and it has become the only razor I will use from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Gillette !!!! for an awesome product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small and handy. Like that it has the razor attachment as well, so you can do everything with one device. While it is not as wide as some beard trimmers, so it takes a bit longer to do the whole face, it trims nicely and being able to snap the razor with the vibrating power on, makes getting everything smooth a breeze. Has become my go to device once a week to trim the scruff down to smooth. The razor itself is great for a quick smooth shave without cuts. Easy to use, versatile and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I was chosen to test this product from a Gillette program. I was excited to try it out and I was so impressed. Shaving was so easy and I was able to trim my beard to the right thickness. There is nothing I would change about this product</li>
    <li> I received the razor free to try through a Gillette program. I am really impressed how well it works. It trims and shaves my face with ease. It is easy to use and fits great in my hand. I would definitely recommend using this razor to my friends and family. Oh yeah, my wife also loves it!</li>
    <li> This battery operated trimmer is small, well made, waterproof, and trims and shaves as promised. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> i received this for free through a program run by Gillette, sure am glad i din;t pay money for this! The concept isnt bad but you should just stick to either a razor or hair clippers. The plastic attachments are terrible and it doesnt cut as well when they are on the razor. Just stick to using the proglide razor for a close shave and a pair of scissors or clippers for anything else.</li>
    <li> I received Gillette&#x27;s powered Fusion ProGlide razor as part of a trial program through Gillette for free and was very excited to try it out. The package comes with 1 blade and 1 AA battery, as well as a stand and beard trimming attachments. In addition to being a razor, it is also a trimmer/ styler. This review is on the trimming aspect of the razor. The attachments come In 3 different lengths for trimming and simply clip on. They attach and disassemble very easily. The trimmer works great. I keep a goatee and it helps me keep it maintained with ease. The three variable lengths seem to be adequate for most facial hair lengths. I use the trimmer for my facial hair, ears, and back of neck. I love the convenience of having the trimmer built in with the razor and that it saves shelf space in my small bathroom cabinet. And, priced at under $20 makes this combo a steal. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Versatile product meets all of my grooming needs.  Keeps a charge and marches on.  It stores nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free through a Gillette promotion.  I was skeptical and now I am sold.</li>
    <li> I received Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler for free via a program run by Gillette. I have always been a big fan of Gillette products. It comes in both manual and powered version. This is one of the best razors in market today.The blades are thinner and it glides smoothly. All your grooming needs in 1 product. That is what Gillette Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 styler is all about. It is very easy to use too.Moreover, it is waterproof!! I will give it one star less because it doesn&#x27;t have a rechargable battery. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette fusion proglide 3-in-1 styler threw a free program by gillette. It came just in time as my old on wore out. Over all it has worked great. I like that it is so versatile, I can trim my side burns and take care of the manscape. The only down side I have found so far is I wish it had a nose trimmer attachment.</li>
    <li> Received the Gillette Fusion proglide styler from Gillette.  I had seen this product advertised for quite some time and hadn&#x27;t a chance to try it out.  I am happy to finally use it.  With the razor head included I am able to use this when travelling to keep my facial hair well groomed.  In fact my wife liked it some much she threatened to steal it!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide free from Gillette and I found this product to be a very useful tool for manscaping. I don&#x27;t usually manscape that much, but since it was free and to give an honest appraisal of it&#x27;s usefulness, I decided to take the plunge.  My wife didn&#x27;t mind either.  You get a precision clipper, albeit with only three different guides, which is plenty for body hair; at least it was for my body hair...that I attacked with this thing.  And as usual, the Gillette razor gave me a very close and comfortable shave; in all sorts of places.  As previously mentioned, I don&#x27;t usually manscape and I usually shave (my face) with a straight razor, but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide is perfect for handling all of my manscaping needs.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette pro glide fusion and was very impressed with the results, I received a free razor with my kit that was very gentle on my skin and the pro glider remove hair with ease was easy to handle and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler is a very convenient product because it has a trimmer and razor all in one, so their is no need for multiple tools. It works well at trimming and styling and for areas that you want to shave all you have to do is attach the razor to the top. It&#x27;s very quick and easy to go from one tool to another. Cleaning this product was easy if all your doing is maintaining your face because you can just run it under the faucet and it rinses out for the most part, unless their is a lot of hair and then it takes more work. Even though I received the product for free from a program Gillette was running, I still think its a good value.</li>
    <li> I got this Fusion proglide styler free as part of a Gillette campaign for my husband. He thought it was a great tool! It comes with three combs and a battery, ready to use. His facial hair grows really fast so he is always looking for a razor that will work great and last more than one use.  He was really happy with the product and happy with me that I got him a free product to try!!!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is so awesome.I got one provided free from Gillette and it works so well that I went out and bought one for my son! Its really the best Shaver/Trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used !!</li>
    <li> I received a free razor through a program run by Gillette and was pleased with the product itself. The trimmer itself is great for trimming up sideburns and comes with 3 attachments for different lengths. It also does a good job at trimming down stubble for a more comfortable and less painful shave with its great proglide blades. It can be a little tough to clean, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to get in the way of performance. Overall, for a quick and easy trimmer, you could do a lot worse.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this product. It was disappointing when it arrived as Exchangeable Razor Cartridge Head is missing. it become useless now to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a similar product from Schick for over a year now and I got my hands on the Fusion Proglide Styler through a program run Gillete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of the Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;1. Feels light and handy compared to the Schick 3 in 1 product.&lt;br /&gt;2. The motor that powers it is pretty powerful. (I&#x27;ve tried using it on a week old beard and it still works like a charm!)&lt;br /&gt;3. The rubberized grip is bang for the buck (does not feel cheap like the Schick one)&lt;br /&gt;4. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month now, and the battery life is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of the Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleaning the trimmer is a bit of a hassle. There are crevices which are hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;2. A bit bulky compared to the Schick product.&lt;br /&gt;3. I hate that the trimmer attachments will have to be carried separately along with the trimmer itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus:&lt;br /&gt;I really like the holder that comes with the product. Good thing that it ships with it :)</li>
    <li> This product embodies a recurring theme in Gilette&#x27;s products for me.  They are simply too good to stop buying and using.  The trimmer and razor were very effective and did a great job of not irritating my skin.  The packaging looks good, the product looks good, you look good. What&#x27;s not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the one thing that I did not like was the selection of guards. Unlike the main trimmer component and razor they did not look or feel quite as good and did not produce the result I wanted.  This may be due to my inexperience and amateurism, so do not let my simple complaint detract too substantially from a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free through a program run by Gillette, and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  The trimmer is very easy to use and the results are impressive.  It&#x27;s very precise and I love the attachments that come with it!</li>
    <li> Gillette has a program where I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler.  Overall I believe Gillette did a great job in the trimmer design and features, however one small addition may have taken it to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general feel of this handle is great.  The rubber grips allow you to take hold of the trimmer with confidence.  It&#x27;s a simple and sensible handle just as it should be.  The side grips also make this a firm choice when it comes to maneuvering your facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button is placed in the correct location and allows the right amount of pressure to power the ProGlide Styler on.  You would expect a protruding button that is too easy or too hard to turn on.  It fits right into the flow of the trimmer.  I also am happy with the release button which makes changing attachments quick and easy.  I like easy.  Just like the power button, it fits into the flow of the handle and is there when you need it.  Not stubborn or hard to use, just smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 attachments make it a great trimmer with 3 different guards and a razor.  I&#x27;m a #2 guard guy when it comes to shaving both my hair and facial hair.  I use it on my sideburns and on my chin to keep it clean and neat.  Switch it on, trim and go.  Fast, clean, and easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to get to battery compartment to swap out the AA batteries.  Although I would prefer a recharging option, I can live with the battery since I don&#x27;t have to trim everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite happy with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler and all of it&#x27;s trimming features.  The only thing keeping it from being AWESOME and a 5 star is you can&#x27;t remove the guard attachments and trim.  I would LOVE to thin out my sideburns and finish by buzzing the end off straight.  The option to use the razor attachment precision trimmer is there, but just not the same as my electric razor&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth the money even without the edging option.  I&#x27;d recommend this to fellow facial hair friends,I believe you will be happy with your purchase AND your clean, neat and easy trimmed facial hair.</li>
    <li> As my title states, this product is a must buy. I have had a larger trimmer for quite sometime now and I have always had the problem of not being able to keep the facial hair lines as close or as clean as I would like. I had the opportunity to get this product for free through a program run by Gillette and I can honestly say that I have tested this product thoroughly and I was more than satisfied with the results. I was able to achieve the straight lines, and the closeness of trimming I was hoping to get from this product, that I was not able to achieve through a larger trimmer. The size of this product is perfect because you can tell exactly where you are trimming while using it on your face. It is amazing not having messed up lines from your facial hair from trimming or shaving. But once again this product is amazing and it is a must buy and I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a facial hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works amazing. Just wish it had a nose hair trimmer built in. I love how easy It makes man scaling and how much less time I spend with the old clunky trimmers.</li>
    <li> Does not cut you the way some trimmers do if they touch skin.&lt;br /&gt;Razor works just like a regular Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;A closing case rather than the stand would have been nice for carrying on trips.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Gillette products for many years now and wasn&#x27;t disappointed with the new Styler.  I received a 3 in 1 Styler through a test from Gillette and haven&#x27;t gotten enough of it yet.  I am not a huge manscaper but I did find the features from the Styler to be super useful.  I love the fact that the trimmer is waterproof and I don&#x27;t have to clean the sink when I&#x27;m done.  The lengths of the trimmer guards are perfect for constructing my beard and sideburns.  They also are great for giving the edges of my haircut a clean up from time to time.  The holder is very convenient although they could have made a spot to hold all of the trimmer guards.  The trimmer works very well and the batteries are still going strong after 2 weeks of daily use.  The trimmer is a little finicky when it comes to the angle that you hold it at but that is expected because even my salon clippers do the same thing.  Overall I am very pleased with the styler.  I would definitely recommend it for those that like to keep a cleanly kept face all while taking a shower.</li>
    <li> This easy to use trimmer is great. I can edge up and trim easily.  No instructions needed.  Inexpensive item to buy.  Was using disposable and expensive trimmers but this easy to use is a top item to buy. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> When I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Styler via a program run by Gillette I was a bit skeptical that it would do what I needed it to do. I usually use professional hair clippers for all my \\&quot;manscapping\\&quot; which required running an extension cord into the bathtub and spending about an hour trying to make sure my junk doesn&#x27;t look like I stuck it in the blender. The Styler was amazing, I didn&#x27;t have to risk electric shock because its battery powered and it was small enough so I didn&#x27;t leave Santa&#x27;s beard under my coin purse.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion through Gillette. Im really glad I had the change to use it. Despite that I do not grow large amounts of facial hair i still found this product to be very useful. Keeping up my side burns was a breeze. Even close shaves was not a problem. Switching between attachments was easy enough. I have heard that some people had issues with their product breaking but this was not my experience with the razor. I was not exactly very gentle when I would clean out the hair and it still works just fine. I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about this razor, its easy to use, well made and it even looks cool! I have already recommended this product to several of my friends and I even bought one as a gift for my brother. He was very pleased his results as well.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by stating that I hate to shave. That is, I used to hate it. This styler makes it so easy and convenient that I don&#x27;t mind fitting in a shave every morning. Plus, if I&#x27;m too lazy for a full shave, this styler does great things with my stubble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently acquired a free style trimmer by a program run by Gilette, and I was lucky that&#x27;s the case, because I&#x27;m not going to lie, I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend 20$ on a trimmer. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what a lot of people think, but let me say this, it is most certainly worth the money. Also, this isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;keep buying this when it breaks down\\&quot; kind of thing. The blades are replacable like any of Gilettes other products, so really, this is an investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I come from Arab decent so my hair is pretty thick, and usually I don&#x27;t shave it because it takes me a long time.  The pro-styler, however works great for shaving my thick beard. Regardless if you buy this particular razor or not, if you go a long while between shaves, a battery powered razor is most certainly the way to go. Usually I hate shaving because I feel like its time consuming and uncomfortable. This styler fixes both of those problems and its great. I can now shave or fix-up my facial hair each morning without worrying about being late to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular styler is fantastic because it provides a number of combs so that regardless how you like to style your facial hair, your set. I was able to style a goatee with no problem whatsoever, and work on my side-burns all without having to change razors. I also love how compact it is. All three combs and the styler fit nicely and conveniently on the side of my sink, without the clutter of not knowing where to put the combs.</li>
    <li> The Gillette fusion proglide styler is a huge success. The 5 blade razor is top notch like all other Gillette razors and the trimmer/styler actually works far better than expected. It&#x27;s extremely convenient to have all the capabilities to groom/shave your face right at your disposal in one device. The only shortcoming is the size of the fusion proglide when using as a razor, I prefer something that is lighter, but that is my only complaint. Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received a free trial of this this trimmer through a program from Gillette.  It is much easier to use for maintaining short beard than full size clippers I have used in the past, although it does lack a wide range of lengths for trimming longer beards.  Very easy to clean up lines.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Free via a Gillette program and I was surprised how well the razor performed. I thought that razor would be difficult to get a good grip but once I tried it I found that it was easy to maneuver. The razor uses 1 AA battery and I will be more than happy to keep on buying a AA battery for this razor. The Razor gives a quality shave and the trimming attachments are awesome. It&#x27;s a very good trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x60;s 3 things in one very useful when wife occupies all the shelves in the bathroom! Waterproof so I can use it in the shower! Definitely would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Due to a recent program run by Gillette I was able to give the new Gillette Proglide Styler Power Trimmer a go.  After a week of use I feel I have a good idea of what the proglide power trimmer is and who its for.  Let me start out by saying that this is a very smartly constructed unit.  The device fits nicely in the palm and makes for one handed operation of the trimmer easy and accurate.  The weight of the proglide is minimal enough that you&#x27;re not burdened, but yet has some heft (which I like) to give it some balance and establish that this is not a cheap poorly built piece of equipment.  Another point I appreciate is that the handle is fitted with a rubberized grip surrounding the body that will prevent slips and assure accuracy when trimming. Getting to the heart of the device, the top trimming end, the actual shaver is smaller than your average barbershop clipper in width, and has the ability to connect to different spacers can latch on to a actual razor blade.  Within your kit you will find that all of these are supplied from the get go and are a really nice bonus so no need to buy other attachments you got all you need right there.&lt;br /&gt;I can see this as a product that is great for a guy who cares about the way he looks, and wants to make sure that he maintains the freshly groomed look throughout the day.  Over the week I trimmed my sideburns to a nice straight angle while cleaning up some of the stragglers hairs who tend to grow out of my burns at a faster rate than the others.  I also trimmed some facial hair, which it really did a nice job at, and because I was curious even trimmed some hair off a not too noticeable area of my leg.  Conclusion it did a great job at that too, so if you are a guy who wants to get rid of chest hair, or anywhere else for that matter, this will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;Overall my impression was highly positive and I would highly recommend this trimmer/shaving system.  Kudos for making such a high quality product.</li>
    <li> I got one of the Proglide stylers and I love it.  Like that it is compact &amp; easy to travel with. I love that it is small, easy to hold onto and easy to use. Keeps me trimmed nicely.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I had the opportunity to try this product through the Gillette sampling program they just ran. When I first opened the package I was very impressed with the look and functionality. It was a really cool product because it had so many different tools in one. I have never come across a grooming tool like this before. I really liked that all of the pieces came in a stand up holder which made it very easy for travel. This tool is really great for all of your grooming aspects. Gillette has pretty much got you 100% covered with this one! I felt that I barely had to push down on the razor to get a good clean shave. At first I was a little skeptical as to how it would actually enhance the shave but I really did notice a difference. It provided a very smooth shave with no irritation. The only thing I noticed was that the blades seemed to go dull quicker that I would have thought. Thank you again Gillette for the opportunity to try the new product! I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a program run by Gillette I love how it comes with 3 facial hair tools.  With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer, it is easy to keep up any kind of facial hair and it is quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer for a little more than a month, and I must say that I am impressed.  Everything from the comfort of the handle to the compact storage for the three hair combs and ProGlide attachment has increased my productivity during my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off with the monkey in the room, so to speak - the awkward-looking attachment for the ProGlide/Fusion razor cartridge that is included.  When I first opened the product and snapped the razor attachment on, I was pleasantly surprised with both the ease of use and solid construction, mainly because it appeared at first to be quite a bit larger and more awkward than traditional razor handles.  As odd as it seems, I feel like I have more control with the wider/larger handle, which is simply the inactive trimmer portion.  I have had significantly less razor irritation when using the ProGlide attachment, and I attribute that to the ability to apply more even pressure with the improved grip.  I will admit, using the single blade for precision trimming too a little to get used to because of the significantly larger size of the entire razor, but that is a small price to pay for the added benefit of being able to apply even pressure (and not ending up with a bloody mess on your neck!).  The storage solution for this attachment is sufficient for most, but I thoroughly rinse my razor cartridge after shaving, and having the attachment (with cartridge attached) inverted (as seen in the product picture above) seems to trap moisture, which has been shown to dull the blade quicker.  As I said above, I have only had it for about a month, but I have noticed the blade getting duller quicker than usual, and the only thing that has changed has been the storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I describe my experience with the trimmer, let me admit that before getting this product, I had (and still love) a Philips Norelco beard trimmer with a multi-length comb attachment included, so I may be being too harsh on what is included in this package for a very reasonable price.  Without the combs attached, you can easily edge your beard and take care of unwanted stubble without much resistance or irritation.  I have very thick, coarse facial hair and I have rarely found (with many attempts) a trimmer than can take care of my hair without catching or tugging, which causes discomfort and irritation.  So, when I tried the trimmer sans attachments on my stubbly neck for the first time, I was very happy with the closeness and comfort.  Gillette did a great job with the trimmer portion, and the product quality is evident from initial inspection.  That said, after seeing the lack of different lengths for beard-trimming combs, I was slightly disappointed.  Included in the package are three comb attachments - small, medium, and large - and for many people they would probably suffice, but when you can find a trimmer for only a few dollars more that includes a wide variety of lengths, you question why Gillette didn&#x27;t include an adjustable trimmer attachment.  Not only would this solution use less plastic, it would also require less storage space and cover all of the bases, virtually eliminating all competition in this space.  For those not too picky about their beard length, the included lengths will likely suit your needs.  But because I am, I knocked the product review down a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll quickly discuss the battery life and storage solution with one word - efficient.  The battery life has been SUPERB for me.  I usually dislike battery-operated trimmers because of the short runtimes, but I have yet to change batteries or notice a degradation in performance, and I have used it every almost every other day.  Other trimmers in this class would show a dip in blade speed or sound like a broken-down car at this point - believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.  As for the storage, the package allows for you to easily keep your trimmer, combs, and ProGlide razor cartridge in a convenient space that takes up no more room on the shelf than a mug.  Also important to point out is that it looks very chic and stylish, so if you keep this grooming package within sight of guests you will not be embarrassed in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in closing, I would recommend this product for sure.  Even if you are picky about your beard length, this is still a great product for the bare trimmer and the more secure ProGlide attachment that, in my opinion, gives you a better shave.  I received this product as part of a program being run by Gillette, so I cannot speak about how much I paid, but I surely would have paid the retail asking price.  The surprisingly improved ProGlide shave will keep this as my daily driver in that regard, but the trimmer part will likely be reserved for touch-ups and travel trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, I do not \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; - so I can&#x27;t speak to the positives/negatives in that practice.</li>
    <li> The  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was provided free via a program run by Gillette. This is the second trimmer i have ever used. This is great because of it&#x27;s size, it is small, compact and light weight. You can get the job done fast and the different guards provided allow for a fully customized look. I have already recommended this to one of my friends already and my father in law was sold on it after giving it a quick try.</li>
    <li> This is a really great styler. The different clips all work well and give you great sculpting abilities. It runs on a battery so its completely cordless which is extremely convenient and makes it extremely easy to travel with too. The handle fits perfectly in your hand. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was able to try the new gillette fusion proglide styler through a free program put on by gillette. I want to explain my 4 star rating and title. I loved using this 3-in-1 product for my sideburns and mustache. I did have a beard when I first got it but I liked trimming my mustache more with it than my beard. I think my beard was a little too thick for this guy to handle. It&#x27;s a really neat idea to have a trimmer that&#x27;s waterproof and allows you to shave stubble as well. It eliminates a lot of clutter and allows you to shave in the shower if you&#x27;re in a rush. I keep a mirror in the shower and found this product super helpful! It&#x27;s also pretty good for trimming other body hair...I&#x27;ll spare you the details. My only complaint is that the batteries don&#x27;t last long at all and mine seems to be on the fritz after 3 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a razor very often; in fact, I don&#x27;t even keep one around the sink anymore. But I do tighten up what facial fuzz I can grow every morning. That said, for how I use it, I have only small issues with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was offered a promotion for a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler, I didn&#x27;t want to pass on the chance to try out an updated trimmer that is comparable to a Remington trimmer I have been using for a number of years ... which brings me to the what I like most about the Styler. Having used a comparable Remington unit now for a long while that is rechargeable -- and having used a Remington model prior to it, until it would no longer hold a charge -- it seemed a good idea to get into a new model before the battery failed and left me half trimmed. Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries here. While rechargeable devices may be considered more green, the Styler makes more sense by operating on a single AA battery that can be easily purchased on the road or at a hotel ... or borrowed from another device even. It being a common, readily available power source is very handy when you would forget your power cord at home -- but you swear you charged it before you left. Consider how great that unique battery in your DSLR is when you run out of juice. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to drop in a few AA batteries and be back in the game?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Styler is priced right, and the option to have a replaceable cartridge blade is a nice touch. The last razor I did have used the same cartridges, so I have some extras ... in fact, the last actual razor I had was the Gillette that vibrated, so I the exact same cartridges and I still have a good battery somewhere, too. I never did understand vibrating feature; is it supposed to saw through my scruff before the 5+ blades can slice through it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note: You can still power on this unit while the blade is attached, bringing back those old vibrations on this (useless?) feature -- intended or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Styler does come packed with three height attachments. I am one who grows very little facial hair but depends on an adjustable-head trimmer to even out my patchy \\&quot;beard.\\&quot; The Styler did the job here, but compared to my former Remington the blade width is much narrower. While the narrow trim path doesn&#x27;t bother me on my face, it is noticeable. Someone with more surface area on the face ... well, it could get taxing. Compare to mowing your lawn with an 16\\&quot; cut mower to a 22\\&quot;; the difference seems minimal but it takes more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this does effect me is when I&#x27;m on the road, where I could tighten up my crew cut in a pinch with the Remington. The main cutting blade -- at just over 1\\&quot; wide -- made short work of an overgrown fade, and had a similar cut to my regular clippers at home, resulting in some pretty clean work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the size of the cutting head here on the Styler. It is marketed as a full-body groomer after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the Styler, it&#x27;s a sleek little device! The packaging is thoughtful, and everything tucks away into different parts of the Styler&#x27;s stand. And that&#x27;s great for on a counter top where it looks really sharp. But it&#x27;s all a little loose for traveling. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m asking for here, honestly, so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t complain, but with the Remington, one of the attachments was a foil razor if I needed a close \\&quot;shave.\\&quot; It&#x27;s not a like a 5-blade razor was loose in my travel bag; would you believe there is no cover included for the cartridge head of the Styler, or would that have been so hard to include?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That little lack of [safe] portability is really the only other problem I have with it. But for as little as I use the bladed razor, I&#x27;ll leave it at home and hope that, when in need, a hotel still comps a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To wrap up here, it&#x27;s watertight with a good grip, nice feel and balance in my hand. It has a replaceable battery, easy to change attachments and VERY easy to clean. I can&#x27;t knock the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler for some of my very picky personal preferences, because overall it&#x27;s a well-designed device. For about $4 more than I what I paid for my Remington, you can tell by the looks and touch that it&#x27;s a much more solid piece of equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the small investment, because this is much more than an entry level body grooming tool.</li>
    <li> My son loves this. He even uses it to do his line up. He loves this product and will keep on buying this. He will not go back to a regular razor.</li>
    <li> First off lets just say this body/face groomer from Gillette is amazing. I was provided it free through a program run by Gillete It is amazing for the price (if I were to purchase it); I usually spend $30/ month just on my trimmers/razors. It has excellent balance and I can also trim my body hair easily and without it pulling the hair or giving razor bumps. My goatee is easily trimmed at perfect length which is hard to do with the ones that click to different lengths. Other unwanted body hair is now scarce with this body hair trimmer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free through a program provided by Gillette unfortunately it caused a great deal of irritation and was not my favorite razor by Gillette. This particular styler didn&#x27;t work well for me but I will try again.</li>
    <li> The styler is so awesome.  I use it every day to keep everything trim and proper.  It makes it so i have an all in one i can shave and trim at the same time.  Thank you gillette for creating this idea.</li>
    <li> Worth  the price, excellent travel groomer.</li>
    <li> Nice product. I like the adjustable setting and clips. Very versatile and easy to use. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Great product. Versatile.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion has created an amazing product here.  I have always been a fan of the Proglide razor so I was excited to try the styler.  It does not disappoint.  It provides a close shave of different dimensions.  And it works well on your body&#x27;s sensitive areas as well.  The razor is well-built and provides a great shave.  Highly recommended to those who shave their faces and groom their body hair.</li>
    <li> Nice product . Value for money</li>
    <li> Does exactly as I needed it to.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do trimming very well. Waste of money, better buy would be peanut wahl.</li>
    <li> For 20 bucks you&#x27;re getting a ton of quality. I&#x27;ve purchased a few crappy trimmers at more than twice this price. Whether you use the razor portion or not, the trimmer is worth the cost. Plus it uses regular batteries and you don&#x27;t have to worry about recharging or a cord.</li>
    <li> More compact than I anticipated, and build quality is really good. Slight con is that it uses batteries, but the pro is that unlike trimmers with built in batteries it&#x27;s easy to swap when the battery stop working. I just use a rechargeable AAA in there.  Using the blade attachment results in a razor that is longer than what I&#x27;m used to - not a bad thing, but takes a little getting used to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal user to Mach3&#x27;s blades for years, having great results so far, so, just for a change, I bought this new Fusion proglide to get the feeling of a new unit. First, about the blade: I&#x27;m not overwhelmed about it. Mach3 had enough to give me a good shave, but the bells&amp;whistles of the ProGlide device itself, are atrractive: Having a battery-powered trimmer is always handy.</li>
    <li> Not much more to say...Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store, easy to love! I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Always interested in gimmicks!  But this is more than a gimmick!  All you want and need in a compact design.  Well done Mr. Gillette, you have come a long way from the old blue blades!</li>
    <li> Rusted out after a couple years.</li>
    <li> I saw the commercial for the 3 in 1 Styler and it looked like it might be a useful combination of personal grooming tools. I shave and trim my beard, so I figured it would be nice to have them all in one. The fact that they come from Gillette gave me the confidence to try it without hesitation about the quality of the product. They did not disappoint - it is a very well made device, versatile and compact and they don&#x27;t force you into buying a new type of razor heads - the ProGlide ones from a regular razor fit. I am glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> i am a regular Fusion razor user ever since I was shaving my head. this trimmer/shaver is great. good price, adaquate trimmer, 3 trim depths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what more do you want for under 20 bucks.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this expecting it to just be another cheap styler. I was wrong!! As you as you turn it on, it delivers professional strength. Enough to shave through the toughest surfaces. I definitely recommend it. I didn&#x27;t buy it here, I bought it at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a new item, I believe it may be canceled as not many people will buy it. I will be stocking up on them, maybe two or three. I very much liked them.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good razor. I&#x27;m upgrading finally from a Mach3 power due finding it harder to find the right razors blades and cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this I thought I&#x27;d go all out, I like the shaving blades. 5 is close though it doesn&#x27;t seem much closer than my old 3 blade model, and having the additional trimming options is nice though some of them seems to be a bit uneven? I nearly took off a large chunk of my mustache when using this and have a noticeable gap as the trim guard didn&#x27;t fully protect.&lt;br /&gt;Also the bare trimmer can be tricky at first because of the curved design, be careful to go slow at first while getting a feel for this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issues I&#x27;ve had are with cleaning this thing. The instructions say to run it under water however I see this as a way to quickly damage the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with the product and will continue to use it. Most of complaints are likely related to user error so if anything changes I will update.</li>
    <li> Finally, a decent trimmer for a decent price. It is pretty well designed and made, and the waterproofing as well as the use of AA batteries as opposed to some horrible built in rechargeable are definite selling points for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Stout Motor&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to switch attachments&lt;br /&gt;+ AA battery&lt;br /&gt;+ Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;+ Compactness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great all in one.</li>
    <li> This is handy for quick trims of sideburns, beards, and mustaches.  The attachement for using a razor blade on the thing is laughable.  Just get a regular fusion handle if you you want to shave.</li>
    <li> Finally found a trimmer that lasts!  Using this for pretty much all over and works great.  Durable and lasts.</li>
    <li> Great product from Gillette. Although i prefer wahl&#x27;s beard trimmer. This product is good too</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day I LOVE the box it came in. Very well priced. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, inexpensive, convenient, water proof.  Awesome buy for the money...</li>
    <li> I bought this mostly for trimming body hair. Though I am not usually looking for shaving level removal, I still look for a very close crop. I would rate this good, but not perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The looks, form and design is really good. You get a good grip at all times and there is never any risk of dropping this accidentally. The batteries (2 AAAs) also last reasonably well. If you are a frequent user, I would recommend investment in rechargeable ones. I think lack of built-in rechargeable batteries is a big drawback. However, I was aware of this when I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance is also very good. Not very noisy, and it handles longer growths very well and I never had the feeling that it is about to get clogged. I do clean it frequently during the operation as well. The shave was not as close as I like to have. Also, with short hairs, sometimes it just misses, even with multiple passes. I think this is an area where there is definitely scope for some improvement. Lack of a close shave means that setting the &#x27;edge&#x27; of my mustache and beard still needs a razor. This won&#x27;t do. For other body hair, this is fine. However, I acknowledge that this was never advertised as a razor, so I am not really disappointed in this regard. I haven&#x27;t used the provided shaving blade yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three trim length controlling attachments are included and work perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking for an electric shaver like performance, look elsewhere. Otherwise this should handle your trimming and close cropping needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this for shaving &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; because using a razor was too painful, so i decided to try a trimmer. When i recieved it though, i&#x27;ve been using t for my whole body. It runs on a single battery, but dont let that fool you, it has some pretty good power. It can trim remarkably close too. The blade is a nice touch to use for shaving too. The trimmer also comes with 3 different sized trimmer heads so you dont have to completely buzz off wherever you&#x27;re trimming. The battery has also lasted remarkably long, it is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this small, inexpensive battery powered shaver, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It is easy to use, pops open to wash clean under running water, and isn&#x27;t very noisy. My facial hair is medium strong so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for you on super tough fur, but for me it is working great.</li>
    <li> Interchangeable attachments are useful. Perfect for trimming my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;But somewhat hard to clean as bristles get stuck inside the shaver head and do not get rinsed out. I usually have to use a brush to clean it out.</li>
    <li> The hubby loves it and I love how he looks after a quick trim. He&#x27;s lazy when it comes to shaving, but this is perfect in the shower and has encouraged him to keep his beard well-groomed.</li>
    <li> Excellent, versatile product. I use it every day for all my shaving and trimming needs and I travel with them packed in a ziplock bag.</li>
    <li> Good, I wish there were more comb sizes for the trimmer though.</li>
    <li> looks pretty cool. chose it because it was very stylish and the price.  i would recommend this product!  Thanks for looking!</li>
    <li> Lasted about 2 months, glad I bought 2 of them. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, just dont like the hairs that go under the trimmer, pretty hard to clean it out. But great for using in the shower.</li>
    <li> Love it. Super cheap for it&#x27;s functions.</li>
    <li> purchased for my boys for Christmas and it is perfect</li>
    <li> Great, cuts low and doesn&#x27;t leave stubble. Loved it. Glad I chose these. I would recommend this to anyone. Try it out for yourself and you&#x27;ll see why I&#x27;m so confident</li>
    <li> I knew I would love the product before I even got it (just a feeling I guess), and I was right! Very good trimmer and very VERY manageable in comparison to my trimmer on my Norelco electric shaver (although that shaver did last me a long time). Glad I upgraded to this bad boy!&lt;br /&gt;  There was one odd thing though... my package came with the trimmer, a battery, the shaver head and three trim guards, just like the package said. The three trim guards were supposed to range in closeness of trim from 1 to 3 (1 being very close). I instead got two number 2 trim guards and a number 3 trim guard. I was slightly irritated since I had been waiting to use this shaver and was not excited at the idea of having to send it back and wait at least another week or so to get a complete set. So instead, I called customer service and explained my situation... MUCH to my surprise they just up and sent me a whole new set of 3 guards no questions asked! I was waiting to hear which hoops I needed to jump through but nope! EASILY the best hassle-free experience I&#x27;ve EVER had with customer service. That only prompts me to get there products whenever it is an option (great quality product anyway!). Thank you Gillette for that breath of fresh air, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product :)</li>
    <li> The Proglide works very well for everything Gillette says that it does.  The only draw-back is that the replacement razor blades are almost as expensive as the original device!</li>
    <li> Beard trimmer works well and good for man scaping, but the razor part is kinda bulky. The trimmer makes it worth the purchase tho</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! Its battery-operated and combined with the fine blades gives a painless smooth shave. Its ergonomic and comes with a trimmer too.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do</li>
    <li> Great value and very functional - I wish it had a charger, though.</li>
    <li> This thing looks like a toy. I was so embarrassed when my boyfriend opened the box. He asks me &amp;#34;Is this a travel shaver?&amp;#34; uggghhhhhh!</li>
    <li> This thing has totally sweet hair trimming abilities that no other trimmer has (sort of)&lt;br /&gt;The responsibility of said trimmer is greater than any other trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head now for about 2 months, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far for shaving.  Closest shave, with minimal to no nicks/cuts.  The trimmer works great, but it takes several passes to get all of my thick/rough beard.  The edger is also a nice feature that works great.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d get something like this, but what with an $8 coupon and a positive review in the Wall Street Journal I decided to give it a try. The WSJ review gave it the highest marks of all trimmers and electric razors including really expensive ones (up to $500-600??).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I haven&#x27;t even used the blade yet. Still using up a pack of cheap disposable razors. By the way, the razor is not electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works really well. I was very surprised. If you&#x27;ve let your beard grow more than 1/8\\&quot; past your tri length this device doesn&#x27;t work well. On the other hand it&#x27;s perfect for regular and frequent mustache and beard trims. The three combs (sizes 1, 2, and 3) clip on easily and are securely fastened by a spring loaded clip easily operated with a thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you use the combs or not, the trimmer is small enough to easily work the area around the mouth. It gives the best lip edge trim I&#x27;ve ever given myself without mustache scissors. The blades are almost as sharp as my Oster clippers, judging by how the hair scatters. This thing is a lot more convenient than my Oster, because there&#x27;s no heavy cord. It&#x27;s a lot less of a production to use the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 1/3 of the weight is the battery. The trimmer isn&#x27;t rechargeable, but I&#x27;m planning to use rechargeable alkaline batteries after the Duracell it came with dies. So far the battery has lasted 2 hours without dropping power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at Target because of the coupon. The retail packaging is difficult to take apart without damaging the components. I recommend buying it at Amazon to get the more intelligent bos packaging they offer.</li>
    <li> This was a great shop, thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t really too powerful to do much and it&#x27;s so small at the same time. The blades don&#x27;t stick out very much so it&#x27;s safer to use in your lower region. But for your face I don&#x27;t recommend it at all, Not powerful enough. Got one for my friend and they said the same thing. Nice concept but it doesn&#x27;t really deliver.</li>
    <li> I had a $50.00 Norelco vacuum trimmer which went on the fritz, and at the same time, I received a 1/2 price coupon for this in my Kindle Fire. Does what it is supposed to for a much lower price. Granted, it doesn&#x27;t suck up the stubble, but again, for what turned out to be a $9.00 purchase (less with some Amazon points that I had), I cannot complain. Nice also for traveling - I can use it as both a razor and a trimmer - no need to carry both. Uses the same blades as my razor too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco sent me a new trimmer - sold it on eBay for $40.00, so I was a happy camper in all ways.</li>
    <li> This is definitely add on to my Gillette fusion.. Great product.. I would recommend to all.. Though Gillette should correct the price for cartage :)..</li>
    <li> I brought this styler a month back and it works fine and shave is more closer and the trimmer is really good but my only problem with this is the detachment for use of different adapters and for the use of trimmer. It is difficult to open and press button does not work better. One more change which can be done in future models is keep distance between the detachable arrow and power button. I have average size hands but still it troubles while opening the adapter, power button switches on. As Per shave goes, it is the best product in the market.</li>
    <li> Use it regularly. Gillette uses this to sell their blades---very expensive, thinking about going to a single blade like the old days.</li>
    <li> Very good! but blade adapter broke in less than one year.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would be something, I could throw in a shaving kit so when work send me on an overnight,I wouldn&#x27;t have to drag,shaving gel,after shave,razor,and then my beard trimmer,trimmer charger,the right Guide for the trimmer....Great Convenient,no crap I wish I had my trimmer moments.Love it only took a single AA battery,I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of power,and needing a special plug to charge my trimmer...All in one...I love the idea...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving - For the past 20 years of shaving,I&#x27;ve shaved with a handle that is slightly larger than a pencil,maybe a nice beefy pen.The I shaved with the 3 in 1 styler which has the handle of a round hairbrush.I thought it felt wieldy,like I wasn&#x27;t as precise,it took my longer,because I had this bigger/longer handle.I kept getting in my way while trying to shave normally.It didn&#x27;t feel like shaving, it felt a little like hand to hand combat with a hair brush.Being a Gillette fusion blade,that I&#x27;ve used previously,the shave was normal,just more difficult.So while it does work as a shaver,I don&#x27;t want to go back to being 16 and relearn how to shave.So for me it doesn&#x27;t work well as a better shaving experience...Even worse for a travel kit,that I might not use every time I shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer - Bad,what am I supposed to trim with this?My arm hair? The blade guards are far too short to trim anything other than maybe your kids pet hamster.The longest blade guide isn&#x27;t even the shortest guide on my beard,and mustache trimmer...So as an average man with real facial hair,it&#x27;s useless.I understand it&#x27;s not really for \\&quot;beards\\&quot; but I&#x27;m struggling for what good guides this short are for.It&#x27;s not going to replace my beard &amp; mustache trimmer (even in a pinch),and I can&#x27;t see it really being good for small jobs,that I&#x27;d rather use my beard &amp; mustache trimmer for anyway...Useless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t like the idea,of all my shaving gel,facial hair I&#x27;ve shaved off on the trimmer blades.When I rinsed my shavinghead off,the trimmer blades are pretty exposed to all that muck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is good,but not for men..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just failed all around as a shaver trimmer,that I was looking for,I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this (I regret that I did),unless you really are into manscaping</li>
    <li> The best one I ever had.... And I had a lot!!!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these already and the glue that holds it in the trimmer mode came off and fixing it was too much of a hassle. I just hope this one doesn&#x27;t break as fast.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor and trimmer on the market. The grooming trimmer is better than all other companies. Gillette and Braun got it right.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who loves it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The guards that come with this are subpar at best and a same priced product from Remington trims much better.  As for being a razor, the handle feels awkward.</li>
    <li> So I have always liked to keep a little facial hair giving me a \\&quot;stubble-ish\\&quot; look all the time, and I have to say this product is great for that! It&#x27;s extremely convenient to  be able to go from shaving my neck with a metal razor to trimming along my jawline with precision in a matter of seconds. Also, this trimmer feels sturdy and is really easy to clean out the excess hair so it doesn&#x27;t get jammed. I have used around 3 beard trimmers before this and none of them were as effective, sleek, or cheap as this one is! I would definitely recommend it and will buy one again if the need arises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This is not an electric razor. It&#x27;s a regular razor with a battery-powered vibrator in the handle. Adds nothing to using it as a razor. I could add a vibrator to my bicycle and call it an electric bike. If someone can tell me what vibration does to enhance a shave, I&#x27;d like to hear it. Oh, and it uses Gillette&#x27;s most expensive blade.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything I ever need for my face.</li>
    <li> It is not working. I could use for only twice :(</li>
    <li> I have just used the trimmer, but it glides across the skin smoothly, and it shaves close, but not too close to leave razor bumps. the blade shaver which I use on my mustache and right below my lower lip, got all the hair with one swipe with a nice close shave. I high;y recommend this product</li>
    <li> Just got it !! :) love it .</li>
    <li> Got this in the mail today. I opened the package and to my suprise the entire thing was covered in hair trimmings. I thought I was buying a new product.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer if you wear a short beard and it isn&#x27;t too thick. It seems to be fairly well made, but I found I like my bread a little longer than the longest #3 trim guide provided. It trims my beard to about 1/4 inch, which is a little too short for me. Also, if your beard is thick, you will be standing at the mirror for a while. Finally, the trim guides are a pain to change.</li>
    <li> great little device. works perfectly</li>
    <li> Got this on sale and i love it, can trim the beard and side burns with ease. Only issue is cleaning the darn thing because there isnt a added brush to wipe of the excess hair stuck inside. I know this is water proof but I&#x27;m an old fashion type of guy!</li>
    <li> Styler is really good and works well...works great as trimmer...well built...</li>
    <li> Compact and sleek design. I found the angle of the trimmer slightly inconvenient though. Hard to keep the same length when you are going across your chin line.</li>
    <li> This styler is the best shaving tool I have ever used. It does everything it is advertised to do. The edge trimmer located at the top of the blade head for line shaping is only average, but the close shave using the blades are smoother than any used before. The three beard trimming combs for length do a great job, but I wished there was a few longer lengths available. I recommend this this styler to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Since first posting this review I shaved my beard completely off using the trimmer. I recommend using downward cutting motions otherwise you may experience what others have written about the trimmer hangups and potential clogging and opening the trimmer head. I still give this unit the same rating though!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my man and he said it trims really nice around everything but of you want to get up close and personal,  use something else.</li>
    <li> Works excellent to keep bead looking well kept</li>
    <li> Nice construction but blade don&#x27;t give close shaves.Have to constantly press down blade to my hair to cut.Need better sharper  blade for close cuts.Will stay with my regular shaving razor.</li>
    <li> This product impressed me!! Works as well as an expensive trimmer at a much lower cost. I love the trimmer with different size guides.</li>
    <li> Great for my new beard. It was needed well to maintain my beard.</li>
    <li> I used Gillet Mach 3 and Fusion and I bought this for trimming, I really like this product Now Im enjoying when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;Nice Design and good quality</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. Very easy to use, solid material, nice grip, small and suitable for travelling. Good value for money and highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packing of the item for shipment shall to be improved though. The rest is fine..</li>
    <li> Bought this last week, have used it 4 times. It works as advertised has 3 connectors for different lengths, 4 if you count the one when not using the connector. I haven&#x27;t used the blade yet. I have a beard and this thing works. I haven&#x27;t used many but for the price I don&#x27;t see why you would need to try any others when this one works at 17$. Highly recommend. If you count it as a con the only one would be it uses AA battery so just make sure you keep a few extra around. I hear it lasts about a month or more per battery.</li>
    <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little AA-battery-powered trimmer/styler and razor attachment is great for home use and travel.  It comes with a useful plastic stand that keeps the trimmer, razor attachment, and three comb attachments all neatly stored on your bathroom counter.  And for travel, it all fits easily into a small toiletries bag.  The included 5-blade razor is quick and sharp by itself, but when you couple it with the vibrating powered trimmer handle, you actually do get an even closer shave, even though it took me a few shaves to get used to the feeling.  The back of the 5-blade razor has a \\&quot;precision edging blade\\&quot; that lets you precisely shape and edge your sideburns.  Sometimes, depending upon how much I have let my sideburns grow out, I find it easier to just use the powered trimmer without either the razor or comb attachments and using the trimmer by itself does a great job of shaping my sideburns with crisp clean lines.  The build quality is good, with nice styling, and it is great that I can use it in the shower too.</li>
    <li> For the price its great. I was worried it would be a wasteful purchase, but it works fine. I have a goatee, and for the past year I have used it to trim my beard and to shave. It works fine on all counts, although obviously a regular shaver is more convenient for regular shaves. But this is very well designed and has served me well.  It is solidly built.</li>
    <li> However, I bought this product in bit cheaper due to having a coupon, I doubt this is an original product and not refurb. As this products contain blade used for shaving, it must be sealed pack but what I got is not sealed. Instead everything is like refurbed and rearranged in new pack. Original and new pack is different if you visit any of the store. I seriously doubt this may be used item and as unsealed, I one should not consider even buying as an option. Better to throw this right away. Amazon should specify if its new/refurb so one can think twice before buying it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler after seeing it was supposed to be a great tool for facial hair detailing and lining.  And after owning it for a month or two now, it&#x27;s definately a good trimmer to be battery powered, but not great as it is advertised.  First I&#x27;ll list the pros...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Great for shaving-With the fusion proglide heads, this razor is awesome.  It has the same quality, but better since it has the higher quality handle.  I threw away my old proglide handle in favor of this sleeker and more efficent design.  As far as the face shaving aspect of this product, it&#x27;s excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for trimming your facial hair-Another aspect where the Styler is excellent.  I&#x27;ve used it to trim my goatee and sideburns quite a few times, and it gives an even and effective trim.  Plus, it&#x27;s the original reason I bought the Styler, since my Phillips Norelco beard trimmer cut and trimmed my facial hair unevenly.  With this though, trimming is very fast and simple.  I also like how the trimmer comes with three length combs, making it easy when I decide to grow a beard and blend my goatee with interchangable trimmer combs.  When trimming my goatee, I used the 3 guide comb, which is perfect for trimming the length on shaggy hair without completely oblitterating my goatee.  Then, when I wanna grow my beard out, I used the 1 guide comb to blend my goatee in with my stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes complete with a stand to hold everything-I couldn&#x27;t believe for $20, I got a razor/trimmer/attachment combs/tray.  The tray that comes inside the packaging means your bathroom will be more organized than using traditional razors or trimmers.  It&#x27;s also smart the way the tray has 3 openings in the back for each guide comb and one opening in the top for the fusion head attachment to rest in.  And the fusion attachment head is built efficently, since it has an attachment that fits neatly on top of the trimmer head.  It also looks cooler and makes storage easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the cons...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Not great for lining facial hair-While this trimmer is perfect for trimming facial hair and shaving, it&#x27;s not great at lining a beard, sideburns or goatee.  This actually surprized me, since the Gillette campaign in the advertisements claims it&#x27;s great for lining and detailing.  Specifically showing in the commercials how supposedly great it is in detailing and lining facial hair.  In that department, it&#x27;s a bit of a disappointment, but I&#x27;ve never found any cartridge razor that can line as well as a disposable razor, and this is no exception.  And as far as the edger is concerned, the few times I&#x27;ve tried lining with it, it never did a phenominal job, more like mediocre at best, since in most instances I wound up using a disposable razor to correct it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have a long battery life-Not really too surprizing here, since I&#x27;m kind of OCD when it comes to keeping my facial hair looking neat.  Plus, I have used it more often than just on my face, thus a partial reason why the battery isn&#x27;t lasting very long.  I&#x27;d say the average battery life of the Styler would be a month if not used for body hair or any other non facial detailing purpose.  Since it&#x27;s so efficent though, this isn&#x27;t a major issue for me.  Others might see it that way however, since batteries are kind of costly to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not great for use on body hair or lining the back of your neck-I really don&#x27;t consider these two areas major issues, since the Styler is only intended for face use anyway.  I feel though that I must point out for those who think this might be great for trimming body hair or good for lining your neck in between barber visits, this isn&#x27;t the tool for either purpose.  With this being a battery controlled trimmer, it&#x27;d take you forever to use on body hair.  Plus, to me using something on your body hair that&#x27;s intended for your face is kind of cross contaminating anyway.  I initially thoughtI might be able to use this for lining my neck hair in between trims, but this won&#x27;t leave an even cut or line.  Something my old beard trimmer could do, but again not a big deal to me, since this product is for facial shaving and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rate this 4 out of 5 stars since it&#x27;s great at shaving and trimming facial hair.  Really, for about $20 bucks, this Styler is a quality invcstment for any guy.  It can do most things a beard trimmer can at half the cost(not counting the cheapo pieces of crap trimmers).  I wish this thing was rechargable, then it would be darn near perfect.  If you&#x27;re expecting to be using this for any other purpose than facial hair, you might want to invest in a good body hair trimmer or hair clipper set instead.  Otherwise though, I have been happy with this purchase and would buy another set once it needed replacing.I might be able to use this for lining my neck hair in between trims, but this won&#x27;t leave an even cut or line.

    <li> It&#x27;s small but it comes in a HUGE box. I don&#x27;t get the logic. It works about as well as a battery operated trimmer can operate so only time will tell if it was a good investment. One thing that helps was Amazon&#x27;s coupon which made this about the cheapest trimmer one the market. I&#x27;m cheap, too so, it was a match made in heaven. The 3 trimmer options don&#x27;t really match what my old trimmer could do but it died and I was forced to make a quick decision. While I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to love it, I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> Picked this up for a Christmas gift.  The item itself is great but the packaging it came in was not really of gift wrapping quality but unless I took it out of the box and wrapped loose I had little choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 1 star rating because Amazon doesn&#x27;t have anything lower.  It took one try to conclude it was totally useless for my purposes.  I have a full beard that is cropped fairly close to the chin line.  I found the Fusion Pro Glide razor head too thick and bulky to perform any type of precision shaving at the edge lines.  Coupled with the trimmer as a handle, it was extremely awkward to use.  I attempted to use the battery operated trimmer along the lip line underneath my moustache and got nothing.  The trimmer is not sharp enough and does not get close enough to cut anything.  Trying to trim the rest of my beard with the snap on combs was an exercise in futility.  The trimmer head is too small and the 3 combs do not provide enough flexibility in terms of hair length.  All in all, I found this product to be a total waste of money.  The best part was the Duracell battery which I removed before throwing the rest in the trash.  Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t get taken in by s slick marketing campaign designed to sell overpriced razor heads.  If Gillette had spent as much money on the product as they did on the packaging it might be a different story.  There are a number of small rechargeable beard/moustache trimmers in the same price range that out perform this product and a variety of disposable razors that offer more precise shaving.  I&#x27;d rather have a couple of products that perform well instead of one that does not.</li>
    <li> I really love it.  I only use the razor part for me - my husband uses the whole thing.  It is a great product for the price, my husband and I both have one.  It shaves so well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick and packaging was great</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I was pulled in by the commercial, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a product that delivered on its promise. The Fusion ProGlide Styler is a versatile, powerful-yet-gentle grooming tool. I&#x27;ve always been reluctant to put a powered razor on my skin, so I also purchased the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Clear Shave Gel to serve as a conditioning buffer between skin and machine. I am impressed by the ProGlide&#x27;s range of function in the shower. I&#x27;ve found that the trimmer trims a lot more than beard, if you know what I mean. The kit includes enough accessories to make even the most high maintenance well-groomed person happy. On the down side, the cartridges sell at a price that would only make a Gillette stockholder happy, but they have a stellar performer on their shelves.</li>
    <li> The Ultimate multitool for man hygiene</li>
    <li> This trimmer works wonders for a great many uses, from beards to moustaches, to even pubic areas, and it generally won&#x27;t nick you unless you&#x27;re not being careful in those most sensitive of areas...</li>
    <li> Brother has one, you shave, trim, &amp; detail all in one. Id recommend it to anyone..Buy it instead of wasting money on all those other trimmers for detail.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Exactly what one should expect from an $18 razor.</li>
    <li> Broke after a single mild use. If you want the most expensive disposable razor then by all means. I tried new batteries and still won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> Great Trimmer! I really enjoy having a shaver and trimmer in one, not to mention it looks great on your bathroom counter top :)</li>
    <li> Very sharp trimmer, cuts hair very well. Be careful where you use it, you may cut yourself without knowing you did.</li>
    <li> It is a great little machine. Perfect size, power and maneuverability, but at this point I go through one Duracell max every time I have to shave and it only lasts about an hour. I even take the batteries out when it&#x27;s not in use. I even tried using other batteries. Nope.</li>
    <li> Perfect for beard and pubes</li>
    <li> This product is Ok but in fact the Norelco trimmer is so much more useful it&#x27;s not even funny.  For the same preice you gat the same 3 trimmers plus a shaver that allows  you to shave in tight spaces needed for managing your facial manscaping needs.</li>
    <li> I recommend this beard trimmer to anyone and everyone that asked my opinion on it. For the money it is the best one you can buy.</li>
    <li> Its a must have styler but dont expect it to cut thick beard.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift, and the kids likes it.  He likes the trimmer part and says the razor shaves well.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Great product.easy and comftorble to use but seems like it drains the battery somewhat faster.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one of these I&#x27;ve had. The 1st one lasted for about a year then died. Hopefully this one will last a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Loved it, and the trimmer is perfect, and works flawless. Good quality and as promised. Delivery was quick and easy.Would recommend it any day</li>
    <li> When I saw the commercial for this on TV, I was a bit skeptical. I thought to myself hmmm it&#x27;s probably just another product by gillette. I like to keep my face trimmed so I was like why not, let me give this a try. It&#x27;s cheap and if worst comes to worst I won&#x27;t be losing a lot. So, this arrived within 2 days of my order (thanks to amazon&#x27;s prime membership). Now, first thing that caught my eye right off the bat was how well built the little razor actually looked. The design is very nice and the grip itself feels great holding in hand. But enough about the looks, let&#x27;s get on with the features of the razor. First of all the razor is a trimmer that comes with 3 seperate clips depending on how long you want to trim your beard. 2nd it comes with only one pair of razor but don&#x27;t worry the set comes with a little holding stand where you can put everything together and put it aside in your bathroom. The stand makes the razor look very nice and professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now the most important part is to answer the question how well does it perform? Well, let&#x27;s just say I feel like I don&#x27;t need to buy another razor ever again. This razor turned on with vibration, gave me one of the most closest shave I have ever gotten. I have very sensitive skin but this razor just glides through and leaves me no marks and leaves my skin feeling great. But that&#x27;s not it, the best part about this little device has to be the trimmer. This trimmer can buzz through any thick hair and I mean any. I use this as my body groomer now. What used to take me 30 mins in the shower now takes about 2 minutes. This thing is worth way more than it&#x27;s price and I am glad I decided to try it. I hope anyone looking for a trimmer and razor decides to go with this purchase you won&#x27;t be dissapointed. This is like a body groomer also, so you cannot lose.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband as a father&#x27;s day gift.  He loves it.  He keeps his beard nice and trim</li>
    <li> excellent product. high Quality</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift - worked great for about 6 months, until it stopped turning on. New batteries helped for a while, but now even with new batteries it won&#x27;t turn on. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had originally given this five stars, and after having two of them bust within six months of purchase I&#x27;m deeply suspicious that these are designed to break.  Neither one made it past a second battery.  Not sure?  Scroll to the top of the screen.  Notice the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; button?  Why would anyone need to have a new one delivered on a regular basis?  Now look at all of the competing groomers and you&#x27;ll see that none of them have a subscription button, because they aren&#x27;t intended to be disposable like this is.  There are far more reliable groomers for the price, some of which come with rechargeable batteries and chargers.  Save your money and avoid this one.</li>
    <li> Got the box but missing thing in it</li>
    <li> Exactly what was described</li>
    <li> Very versatile to use to trim hair anywhere on your body and the razor attachment is very handy when you don&#x27;t want to travel around with multiple means of shaving. Also, note, this is double A battery powered</li>
    <li> Used it the day I got it and what a relief.  No scary feeling shaving down there.  Perfectly happy!</li>
    <li> Normally I would never write a review after 1 use, however this Gillette Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 Styler Special Pack warranted one. When I was checking it out, saw a review that mentioned how good it felt in your hand, untill I held it in my hand to shave, I had no idea how huge that point was. Never have I had a manual razor feel this solid and in control while shaving. Lets face it, this is a man&#x27;s razor, and we want our tools to be substantial, well-built, and, well, manly, &amp; this tool fits the bill. If you purchased this for the handle alone, I think you&#x27;d be happy. (although I did get mine on 1 of their deals for 14 bucks, &amp; I already have a Fusion Proglide, so have blades for it) But it does come with more, trimmer &amp; styling combs. Since I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for years, I always had to trim the length later with a cordless electric trimmer. In just 1 time being able to trim lenght with the styler comb in the shower, well, I am singing in the shower (sorry couldn&#x27;t resist). With its powered action, the styler trimmer did a beautiful , and quick job of trimming to length. Only negative I found, its very hard to release the blade, or comb without hitting the button to turn it on. Bottom line, even after 1 shave, its the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. One last note, if your not shaving in the shower, get a fogless mirror &amp; try it with whatever razor you use. You won&#x27;t believe how much the extra moisture helps, and I swear the blades last longer too.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this item. I realize it is an inexpensive alternative, but (for me) it borders on useless. Other people may be fine with it. The head is very small and the attachments seem questionable in both function and the ability to stay connected. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying that I like the trimmer since this is the first trimmer that really worked to keep my beard at the length i like. However the trimmer stopped working after barely a month&#x27;s use. Thinking a fluke, i ordered a second one and that one broke after about a month&#x27;s use as well. I use fresh batteries (Duracell), only use it about once a week to trim my beard.. so can&#x27;t really blame it on abuse. Too bad.. its a good idea but either i had bad luck with it (twice!) or there is a quality issue here.</li>
    <li> Whatever&#x27;s, it worked the first time at least .lol</li>
    <li> A really easy shave so close and comfortable, plus the trimmer works perfect on the face and body. All around great product!!!</li>
    <li> i recevied in open damaged box , some contents missing</li>
    <li> Great product! Had one of these since came out. Replacing it wit a new one.</li>
    <li> Ad said MADE IN USA, but when i received the product, it was made in china. I got arefund.</li>
    <li> This product keeps everything you need in one place for ease of use. The trimmer seems to open when I remove the guides and shaver which helps to remind me to rinse the trimmer clean. I don&#x27;t know if it is intended to do so, but is a good reminder. The three guides seem to limit your range of length but I only use the #2 guide so I am fine with it. The blade attachment is a bit cumbersome when attached to the power trimmer head. Other than that it is a nice product and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a rather flimsy and cheaply made &amp;#34;as see on television&amp;#34; product that broke after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a MUCH better product, and comes with three different &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; that attach over the blade to control the length of the trim you want. great for trimming the cookie duster and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and for that matter, any other unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it runs on one AAA battery that comes with it, and razor attachment if you want to shave rather than trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;although I don&#x27;t use it this way, it is waterproof and can be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this latest offering from Gillette. It has a nice weight to it -- definitely doesn&#x27;t feel cheap -- and is grippy to hold, though the razor has quite a bit of bulk to it when using the Fusion ProGlide attachment. Not something to stop me from using it, but it&#x27;ll take a little adjustment over the \\&quot;finesse\\&quot; I had with a regular Fusion handle. The trimmer is really where this thing shines. The Braun-branded trimmer is quite powerful and is perfect for shaping up my facial hair. I use it for sideburns and to keep a unibrow at bay. Gets the job done very nicely. Nothing to plug in, it runs off a single battery and the included stand is very space-saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re already a Fusion user, this is a nice upgrade. If not, consider it just for the trimmer. I&#x27;m happy with how much counter space I&#x27;ve reclaimed and that all my face care appliances are now in one convenient package.</li>
    <li> first of all its just basic, so dont expect anything great..  if u r looking for more comfort and more features then there are better products in the market...  otherwise it is a decent product..  will not call it a steal but yes its ok..</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer average shaver.Did not come with any instruction but it was simple enough to figure out. Only question, is it waterproof?</li>
    <li> Very efficient&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for almost over a month and I didnt have to change the batteries yet&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Like the single battery and size, it gets its job done.  I may pick up more of these for my travels . . .</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. Good buy !</li>
    <li> simple amazing product &amp;#34;-&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  If you have a short/stubble beard this is a great device.  I, however, have a substantially longer beard, and, failed to read the fine print.  The longest attachment brings my beard down to a length that is just too short for me.  It is useful for trimming the beard line, and, the Gillette razor attachment does a fine job, although, looking at how expensive the replacement blade cartridges are, I doubt that this will be my main neck/cheek razor.  Their 4-blade Mach whatever-it-is works fine for less.  It is nice to be able to pop open the beard trimmer assembly and wash out the trimmings.  Just not what one needs for a longer beard.  Back to the drawing board.  I may try a hair clipper with attachments that very cutting lengths from those available with this unit up to a couple of inches long.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and multiple features for styling your facial hair</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer for hair anywhere.  Three different blade heights and then use none for super fine trimming. a a</li>
    <li> Just received it today in the mail and used it. The trimmer is really precise and sharp. Very detailed shaved. I previously owned the razor itself (Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor) and it is great! This 3-in-1 styler is perfect for anyone who likes a scruffy beard and good looks.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works very well. Does everything it says it can. I love the design. Its not cheaply made. Only weird thing about it is that you have to attach the razor to use it, but no big deal.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion is an incredible trimmer. It allows for different styles and is extremely economical. Definitely thinking about buying a second one</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer and the price is very reasonable.  I use it mostly for trimming my beard and sideburns and I don&#x27;t use the razor part very often.  The trimmer feels very solid and fits the hand well.  Works good for trimming ear hair also.</li>
    <li> My boys like this product. Works well for them. They do not have heavy facial hair.</li>
    <li> Husband still using this years later</li>
    <li> I chose to write this review because I just trashed my Gillette Fusion. It was a good shaver, not so good of a trimmer but a nice concept. Too bad Gillette chose to test my satisfaction with ridiculously priced refills. $50 bucks ! Really? Yes, really, at a warehouse club. I can afford it, but I won&#x27;t. Sorry Gillette, you just lost my business and I&#x27;ll remember tomorrow when I replace it.</li>
    <li> Good performance and protection to blade as the stand is good. It is a bit heavy especially as compared to Wilkinson</li>
    <li> This combo does it all.  I bought it for those days when I&#x27;m just too lazy to fully shave, I can just turn this thing on and use the long hair trimmer so I don&#x27;t look like a total lumberjack.</li>
    <li> Coming from the Mach 3 turbo, the razor on this Fusion is huge and due to the bulkiness, a bit difficult to shave around things, like goatees, to maintain a straight line. You almost have to have the groomer to make it work well together. Used it in the shower for a super smooth shave this morning so for a quick shave or cleanup, this is a steal, particularly with the 3 guards you can use to clean up!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get one thing out of the way up front: if you think you&#x27;re going to spend about $20 on this and have the clippers of a barber shop, go buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve let your face and hair go for awhile and you want to use this to start over (slash through thick sideburns, remove the handlebars on your moustache, chop off the Santa-beard), it&#x27;s going to be an uphill battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you&#x27;re looking for something to edge a moustache, keep sideburns in their place on a regular basis, and make sure you have two eyebrows instead of one, this is great for you.  I use the trimmer to get the hair of my moustache that tries to curl onto my upper lip, i put on the clipper attachment #3 to keep the overall moustache down, and the razor attachment for everyday shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first kit that has let me use a manual razor without keeping the electric one around for trimming.  It&#x27;s easy cleaning, just pop the top open and spray with water.  It doesn&#x27;t look cheap so it&#x27;s not too shabby sitting there on the bathroom counter, and the little storage stand/caddy isn&#x27;t a crappy gimmick.  In fact, the section for the razor attachment even has a small hole cut out so you can put the razor away without messing up the lubrication stripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the size of this would make it awkward to hold and use, but i actually feel i have a better grip on it than the pencil-thin razor handles you usually get.  I&#x27;ll put a more in-depth review of the razor in the cartridges product listing, but in short i can&#x27;t complain.  The single \\&quot;precision\\&quot; blade on the back of the cartridge is not the face-shredder i thought it would be and lets me get in closer than the Schick precision-mode on their Hydro 5.  The 5 blades on the front clog easy with hair and at first were hard to clean until i thought to blast hot water from the back.  The precision blade can be a bit rough to clean though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because the only thing that would disappoint me is if the expensive blades don&#x27;t last long, but that will be reflected in their own review.  This product fits its niche well and if you get it knowing that instead of thinking you&#x27;ve found a way to \\&quot;beat the system\\&quot; with an inexpensive product, you&#x27;ll be just as happy as i am.</li>
    <li> Works great. Feels good to use, compared to my previous one. Though at first I wasn&#x27;t liking the multiple clips, the stand that is provided makes it easy to keep track of everything. Clever design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing missing is a cleaner brush for when the crevasses of the razor is dirty, but it seems that a toothpick works alright.</li>
    <li> perfect product. Serves all the purposes for me. beard and muctache trimming, eye brows, ears, body, etc. I does the job weel and the best part, it&#x27;s water proof.</li>
    <li> For the price its just ok, nothing fancy at all.  Wish it was a bit more powerful...</li>
    <li> I gave this to my soon to be father-in-law...he loved it! its sturdy, intuitive and sleek! he told me the shave is really close with minimal razor burns (due to the vibrations) and the grooming part really does a neat job. the only thing i reason im giving 4 stars is because its not rechargeable. it works with a single AA battery.</li>
    <li> Essential part of my routine any time I feel like manscaping a little bit.  Easy to use as highly reliable!</li>
    <li> A little trouble getting to me but it does exactly what I thought it would do.  It says it can get wet but it&#x27;s battery operated and I don&#x27;t trust it.</li>
    <li> It looks cool, but I am still confused.  Even after reading what it does, I am confused about why it&#x27;s so special.</li>
    <li> I moved to this from a straight razor for trimming my mustache.  Much better result.  The best shave with the blades and power option on.</li>
    <li> great product. This is the second one I have purchased. My first lasted about 2 years. I just bought just to be safe</li>
    <li> well it didn&#x27;t really changed my life--but after using it--it changed the razor (gillete sensor excel) that I had used since the mid 1990&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started looking around for a new razor because I was having trouble finding sensor excel replacement razors at my local grocery store.  they used to carry them but then stopped recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then saw a review of electric razors in the wallstreet journal--that review was spot on.  the regular razor give a great shave.  it also has an internal electric razor with different sized attachments to work on your beard, sideburns, and straggling ear hair--or what not.  it uses a AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the razor comes with one razor--so you may want to buy replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the price--this is great deal.  very happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor trimmer combo hands down. Works really well trimming my beard and the shave is smooth</li>
    <li> Groomer is terrible. I used a Shick before buying this and it was much better. The design changing from blade to trimmer is very cheap. The razor is good but that was the only positive.</li>
    <li> unable to cut after 10 min.......</li>
    <li> Razor works ok. Trimmed quit working on my first one after about 4 months. Hopefully this one lasts longer. I have had better razors but this one come with a trimmer. I like multitaskers and space savers. But if this one does not last. I will not buy another. I like the way their twin blade sensor works more than I do this one. That&#x27;s what I will switch back to if trimme fails again. Wish they made this to accept the sensor blades.</li>
    <li> This styler is the only styler that trims my beard and mustache perfectly. I have tried multiple ones and for some reason this just does the trick. Good price and fast shipping, even came with batteries.</li>
    <li> I was wandering through Walmart a week or so ago and seen the big display for this new trimmer kit and I immediately threw it in the carriage. I&#x27;ve been a happy Gillette Fusion Power user for years so incorporating the razor into a trimmer, with good looks and Gillette quality was a no-brainer for giving it a spin. Well I just used this tonight (trim and shave) and it works great for both. I&#x27;m totally happy with it and for under $20 for a top tier razor and trimmer, with a great design (especially coming right out of the gate with this brand new product), you can&#x27;t go wrong. Highly recommended. I paid about $18.74 at Walmart and they&#x27;re sold out now. People know and love Gillette!</li>
    <li> I wanted a quick shaver/edger and this definitely lived up to what I needed. Works very well. But again I use it for quick trims and shape ups.</li>
    <li> Gillette is the best, no rash after shaving</li>
    <li> I love this razor/trimmer, especially for less than $20!  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now with no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a base to hold everything, the &amp;#34;core&amp;#34; of the razor, three clip-on heads for trimming, and another head that is actually a razor and not a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this accomplishes both my trimming and shaving needs in one little kit - it&#x27;s also small enough that it&#x27;s easy to bring the entire thing if I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how effective it is - it works great as both a razor and trimmer.  The razor part uses the Fusion Proglide blade heads - luckily, I happened to already use a Fusion Proglide before I bought this, so I am able to use the same heads I already had on this.  I notice no difference in quality whatsoever between this combo pack and the stand-alone Fusion Proglide, which I have been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer part is also great, and is why I picked this combo-razor up in the first place.  You can use it without any of the plastic attachments and it will trim down to bare skin (though obviously not as well as a razor), or one of the three plastic combs, which trim at length #s 1, 2, or 3.  The plastic combs are sturdy and easy to attach/remove, and VERY easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing is waterproof, so you can bring it with you into the shower and avoid getting hair everywhere when you trim parts of your body.  I have never had any snags/cuts or anything like that from using the trimmer, so it&#x27;s safe to use everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great purchase.  It&#x27;s well-made and has held up to daily use for almost a year with no noticeable wear and tear.</li>
    <li> I been a Mach III user for years and decide to give this a try since all the highend shave shope are using this blade in their very expensive razors. work very well close shave love the extra bade edge for getting sideburns very even and straight.</li>
    <li> I always use only products of Gillette, it gives me comfort and pleasure. Gillette&#x27;s exactly what I want. I recommend to everyone. Thank you very much for delivery. Sincerely B.Kajaia.</li>
    <li> Works great out of the box.  I got it for less than $10 so I can&#x27;t complain.  It does what I wanted it to do. :)</li>
    <li> The price is not asking too much functionality, cheap and easy, fast moving consumer goods,easy to use, easy to maintain</li>
    <li> I bought this for the groomer and the groomer works great. The razor is nothing special, it feels nicer shaving against the grain but the overall shave is no better than my Schick Hydro. With the cost of a replacement shave head it&#x27;s worth it to stick with your razor. There was a 5 dollar coupon that brought the price down to around 12 bucks. I&#x27;ll pay that for a decent beard/mustache groomer anyway. I&#x27;ll use the razor until it&#x27;s dull and then forget about that part.</li>
    <li> It is a nice unit and if you have a very short beard or mustache it would be fine. If your hair is longer than 1/4 inch don&#x27;t get this trimmer</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, he loves that the razor has 5 blades for his very thick beard growth, the trimmers worked well on maintaining the length of his goatee and that the unit has vibration to get a clean, close shave/trim.  Also there is an edger on the back side of the razor for getting area that need precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the online Amazon coupon for this purchase also, very satisfied</li>
    <li> works wonder for me, solid built, battery thing has to be still tested how long it last,&lt;br /&gt;but does a excellent job in terms of shaving,</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he loved it! He told me that he was looking for something similar that would had all the things he needs for his beard. Anyway, I recommend this!!</li>
    <li> I had one of these for four years of heavy use and it finally gave out on me. The first thing I did was jump online to order another one and have nothing but praise for this product!</li>
    <li> Great all around razor.</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower, and no problems have occurred so far. Easy to clean(use water), easy to attach the various attachable items. The razor blade gave a fairly close shave. I&#x27;m being modest, it was a close shave. Haven&#x27;t found a use for the other 3 attachable yet. Just wish the trimmer was wider, same with the razor blades, but besides that, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> why didn&#x27;t i buy this a long time ago??? this thing is literally amazing. i love it. 5/5 without a doubt. making shaving easy</li>
    <li> Electric part worked for three minutes. That&#x27;s it. If I had not got it on a super sale I would be a bit more angry. I know it is not meant for abuse, but couldn&#x27;t even get a trim in.</li>
    <li> I was impressed by its size and multi function features, it is indeed good and works as advertised... my only concern and the major concern is, its really hard to remove the cut hair below the trimmer head... the force from the running tap water is not enough get the hair out... so I guess it will last for a year or so only...</li>
    <li> To be honest it&#x27;s very bad I didn&#x27;t like it at all also doesn&#x27;t shave perfect. ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> This us a great item. It works and gets the jobs done. This is a great trimmer for the price but don&#x27;t expect to do the same as a trimmer that is more expensive.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. Very smooth and powerful. Haven&#x27;t used all the attachments yet. Cool little stand to hold all the attachments.</li>
    <li> the handle is too big an bulky to shave with...and the blades go dull after 3-4 uses....would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it. Great price!</li>
    <li> I love the way this trims and all but you have to put in a double AA battery which I didn&#x27;t notice. The battery usually only lasts me two full trims after it can barely cut through my hair and need another new battery. Getting expensive to keep buying a bunch of batteries.</li>
    <li> Designed by a genius. About the same size as a disposable- perfect for travel. Unbelievably low price for such a great product</li>
    <li> Love this product! Useful for real!!! This combination is really good! And I&#x27;m still wondering - why it&#x27;s so cheap? :)</li>
    <li> Does not do what it is suppose to do... very bad quality !</li>
    <li> I got rapid delivery on my order and nothing was damaged. My only complaint is that I didnt get all three size combs for the styler. I got a size 1, 2 and another 2. No 3. Not that big of a deal, but I woulda liked the proper set of combs.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have a beard and like to keep it trimmed and this does it all very well. I really like the different adapter&#x27;s that fit the cutting head this makes it easy to get the trim length that you like without messing up. The fusion blade is really great for shaving.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m really pleased with this trimmer. plus i saved a bunch of money. i highly recommend this trimmer. you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> my husband received this for fathers day and he loves it!!! he can get in places that were difficult with a disposal razor.  with the attachments he is groomed very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old Wahl beard and mustache trimmer. It took me about 4 times as long to get the same end result from my old trimmer.  Not only did it cover less area at a time but it felt slower (maybe because it was battery powered?) and I had to go over it all a couple of times.  I really expected more from this after seeing the commercials. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t measure up to what I expected from a company like Gillette.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the first use of this item. I had let my beard get out of hand in the last month or so and when I saw this on the television I decided to check it out. The price is what really drew me to the item. I used the clickable coupon that was available on Amazon and I think I ended up paying less than $15 for the item because I&#x27;m also a Prime member. The item arrived 2 days later and I was trimming away. I actually enjoyed using the product. It looks and feels like a quality shaver and trimmer. I also like that it is powered by batteries because I use rechargeable batteries. I actually haven&#x27;t used the shaving part of the unit because I really hate shaving. I was able to trim my beard on my neck so closely that it shaving wasn&#x27;t really necessary. Still I&#x27;m impressed with how the razor attaches and vibrates. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it eventually, even if just out of curiosity, lol. Love this purchase.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason my local big box store can&#x27;t keep these in stock. Buy on Amazon and save a few bucks. At this price you can&#x27;t find a better quality trimmer let alone a razor as well. No cheapo plastic. It has a little weight to it and the rubberized grip feels great in your hand. The snap on combs aren&#x27;t made of brittle plastic and have a bit of flex. The base that holds it all is well designed to actually hold everything securely. The trimmer works well and didn&#x27;t pull any hairs on my beard and the fusion razor is well... a fusion razor. We&#x27;ll see how it stands the test of time. Finally a trimmer that won&#x27;t sit on the shelf. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome little gadget, everything you need in one tool.  I also like the storage base that comes with it--it&#x27;s actually functional!</li>
    <li> I had this product for roughly 3 - 4 months. probably more. Ive come to love this product. It does everything I need. Trim, Shave and line up. It makes shaving quick and easy. The product feels very secure in your hand, light and easy to move around your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision blade is my favourite feature. Helps me line up not only my facial hair but my hair line aswell. I have only used 1 blade and battery in a month untill i have to change it. However, I do only use the eletric trimmer once every week or 2. I shave every other day and precision blade I use every week or 2 aswell. So it might be different for those whos hair grows alot faster then mine and depending how you maintain your style. Overall amazing product with an amazing price.</li>
    <li> It trims, it shaves, and it edges!  To top things off, it&#x27;s waterproof!  Easy to use, easy to maintain, easy breezy everything.  Only flaw are the cartridges life span.  Other than that, it&#x27;s golden!</li>
    <li> While scrounging around the local drug store last night i came across this product and for a very low price i picked it up and im glad i did. This is what every person needs to do there basic shaving and trimming as well. I have used gillette products since they first hit the market and im still satisfied. This proglide special delivers and it replaces my standard five blade razor. I recommened this to all the the guyz out there to pick this up and i quarentee that tis will replace your old razors.</li>
    <li> This is a awesome device. It does not come with to many switchable modes and option but offer you the basic settings. Good for traveling</li>
    <li> My son loves it. Quick and easy.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this product from the Pro-Glide Power. I love that this has more functionality! I can no longer store the blades right on my unit, and not an issue at all. Would have appreciated if it included a small trimmer brush, lubricating oil, and a small comb of some sort. Overall I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my new razor. I have very sensitive skin and like to keep my facial hair trim and tidy. I also like that this has Br&amp;auml;un design, making it a beautiful piece of technology  And the price is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have complained that they have very thick growth, I have a suggestion. Try using the trimmer by itself first, getting it down lower. Then add one of the three guides to even it out and get it to the proper length. This will help eleviate the possibility of the blades jamming up and pulling hair painfully. Just a suggestion.</li>
    <li> I have gone with two of these because they do a great job, however they are hard to clean. You need a can of air to blow out hairs stuck in the cutter. Works good in the shower.</li>
    <li> This to replace a broken one. The broken one isn&#x27;t totally broke, but it was dropped and it no longer holds the trim attachments.&lt;br /&gt;It still holds the razor attachment and gives me the comforting buzz shave, so it stays in the shower. (I shave my head )The new one has it&#x27;s place in the cabinet for trimming the mustache and beard.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Less than $11.00 Delivered (After Coupon)&lt;br /&gt;Compact Beard, Mustache and Side Burns Trimmer with different size guards.&lt;br /&gt;Razor gives a pretty good shave when new.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer easily pops open to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries seem to last a while- I get about a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Multi-blade razor clogs fairly easily&lt;br /&gt;Replacement blades are expensive&lt;br /&gt;Razor is kinda big to get into some of the hard to reach areas (below nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;As a frequent traveler this takes up less space than separate razors and trimmers in my bag. I wish it was a bit shorter in length and the blades were less expensive to replace and did not clog so easily- but I haven&#x27;t found a better product to date.</li>
    <li> Underpowered but will work well as a traveling/vacation option. At the price it is an ok buy</li>
    <li> This is not a rechargeable groomer.  Bought it for the boyfriend so he can groom his hairy self, and am returning it because I would rather buy him one that is rechargeable.  We did not open it or use it.</li>
    <li> I got this Fusion proglide styler free as part of a Gillette campaign for my husband. He thought it was a great tool! It comes with three combs and a battery, ready to use. His facial hair grows really fast so he is always looking for a razor that will work great and last more than one use. He was really happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a beard trimmer since I grew a goatee back in 2002. Nothing has ever worked very well until now. I saw a review on the Askmen.com website talking about how it was as good a some $100 units, I paid $18 for it. It comes with a real Durocell battery installed and compact holding case that uses a small amount of room on the counter. That makes my wife happy. I found the attachment that works perfect for me and I now groom my beard at least every other day. Before I hated it so much that I did it sometimes once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I have never been a big Gillette fan but I have to say this a great shaver and does everything it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;Con: the packaging was weird, came in a box that was about 3 sizes to large and holes for things not in the box but I guess they are still in the testing phase.</li>
    <li> Works great with and without the guards. I wish it came in two colors, because I want a second one and don&#x27;t want to mix up the two (for obvious reasons).</li>
    <li> Found this looking for a trimmer for my beard. snd Gillette had an online coupon. so got this at steal</li>
    <li> So far so good - used it for about 10 minutes total off and on and the batteries seem new. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Works okay, but not as well as I had hoped or expected.  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t facilitate a sharp clean edge without much back and forth.  A single edge disposable does a much cleaner quicker job.</li>
    <li> This razor works great...  My husband is a hairy man and I help him shave his back, arms, and chest for weight lifting&lt;br /&gt;...Smooth shave in less time!</li>
    <li> This pro style groomer is ,believe or not !,the best thing I ran across for my face.....and other parts !&lt;br /&gt;Being a stickler for perfection in the looks department ,I have spent ,for years a lot of money !&lt;br /&gt;Anytime a new gadget came on the scene I had to buy and try it......most not worth the money and very short lived!&lt;br /&gt;But this unit I already know it is the best yet!! ........you will be amazed how easy it now is to groom......GET IT!</li>
    <li> First of all it is no Body groomer so the product itself is false advertising. The beard trimmer is very weak. I was excited so opened the box as soon as i got it. I have very thin chest hair not a hairy man by any mean. I ran it for 15 mins not even one strand of hair is gone except i become all red. Already in the process of returning it</li>
    <li> Not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  I use it in the shower and at the sink.  Keeps my beard trimmed and helps me shape it.  It also does a good job of pre-shaving the rest of my face making a the razor attachment work even better.  Razor attachment works well, but I still lather up and us my old Mach 3 at the sink to get it all clean.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of face to shave.  I play underwater hockey (Google: &amp;#34;Intro to UWH&amp;#34;) and I shave above my upper lip so that the mask doesn&#x27;t leak and just below my lower lip for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and it is performing as advertised.  It arrived quickly and I can recommend the seller.</li>
    <li> Works great, haven&#x27;t had such great facial hair in forever. I am loving having the ability to keep up my mustache</li>
    <li> I was amazed by the quality of this product. It runs fairly well and for a decent length of time off a single AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had several other more expensive trimmers and none have worked as well for a close shave in delicate areas as this one. No, it won&#x27;t replace your trimmer for a haircut, but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s meant for. Does a great job at shaving chest/back/genital hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean as well. You can run it right under the water.</li>
    <li> The razor portion of this is really good and I have yet to be cut or nicked (been using for about a year now).  For the trimmer set, this made a great travel beard trimmer.  However, the plastic guards are a bit cheap and the small plastic release tab on all three sizes broke off in less than a month.  I am able to still use this as a trimmer by holding them in place with my finger, but I wish they had been better made.  I can&#x27;t justify buying a new one just to get replacement guards that probably cost about 5 cents to manufacture.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for an unbelievable price on Amazon.  The clips (1, 2, or 3) on the beard trimmer work as expected and trim very well.  But without the clips, I found that it did not trim my beard quite as cleanly as I expected.  Overall great price and decent quality.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it all that long but it has done a nice job.  Using it to keep a beard close and tight and although the width of the cutting head is small and thus extends the time to do the job, it doesn&#x27;t bind or pull and  leaves a nice even finish.</li>
    <li> The sample cartridge they supplied dulled out after a few uses.  I&#x27;m a little scared by what the cartridge costs will be if they all burn out so quickly.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s priced right.</li>
    <li> Works great for what it is, as long as you take care of it you&#x27;ll get a lot of good uses.</li>
    <li> Little vibration frequency</li>
    <li> This product stop charging 6 months after purchase.  Worked effectively as a personal groomer but it was useless soon after purchase! Would NOT recommend!</li>
    <li> This is literally one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever bought. I can literally groom anything with this product. It&#x27;s so useful and easy to maintain. It&#x27;s saved me a whole bunch of money because I have everything in one product.</li>
    <li> Great product and super quick</li>
    <li> I like the Gillette Proglide Styler. It&#x27;s small and fits on top of the bathroom counter. It&#x27;s great for trimming mustaches and the accessories work great.</li>
    <li> This was just a stocking stuffer for christmas last year but he really loves it and is still using it. He takes it away to work with him for 6 weeks at a time so it has really held up well. Will proabably buy another one.</li>
    <li> AWESOME product! I travel and this is my GO TO shaver and styler.  The battery lasts well over a month while on the road.</li>
    <li> I have always been skeptical about all the new shaving kits, I however was surprised at the great quality of this product. It gives a very smooth shave that lasts, the 3 trimming accessories are great, they provide great levels of adjusted trimming. I am giving it 4 stars because the removal of the different accessories is a little difficult, can be annoying but overall, I would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Works great no issues</li>
    <li> This is a very flimsy shaver.  The interchangeable heads are broke and they do not give a very close trim.</li>
    <li> the motor started to freeze and one of the click is broken. Until then it worked well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t wanna keep shaving with the blades anymore and looking like a baby face every time. This thing trims short but not a cleaaaaaan shave which is awesome. I like to keep a little bit of scuff but look nice and neat at the same time and this is perfect for it. Yes it does come with a blade attachment that u can use Fusion blade with. It already has 1 blade on it. But i won&#x27;t be needing that. It does nice clean lines as well. Anyone thinking about getting this, Just do it. Its worth it.</li>
    <li> works grate, best product from Gillette so far dose every thing i need and more will work good as a present and as a groomer.&lt;br /&gt;but i would check the price everywhere before i buy it i got it on amazon for $23 and a few days later i find it at Walmart for $18 shame on me</li>
    <li> This was not what I thought I was getting... it was much smaller then photo shows... the item did not work as well as I was expecting for my money... no replacement blades or information on were to get replacement blades...</li>
    <li> This is a very cool set of cutters...You can shave and also trim yourbeard.....This was a gift from my wife..</li>
    <li> This thing is AWESOME! It&#x27;s built solid and gets the job done. The only complaint I have is replacement razor heads are pretty expensive. Gillette lower your razor head prices!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the coolest electric blade I&#x27;ve ever purchased(it&#x27;s the only one, but still!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of usefulness I find that the trimmer works good on my sideburns, and the included head takes 99% of hair off my face. My only complaint is that I wish this model was rechargeable, that way I don&#x27;t have to buy batteries.</li>
    <li> This item came in one day!!!! I had contemplated my need for another Fusion razor handle-Glad that I purchased it-aside from other features, the feel and angle on this handle seem better than my other handles. The price from Amazon undercut all stores-Thank you again Amazon</li>
    <li> I give it a two stars because the actual machiene itself can&#x27;t trim your beard at all. Like I mean the product is garbage. I do however like the fact that it comes with an attachable razor blade that can get the job done. Very upset with the money I wasted however.</li>
    <li> This body groomer from Gillette is great. It is a quality product. It has excellent balance and I can trim my body hair with ease  and without worry. No razor burn or bumps ever. My goatee is easily trimmed and shaping around my nose and mouth is quick and painless. Other unwanted body hair is also a snap with this body hair trimmer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, the grooming combs are the right height for any beard style, and it shaves great.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler 3-In-1 Men&#x27;s Body Groomer With Beard&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ITS QUALITY AND PRICE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler 3-In-1 Men&#x27;s Body Groomer With Beard...!</li>
    <li> bought a more expensive one first and was crap. loved thiis one</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the price, I bought mine at Walmart Its been good until about a month ago it has not been able to keep up with the hair growth on my face and body Granted I do have thick strong hair like superman. :) I Put fresh batteries in it and it still jams on the hair on my face and chest and stops cutting hair until i put some baby oil on it or tap it on the sink, I would not buy this again...</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Small and light weight.&lt;br /&gt;2. Regular blades can be used with trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Is not rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;2. Feels way too less on Power, since it runs on AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;3. Trimmer doesn&#x27;t work too great, gives uneven trim.</li>
    <li> I hope the electric switch works for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 19 year son in college. A reasonable price makes it a great bargain.  Compact and versatile. .</li>
    <li> So I bought this razor on January and I have been using this since. Straight shave with it was useless, so I had to do backward shave with it, which kind of damaged the way my mustache grew. I recently looked at a few tutorials online and realized that my razor has been defective the whole time. It was difficult to realize that because the whole thing was vibrating, but the blades were not, so making it effectively a non-electric razor and shaving with the grain had very little effect. I still have plenty of blades left, so I am kind of left stranded with them now. Anyway, will probably shift to a proper electric razor.</li>
    <li> good product,fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great for the price. A really good trimmer for most basic trimming. Nice and compact design as well. I recommend it to anyone looking for a easy, cheap trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion power razor (vibration) for years and it simply performs. I&#x27;ve fiddled and hated all stand alone beard trimmers. Either overpriced or left hair in the drain. Or broke. You need to consider shaving/trimming in the shower-- hair goes down the drain. Use a $15 fog free mirror. No more cleaning sinks. No more splashing water all over the sink and mirror. This Braun designed gem is water resistant. PERFECT. Do yourself a favor.</li>
    <li> This is one of my best purchases of the year. Gillette has made the perfect razor. It&#x27;s an excellent groomer and trimmer that can be used to trim and thin hair. The shave is absolutely top notch! I have thick stubble and the razor has enough pressure that does not require additional force on my part. It minimizes cuts but provides a close shave. Touchdown, Gillette!</li>
    <li> This is my lowest review thus far, on Amazon, and I stand behind it. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I guess it does some things OK, but it&#x27;s really bad, at clipping without the combs. WHen I use it to trim, with one of the attached guides, it does OK. But when I use just the clipper, without the attachments, that damned thing keeps opening up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thick beard, and trim it back until it&#x27;s stubble - which I what I bought this unit for. But the damned thing will open up and pinch my face, about five times, every shave. To use it, I have to pinch down on the head so hard, that my index finger gets fatigued. This thing is garbage! Oh, and the battery does not last long, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected with AA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using this to trim a beard with some height (eg. using one of the attached spacers), it does a reasonable job. But if you&#x27;re looking to shave that beard down to stubble, as I do, look elsewhere. I can&#x27;t believe more people haven&#x27;t run into this issue! I regret the $20 I spent on it, and with Gillette put a fraction of their Marketing budget into R&amp;D. Or maybe some of their execs should actually try using the B.S. products.</li>
    <li> This is a good idea, but the trimmer is not worth the price. The blades are excellent though. If you want to use the trimmer to do some edging, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. It&#x27;s not powerful enough to do edging. It works fine trimming with each of the combs, but edging is out. My 20 year old Con-air trimmer does better due to more power (2 AA batteries as opposed to 1 AA battery for the styler). And the replacement cartridges prices are insane, although you can get the 6 cartridge replacement from Amazon for cheaper than you can a 4 cartridge replacement at any store. I suggest buying the fusion proglide razor instead of the 3-in-1 trimmer. Not worth the money for the trimmer</li>
    <li> the set is compact, sturdy and gets the done. I love it is a fast shave right before work or if I need to clean up before I go out. also its small that doesn&#x27;t take a lot of room in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Very impressed. Won&#x27;t give you the skin-smooth shave a razor will, but it makes clean edges and uniformly trims. It even cut through my coarse hair without pulling (we&#x27;ll see how long that lasts, my hair dulls scissors and military buzzcutters).</li>
    <li> I picked one of these up at a CVS during a work trip when I forgot to pack my razor, and it&#x27;s not only become my go-to razor but it&#x27;s also supplanted a number of pricey brand name beard trimmers.  My only complaint is that the stubble guards are pretty flimsy and broke, but it&#x27;s cheaper to buy this whole set again than it would be to buy most beard trimmers out there, and you really get a remarkably accurate and good trim.  If Gillette would manufacture long-lasting high quality metal guards for this, I&#x27;d give it 5 more stars.  Absolutely a steal at the price.</li>
    <li> The only qualm I have with this product is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
    <li> Great product. I enjoyed it a lot, but after 4 or so weeks it broke.  The trimming part loses all power.  You can see that it still has good power because when you snap the head (trimming part) back to clean the area you can see the metal thing rotates with power.  But when you snap it back in place it loses most power.  Because I loved the product so much and thought this one unit was defective I bought another one.  Turns out the same problem happened and I didn&#x27;t even used it that often.  Looking for a more professional model now like a Wahl, I don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra cash.</li>
    <li> I purchase this a while back when they first came out and love it. I could not wait. Thank you</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and he loved it! It&#x27;s such a sleek, eye-catching design and it has multiple shave/trim settings so you can do just about anything with it. Prime shipping was awesome.</li>
    <li> I got this for about $7 with a coupon and for the price, it is excellent.  I like the added guards and use them to trim sideburns in between haircuts.</li>
    <li> Have bought 3 of these now as gifts.</li>
    <li> I Just purchased another styler  the last 2 have failed they just quit working...Great razor and styler feels nice in your hand and what can you say about the fusion blades there GREAT but you have to replace every few months even when you keep it out of water..They just don&#x27;t hold up .The good thing is the price easily affordable. David</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually get that excited about simple purchases like this, but I have hated just about every beard trimmer I have ever purchased.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styer 3-In-1 is the best beard grooming tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  Mind you, I just like to tidy up my beard when it gets ratty, but all of the other beard trimmers I&#x27;ve ever purchased all pull on my hair.  This thing doesn&#x27;t pull at all and it trims beautifully!  The fact that it uses a regular battery is a plus for me too.  I hope they never change this model as I think I have finally found the perfect beard grooming tool for me!</li>
    <li> Great product and a great value.  I use this thing all the time.  I made several purchases as gifts for family with mustaches and beards.  The product is durable and holds a charge well also.  m</li>
    <li> Not much to say, the stand neatly organizes the attachments and the styler in one convenient place. the styler works well and the manual razor does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Glad to have this one. Several uses with this. I shave my face/chest/arms with no problems. Battery lasts longer than others.</li>
    <li> Having had the Power Fusion Proglide for a couple of years, I tried this unit. Pass! Its trimmer is not worth the effort. I use my electric trimmer and bought a new Power Proglide after the unit stuck on. This two piece unit is way too flimsy and the trimmer is worthless.</li>
    <li> only issue is the box of this hole unit, it can be packed in smaller box and shipping  will cost less, it&#x27;s not the issue when delivery is free but when redirecting to overseas, can be considered, no issues with styler it self, works good and looks nice</li>
    <li> Für das, was er ausgelegt ist - also Trimmen und Stylen - ein TOP-Gerät! Mit dem Elektrorasierer präzise Rasieren und durch die 3 verschieden langen Kammaufsätze trimmen und mit dem aufsteckbaren Rasierklingenkopf und der Präzisionsklinge nach/feinarbeiten. Und das alles zu einem fairen Preis mit einem unschlagbaren Design!&lt;br /&gt;Das einzigste was mich stört ist die Beschriftung auf den Kammaufsätzen, dort sollte die Millimeteranzahl drauf stehen!</li>
    <li> Der Fusion Proglide Styler ist ein sehr praktisches Gerät. Er kann fast alles was Man(N) sich vorstellt. Er liegt sehr gut in der Hand obwohl man sich am anfang an die Größe und das Gewicht gewöhnen muss. was aber recht schnell geht. Die klingen sind einfach fantastich und der Trimmer ist auch sehr gut. Einzig die Trimmaufsätze wirken sehr Unstabil und gehen auch leicht kaputt. Schade ist auch das man die Aufsätze nicht nachkaufen kann.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zum Rasiergel...&lt;br /&gt;Das Rasiergel hält was es verspricht und ist super wenn man sich den Bart stylen möchte.&lt;br /&gt;Der große Vorteil ist hier natürlich das es nicht schäumt und man alles sehen kann. gerade bei anspruchsvollen Bartstyles ist das sehr wichtig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alles in allem ist der Proglide Styler ein SUPER Rasierer</li>
    <li> I was initially happy to receive this product.  Upon receiving it, I realized two of the three guards were cracked in the middle.  I would prefer to handle this directly with Gillette is one of their employees reads this, if not I guess I&#x27;ll return it within a few days if I see no response.  Other than this defect, seems like a well made product.</li>
    <li> Broke in two months using it just as a trimmer - Trying to clean the blades was very diffucut as well</li>
    <li> Bought this on sale for my husband. He absolutely loves it! Versatile and easy to use. Made very well! Small and compact but powerful at the same time!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Works great.</li>
    <li> Before buy most anything electronic from rechargeable batteries to power tools by pouring over reviews. Most people gave this high marks which is always promising. In my experience this product isn&#x27;t as ergonomic as the regular Gillette Fusion razor for shaving. The chunkier handle works great for the beard trimming combs which is it&#x27;s actual strength. The shaping tool doesn&#x27;t do much against bare skin for styling, one is better off with the Pro-Glide razor. Still if you are a facial hair enthusiast this will keep your beard sleek, friends noticed the difference immediately.</li>
    <li> the adjusting of the combs and fixing and unfixing is easy and smooth. Just keep in mind that the razor has to replaced.</li>
    <li> I bought this as first shaving kit for my teen son to trim is new bread. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Light weight, three combs, nice shape and holder. This is perfect as a groomer / trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Power and eject button location. We can accidentally press both while ejecting attachment. Mach3 Razor is better than proglide.</li>
    <li> Product as such seems good except that it should have brand new Duracell Battery that comes with the product. The battery was sort of dead which makes me wonder if the product I received was used. This should not be the case as the product is marked as Brand New.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Before, shaving was a hassle, I&#x27;d always regret the day I would have to shave because it was such a long chore.... Now my beard is always shaved for that clean look, and it takes less than five minutes too! FINALLLLLLYYY</li>
    <li> I like this better than the bodygroom I had. My bodygroom stopped charging so the fact it uses just a normal battery is a plus. I mostly use the clippers to groom my body and it works very well for its intended purpose.</li>
    <li> I use this unit a lot and it works better than any other similar styler.</li>
    <li> The whole unit is a great buy. This is my second one. Will probably be buying another one after this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Excellent and practical I liked in terms of light weight and razor degrees But I wished to be shipped by electricity lasting battery</li>
    <li> I have much more expensive razors I really think this is one of the better ones. The normal dear Jim are part of it is excellent and better than much more expensive models. The built-in attachments and the razor are really cool too. It only operates on one battery and I&#x27;m sure that it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I like the small and durable form factor, and the fact that everything fits into the little stand that it comes with, but it just isn&#x27;t heavy duty enough for any serious beard trimming.</li>
    <li> I wanted a backup replacement for my Phillips groomer just is case it failed. Now my Phillips outlived this very expensive razor. Don´t buy it.</li>
    <li> Works well. No problems with thick hair. Attachments are useless and anything that isn&#x27;t your head. Also it came in this great big unnecessary box. Like it was huge. But I can&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t like the box.</li>
    <li> Works great for sensitive skin. Easy to use and easy to keep organized wit the holder it came wit. Highly recommend for any guy wit sensitive or dry skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim as a Christmas gift for my husband. I was looking for an inexpensive trimmer to supplement his regular electric razor and Gillette fusion razor. The stand wasn&#x27;t anything special but the trimmer was great. My husband really likes it and likes to have the stand to set everything in. The stand holds extra razors too which is great. The whole thing is easy to clean</li>
    <li> This is much better than you&#x27;d expect from a &amp;#60; $20 trimmer. It drains batteries quickly, but that&#x27;s what Eneloops are for, right? I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this, considering how inexpensive it is.</li>
    <li> I only buy Gillette razor blades.  They are EXTREMELY pricey, but the comfort I feel while shaving my neck is worth the money.  I did buy this to keep the edges of my beard under control and it is just an awful product.  I do have a heavy beard, but this trimmer could not help me at all.  I could not get every piece of hair cut and I had a difficult time shaving straight across my jaw-line.  I always found myself pushing hard against my skin than I should have.  Batteries died quickly.  I know &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, but bearing the Gillette name I just expected more.  Take the money you&#x27;d spend on this, throw in a few more dollars and buy a &amp;#34;WAHL&amp;#34; brand beard trimmer.  Save yourself the frustration and disappointment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a huge Gillete fan for years, but always found myself skeptical of the beard trimmers due to the thickness of my beard. I spent years researching electric razor/bead trimmer combos that were in the hundreds of dollars, and all the while I kept seeing the commercial for the Fusion Proglide Styler. I randomly jumped on amazon and was amazed by the reviews! I gave it a shot and have been even more amazed as to how awesome this thing is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: This thing may be small, but it cuts through even my thick hair. The 3 adjustable guides allow for trimming from a stubble beard, up to about .25 inch thick. I was even more impressed with how much I like using the actual pro glide razor with the built in trimmer. Now I get the closest shave where I don&#x27;t want my beard, my beard is all the same perfect length of my choosing, AND the precision trimmer allows me to get the pesky hairs that grow over my lip and fine tune the edges of my beard. I feel like I&#x27;m getting a professional trim and shave with this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that with the single AA battery it runs out of juice quickly if your beard is really thick. I decided to use rechargeable AAs so that it would keep the cost down and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> its a really good product it shaves perfectly it trimms perfectly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 3 Trimming sizes&lt;br /&gt;Comes with its own case to put stuff&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s super easy to use&lt;br /&gt;WaterProof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;if you have long beard and you trimm it lots of hair gets inside the head of trimmer and you have to clean it for 10-15 minutes because some hair get stuck inside spring and its annoying to get hair out of it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is defiantly worth the price only giving it 4 stars because cleaning is annoying</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s malfunctions .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;has multiple sizes for hair cut .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in general it&#x27;s good if you don&#x27;t use electronic shavers .</li>
    <li> Happy with this. Been using it to trim and keep my face looking neat.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> Power and life of this product is a very short span.</li>
    <li> 2nd time purchasing this device.</li>
    <li> Did not shave as close as I wanted. Not for the Scruffy Look at all. More suited for trimming a beard. It didn&#x27;t work for me to keep the hair on your Moustache short in length, not just trimming where it hangs over your upper lip. Nor did it allow me to shave my facial hair to a very short length which I like. The stand didn&#x27;t hold the attachments well either. I did a lot of research looking for a new trimmer as my old Faithful remington is getting .. old... but it does exactly what I want. This one was inexpensive but ultimately I returned it..</li>
    <li> Ugh. I killed two of these. I&#x27;m a little heartbroken about the second one. But I think this device&#x27;s fatal flaw is that if it ever jams up---which it will once the battery dies---then the motor breaks down permanently. It was working great last week and then I went through 3 batteries in one shave and it gave up. It&#x27;s dead. My beard is not the thickest beard. I didn&#x27;t think I had to spend more money to maintain a short beard but apparently I do. Blah. I got a year out of it shaving once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> Totally as advertised. Have only had a short time, but quality seems good. The only reservation I have is that the 3 trimming guides appear to be flimsy.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one to own.  Which this one is still in box.  Only had to purchase so I could get the trimming guards as one of mine broke and your unable to purchase just the guards anywhere.  I don&#x27;t use the razor blade addon for it as trimming is what i wanted it for which it does great.</li>
    <li> I just use the trimmer. I can&#x27;t shave with the blades; they literally shred my face to pieces.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer.  Liked it so much I bought another for my son (who kept taking mine).  Easy to use, uses standard batteries, recommended.</li>
    <li> Great razor but this is our second one as the first broke very fAst but still does a great job.</li>
    <li> Excellent Blade but the trimmer is not impressive. the trimmer is not useful as it is too weak and too broad</li>
    <li> My fusion proglide lasted about 2 months. I can&#x27;t return it because return period closed. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I like this item. I picked it up in a $10 Lightning deal and glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using for over a year and only had to replace the batteries and the blade as needed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Husband as part of his Anniversary Gift. It isn&#x27;&#x27;t until May 29. So .. he knows it is here and I have tried to tempt him with it but he is happy waiting. I know how well the Fusion Razors are. I am excited I was able to get this for him and look forward to seeing him use it and hearing what he thinks about it, Then I will report back , I am a little concerned about hearing about a plastic piece breaking in other reviews and I really do hope it does not break on his. It is after all a gift. Shall report back. I had free shipping on my package as I had ordered other items too. Placed order on April 5 and received April 15. High Hopes and Great Expectations. Its a Fusion after all.</li>
    <li> I will not use any other razor, if it is not a Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gillette...</li>
    <li> This works fine but it flings the hairs all over and makes a mess</li>
    <li> Works very, very well.  Not cuts, very close shave.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Took me awhile to figure out the button to make it stay on . Not enough directions came with it. But it works fine for what I want. At a good price too.</li>
    <li> I have professional clippers and when it comes to grooming my pubes I would always be scared of getting the skin caught in the razors. I used this product and all my worries dissipated. The blade guard is awesome and gives you a close trim without getting your balls or shaft caught. I would recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be a good little trimmer for touching up sideburns, eyebrows, ear and nose hair.  For that purpose it works pretty good.  The blade shaver, on the other hand, is not.  First of all replacement blades are $3 to $4 bucks a pop.  They don&#x27;t tell you that when they sell the styler for $20 bucks.  A four blade razor also means four times the pull.  If you have gone a day and a half or two days between shaves the razor pull can be quite uncomfortable.  Personally I get a closer more comfortable shave with cheap old BIC Single Sensitive Shavers 12 pk and a helluva lot cheaper.  My recommendation, pass on this buy the BIC 12 pk for $3 bucks and put your money into the Norelco QG3360 Multigroom Plus.&lt;br /&gt;I am in no way affiliated with BIC or Norelco.  I just think both products work better for me.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased because when it works it works great. The problem is it doesn&#x27;t work more than about three months before it just quits. Very disappointing from a company as well known as Gillette.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these. Both times the trimmer works well for about three months, then abruptly stops working. The motor will spin when you open the trimmer head, but when you try to re-engage the trimmer it drags the motor to a stop, like there just isn&#x27;t enough power. Both times I made sure to put in new batteries (or duracell batteries with a power check on them). The blade attachment still works because it disengages the trimmer, but I didn&#x27;t buy this razor for that.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer.... I little hard to use on sensitive skin...</li>
    <li> He is keeping a bush under his chin, and is using this to maintain it and the rest of his face.  Not using the razor side after the first blade, just the clipper part now.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> I like it, don&#x27;t love it though. I got it with a coupon for around $7 which was definitely worth it. It is nice and good for precision work, but the cutting area is very small and it definitely isn&#x27;t something i would use for any more than occasional precision grooming personally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several different brands and types of battery operated trimmers in the past.  This is by far that best!  I thought the price might mean it would be low quality, but it&#x27;s actually really high quality.  Waterproof, compact, long battery life, easy to clean, easy to use.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I Really like this product a lot! It worked perfect for 14 months. But it&#x27;s not a 5 because now when I use it to trim zero -without any teeth- it opens when I press against my skin. I don&#x27;t need the combo 3-1 but the styler, and I&#x27;m looking for it. I just don&#x27;t find it separate. So if I buy the 3-1 combo I will have an extra kit I don&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT , WISH HAD BOUGHT IT EARLIER</li>
    <li> Loved product.  Until 2 weeks later when the part between the power body and the disposable heads broke.  This is a cheap plastic connector that attaches to the power body to enable the heads to get the vibration from the base.  You cannot use the heads without this attachment.  This attachment shall remain nameless since I cannot find the name nor replacement part on any site, including gillette&#x27;s website, and has rendered this razor and the extra heads I bought worthless.  Gillette also doesn&#x27;t seem to even have a way for me to email them on this.  Great product and concept, but very poor company, and bad quality connecting cheap part probably designed in to waste our money and not spared so we can&#x27;t just buy that part.  I really don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> works well, easy to clean. except the blades..&lt;br /&gt;the gaps between the blades are too small, and even if I rinse it for 30 sec, it just wouldn&#x27;t clean it all.. but it appears not affecting shaving. so I am not taking any star off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is great, but if they can have a thinner one would be better.</li>
    <li> fantastic product even better price wonderful gift good packaging will make a wonderful gift and the price was so great bought two these work great very happy</li>
    <li> This trimmer kit is extremely convenient.  I bought it to retire my old Remington trimmer, and I don&#x27;t regret the decision at all.  Unlike my Remington, this is waterproof, so it is great for shaving in the shower and makes cleaning it so much easier.</li>
    <li> I waited a few months to write my review because quite honestly, this little beard groomer was one of the cheapest I found. My previous trimmer was powered by a built-in battery that I needed to charge about once a month. I liked it very much but as one would expect, the battery stopped holding a charge, making it completely useless. For the $25 I spent four years ago, I felt I got my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When ordering this Gillette, I didn&#x27;t realize it was powered by one AA battery. After three months, there seems to be just as much power as on &amp;#34;Day One&amp;#34;. It is much smaller than my previous trimmer and comes with several attachments. It&#x27;s less expensive, smaller in size, and doesn&#x27;t seem to use much energy! What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to others!  Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and excellent for the price point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
    <li> This trimmer works quite well.  Cheap, several guards, and trims hair.  It sucks down the batteries though and I only get maybe 4-5 trims before having to replace.  The BodyGoom trimmer might be a better option for the long run, but this one makes a great travel trimmer.  The razor part is weird and I&#x27;ve not used it. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great device for the money!  Comes with three different &#x27;comb&#x27; sizes.  I was enjoying using the number 3 comb, which allows the longest hair length.  My only recommendation is take your time when removing these to either switch to the blade or go with the lower setting so you can trim around the edges.  The comb breaks easily when removing, so go carefully, because after just 2 weeks of use .... well, let&#x27;s just say I now use the number 2 comb!  That&#x27;s not so much the fault of the device ... I got in a hurry, I suppose.  I&#x27;ll wait until I finally wear this thing out and order a new one to get the number 3 comb.  But, I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Decent product, battery life is good (not rechargeable), because of the head configuration it&#x27;s a little difficult around the ears, otherwise not bad</li>
    <li> I loved it at first had it for about 6 months til it started messing up changed the batteries didn&#x27;t solve the problem i put veggie oil on the inside helped for about 3 months but then i had to do it more and more. Now i can just you it as a razor not a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Just AMAZING!!! This razor works really really good it has a beard trimer a razor and the blade on the back to define the shape.its totally worth the price</li>
    <li> I bought this to help thin out the beard I had so that I could shave it completely off. It worked as I expected and needed it to. I like that I could trim my beard and then use the razor to shave the remainder. I also like that is has an organizer and is battery operated.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and great view. Never could expect such a great result from something that costs $20.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I can use it under the shower as well or not , but it is a very high quality and good product, I like it</li>
    <li> This is a nice inexpensive little trimmer that works very well. Don&#x27;t buy it to shave with or even do your whole beard!  The Fusion is a handy nice little extra simple trimmer! Not a SHAVER!</li>
    <li> the clippers get stuck making you think the batteries are out.  What I do is flip open the area that has the mechanical part and put in some soap that seems to lube it up and it works.</li>
    <li> I got this groomer for about 15$ the price alone should be the reason to test this product out! but is it worth the 15$! Most definitely! this Gillette groomer retails at stores for about 22$ including tax. So you get a good discount buying on amazon. I would easily pay 30$ for this product. and even then 30$ would be well worth it. so first off. the packaging was very easy to open. it comes with a little holder for all your accessories that come along with it. A razor blade holder at the top and a slot for the groomer itself. My first impression on this little magical wonder was priceless!!! I grow a lot of facial hair and I just want to be able to trim it down and fix the sides and just look clean. Before I tried this bad boy out. I always had to shave to look presentable at work. My job doesn&#x27;t care if we have facial hair as long as it looks clean and well groomed. Gillette you have fixed my problems once more. I can now easily trim down my beard to three different lengths. Trim the shape you want then shave what you don&#x27;t need. haha. The groomer fits nicely in your hand thus making precise quick trims. Its water resistant so you don&#x27;t need to worry about how to clean it. the only thing I wish this product had was a little brush to clean out hair inside of the razor. but overall this product is 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;easy packaging&lt;br /&gt;comes with accessory organizer&lt;br /&gt;3 different trim lengths&lt;br /&gt;small easy to hold razor&lt;br /&gt;gives perfect clean grooms&lt;br /&gt;its delicate with your face&lt;br /&gt;comes with batteries&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;water resistant&lt;br /&gt;durable + great price&#x3D; amazing must buy product! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;can be troublesome to clean the inside</li>
    <li> Good product. The only complain is that it does not have rechargeble batteries and the plastic sizing inserts breaks easily.</li>
    <li> Razor is good. The trimmer is an amazing option for those who do not want to shave because you don&#x27;t want a gorilla hair chest or wax because it hurts.</li>
    <li> I love this unit - especially for travel. I ended up getting two, one for home and the other in my travel bag. To have both the razor and the groomer, plus storage for extra blades is great for what I need on the road. Though I only use one length of grooming combs, the kit comes with multiple sizes for different length beards. I have a single purpose razor that has the vibrator in it - but find the unit&#x27;s groomer motor actually doubles as a vibrator when the razor is attached - and it works better than the single purpose razor. I&#x27;ve yet to change the battery in either of these units I purchased. Good job on this, Gillette.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer for years but you can&#x27;t let it get wet. It isn&#x27;t really designed for body grooming but it did a good job on my beard for years with no trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I had to trim the Johnson and family jewels as well as my stomach and upper thighs due to a surgical procedure. I did not want the hospital orderly doing the shaving for me. I&#x27;ve been there and done that and lived to regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally buy Gillette because nearly all of their products are made outside the USA and they are expensive as all get out. A while back I bought a Fusion ProGlide razor just to check it out and it gave a really good shave for me and my ultra sensitive face. I have a couple of Braun electric toothbrushes that the family likes and they have been totally reliable (yes, they are imports but there are no domestic alternatives). Anyway, this was a Braun co-branded product so I took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great in the shower and has a rubbery grip so you don&#x27;t drop it all the time. Did not have any problems with hair sticking to it as others have mentioned. When used as a plain razor, you can turn it on and get a little vibration in the blade while shaving. I can&#x27;t tell a difference on or off. Trimmer blades are sharp and didn&#x27;t pull. Be sure to use a drop of oil now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Styler performs very well. Comb lengths give a good variety and the bare trimmer is pretty delicate. The Mrs. has been eyeing it since she saw me use it in the shower. She goes bare down there and this immediately appealed to her. All in all, it does all that is claimed as far as I am concerned. I&#x27;m an electric razor guy so I do a lot a trimming anyway. This Styler gives me a lot more flexibility and a closer, neater trim than my old Wahl. It is on the smallish side; my big hands kinda swallow it up so be advised. Normal folks should be OK. Us knuckle-draggers are going extinct-we can&#x27;t dial cell phones either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holder for everything is pretty stable but could use some rubber feet to keep it from slipping about. Four dabs of silicone will fix that. Has a small footprint and it will fit in my medicine cabinet if turned sideways. A really good option would be to modify the holder design so that you could slap on a 3M Command Adhesive Strip and stick it up on the shower wall. Water drains easily so there&#x27;s no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I think this was designed with the MetroSexuals in mind, but that&#x27;s OK. It works for me and I&#x27;m hairier than the average bear, as Yogi used to say. You&#x27;ll probably like it and maybe your significant other will too.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the same product. Can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
    <li> very convenient to use and travel. fast and easy to use. I&#x27;m traveling a lot, so for me its very compact and helpful product</li>
    <li> This piece is simple and does what its suppose too. I like that it comes with 3 preset trimmers because it helps with keeping a consistent shave. I have a beard and using this cleans it up real well. Plus, it&#x27;s cheap. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal on this product it works like a cham</li>
    <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had! My regular shaver is a Gillette Sensor Excel. Been using it for many years but blades getting hard to find. Got this Fusion Proglide at great price and what a difference! Really close shave.  I also use the single blade for trimming up my mustache and again, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;My only cons are the price of replacement blades and the size of the handle. It feels like your shaving with a small finishing hammer. It&#x27;s a pretty chunky handle.&lt;br /&gt;I still use my Sensor Excel for regular days but this is my go-to blade for going out or needing that real good look.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality razor, definitely worth the money for those who need to maintain their beards and such. You can find the same thing at Wal-mart for $17 though. Wish I realized that lol.</li>
    <li> After just over 3 months use, the plastic harness that holds the razor blade, broke off the hinges. This product worked well before this (I used it for body shaving and the razor refills barely make it to 3 uses, but never cut me), but due to the cheap construction and plastic design, I would avoid this product.</li>
    <li> I call this thing the leatherman multi-tool of the shower.  This takes care of all my grooming needs.  I used the Gillette fusion blades for a while and thought I would give this a try.  The trimmers come in 3 different sizes which makes man-scaping nice.  I like my body hair at different lengths, depending on the location (pits, beard, chest, junk)  This thing trims like a dream.  No cuts or nicks.  The wife appreciates it.  This works well wet or dry.  Only thing I wish it had was a rechargable battery, although the one battery it takes does last a while.</li>
    <li> All of it came fast and it works excellent have been using it for the past couple months and have no complaints</li>
    <li> The electric shaver has no power and pulls your hair.  I have tried fresh batteries. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Gillette is a multi national company that does not need this kind of scam. You pay premium for stuff that you can get anywhere separately . Please don&#x27;t waste you money . Nothing unique about the items , you can spend 1/2 the $ buying it individually .</li>
    <li> Okay product. Not all that. I expected more. The razor becomes dull after a few shaves. The groomer has no power at all.</li>
    <li> Good product as described.</li>
    <li> Very well made. Great for beards.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a fine job--allows for precise trimming of sideburns, shaving the neck for shorter styles, and shaving the face. Very happy with it. (Wish there was some sort of device/attachment that could catch all those tiny hairs, though!)</li>
    <li> Our second one of these. They last a long time which is very nice</li>
    <li> the batteries do not last long in here at all.</li>
    <li> man this is like a bugatti of shavers screw the 300 dollar shavers get this manscape and fix up your face two different shavers</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, helps to get in places where using a long-handled razor is inconvient. Great battery life and the guards included with the pack are extremely useful for finding the right trimming level. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> But, there seems to be a piece missing and the box was not sealed? Do we have a problem? Otherwise, my husband seems to like the small shape for his beard trimming.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Small an easy to use. Great razor attachment. Small and compact. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> The best value on market. The battery lasts forever. Very light, sharp and useful thing</li>
    <li> It really does not trim much of anything.  The razor does not have much power.  I never used a battery operated shaver, so I can&#x27;t say if it is worse than the others.  I just use a regular proglide razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette products for over 30 years and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Fusion Proglide Styler. I have severe nerve damage in my hands and fingers. The size of the Proglide along with the battery power really makes it much easier to control when I shave my face and trim my beard and mustache.  If you check out the videos I have what the call the &amp;#34;Royal&amp;#34; style. I prefer to keep it closely cropped because my facial hair tends to curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Gillette clear shaving gel and finish things off with Gillette Cool Wave aftershave lotion (a really nice fresh, clean scent). I have found that using a liberal amount of the clear gel along frequent rinsing gives very good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette for making my life a bit easier.</li>
    <li> The Styler was a great buy in my mind. I had a Wahl shaver before that was too heavy for its purpose with a crappy battery. This product is light, ergonomic, quiet, and accurate. Paired with Gillette Body Men&#x27;s Shave Gel is an incredible feeling. The shaver does not get caught up on anything and is very slick. The gel is not supposed to be used on your face so I used another gel. The three beard attachments are ok, nothing great to talk about. The razor is amazing. Moves the the contour of your face, and does the job right. Only downfall is the battery. It&#x27;s not rechargeable, unless you use rechargeable batteries. I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet though. Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I.&#x27;ve owned including the higher priced ones. Has all the attachment you need and very easy to trim and shape. actually bought a second one because my son took over mine.</li>
    <li> great gift for my boyfriend! came on time in perfect condition! works great and would recommend to anyone with a significant other to get!</li>
    <li> This is excellent for trimming longer hair prior to using the blade to shave. I love the straight edge blade on back of razor to taper off my side burns. Refills are expensive, but you get quite a few shaves off of each blade cartridge. Vibrating function I don&#x27;t use. I like a steady hand while shaving. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the trimmer because it functions in both wet and dry and it had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to shave every month or so when my bead gets itchy.  When my beard is longer than a month I trim my entire face and then shave with the shaving attachment.  When I used the trimmer it caught the beard hair and stopped.  This is painful and something I do not expect from a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming is better when I only have a 2-3 week long beard.  There is no catching of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the attachments.  Especially the proglide razor function.  I like using it on vibrate mode because it seems to make shaving easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product to people who do not grow their beard out too awfully long. Otherwise buy something a little more heavy duty.</li>
    <li> I almost rated this poorly.  I initially tried to edge dry.  I laughed as the trimmer failed to edge anything.  Give it a shot wet and with shaving cream/gel on.  I was VERY impressed.  I was also hesitant to try the razor with the motor on.  It worked extremely well.  The single detail blade worked so much better than I expected.  I had been using a Mach 3 and a double edged razor blade (for detail).  After my first use, I really like the results.  Not perfect, but better than any combination of items I&#x27;ve used recently.  If you have coarser hair, remember to try it wet with your cream/gel of choice.  Also, try finishing with a shaving oil.  As smooth as I want to get without risking irritation and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> A couple things - I wish amazon would ask if a product was a gift - not because I need or want them to gift wrap it for me, but more so, so they wouldn&#x27;t put what&#x27;s in the box on the outside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a present for my fiance and I&#x27;m really glad he didn&#x27;t notice that it said what it is on the box because he got home before me and got the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I took it out of the box so I could wrap it for him and it was wrapped really oddly. I had a really hard time getting it out of the box and obviously couldn&#x27;t ask for my fiance&#x27;s help. I ended up cutting the box open and all the little pieces went flying all over the place. I don&#x27;t know if this is the way Gillette or Amazon packed it, but it was a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope the product works after all the trouble I went to get it opened, hide it from my fiance and wrap it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many failed experiments with more expensive trimmers, but this one enabled me, for the first time, grow a well-groomed beard. Switching between the different lengths was a breeze, and when time came to trim it all off, it worked like a charm. The included battery also appears to last a while. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I travel light and like to keep my beard trimmed, and my regular electric razor with its charging unit was taking up too much space in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more compact than it looks in the product photo: the Fusion cartridge (which you use for shaving) is a separate attachment which can sit alongside the main unit, making it easier to fit everything into a small toiletries bag. However, it&#x27;s heavier than I expected. Not heavy enough to be objectionable; it just has a bit more heft than you&#x27;d think if you saw it sitting on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it uses an AA battery rather than a factory-sealed rechargeable battery means I don&#x27;t need to carry around extra gear to keep it juiced. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now and am still on my initial battery. Part of that may be due to another thing I like about this unit, the fact that you can use the shaver without turning on the motor. I usually shave most of my face without turning on the motor, then remove the shaver head and power up the trimmer to clean up my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m having better luck with the cartridges than many of the other people writing reviews. It took about 3 weeks of daily use before I started to notice the blades getting dull enough to affect the quality of the shave, and another week before I felt like it was time to switch to a new cartridge. I don&#x27;t think this is due to any special care I&#x27;m taking to maintain the blades; it&#x27;s probably more due to the texture of my skin and facial hair. I rarely use shaving cream since my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, so maybe that&#x27;s part of it. In any event, this means I can get by for months on an 8-pack of Fusion cartridges, long enough to make their price a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest annoyance is cleanup, which is why I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5. The trimmer blade compartment pops open so you can rinse out any accumulated hairs, but inevitably there are a couple stray ones remaining. Sometimes blowing into the compartment gets rid of them but sometimes you need to use a fingernail to pull them out. If you don&#x27;t mind little bits of hair sticking in your trimmer this won&#x27;t be an issue for you.</li>
    <li> This razor works great.  The only downside is the blades cost about $4 each.  Buy the 8 pack of blades when you get it to save a little.</li>
    <li> I always love gillette Fusion or Mach3 for shave but one thing I used to miss was playing with my side logs (hairs on the side face behind cheeks) Now I can make precision cut. Also I am making new style with beard in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon gave me such a nice rate for this product that I am really thankful&lt;br /&gt;VERY NICE PRODUCT, definitly 10 on 10 with such price</li>
    <li> I love how this works. The trimming guards are really easy to put on. It all stores in a small place and it has the option to be a razor. For the price this is a great piece of equipment. Very versatile and it is great quality. Very recommended</li>
    <li> Great for trimming and the Gillette fusion razor is a great razor.  The trimmer works wonders and is very sharp.  Only problem I had was I went to short with the lowest trimmer setting and regretted it afterwards.  But that was my fault not the trimmer.</li>
    <li> The combs make it so easy to get the right shave that I want.  It&#x27;s easy to use, but a little difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> This cannot be beat for the price. There is no way to cut yourself and takes care of the &amp;#34;certain areas&amp;#34; with ease</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 17 yr old and he loves it. He uses it to trim his hair and his beard. I wish I would have bought it for him sooner.</li>
    <li> Great tool.  Works great in the shower and out.  Once I started to use it I can&#x27;t live without it. !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect. It has different sizes for trimming, the machine works for cutting most facial hair, and the razor works great for to look sharp. You really cold not go wrong with this. The only downsize is purchasing new cartilages.</li>
    <li> This thing is pretty weak. Bought it for some man scaping but it does not have the size or power. This thing is more for manicuring. I have used it a bit on my beard too and it is ok. Have used others before that were much better. Tried this one because it is coardless. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> So far this has worked great as both a blade shaver and trimmer.  I go stretches where I don&#x27;t have to leave the house because I can work from home and when I do, I often won&#x27;t shave and my facial hair grows pretty rapidly so if I go even a week without shaving, doing so with just a blade gets painful because it gets so long.  The trimmer helps me both shape it and shorten what i want to shave.  My only complaint is that hairs do seem to get into the motor compartment which has not yet caused a performance issue but I believe eventually will.  I will try to remember to update this if I am ever proven right.</li>
    <li> Best ever. Amazingly close trim, battery last forever. I travel a lot I bought 2 cause 1st one got damaged. I would buy again</li>
    <li> I only use the buzzer part of this groomer. It is soft and easy to run over your skin without any irritation but it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as other buzzers I have. It&#x27;s easy to use but I need to edge up my beard pretty often.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best beard razors I&#x27;ve ever bought, it&#x27;s very simple and easy to use, and does the job very well. There are only 3 lengths, adjusted by interchanging the three brushes, the first brush is just enough for a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and I used the second brush to lighten my mustache to look perfect with the rest of my facial hair. Every man who likes styling facial hair on shorts lengths needs this invention.</li>
    <li> This is much, much better than a former Phillips shaver I had (one of those with 3 disks.. I can&#x27;t figure why people like it) and a grey Panasonic for the whole body. The Panasonic sometimes caught my skin and made bruises, even if I used it with the comb attached to 2mm. This cheap little thing here does none of it and is even much easier to use due to its small size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aye: cheap, easy, small (so it&#x27;s easy to contour your face/body), portable, Braun (german) manufacturing, everything you need for a simple trim/shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nay: 1 - you&#x27;ve got to be careful with the plastic combs, if you force them when taking off or putting on you&#x27;ll surely break it. But it fits nicely, so if you must use force then you&#x27;re probably doing something wrong. 2- Since the blades of the trimmer are small, it can take a little longer than a bigger trimmer to trim a big area, but at most 1 minute longer. 3 - It&#x27;s hard to clean the blades compartment afterwards, since it doesn&#x27;t fully open, just partially, so some hair will live there forever, but it&#x27;s actually not a big deal. 4 - Well, that&#x27;s a hit and a miss, but it uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable battery; you can use rechargeable AA batteries but I think it&#x27;s better to have a &amp;#34;native&amp;#34; battery so you don&#x27;t have to worry about AA batteries. 5- The gillete razors are expensive, that&#x27;s where the company makes the big money (there&#x27;s no way to have a clean/perfect shave with just the trimmer - you&#x27;ll need the razor for that, although the trimmer makes the hair small enough if you don&#x27;t need a clean shave for your job).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But still, with all those &amp;#34;nays&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m very glad I bought it (heck I gave it 5 stars), since it works perfectly well for my needs and is the cheapest trimmer I could find</li>
    <li> I use it as my daily facial shaver as its quick and it works great.  It is waterproof so you can even use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day. It allows you to have all of the trimming and grooming coverage that you would need in a small organized package. It makes for a much better experience than fumbling around with 3-4 different products. I use this on my face for mustache/beard shaving and trimming and it&#x27;s fantastic. Since the motor is small, I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work on larger applications like trimming your head hair. However, to maintain buzzed sides I could see this working well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product that shipped fast and is packaged nicely. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and he LOVES it!!! Uses it to trim around beard, side burns and neck line. Perfect for him and he&#x27;s obsessed with it!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, price and quality!</li>
    <li> I use it to trim my beard and it works better then more expensive clippers I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s super compact and it&#x27;s surprising how good it works.</li>
    <li> Received this item with 2 trimmers of the same size.</li>
    <li> This was exactly as listed.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like keeping my facial hair at a certain length and it really does help keep my facial hair at a great length. Also the fact that I can use it to shave makes it a great value.</li>
    <li> I use this from shaving my facial hair to shave my baby&#x27;s hair. This thing is great, you get an all in one.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> The job takes me on the road, sometimes for several weeks at a time and I was really sick of packing both the razor and the trimmer/groomer to keep myself looking my best. I had looked at this option a few times, and finally broke down and bought it. The trimmer is great and the razor gives me a great shave. It packs into space a bit bigger than a typical razor, but saves the bulk of packing the razor and another trimmer. Added bonus is it operates on batteries, so no matter where I am in the world, I will be able to use it without worrying about chargers.</li>
    <li> Liked this product just fine until the attachment that connects the razor to the body snapped in half while shaving.  Reading reviews this seems like a common problem.  The attachment is just a cheap piece of plastic that won&#x27;t stand up to the normal pressure you apply while shaving.  I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years and have never broken a razor before.  For the price, I would expect something to be made of better quality materials.  I&amp;#34;ve had mine for less than a year and it snapped in two pieces while in the middle of shaving.  Luckily my oldest son is of shaving age and was able to finish with his razor, otherwise my face would have look pretty funny at work.</li>
    <li> It gave a good, close shave- up until a month after when it simply stopped working! Epic fail!</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves it! Great buzzer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It allows me to style and maintain a low type cut with the beard and mustache daily. Works best with any rechargeable battery.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for one of his Christmas gifts.  He needed a new groomer and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on one.  I went with this one since he already uses the Gillette razor for his face, and because the reviews were pretty good.  Glad I bought this, and he is too!  It works great.  Thanks Amazon!  6/15/17  UPDATE Razor just died this morning.   My now husband got a good 3.5 years out of it.  For $20 bucks,  we&#x27;re happy.  Just ordered him another one!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a dedicated beard trimmer with a worn out rechargable battery.  Unfortunately the trimmer is underpowered and makes a mess with hair going everywhere.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the Fusion razor but using the beard trimmer as a handle is clunky and a bit unwieldy.  I&#x27;m back to using my old beard trimmer (even though I need to plug it in every time) since it&#x27;s much more powerful and keeps the hair contained and back to my old Fusion razer with a normal handle.  I&#x27;ll probably use this for travel although the lack of a travel case makes this less than ideal.</li>
    <li> The thing works no doubt, replacement blades are expensive however it works well ,as described , and i have used it in the shower many times without a problem.</li>
    <li> It is powerful, clean and does the job.  What more can you ask for except a piece to trim nose hairs.  Otherwise the accessories are really helpful in getting the look you want.</li>
    <li> Great tool at affordable price. The Styler gives me the perfect mustache every time, same close shave and more... MDL</li>
    <li> good price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I use this thing all the time, I prolonged getting haircuts by months. Takes one double A battery so you can&#x27;t beat that alone people. Buy the thing its great.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!!</li>
    <li> This surprisingly-small shaving and beard-trimming apparatus worked to expectations. The holder is made if thin, cheap plastic. But in view of the low price and the quality of the razor, which can be adjusted for the desired degree of beardiness by means a sliding, plastic add-on, the holder doesn&#x27;t matter. Batery included.</li>
    <li> Really good and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my friends hair for over 20 years. When it came to trimming one of my friends beard, he liked it low. Not stubble but a notch up from stubble. I tried and tried with my big professional Wahl but it would either cut it too short, or too long. I was impressed how this sturdy well designed little Styler trimmer by Gillette not only gave me the low length we wanted but also lasted a long time before the trimmer dulled. And this little Styler is not wimpy, it has a fast long lasting power and is good on the battery life too. It is just too bad the blade is not replaceable, I can only think what a waste of resources, from mining the product from the Earth, and every step to get the resources ready to manufacture it, including packaging materials and efforts, to distribution, to delivery, to the store putting it up on the shelf, to the consumer working to make the money to buy it and the gas to go to the store, only to use it till it gets dull and have to throw it out. What a loss.  Our throw away world is truly immature and is using up the Planet&#x27;s resources long before we will be gone. I shave my friends with a straight blade so I can&#x27;t comment on the shaver part of the package, but I can say I will keep buying it as it does what I want... except have replaceable blades... I&#x27;d by 100 of them if it did.</li>
    <li> Cheap and very usefull!</li>
    <li> Completely fell apart after only a few uses and the battery life was awful.  In the short time I had this thing I had to replace the batteries 3 times, and I didn&#x27;t use cheap batteries.  I guess it&#x27;s good that it feel apart so I didn&#x27;t have to continue buying batteries for it.  Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this worthless piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really enjoying this razor. I have gone through many, many different types and while this may not be the high end, it does the job better than anything else I&#x27;ve used yet. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> damaged...hate the quality of product and already returned...It was also looking very old compared to the picture shown in the website.</li>
    <li> What a great product! I have a beard, so this little tool is great for shaving my face, trimming my beard, cleaning up necklines, around the ear, even in the nose area. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I bought the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler after seeing it was supposed to be a great tool for facial hair detailing and lining. It&#x27;s a good trimmer to be battery powered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent and it was received on time. I recomend this item!</li>
    <li> my son was looking for a razor to get that close trim feel around his beard..he loves it and it has different size trimmers with it which makes it easier to judge</li>
    <li> This  is a really nice product - don&#x27;t get it wrong. But they could have done much better to enhance the body groom especially for regular use. Also the cleaning of blade is not as easy. I give it a 4 star</li>
    <li> I am a male who primarily uses this for body grooming. I have had other body trimmers before (some upwards of $80) and not one of them has held up or done as well as this. It&#x27;s cheap, functional, and gets the job done. It runs on an external battery and provides you with a straight blade attachment plus 3 trimmer lengths. Cannot beat the quality or functinoality for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent very good very expensive for my budget but the product performs its functions, god product for my tnkU A</li>
    <li> Dont use it as much as i should but when i need to use it its always perfect to use</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, I really did. However after owning it for about three months two things happened. The flimsy tabs broke on the blue plastic clip-on pieces supplied to adjust trimming height, making them and the razor less than totally useful. Also, other than the first few times with a brand new battery, once you turn this on it chugs along at what sounds like about a quarter of the speed it should be running at, leading me to believe it&#x27;s cutting at about 25% power. You sit there hoping it will speed up - something it should do from the time you turn it on. Gillette cheaped out on the quality of a product that should have lasted much longer and worked much better.</li>
    <li> this trimmer is cheap, easy to use, and does exactly what i wanted it to. i don&#x27;t know why this has negative reviews.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer. Actually it&#x27;s a great trimmer. To correct myself it&#x27;s an amazing trimmer. You should buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with the facial manscape for quite some time and realize that I could not maintain a clean look without a trimmer. Enter this small battery-powered kit. I&#x27;m not a pro when it comes to these things, but I feel like the battery powered trimmer was easy enough for newbies like me to use. That&#x27;s gotta be a plus. The added bonus for me is that this trimmer doubles as a razor handle, so I no longer have to keep my razor in the same holder as my toothbrushes. I&#x27;ve been using the regular Proglide razors, and since this trimmer is pretty &amp;#34;backwards compatible&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t have to buy new ones until I deplete the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for newbies looking to not have to plug a darn trimmer into the power outlet every time. Just make sure you follow maintenance instructions. That will probably do you some good.</li>
    <li> I use to use a different name brand razor and was sorta trying out different razors to see which was better for me.  I was always a little skeptical about using the Gillette because of the cost and I really didn&#x27;t think there would be a difference in the shave but I have been mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this and was very excited to use this razor, and being a black man, it appealed to me because of the trimmer feature so that can do a shape up or a different style to my shave.  It works beautifully and to be honest has a very appropriate name, Styler.  I love the fact that is a wet/dry razor and that it also becomes a power razor that is soothing when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor to anyone who is out there that wants to be able to make a unique look and clean and comfortable shave.  Gillette Styler all the way!</li>
    <li> Well, its cheap in cost but it does the job just fine.  I love that it runs on just regular batteries so there is no &amp;#34;forgot to charge&amp;#34; hassle when it is time to do a little beard pruning (as my wife calls it).  I have problems with my neck which can my holding smaller objects a pain but this over-sized handle makes it easier to get the job done.  Trimmer works just fine and even after it get dull, replacing the entire thing wont dent my pocket-book the way some of those other &amp;#34;grooming systems&amp;#34; have.</li>
    <li> When I bought this on an impulse (amazon had a 50% off clip coupon on the product page), I wasnt expecting much - just another razor.... but when I used it for the first time, I fell in love with this system. I have heavy beard growth so the lesser systems struggle to keep it looking clean and smooth. Since I bought this razor system, my 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow has has been consistently showing up late by a couple of hours !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of things that make it better than other cartridge systems / handles:&lt;br /&gt;1. The feel of holding and shaving with this handle is far superior to the pencil thin handles I had been using in the past - the soft rubber ridges make for a strong grip for smooth strokes.&lt;br /&gt;2. The \\&quot;power\\&quot; vibrations seem to help in getting a closer shave plus feel like gentle massaging of the cheeks feels awesome.&lt;br /&gt;3.  This comes with 3 plastic \\&quot;combs\\&quot; which fit over the electric trimmer built into the handle - the trimmer can be used with or without these combs - very handy in keeping the bushy eyebrows trimmed (or beard / mustache trimmed) - they can also be used for \\&quot;fading\\&quot; body hair, though thats going to take a long time with the narrow trimmer :)&lt;br /&gt;4. The on/off button can be half pressed for activating the vibration/trimmer function for the duration the button is kept pressed or a harder push of the button clicks it into continuous on or off state.&lt;br /&gt;5. There is a holder provided to keep the razor and the combs - which helps keep the handle and blade in a vertical position and looks good.&lt;br /&gt;6. The proglide blade itself is very good with 5 blades on the front and one on the back. The front blades give a good general shave and the back blade is handy to reach those hard to shave places like the spot just under the nose on the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;7. The power function works on one AA battery, which is easy to replace, no matter which part of the world  you are in.&lt;br /&gt;8. As per the instructions, this razor can be used in the shower, hence its water sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; that i have come up with so far is that the blades are expensive. It remains to be seen how long the blades last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed with this system that i promptly bought a second one to keep in my travel bag !r, hence its water sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; that i have come up with so far is that the blades are expensive. It remains to be seen how long the blades last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed with this system that i promptly bought a second one to keep in my travel bag !</li>
    <li> What a handy little shaver- trimmer! It is easy to maintain a neat, trimmed appearance using the various blades and attachments.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Great buy.  Love that its water proof.  Take it in the shower with me when I&#x27;m running low on time.  Great for touching up the facial hair.</li>
    <li> i love this razor. i have never had a better shave. i wish i had one a long time ago</li>
    <li> It is a nice set, but it is to small to trim my husbands beard. I can use it to trim his neck or my neck. I couldn&#x27;t believe when I opened the box of how small it was. It wasn&#x27;t a good buy for me.</li>
    <li> For below-the-belt use, this does exactly what you need it to do without trouble or pain. The shortest guard cuts surprisingly short without ever once endangering your goods. Hard to imagine something else doing a better job at this price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product but the refills are too expensive!</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Batter container feels like it doesn&#x27;t fit quite right, and at times I have problems getting it to turn on. Partly be cause of the battery compartment and partly because of the blade detaches from the unit strangely to fit the attachments, if it doesn&#x27;t click back all the way it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Trimmer not the best and blade dulls easily - does not leave you satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really like this for keeping my beard short and nicely groomed.</li>
    <li> Perfect trimmer and shaver for the price</li>
    <li> Well made, high quality product at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the level of performance and&lt;br /&gt;range of of functions for this groomer.&lt;br /&gt;The stand for the groomer is also highly functional and&lt;br /&gt;looks good on my bathroom counter, so I can remember&lt;br /&gt;to groom all the new places I never had to before I entered&lt;br /&gt;my 40&#x27;s (ears! eyebrows!  really???).</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because it was waterproof and seemed to have everything one. Unfortunately the guides it comes with are all pretty short and don&#x27;t leave room for variation (about 1/8 inch at the longest). It is also slighty underpowered and requires constant cleaning, sometimes 3 times for a trim.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these. The first lasted about three years before the plastic combs broke from clipping on and off. In general it&#x27;s a good all around trimmer, but the battery life could be better. I seem to have to change that monthly, and no - I don&#x27;t use this to shave with, just trim.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I love Gilletes.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt dislike anything about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this product..</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted, simple, usefull and compact, and very functional&lt;br /&gt;you can trim, shave, and all of that can be done in the shower</li>
    <li> I just needed a simple groomer and didn&#x27;t want to pay $60 or more.  These work great and can be used in the shower as well.</li>
    <li> Efforts are still needed.</li>
    <li> I sport a short french beard for more than 10yrs now and ve tried a bunch of trimmers. Have always liked fusion but the trimmer was a surprise. Noticing a quicker shave n trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not like the  removable Razor design. Could ve been better.</li>
    <li> Works great! I can trim my beard in the shower without fear of it getting water damage. Cant beat it for ~20 bucks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this styler for some time now, and it was definitely worth the price for what it offered. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it gets the job done and provides an extremely smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades, no pulling on hair. I like how its small yet easy to handle. The adapters work good too.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I enjoy using it to style and groom my bodily hairs. It does a good job, but goes through batteries pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Nice solid piece of equipment. Just what I was looking for to shave my neck and trim my beard and moustache. Now I can throw away all of the old home hair-cutting razors. They were too bulky, too noisy and always in need of adjusting. Despite its size this smaller unit with the different head spacers does all that I need.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. Just remember to change the battery when it slows down...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sarisfied with mypurchases</li>
    <li> Seems that the Groomer will stop grooming for no reason. Just short of 3 months there is no buzz in this product. Won&#x27;t turn on.  Looks new (only use it once or twice a month).  Had a coupon and it ended up costing $10 or so. But after using maybe 4 times, this was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great shaver,works as described, completely water proof, is super light-weight and is a joy to use. Not one problem with it so far at all!</li>
    <li> I will make it short: I sill cannot beleave this wonder costs less than usd 20!!! I highly recommend this amazing product.</li>
    <li> The trimmer sucks. No way to fine trim. Have to use my old trimmer the clean up around mouth and under nose. Shaver is great.</li>
    <li> I already own one of these bad boys from when they first came out, but my friend did not have one and was always curious about mine, so I bought it for him for Christmas especially since the price was perfect! The product itself works great dry or wet. You get 3 different head for trimming which suffice and a razor blade attachment. It is not meant to be for precise detailed trimming, but will do if you need something quick. Also it works off a one AA battery which can make it run for a long time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave body hair that well... its better if you keep hair trimmed, but you&#x27;ll need real clippers to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I use this product to shave my face and trim my body hair. This is a handy grooming tool because it works very well. If you use this tool your significant other will be very happy.</li>
    <li> Gillette products are always great as this one too...this powerful shaver and trimmer fulfills all my everyday needs. the battery life is excellent.</li>
    <li> Having three different trimmer lengths and a razor head is ideal along with the trimmer.  I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for awhile now and wanted to consolidate some of my grooming tools, this fit the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works well on my side burns and to trim my beard when I had one.</li>
    <li> It gave a great shave, groom worked excellant and i never had any problems with it at all. Really recommended, I even use it as a body groomer</li>
    <li> So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;This little styler is quite nice, and seems easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside so far for me is that I wish there were longer guard lengths available.&lt;br /&gt;The three that come with it are all extremely short, which may be fine if you have dense or curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;As it is, I have to hold the styler a bit further off of my face so I don&#x27;t come back looking all patchy.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not the best tool for maintaining a goatee, but probably works a lot better for someone like Seneca Crane from Hunger Games.</li>
    <li> I love this product I use it all day is the best ...</li>
    <li> Perfect. What else can I say about a razor and trimmer. It shaves, it trims, it&#x27;s waterproof...triple threat.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Perfect! Replacing my man&#x27;s old one that broke! Definitely recommend!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Easy to use trimmer. Quick, nothing special and to the point. I actually had one of these before that a girlfriend bought for me but somehow during a recent move got lost in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went a few months trying to let my &#x27;beard&#x27; (See: goatee) grow and trim it just using my Braun Series 7-790cc. Lets just say it often ended in failure. I&#x27;ve never been &#x27;good&#x27; at trimming my facial hair so I usually just mow it all off and using the Braun most often than not meant starting over on my facial hair as I&#x27;d always trim something too short, nick a spot or etc and then just have to shave the hole beard off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally caved, getting tired of having to shave my face entirely because of my unskilled hands. I didn&#x27;t want a full blown high end &#x27;beard trimmer&#x27; either as I -do- shave 90% of my face still. These factors, plus the cost, led me right back to the tried and true 3-in-1 trimmer. It&#x27;s fairly cheap, I can easily snap one of the three guards on and trim away now, keeping my facial hair much neater than trying to freestyle trim It with my 790 and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter top. I like that it uses batteries too, since I hate unplugging the 790 or the other accessories that are always left plugged. So overall, if you&#x27;re like me someone who just has a little facial hair and needs a quick trimmer this thing is golden. Its not going to last you forever, but you&#x27;ll get your monies worth. The last one I had lasted for at least a year, and would have still worked fine for some time after i&#x27;m sure, before it got lost during a move.</li>
    <li> Use this to trim my beard and mustache, does an amazing job keeping it trimmed and the attachments are handy!</li>
    <li> Its a good razor and have used it for over a year. The blue attachment that holds the razor blade however cracked and now keeps falling off. No replacement part is available.  So if this happens, one will have to buy a new razor for shaving! I hope Gillette/Braun will improve the quality of the plastic attachments.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Small, compact and comes with three attachments that are really all you need for short to medium facial hair.  Hell I was in a pinch and even used this thing to cut my hair once... so it is plenty powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the razor attachment comes in handy, but the blades are too dang expensive for me (I use the dollar shave club).  The holder is nice and holds everything without taking up space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is that it takes a double A battery.  It seems like it would have been more logical to have a rechargeable lithium battery.</li>
    <li> Great idea but it shaves my husband&#x27;s face to close.  Think about it. If you run the razor down the skin once you are actually shaving it 4 times each time.  This in time would irritate the skin.  Need a great shave cream to keep the skin smooth during the shave.</li>
    <li> I had an older groomer with rechargable battery (but it broke). That thing powered through my tough beard with no problems. This thing is pretty weak and eats up batteries. I will keep on using by will invest my $$ more wisely in the future.</li>
    <li> Everything is great, just wish it had 1 step longer guide available.</li>
    <li> Pros - With the primary shaving attachment, this works as well as any other vibrating, battery-powered razor, which is to say it works very well.  A nice, clean shave.  Battery power is decent, had to change mine after a few months, but that&#x27;s only a little less than comparable razors.  Really sleek design, very convenient to just leave by a sink or in the shower.  Contains all its own parts, very handy.  Good comfortable grip and feel.  Solid design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - The attachments for trimming and clipping beards and mustaches don&#x27;t work on my unit.  As soon as they are attached, the unit simply ceases to work.  You can feel the vibration slow way down as soon as a guard is attached, and then just stop.  Once I take the guard off and replace it with the primary razor for shaving, it works just great again.  This is clearly a design flaw of some sort, and turns what could have been a really handy grooming gadget into just another razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the device two stars because the pros simply can&#x27;t overcome the massive con of the guards not working with the razor, which is the reason it is double (or more) the price of a &#x27;normal&#x27; razor, and the reason I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great groomer! Compact. Easy to clean. I&#x27;m not quite sure what the buzzing feature does, and I cannot tell if it improves my shaving experience while it&#x27;s buzzing. But I like this a lot.</li>
    <li> Great concept- the styling pieces are near perfect in their size to trim and groom facial hair to near perfection- one huge problem- they are made of cheap breakable plastic that can easily lose their &#x27;teeth&#x27; I wish replacement pieces where available- if so this would warrant 5 stars - the fragility of these styling combs make this less then  an optimum investment.</li>
    <li> Its ok its doesn&#x27;t shape a good as I would like but will do. Not as good as a razor</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Great for trimming hair on neck between haircuts.</li>
    <li> I bought the trimmer because it functions in both wet and dry and it had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to shave every month or so when my bead gets itchy. When my beard is longer than a month I trim my entire face and then shave with the shaving attachment. When I used the trimmer it caught the beard hair and stopped. This is painful and something I do not expect from a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming is better when I only have a 2-3 week long beard. There is no catching of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the attachments. Especially the proglide razor function. I like using it on vibrate mode because it seems to make shaving easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product to people who do not grow their beard out too awfully long. Otherwise buy something a little more heavy duty.</li>
    <li> It does not have nose trimmer or other fine trimmer options. However, the trimmer works perfectly fine for the money I paid. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming down before a closer shave. Men, I&#x27;m talking to you. I&#x27;ll say this as delicately as possible. This razor is really good at NOT catching and cutting sensitive skin. I have other &amp;#34;Trimmers&amp;#34; that I still shudder when I think about what happened when I took the guard off to do some grooming. This one is much safer. The 3 length guards are decent, but test them before assuming they are  lengths you are used to, they were much different than my previous trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer and used it once a week for about 6 months. The plastic guides that contact your skin failed because they&#x27;re just cheap plastic. I contacted Proctor and Gamble to see if I could get a replacement part. They responded quickly but never followed through on helping me with a solution. I exchanged emails with the same customer service rep 3 times, including sending pictures and links of the issue, they eventually stopped replying to my emails and left me hanging. I won&#x27;t buy this product again. Subsequently I have purchased a Wahl unit.</li>
    <li> Very nice thing! Description is correct, do not need to repeat it all, nothing bad, fits well, good quality, nothing to complain about... recommended to have at home!</li>
    <li> I tried buying and tried other expensive trimmers but i never knew that the solution was right here under $20 bucks with all my needs. Seriously it does it all! It trims, shaves and shape it up! Also the videos on Amazon on styling are just great! I really  reccoment starting from this trimmed and then upgrading according to the needs. At least you are getting a decent shaving kid/razor even though for me the whole package was great. The trimmer the combs the razor whole package under $20 is one heck of a deal!</li>
    <li> I got this while on sale for around 13 bucks. It works great for managing a beard. The fusion cartridge adapter is a little bulky and feels odd to use, but it works. I love that the shaver takes a regular AA battery so I can always have it ready to go without having to worry about a wall charger.</li>
    <li> Normally I used a pair of clippers with a #1 guard to landscape the nether region. But one day the #1 guard broke because I dropped the clippers on the floor.  I tried to use the clippers still but that was a bad idea. lol  So I bought this Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler and it works just fine. It comes with three size guards(1,2,3) and operates on one AA battery. I have another electric shaver for shaving so this is strictly for the landscaping. For the price, this groomer is totally worth it also because it is very portable too, it doesn&#x27;t have a power cord or anything getting in the way.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my fiancee and he loves it.  He is always edging up is beard and mustache.  He said it is much easier with the different attachments unlike what he was using.</li>
    <li> It is good but the Razor is not sharp enough and it cuts my skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome for what it is! Perfect for TRIMMING your beard. Excellent razor as well.</li>
    <li> A very good groomer overall.</li>
    <li> I bought this set at Walgreen&#x27;s and love it.  Great for trimming beards.  Have had several trimmers over the years. I like this on the best.</li>
    <li> This styler was awesome and useful, but it broke very quickly under normal use conditions. Would not recommend if you need a durable styler and don&#x27;t want to keep buying one every couple weeks</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for...  had to shave over the same places several times for continuity, only to create bald spots.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money , the trimmer works excellent .</li>
    <li> Very useful, good quality</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great for the price. I normally have to go back over the same spot in order to trim it completely, however I still consider it to work well. I&#x27;ve used it for body grooming as well as for my beard/mustache and it seems to do the job. I really can&#x27;t complain much for the price I got this thing at.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality and great price. Perfect little size for my trimming needs.</li>
    <li> I have to admit it but this kit really works. When you consider the price you get a Braun designed and made trimmer with multiple combs and a ProGlide Fusion Power razor all in one combo. The trimmer cuts smooth and precise and you can use it in the shower. It&#x27;s wet or dry.</li>
    <li> As expected, perfect timing delivery</li>
    <li> It came in a very nice box!</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer for beard / mustache ! The shaving attachment is a bonus. Best part is that i takes only 1 AA battery and goes for atleast 25-30 trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a neat wireless trimmer.</li>
    <li> This product is great. First of a kind that is actually user friendly, and makes shaving a no effort task. Great feel and quality. And the best part is the price.</li>
    <li> The definitely shave kit. You can shave to fifferent levels. Cheap and it works very good. I strongly recomend it.</li>
    <li> I think for under $20.00 it does what it&#x27;s suppose to.  This is definitely something to get if you don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
    <li> Works great for most needs.  However, I have a coarse beard and sometimes the trimmer is not powerful enough, even with fresh batteries.</li>
    <li> Holy moly this thing is the t1ts! Works so well. Its so sharp. Cuts my hair. Works on more than the face.</li>
    <li> The Proglide shave is good and it&#x27;s handy for travel but it really needs to be rechargeable to be effective unless you don&#x27;t mind replacing batteries every couple weeks or so.</li>
    <li> Came well package, had everything included and ready to go.  Hands down best razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I only use Gillette.</li>
    <li> A great little trimmer for the money.  For under 20 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s cheapest trimmer you could buy, spend the extra money!</li>
    <li> I switched to Merkur right away Idk why Gillette convinced me that more is better. No! A single blade Good quality razor beats multiple blades any day! Especially with the right cream and blade, it&#x27;s such a smooth shave!</li>
    <li> Trims even the tallest  grass very good and waterproof</li>
    <li> Trimmer is not effective as advertised.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple of months now. this is like no shave I have ever had. A vibrating blade is hard to describe. The trimmer function works treat as well. Battery life seems to be quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a best friend.</li>
    <li> You have to clamp the razor onto the trimmer. It makes it a bit awkward because the trimmer handle is so big.</li>
    <li> It worked only once, battery died fast. changed battery and never worked again. it buzzes but blades do not move.</li>
    <li> The device itself is well built but I was underwhelmed by the number of plastic accessories this brought. Really not worth the additional space it takes up in a medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I like this because it gives you a lot of control when you shave. Its takes a while to learn how to properly use it to its full penitential.</li>
    <li> This thing works great and I really enjoy the fact that it works with water. It is kind of the all in one when it comes to grooming. The biggest issue I have with it is it&#x27;s size which is a little big for a razor but since it is also a trimmer, it makes sense why it is the size it is.</li>
    <li> This item works amazing, especially for the price that I got it for. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> Was looking for this for a long time, but suddenly one day Amazon had it for almost half the price, so bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome deal......</li>
    <li> Seriously.....it&#x27;s all in the marketing. Sure our grandparents used straight razors and they were fine. They also had scars on their faces not from the rough and tumble life of a veteran but more likely from the old straight razors. I used dollar shave club for months, finally canceled. They just weren&#x27;t getting the job done. Gillette turned me back around with this product. I&#x27;ve been using them now for 26 years since I started shaving at 12 with the free razor they sent me. This is an excellent sturdy product.</li>
    <li> Great product that is good to use at home, and a great product to use for travel because it is compact and has everything that you need for grooming.</li>
    <li> This little electric shaver is exactly what I needed. It is not expensive like the heavier shavers which I didn&#x27;t need. It does very effectively trim your hair pretty low and it is easy to groom your beard etc.</li>
    <li> I got this Product Without 3 combs this is normal? I need these items.Disappointed me.What to do in the future?</li>
    <li> Cut easily. Had to make sure did not cut off too much. Would recommend to anyone who has been paying to have their beard and mustache trimmed at the barber shop. Pays for itself.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! This little thing can do so much. This is the perfect product for anyone maintaining a beard. It truly is a 3 in 1. Definitely a recommend. Gillette is the best!</li>
    <li> For the low price it is really great! However, you can tell that the blades are not the highest quality since it lead to a couple of small cuts already. But overall it does its work!</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer on sale about two years ago &amp; am well pleased with it.  Here are some things you should know which aren&#x27;t clear from the directions:  If the trimmer becomes clogged it will slow down.The head will flip open for cleaning if you remove any accessories &amp; push back on the trimmer head.You can even rinse it under the tap (leave open to dry).I saw some YouTube reviews about this but strangely they kept mentioning this feature but didn&#x27;t actually show how to do it.I had to play around with the head a bit to see how it worked.Easy once you do it.  The snap on blue trim head depth guides look brittle.In order to preserve them,I recommend you use the little slide catch for both installing &amp; removing the guides rather than just pressing them in place.  I found that you can accomplish very nice trims with great precision with this trimmer &amp; it also travels well.You can get a uniform beard length if you go over a given area from several directions.  The trimmer&#x27;s speed increases significantly,if you wet it under the faucet.  I get pretty good mileage from premium lithium batteries.  I have a large-sized rechargeable trimmer as well,but I usually prefer to use this one.  I rarely use the razor attachment but it&#x27;s nice to have it as a backup.  I hope these tips help.  Recomended</li>
    <li> This is a great trimer, comes with three sizes for different length but it you have to switch back and forth with the razor part because it doesn&#x27;t give you such a close shave</li>
    <li> I think its an overall great razor but do not think the vibrating feature makes it all that different...therefore 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I have a full beard and have no need for it for facial clean up. I use an old dog trimmer for my beard. LOL  Hey, it works!  However, I do like to keep the southern verge clean and neat and this is the best I have ever used for that sensitive area.  And I can use it in the shower too.</li>
    <li> this is a very fine product. it works very well. it is pretty powerful and it vetry versatile. feels good in the hand and easy to maneuver. gillette got it right. a good purchase.</li>
    <li> for this price this is the best product.&lt;br /&gt;yes i does have some flaws where hairs get stuck. But it does give a perfect shave.</li>
    <li> Solid little system! It works great. A small travel bag would have made it even better but I can purchase that myself.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels very well made, especially for the price. Bought mainly for grooming \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas, and it does a great job with that, allowing you to get pretty close with no gotchas.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I use it often. The blade attachment removes the need for a shaver and the buzzer is basically the same as the gillette shaver vibration function. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a beard/mustache trimmer for a while now. Got this one from Amazon after seeing the tv commercial. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s small, lightweight, easy to use and trims very well. I was worried that the single AA battery wouldn&#x27;t last long but it&#x27;s still going strong after several weeks of use. It easily fits in my medicine cabinet and doesn&#x27;t need a recharger cord which would dictate that it stay on the counter.  Overall I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, inexpensive trimmer.</li>
    <li> works very well, good features, good value</li>
    <li> Love this have been wanting.to buy it... my whole family has this</li>
    <li> This works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;Shaved EVERYWHERE and I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> It works. I like the quality of the product. I usually never clean shave, but it&#x27;s nice that this can do that too.</li>
    <li> I love this one. I was suspecting the cells would get discharged but it has been going well. The fusion razor also attaches well and in fact I like this grip than the Mach 3 grip.</li>
    <li> I use this weekly to trim my beard and mustache. works well but never used the blades</li>
    <li> My sons and husband fight over this, so I had to buy another.</li>
    <li> Probably they could try making a bigger one.. This ones a bit small</li>
    <li> Best Razor I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I love using this product to shave my groin area.  It&#x27;s an all-in-one type of product and it works great.  It&#x27;s cheaper than the competitors and does more.  The only grip I have is that the battery is not rechargeable but it&#x27;s not a big deal for me because I only use it like once a month.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.</li>
    <li> You can use this machine for the following purposes without any problems:&lt;br /&gt;- Armpit hair&lt;br /&gt;- Torso hair&lt;br /&gt;- Shoulders and back&lt;br /&gt;- Pubic hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, put in mind that the task of shaving might be a bit more difficult than normal if you&#x27;re hairy dude.</li>
    <li> A bit smaller than I expected, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is truely a nifty, quick and easy to use device....It has been a month and i shave every other day and it is sharp as ever. great for around my gotee&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery it came with did not last long....maybe a week. The new battery i put in has lasted three times as long and is going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually i will have to buy a replacement &amp;#34;razor section&amp;#34; - but did not find in my local supermarket...</li>
    <li> Love it . Very simple and works well. Price is right and I like Gillette products. Don&#x27;t shave with it as yet since I have a separate Fusion razor.</li>
    <li> had i know it was the same price online as it was at the store in town, i probably wouldnt have bought it on amazon. but its a quality shave and its nice to have a trimmer for my beard as well.</li>
    <li> light good quality big box easy to use it i used it on my body and face . love it because the size and efficiency</li>
    <li> I love using this gismo mostly for shaving! The only negative side to this shaver / groomer is the shaver arm is made of cheap plastic! This part should have been made out of metal! Nevertheless, it gives me the closest shave without any nicks or cuts!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical to buying a beard trimmer because I normally keep a clean shave but I wanted to try the beard look. Whenever my beard became unruly, the 3 sizes it comes with helps out a lot. It&#x27;s also great for touching up your shape with the razor. Whenever I have to shave, this feature also comes in handy as I can trim my beard and shave it off with ease and little irritation. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and it&#x27;s still working strong. Another nice thing is that the blade is completely enclosed so little hair don&#x27;t get stuck inside and it&#x27;s very easy to wipe down. Recommended for easy grooming.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this. I bought it and havent used anything else for months</li>
    <li> The shaver worked fine at first but after the 2nd use, it requires for the head to be lifted and reattached for the motor to start running again...</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is groomed!</li>
    <li> For the money, a very nice outfit. Trims very well and the attachments are simple to work with. My only negative is that sometimes the attachments are difficult to remove from the trimmer. Otherwise, a very good buy.</li>
    <li> great for the price, trimmer guards are handy and give uniform cutting.  I go through a AA battery a month, and that&#x27;s fine... it&#x27;ll not cut well with a dying battery.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son for Christmas, and he is so happy with it....great product, he said it&#x27;s just what he wanted</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my ageing son. I have one of my own and it works great. Several friend have one and they love it.</li>
    <li> Love everything about it, the names label just the way I want it to be. I rate this five stars</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. end of story.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a charging trimmer. But i did&#x27;nt know this was with the AA batteries. You should clear everything in the description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used an electric, and wanted to try a more traditional one. I thought I could use this on trips &#x27;cause it combines both razor and trimmer, so I don&#x27;t have to take both with me. The razor was good, but the trimmer wasn&#x27;t worth it. I&#x27;ll stick to a dedicated beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> this product has to be the best product i have purchased in a long time , i use it to shave my whole body even my head because i have the bold look and there is nothing bad about this product and the good thing about it is that you can do so many design on your face, its increlable and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Came exactly with everything that it says, this is a must buy, spend less in the barbershop now haha !</li>
    <li> it is the most suitable price, you cant find.and the razor part of it is really amazing. and it is so conventionall</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this product. It was disappointing. I had Fusion power and I liked it. but in this one ...&lt;br /&gt;a) Trimmer is not powerful at all...&lt;br /&gt;b) The Blades were really bad and I got lots of cuts and nicks on my second shave&lt;br /&gt;c) The lubricating strip just fell off on my second shave&lt;br /&gt;d) It&#x27;s too big and feels awkward when you&#x27;re shaving, it&#x27;s like writing with a 2 inch thick pen.&lt;br /&gt;However:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) I think the precision edge trimmer was much more powerful and sharper</li>
    <li> My Son love this so much, it was a great gift and came with everything he needed.  Really a great deal.</li>
    <li> Best body groomer that I have ever used and it comes with a new blade. Perfect for taking care of back, chest and or arms.</li>
    <li> This is a really handy trimmer that runs quietly off of battery power - no recharging necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments click on and off easily to convert from standard razor to any trimmer length.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk!! Works good but the trimmer attachments are horrible!! Brake easily</li>
    <li> works for my teenage son&#x27;s &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; needs.</li>
    <li> this is the best razor ever.</li>
    <li> Works well, didn&#x27;t come with a small brush to clean the clippers though.</li>
    <li> So easy to use right out of the package. All I did was attach the appropriate blade and press the power button, and I was shaving my chest successfully within seconds. So much easier than a manual razor and the multi-level main blade makes it easy to use without risk of nicks. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Simply put this is the best damn portable timer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Awesome ... husband threatened son to keep his hands off because he likes it SO much! May have to buy one for son for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect beard trimming tool at a great value price</li>
    <li> Eats blades and batteries. When I compare to single blade safety razors, it&#x27;s not worth the money for a few less strokes to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> Great it works extremely well</li>
    <li> Very cool device.. only had one official shave with it but it really does have everything you need to design many different looks when you combine it with a good clear shave gel. Also get the facial scrub to use in the shower before the shave, its great as well!</li>
    <li> This is the first personal trimmer I&#x27;ve ever ordered for myself and I love it! As a 20 year old male, the guards equipped with it are very useful for trimming certain areas where it is essential to keep tidy.  Glad that I found this product!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.Great price.</li>
    <li> I bought it for traveling because of the size but I now use it as my main grooming tool. I keep an eighth to quarter inch beard, so use the closest cropper which works well. The battery seems to go forever - I have yet to change it after several months of use, 3 times a week. The ribbed surface makes for a nice grip and although the device is smaller than the average penis one could, in a pinch, use it as a vibrator on one&#x27;s partner. Just rinse it under the faucet and move on. A small piece of chrome came off at the blade end but I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars for its sturdy construction, solid design and excellent performance.</li>
    <li> this is a great product absolutely love it. Easy to shave my side burns and even easier to shave my balls no cuts or Knicks. If yo looking to style your beats or easier way to shave your balls than this is a must buy!</li>
    <li> Good styler but hair gets stuck inside!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for the price and the quality is higher than I expected. I&#x27;d suggest getting yourself some rechargeable batteries. It only takes one AA but if you keep a few charged up you wont run out.</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great razor that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> My husband wasnt sure about it but he seems to like it now that he has tried it.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these to take care of the goatee that i have, because i don&#x27;t really like to shave it off when it gets too longs every 3 weeks, and wow does it do its job, its amazing, but I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times and it makes a very weird buzzing sound now, im sure its nothing major because it still does its job perfectly, and for only 13 bucks, its a steal</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor purchase and I&#x27;m glade I chose Gillette. Their Proglide series is amazing! It gives a smooth cut and easy to use. I just wish there was a rechargeable battery and I would give it 5 stars but its still great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good~I like it.I will be back soon.So i will take ti more.It&#x27;s very very good.It&#x27;s very very nice.</li>
    <li> it came with missing parts and did not work very good .the razor was broken and did not work. don&#x27;t buy this its trash .we couldn&#x27;t even return it back</li>
    <li> I have always loved the Gillette fusion series of razors, and when mine bit the dust recently, I figured an extra $10 to add on the trimmer was worth it.  The main reason I use the trimmer is for sideburns and cleaning up my neck line.  For both of those reasons, I have no qualms and feel it works great.  This will be the 4th purchase of a trimmer that&#x27;s less than $20 and so far, is really the only one that really gets results.  The other trimmers have either broken quickly, don&#x27;t trim at all, or the different trim length heads aren&#x27;t reliable.  If you&#x27;ve used Gillette razors before and need a new one, this is a good buy.  I also think Gillette nailed the aesthetics and design.  It looks sleek and has a great razor and trimmer holder that organizes everything neatly.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I used it only once then returned to my normal way. That&#x27;s why I left 2-star feedback.The trimmer is useless actually. It&#x27;s not sharp enough.</li>
    <li> The Gillette ProGlide is a nifty little trimmer.  I wanted a small useful trimmer, and that is exactly what this is.  It came with a battery, ready to go.  I really like that everything fits in to the stand and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on my sink.  I have not tried the attachments yet, but will post an update if need be.  Overall, seems like a great deal.  Only complaint will be when I have to purchase replacement cartridges for the Fusion razor accessory. This will not be an every day use for me, merely a trimmer when I need one.</li>
    <li> I like this because it gives a very comfortable and close shave which is hard to get for me because I have sensitive skin and razor-burn is common for me. Not with this! When I tried to just trim my facial hair without any attachments on it I was expecting it to act like an electric shaver, it doesn&#x27;t. Perhaps I was doing something wrong but it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut any hair for me with the main part and attachments, the razor attachment is probably what I will use this device for though because like I said it&#x27;s one of the best shavers I have ever owned and it&#x27;s super comfortable and glides right along your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide and have a subscribe and save subscription to order replacement blades. I keep a clean shave on my neck and cheeks while keeping a trimmed beard.  I thought this would really allow me to have one device which would allow me to solve all my shaving needs. Although technically it does, it doesn&#x27;t do this without a very awkward approach.  Unlike some devices which are dual ended to allow a quick flip to switch ends, the Gillette Fusion ProFlide 3 In 1 Styler requires that you attach add-ins to the end.  This means that you have your razor attached to a razor holder which is attached to the main styler unit. It feel very long at this point and not very secure, as it somewhat wobbles with use. Once you want to do trimming, you need to remove the razor and find a place to store it (it doesn&#x27;t really fit in the holder). If you don&#x27;t want the closest trim, you then need to take the one of two guards and attach this to the styler.  Again, it technically works, but is such a burden that I&#x27;ve given up and just use my regular ProGlide razor and this to keep my sideburns aligned.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wanting one of these. I ordered it for christmas this year and I am really hoping he likes it. It seems like a good product with several functions, which is what he is looking for. This did arrive on a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend a few months ago.  He was not too happy at first as he would have preferred the electric ones for marking out his beard as he felt battery operated shavers do not work as well.  After using it the first few times he was very pleased with the result and uses it a few times each week.  His head and face is so smooth after using the Gillette Fusion.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The men in my house like this a lot. They look better lately too.</li>
    <li> one of the best  item I have ever  used during my life, it is a peerless  razor, I couldn&#x27;t imagine that  another such  a precise gadget  could be made, but there are  strong possibilities. How ever it worths great  .</li>
    <li> This is probably the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. Not only does it trim very well but it&#x27;s also small. What I like about it is that this thing is definitely portable and small enough to fit when you travel. It only requires one AA battery and that is it. I&#x27;m not too crazy for the packaging, I think that if there was some case for the blade that would be nice and also cleaning the inside of the trimmer is very hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is a fantastic product! I threw out my old big phillips razor!</li>
    <li> This is a really great little product. As to the beard trimming aspect of it, it&#x27;s a really well designed little system, at a great price. Comes with 3 beard length attachments that attach and release very easily. Great for ladies, too. :)&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint would be the choice to come with a 5-blade razor attachment. I&#x27;ve always felt the 5-blades were overkill anyways, and just a reason for the razor companies to be able to charge their customer more. Well, in the case of this trimmer, seeing how the trimmer is designed for custom and cool beard and mustache styles, as they advertise on their commercial, a much smaller 2-blade razor works much better for tight places around the nose and lips that you need smooth clean edges on. I use a 2-blade for that.&lt;br /&gt;So hey, Gilette, lose the 5-blade, for a 2-blade attachment, and it will be a perfect trimming system.</li>
    <li> Very well thought out razor. I use both the trimmer and the razor every day IN the shower.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product first for my boyfriend because he wanted and when I finally gave it to him he loved it. He said it is an excellent product because it has basically 3 in 1. If you are curious of buying this then I suggest that you do try it because from the responses I&#x27;ve got from my boyfriend and other guy friends, they all say its a handy product for any guy. Since my boyfriend liked this product a lot, I&#x27;ve bought two more of the Gillette&#x27;s to give as a Christmas present. Don&#x27;t hesitate, try it for yourself either way it is not expensive.</li>
    <li> I chose 5 stars because I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutly loves it! He uses it all the time. I would buy this again, and recommend it to anyone! Very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Got it for $8 bucks and great for manscaping</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good kit for the price.  I paid ~$11 for this, and it was worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for the styling functions, and it works quite well. I get a much better trim on my beard than I have on many of the more expensive trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself works quite well, however I am unsure how much the vibration mechanism helps with the shave.  The stand is great as it holds everything in one place, and doesn&#x27;t seem too obtrusive on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative to this, is that adding the razor attachment opens up the trimmer which could possibly hurt it over long term use, however after the first 2 months it hasn&#x27;t seemed to be a problem.</li>
    <li> I loved my Fusion ProGlide and after 30 days it broke. While Amazon would not refund I called Gillette their helpful customer service team answered the phone quickly and were extremely friendly. After a few brief questions and proving I owned a ProGlide they sent me a coupon to replace the unit at no cost to me. I highly recommend purchase  and applaud Gillette for standing by their product. Their customer service number is 800-445-5388.  Note: My earlier review applauded the function of the product, the comfort of shaving, and ease of keeping professionally groomed. I&#x27;ve been a Gillette customer since I began shaving and they have renewed my confidence in them.</li>
    <li> This thing is really really fantastic!  It just works.  The only thing that might require a bit of a learning curve is \\&quot;opening\\&quot; the teeth to rinse it out.  The instructions say you&#x27;re supposed to do this after each use.  You may feel like you&#x27;re breaking it, but just push up against the teeth, and it will open, kind of like a snake&#x27;s mouth.  Rinse it out and dry, and snap it back the next time you use it!  Really perfect size for travel and carrying around.  I really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the way it shaves. The problem is how long it lasts. I was very disappointed when my trimmer stopped working on first use. If it wasnt for the length it lasted it would be a great product. There was no fix to the problem I was having with the trimmer so unfortunately it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Like the razor and attachments. A little hard to get the battery out for replacement, but that probably is to keep it water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;Also I wish it came with a carrying case for travel. I&#x27;ll just have to throw it in my bag...</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this thing. I use it every other day to trim my side burns and my upper lip. gets a pretty close shave with the eletrical head and when i really want to clean up i put the razor cap on AWESOME Product and CHEAP!.</li>
    <li> Cheap, not many lengths to cut, doesn&#x27;t really get a good stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at Conair iStubble and never look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 stars for the price and free razor.</li>
    <li> Have 2 of these and for the price they can&#x27;t be beat. I have managed to get over 2 years out of these and they are still running quite well. I believe some hair is clogged in one but for the price I will probably just buy another when it starts to be an issue.</li>
    <li> This Product was not that great i would not recommend this product to those with very thick hair (or) i would say very hard beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few days now. Looks like a toy when you open the package. My first reaction was: shouldn&#x27;t I return it? But it actually works quite well.</li>
    <li> I use this for body grooming and trimming the side burns.  It has 4 different levels, which is all i really need.  The hair sometimes gets stuck in the trimmer to easily.  It can go in water, but haven&#x27;t tried it.  Nor have i used the razor it came with.  I already have a razor... didn&#x27;t see the point.</li>
    <li> been using this for several months and it works fine. It is not very good at trimming mu mustach. Shaving and trimming hair and beard is great.. All in one.</li>
    <li> My husband is in the military and loves when he has a few days off that he can grow out his facial hair and this does a great job of keeping him nice and clean and trimmed. Great thing to have for your man!</li>
    <li> Both of our sons have been inquiring about grooming tools for their facial hair.  I have one of these and bought one each for our two sons.  They&#x27;re happy.</li>
    <li> An awesome product, the shaver is extremely helpful sometimes, and it gives you a nice clean shave, and the electric part somehow makes the cartridge last longer.</li>
    <li> I purchased it through amazon.com even though i live in Japan. Unfortunately, Japanese amazon doesn&#x27;t sold at time that i purchased it. I bought this because of it&#x27;s durability which i can use it when i travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s good product.</li>
    <li> i have a tough beard and pulls on whiskers mostly, nice idea, keep working on it, blades are expensive to replace but lasts a couple weeks for me</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer with high expectations.  This was foolish on my part; the fact of the matter is, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first 3 months, this styler exceeded my expectations.  I was blown away with how well it performed, particularly because I have very coarse facial hair.  The little motor and AA battery powered right through.  The best part was I could use it in the shower and avoid all that messy sink cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months passed and this thing absolutely died on me.  Regardless of whether I have a brand new battery in it, this shaver does not perform anymore.  I assume the motor burned out.  I guess I wasn&#x27;t all that surprised.  I&#x27;d suggest you spend a few extra dollars on a decent waterproof styler because you will have to eventually anyway.</li>
    <li> This is actually my second one, for my workout bag.I keep the other one at home.I&#x27;m the kind of person that shaves his head and grows his beard.this Gillette solves my problem.I used to have to take my norelco trimmer with me to the gym to trim my breasts before the shower, now I just take this Gillette and trim Mr based and shave my head with one simple machine</li>
    <li> very compact and versatile. it makes a novice like me look and feel like a pro. my favorite thing about this is that it wasn&#x27;t expensive... yes that means it probably wont last as long as others more expensive ones... but for someone who is just starting out this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> you cannot find similar products in this price range.  electric trimmer works great.  This is personal opinion:  it would be great if smaller manual shaver comes for detail trimming works.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these for me and a family member. Love this little shaver. I do wish it had more sizes but I do love this little guy.</li>
    <li> habe jetzt alles einmal ausprobiert und bin sehr angetan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eine super sanfte rasur in verbindung mit dem rasier-gel, einfaches konturen schneiden mit dem trimmer und den vorhandenen \\&quot;3-tage-bart\\&quot; pflegen mit den verschiedenen aufsetzten : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ich werde auf jedenfall dabei bleiben!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that adding vibration to a razor would really offer a better shave. I have sensitive skin, so I finally decided to give it a try. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It gives an incredibly close shave, yet it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Also, it has virtually eliminated the small nicks I would often get from my regular razor. This alone is worth the purchase, but also being able to convert it to a decent trimmer makes this one of the favorite items I&#x27;ve purchased in a while. One more recommendation--pair this shaver with the Gillette Proglide shaving gel. It lubricates the skin exceptionally well and enhances the shave.</li>
    <li> It was a wonderful present for my fiance. He loved it and acctully enjoys shaving now. Wish it came as a nose trimmer though.</li>
    <li> I would recommend just getting the fusion proglide instead of the three-in-one unless you really need a trimmer. I thought I would make use of it, but i only use it to do my  daily shaving. Blade feels decent, but still gives me razor burns here and there. The gel at the top wears real quick. I&#x27;ve used the shaver maybe 5 times now and already wearing out. I don&#x27;t even have that much facial hair. Still overall, it&#x27;s not bad. I would recommend it if you need the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> I am a Gillette fan and this product was a HUGE help in removing my beard!! I&#x27;d recommend this to any man</li>
    <li> Definitely would recommend this product. Bought rechargeable batteries for it. only downfall but I like that it is waterproof and don&#x27;t have to worry about getting water in it when you are rinsing it out.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer you&#x27;ll find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make one similar to this with a wider head and variable settings :) it would be the only good &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; on the market.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works as advertised. Easy to use and the attachments work perfectly...!</li>
    <li> My old rechargeable trimmer broke, so I started looking for a new one.  I was primarily interested in certain features (trimming beard &amp; mustache,  sideburns and nose hair).  I preferred a built-in rechargeable version so that I could avoid buying batteries over the years of use.  I know that I can use rechargeable batteries in this unit, but I wanted the recharging feature built in like my last few trimmers and avoid manual recharging.  I was intrigued with this model based on the manufacturer, design and good rating, but it had a few drawbacks which made me delay my purchase.  This product does not come with a nose trimmer and it does not have a built-in recharger. However, when I could not find any other trimmer that I liked, I kept returning to this one.  So, finally I bought it.  It was a good decision.  The battery seems to be lasting a long time.  I still don&#x27;t like the fact that it has no nose trimming adapter, but going back to manual nose-hair trimming has not killed me yet.  I tried the vibrating razor attachment once just for fun and it seems to work well.  But I still prefer my electric razor and I wonder how much the replacement blades will cost when the included blades are dull and need to be replaced.  Overall, Iike the quality of the trimmer and the job it does trimming my beard, mustache and sideburns; it seems to be a decent shaver as well.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs these features.  I would consider buying another one.</li>
    <li> Heckuva good deal. Use it to trim the sideburns and trim down the eyebrows every once in a while. Battery has been going strong for a while now.</li>
    <li> I got to use it once..... and it worked really well. However as the product was not listed as a disposable and all I got out of it was 1 use before it stopped working, I am going to say 1 star.</li>
    <li> Received a USED product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today, I received the item, and noticed the seal was broken. First I thought it should not be a big deal, and then, I realized that the thing you put the shaver on was full of tiny tiny cut hair pieces. So there you have it! 1 star!</li>
    <li> It is battery operated and it&#x27;s a disadvantage The battery should stay a little longer</li>
    <li> Works better than a $250 Braun!</li>
    <li> Why not? I asked myself the same question. The answer is: yes, you might as well. It&#x27;s a solid trimmer that also has a razor attachment. You can take it in the shower which makes this little gadget very versatile. It may be a little smaller that it&#x27;s competitors, but it is also a hell of a lot cheaper while still providing a good nick free trim. Do yourself a favor and just get it. You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> i am sorry but this is bad qualiti</li>
    <li> Got it on ridiculous promo price here on Amazon, I&#x27;m very impressed with this little trimmer so far.  Been using it about 3 months as a body groomer, it trims very closely, yet much more gently than the other groomers I&#x27;ve used, resulting in far less or no irritation or cuts!  I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower or wet conditions (as it&#x27;s supposed to be able to easily withstand), but in dry operation it works great!</li>
    <li> I love Gillete products, but this one really sucks, the trimmer does not have enough power to do one shave comfortably, plus it turns off every 10 seconds. Braun are good products so I have no idea what happened here. This was really a waste of money.</li>
    <li> lets face it, it&#x27;s 2015 nobody needs hair on their nether regions! This thing has upturned teeth that keeps snagging and other unfortunate mishaps down to a never.....unless you become to confident and get overzealous</li>
    <li> For something this cheap, the Gillette Fusion Proglide is very well made. Powered by Braun, it is sturdy, lightweight and waterproof. It has a trimmer (for contouring and edging), three combs (sizes 1, 2, and 3, which provide different trim levels), and a razor blade (you can easily buy replacements) for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powered by a single AA battery (which should last about a month of average use), the black rubber contours provide a firm grip. The power button is located beneath, and ejecting the attachment requires sliding the arrowed switch on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also provided is a nice plastic stand which houses the unit and attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it does its job very well and gives me a clean shave, as well as a comfortable trim of even the nether regions. I&#x27;m pleased as punch.</li>
    <li> Amazingly easy to shape your beard.  Comes with three attachments for different lengths, as well as another one for shaving.  IS waterproof too.</li>
    <li> I have had my 3-in-1 for over three years now, and it still runs strong. I&#x27;ve use it countless times, and I&#x27;ve never had any problems. I shave in the shower, and the waterproofing is flawless. Also works great for non-facial regions.</li>
    <li> I have been using the trimmer for a year and a half now.  A plus!  Buying them for friends for xmas now</li>
    <li> Cheap and quite good, I leave it at the gym and the batteries last for about a month, nice piece of utility.</li>
    <li> Does everything it show&#x27;s in the video add!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he LOVES it! Its awesome because he can trim his line up and shave his face with one tool. Works great! We can even use this to fix up his neck in-between hair cuts! This was an awesome value on Amazon as I saw this is stores for anywhere from $5-10 more. I especially love the caddy it comes with. Will help to keep the bathroom looking more clean and organized, everything fits nicely in it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son, and he loves it. It&#x27;s small enough for him to be able to travel with it and a great starter shaving kit for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.  when it wasn&#x27;t available in the local CVS pharmacy, I was very thrilled to find it on Amazon. This is a wonderful  way to protect one&#x27;s face and get a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!  I am a very hairy man and have used trimmers for over 20 years.  The Gillette Proglide Bidy Groomer is an answer to a hairy man&#x27;s or woman&#x27;s prayers.  After years of using cumbersome electric and charged trimmers, none of which were water proof, I have found a product that is exactly when I need.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for manscaping your hairy bits in the shower with or without the guards provided.  I have had this product for about six months and have replaced the battery twice.  Not to bad considering it using AA batteries, which are relatively inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking to have a groomed body and be sexy for your lover, than this is the product to buy.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and my husband absolutely loves it.  I read all of the reviews others had posted and purchased it based upon those reviews and am glad I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought some other electronic razors in the past and since this one only uses a single battery (which has lasted for months now), comes with guards for electric shaving and a razor attachment, it pretty much does everything an does it well for the best price out there.  Five blades is kind of ridiculous in my opinion if you&#x27;re just shaving, but if you have any facial hair or do any trimming then you really can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this for $7.47 and really that was the only reason I bought it.  Its fine.  It works ok but I really never use it.</li>
    <li> I recommend you buy this razor, you wont regret it!!!  its great for everyday use and its really cheap too!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly acceptable beard trimmer and a great razor. Considering the price, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free as a program that Gillette was running. I was skeptical at first when I heard about what the trimmer does. Once I tried it out, my thoughts totally changed. This is one of the best trimmers i&#x27;ve ever owned. I love that it is a trimmer and razor in one. It also includes guards for the razor so you could keep your facial hair nice and clean. I  highly recommend the fusion proglide, its the best trimmer i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I received mine through a free program run by Gillette, having used their products for years i was pretty optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to let my facial hair grow out so i could run it through the gauntlet so to speak since i got it for free.  It&#x27;s smaller than other trimmers i have owned but it was extremely comfortable to hold and use.  The guards and the power shaver change out easily, and it works as well as any trimmer i have ever owned.  I am extremely satisfied with it, as it performed flawlessly.  AND  since it is able to be used in the shower it works great as a body trimmer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks i notice to it are that it doesnt have a rechargeable battery, (although batteries are included with it initially), and that the power button is placed almost directly on the other side as the slide to change off the heads.  Which makes it easily pushed when you are changing them out.  but those are really minor things and overall i am very happy with it.  I definitely recommend this purchase.  Its just the right price and it works great.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer in the mail to test this product, and I just opened it up and recently used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It functions as a electric trimmer should do, and with no faults. I like how it has an attachment to add a razor to the end of the trimmer. However, it can get pretty bulky and large for a shaver. It is easy to maintain and upkeep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own a Norelco G370, which came with many different attachments, which is being sold at the same price as the Proglide Styler. I personally prefer the G370 as it contains a mini foil attachment for a close shave, if you are like me and don&#x27;t like to use shavers. I would five star this product it was a rechargeable shaver instead of the need to use AA batteries.</li>
    <li> Love how the razor stores and cleans so well. I received my power trimmer for free through a program ran by gillette. Did what is supposed to do and did it well. Would definitely spend the money and get one.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. I like the attachments. The storage stand is a plus. Its is built well. The trimmer is perfect for cleaning up your face, getting into the areas where a razor just cant reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad. I am not impressed with the razor part. I didnt see any difference in the vibration to a regular razor. I would rather use a non powered razor. This may not be the part for everyone. The good to this is if you like that part of it, all Fusion blades will fit this. I got this free from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler as part of a promotion and I was surprised at the quality of the product. I am impressed with the attachments and how functional the styler is. I like having the power option when shaving. The multiple attachments for trimming and styling makes this product a WIN! I will definitely be purchasing blade refills for this product. This styler part of the device is comparable to my high-end brand name trimmer. Definitely a great buy when you consider you get refill blades and a shaving head with the styler/trimmer. Save your money and buy this product instead of a larger trimmer with attachments.</li>
    <li> I was given a chance to try the Gillette Fusion power trimmer through a program run by Gillette. I thought the trimmer worked very well I used all three trimmer attachments they attach and remove with ease. I thought it was pretty heavy for the size it feels really durable. I thought it was very powerful running on just one AA battery. My favorite part is how easy it is to clean up, you just push the trimmer blades back and run it under some water. My only complaint is the trimmer is a little smaller so it takes a little longer to to trim my beard, but all in all I think this is a great power trimmer for being in the $20 price range.</li>
    <li> I received this from a program run by Gillette.  I was skeptical about a trimmer that is powered by an AA battery.  Once I used the trimmer I thought it was awesome!  It is great for trimming up your facial hair. It might be a problem for shaving off all of your facial hair, but for trimming it is awesome!</li>
    <li> When I found out I was going to be lucky enough to try this trimmer out via a free program provided by Gillette, I was pretty stoked.  I&#x27;ve had a beard for probably over half my life now, and the handheld, battery powered trimmers I&#x27;ve tried in the past have never really worked that well.  Hair clippers are great, but don&#x27;t provide a lot of precise control for tight lines.  My hope was that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer would be better at the things I didn&#x27;t like about what I had used in the past.  For the most part, it succeeded, but not on all fronts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got the trimmer and dug through the package, I was surprised at the weight it had.  I have used battery powered (both rechargeable and not) trimmers in the past and they all felt flimsy and too light.  This one does not.  It only uses a single AA battery, but has a nice feel due to its overall weight.  It feels very solid and well put together.  The rubber grips have the right amount of tackiness to not feel sticky, but they are easily held when the trimmer is wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package contains a little stand to put the trimmer and its attachments in.  It&#x27;s useful to me, but I can see others thinking it&#x27;s a little too clunky.  Along with the stand, there are 3 guards and a tool to affix a razor to the trimmer, more on that later.  The various guards are nice but I think it bears mentioning that they are all rather short.  If you are someone who wants to use this as a beard trimmer and have a beard longer than 1/4 of an inch, this won&#x27;t work for you.  It also would have been nice to know the guards lengths, but they are only labeled 1, 2 and 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I snapped the number 3 guard on and got to trimming.  I typically keep my beard around 1/2 inches long but that wasn&#x27;t an option for me as the guard was too short.  I&#x27;m actually rather pleased with the shorter length (which I am guessing is 1/4 of an inch) seeing the final result and might be keeping it like this for a while.  This is where the trimmer was somewhat disappointing to me, however.  I was expecting it to be a beard trimmer and while I certainly got through my rather thick and long beard with it, it took a long time.  My expectations might be more my fault than the products though, as it&#x27;s hard to expect a battery-powered handheld to replace what a hair clippers can do.  While it took a while to get through the jungle that was on my face, it did a good job and I think if I kept my beard trim, trimming the entire thing would be much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting the entire beard to length, I used the trimmer, minus any guard, to get the lines of my beard how I wanted.  This is where I fell in love with this thing.  The trimmer blades are perfect for getting lines down to a very finite detail.  If you wanted to trim a Batman logo on your face, this is the tool to do it with.  The smaller size, when compared to clippers (which was my standard go-to for my beard&#x27;s lines), is perfect to do exactly what you want from a design perspective and it trims shorter hair very, very well.  Once I got the lines done, I got a quick review from the fiancé and she said that she had never seen the lines look as good as they did after using this trimmer.  If she approves, you know I do, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last step was to snap the razor attachment (see my separate review on the razor blades) on and shave the non-beard locations of my face and my head as well.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head with razors for the last 10+ years of my life.  Typically I used a more standard sized handle razor to do this, but this was another thing I loved about the trimmer.  Being able to have the extra size, weight and rumble of the motor in the trimmer, while attached to the razor, is wonderful.  It just feels better to shave with it.  So much so I can&#x27;t see myself going back to a smaller handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing that impressed me about the trimmer was the fact I can actually spring the trimmer bladesfrom the body of the unit a bit to get rid of any excess hair that gets trapped, making this really easy to take care of and clean.  As I noted before, the overall build quality is fantastic and this speaks to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was impressed with the trimmer.  I don&#x27;t think it can replace my clippers when I need to trim a lot of length off my beard, but in tandem with clippers I think the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is going to be something I use long term to get the smaller details of my beard down as well as using the razor attachment to do my general shaving.  Gillette did a nice job of making something inexpensive not feel cheap and I&#x27;m pretty happy to use this going forward.</li>
    <li> Wow.... I had heard a lot about this little wonder. I never expected it to do so well. I have used many different razors and many different trimmers, this however took grooming to an all new level. I was so excited when I received one for free through a promotion ran by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first removed this little beauty from the packaging, I was a little confused as to what parts to keep and what parts where disposable packaging. After a quick flip through the instructions however, I had it set up and ready to go. I trimmed down my beard, IT WAS COMFORTABLE. I put the razor attachment, the 5 blades gave me a closer more comfortable shave then I have ever had. Finally I snapped on the #2 guard and trimmed up my goatee, and It looked better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was that I found it difficult to clean, but for the pride and comfort I got? I will take that....</li>
    <li> THIS SHAVER IS A NUMBER ONE TRIMMER FOR ME I WILL USE IT EVERY DAY. IF IT SHAVES LIKE THIS WHY NOT USE IT EVERY DAY AND WHY NOT BUY ANOTHER. ITS AMAZING THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME WHATS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF JUST SHAVING. I FEEL SO FRESH AND CLEAN AND GREAT WHEN I SHAVE MY FACE. THE HAIR IS NOT AS MUCH THICKER WHEN IT GROWS LIKE IT USE TO. I WANT TO TELL EVERY ONE GET UP AND VO TO THE STORE AND PICK YOUR SELF UP A GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER YOU WONT REGRET THIS OFFER.</li>
    <li> Easy to shave, Easy to handle. Very fond of the adapter pieces that come with the Gillette proglide 3 in1. Will definetly be recommending this to my buddies as it works very well and if highly affordable at around 20.00 a set. For this kind of shaving quality you cannot beat that deal. I was lucky to receive this product free from a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free through a program Gillette was offering. It is by far one of the better trimmers that I&#x27;ve used. It works well the trimmer has plenty of power and cuts clean!</li>
    <li> I first received the free razor from a promotion run by Gillette. After using the Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer, I must admit: it is way better than any other competition has out there. It does not cut you or nick your skin. I&#x27;m here to proudly say that it is the best trimmer on the market!</li>
    <li> As a part of a program put on by Gillette, I received free, this trimmer to try out.  I have a fairly thick bushy beard that was at the point I needed to trim it down.  I really like this trimmer to handle and it&#x27;s feel, the ergonomics are nice.  I got a nice even result, given the state of my beard I made groan a bit. This made me wish that there would&#x27;ve been a longer guide to go through my beard. I tend to like to keep my beard a bit longer. All in all I think this is a first rate product.</li>
    <li> I received this styler as a promotion from Gillette, and so far I think it works great. I don&#x27;t really have that thick of a beard to begin with, but this styler works well with what I have. I&#x27;m not sure if it would work the same with someone who has a really thick beard, but for me it works great. I really like that they have three different attachments for different lengths and I also like that you can use this product in the shower, because it saves time. I also like that it comes with an attachment for a razor that also has a trimmer built into the razor, for trimming your sideburns, which is what I use it for. Overall, I think this is an excellent product and I will continue to use it. Thanks for helping me maintain my style, Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free via a program run by Gillette. Really impressed with this razor from the start! Great little stand it comes with to hold the razor and all of it&#x27;s attachments looks great in the bathroom and keeps everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far a performance of the razor it works great, I have rough facial hair and usually end up with a couple of cuts when I shave. Been using this razor for over a week and no cuts! The combination of great blades and the small vibration of the razor gives you a great, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer attachments works perfect, really helps to get those nice straight lines around your sideburns. There area limited amount of lengths available with only 3 trimmer attachments but I personally have no complaints about this.</li>
    <li> I received this free from a program Gillette had- and I am sooo glad I got it- it should be on every man&#x27;s wish list! This thing is amazing and so easy to use !  Best thing ever! Love the Gillette stuff !</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Style from Gillette themselves through a program they are running where customers get to test free products. The Fusion ProGlisde Styler is very comfortable to hold and easy to put the attachments on it. At first it felt weird because it is so slim and a bit slippery but once you really get that grip on it you get a nice shave and you get no pulls or tugs from it. The blades on it are really fine but I go no cuts from trimming my beard whatsoever. Very nice product to take wherever you go and totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> It was fun unpacking the system until I tried to get the shaving head loose from the polymer retainer-that I had to cut loose with my Swiss Army knife.  After that it was easy to assemble and use-a bit bulky, but curved to the shape of the hand.  Where it excells is in shaving in the shower.  Close and no nicks.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> It allows you to shave easily without any troubles, easy to use. Shaves smoothly, Price is set at a good place as well and recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> Okay so here it is I do a lot of traveling and thinks to the constant restraints on traveling these days this little pack is one of the best you can have. While I travel i do not have shave but once I get back on the plane on need to be. Normally I have too care my trimmer and a razor but now this kit packs up everything nice. So the trimmer knocked down my beard nicely with no effort and trimmed my mustache down right nicely. Then to clean shave all i did was change the head and install what is the head of a Gillette Fusion Proglide i had no irritation what so ever which i was happy with. The other thing that is nice is the razer is powered by braun which is a powerful electric razor also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the only down side i see with this is i will have to use a a plastic bag the storage thing for it is not that great and they need to rethink that and hopefully come up with a better product.</li>
    <li> This product is better than the Schick version I used a few years ago.  That being said, if you are looking to use the trimmer for more than just keeping stubble in check, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.  The razor is exactly what you&#x27;d expect for Gillette.  Left my face smooth for two days.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler mustache and beard trimmer is the ultimate 3 in 1 tool For face Beard and Trim, I was very impressed with how easy it was to have everything in a nice holder and easy to get to. The trimmer worked great on my beard, This product saves me a lot of time now while im grooming.The Exciting part is the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for FREE.helping you to always look your best with all your quick grooming needs.</li>
    <li> This razor/trimmer combo is amazing. I was asked to try this razor via a program run by Gillette and couldn&#x27;t of been happier!! The trimmer is great!!! I love to maintain my beard with ease, and this product is all about ease. I love the power behind the trimmer!! Especially being my facial hair is quite coarse, but this was no issue with the power trimmer. I&#x27;ve used many trimmers over the course if time I&#x27;ve had facial hair but this is definitely in my top 3!!!</li>
    <li> Normally I just &#x27;risk it&#x27;, using a normal razor and have the barber clean up my sideburns when I visit.  Not anymore.  The ProGlide is awesome - and I can leave home without making it look like I got a professional job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, granted, I did get a promo one from Gillette, but even so I&#x27;m impressed.  I must say I didn&#x27;t realize I needed one until I got it, but it saved me time and did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the adjustment options as I can use the set to do a clean and professional job every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: they say that the batter should last for a month or longer, but since I travel a lot, i&#x27;m not risking it and have thrown a spare AA into my travel kit just to be safe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very impressed and pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler is very comfortable to hold and easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer really glides effortlessly and since first use with new fresh blades it caused no skin irritation and shaving without any small cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to receive the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer for free directly from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer could be improved since some attachments are sticking out on the back, it can only be placed on a vertical position and won&#x27;t fit easily on a bathroom sink drawer horizontally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to clean with the all metal handle, some other Gillette products that I used before with a rubber part and logo can not be thoroughly clean the same way this new all metal handle can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed since the moment I received the packaged in the mail and overall the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is great.</li>
    <li> The thought of a bunch of super sharp steel blades vibrating against my skin was little unsettling at best, but when I received a free Fusion Proglide styler from Gillette I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised! I got a very smooth and comfortable shave without pulling or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I got a significantly closer shave than a non-powered razor but it definitely was a good, clean shave. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower mainly because I don&#x27;t think mirrors and showers are a good combination.&lt;br /&gt; The trimmer is small, light and easy to use for eyebrows and for touch-ups around ears and sideburns between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt; Overall, a nice addition to my shaving kit that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product from Gillette has multiple functions all of which perform well. Long time user of Gillette products which is because they work well.</li>
    <li> I liked the product indeed. it has a really cool design, and it is quick and useful if you are in a hurry in the morning. if you are looking for a baby-smooth shave, look for Double-Edge Shavers. However, Gillette does its job well in terms of trimming and styling. For a better performance prepare your face with hot water, a brush and a shaving soap for a better shave. I wish the disposable catridges of Gillette could be less expensive...</li>
    <li> this is very good to trim mustache and beard also to trim eyebrows  I am able to do most of my shaving with this and batteries last real good</li>
    <li> received mine earlier than expected, it came in a nice packageand the style is awesome you cant beat it. it works well on the face and anywhere else you dont want hair in !</li>
    <li> Avevo acquistato in precedenza il modello simile prodotto dai concorrenti della Wilk***** ma niente a che vedere. Taglia davvero bene ed è molto pratico in ogni sua componente.</li>
    <li> So I recently decided to try growing a goatee, but as my past attempts have always ended within a week (usually after a shaping accident, I give up), I didn&#x27;t want to spend a tremendous amount on a trimmer.  While I didn&#x27;t buy this device through amazon (it had a couple weeks wait, while the local drug store had it on the shelf), I did pick one up and here are my impressions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Sufficient in terms of comb selection and power - there are 3 combs to adjust trim length and while they&#x27;re all fairly similar, the 1 keeps a nice close cropped goatee while a 2 lets it have a little bit more length&lt;br /&gt;2. The \\&quot;power shave\\&quot; feature, while okay, is something I will never use (that is, the regular razor head).  Reason?  22 bucks for 4 blades.  Absolutely insane.  I&#x27;ll stick with my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;3. Battery life is absolutely AWFUL.  I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month and, one body grooming session aside (worked great btw), have used it on average twice a week for quick shavings...and have had to change batteries twice already.  While it&#x27;s only one double A battery, it&#x27;s kinda ridiculous to have THAT short a battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, the styler is fine.  The blade itself isn&#x27;t really as sharp or fine as more expensive units, making shaving edges a bit more of a challenge than with a higher end trimmer, however after a month of use it&#x27;s still going strong and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart (as other reviewers have stated their units have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If what you want is a real entry level trimmer, I see no reason to spend any more than I did on this one.  It&#x27;s cheap, its easy, its maintenance free (other than battery changes) and it does a sufficient job of keeping my beard neat and tidy.  Works well for body hair grooming as well - though again you better keep a stash of batteries on hand.</li>
    <li> The proglide power razor that comes in the package is pretty good even with tough beards. The Styler that can be used as handle can be used as handy trimmer but not for tough beards. The blade width of Styler is less and for those who trim more often rather than shaving it might not be a good choice. But it is good enough to trim to finesse the sideburns or style your beard. A very good purchase for the price..</li>
    <li> I like it. Bogs down a little in heavy hair but just rinse and you are good again. Battery seems to last and and 3 attachments allows you to vary beard length plus you can attach a razor head for regular shaving.</li>
    <li> bought this to travel with as I travel a lot and liked the fact that it looks small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed, it is small, it also does a pretty good job, in fact no issues with the trimmer or shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downsides to me is that the battery does not really have much grunt, but it has just enough, ie one battery limits the grunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;secondly lacking grunt and a pretty small trimmer surface makes using the trimmer a bit slower than other electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all said I like it, I like it a lot, but will use a more commercial trimmer etc when at home</li>
    <li> I bought this originally from Target because I forgot my razor when going on an extended stay trip. I thought it was great that it came with both a regular razor and an electric trimmer. I am very happy with it so far. I have liked it so much that I bought two of them to give as gifts. If I am lazy I can use just the trimmer and its not too bad. It is not as close as an electric razor but definitely a lot quicker. I have not used the beard attachments but my friend has and loves them. The reason why the styler is not 5 stars is because the trimmers battery could be a little longer. I think this may depend on the type of batteries but i just wish the life was a little longer or possibly a wireless charger would be nice. The other reason is that when the trimmer gets a little wet it slows down a lot and doesn&#x27;t cut as well. Overall I am very satisfied though.</li>
    <li> A bit too heavy for a razor.  Perhaps it is trying to be too many things?&lt;br /&gt;Still trying it out as a trimmer.  Works fine as a razor.</li>
    <li> I have never used any other powered grooming products so I may not know what I am missing but this styler works well for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fast and easy to use. It can be a little tricky getting it cleaned but otherwise has been a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for travelling. It makes my life easier by bringing a trimmer and a razor at the same time. I will recommend this to anyone and I should also mention that I am extremely happy with the vendor and shipping speed.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this product I was amazed. It worked so well, especially for the price. Like I expected, the usual close shave with the Fusion Proglide Power blades, but the trimmer, wow! It does work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your willing to purchase expensive batteries, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up spending a ton of money just on batteries! I had to buy Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries in order to get full power for a good amount of time. Otherwise, if you buy cheap dollar store batteries, after two uses you&#x27;ll feel significantly less power than when you first bought it, trust me. And if you have less power, expect to have your facial hair repeatedly tugged on which of course is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it over 15 times AT LEAST (and I don&#x27;t use it every time I shave --- I don&#x27;t shave often) with the expensive Energizer batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a large enough beard to use the add-ons with the trimmer, although the first time I used it, it worked very well, even though I did not have a large beard. Now, it seems to no longer work very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product any longer and why? #1 batteries. #2 the Fusion Proglide blades are no longer any good. Dull, very dull, very quickly. They tug and pull and cut. In the end it looks like a scene from a horror movie. So yes, the trimmer works excellent if your willing to fork out $15 for two batteries, but not worth the purchase if your going to use Proglide blades.</li>
    <li> At first i thought this was a great purchase. It was powerful, accessible, portable, with a good look and feel to it. 1 month later torque began to decrease use after use. I didnt think much of it because i thought it needed new batteries, although after just one month seemed odd. When i changed the battery it worked just like new for about 20 seconds into the shave it again lost all its power. And thats just how it is. After not using it in between shaves it starts as if its new but only lasts for about 20 seconds until it loses its power and starts pulling hair.</li>
    <li> the diference thats gillette show, its the quality,of the razors powered by braun,  very smooth in the skin,l  for a perfect shave</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time to keep my facial hair trimmed as well as my sideburns. I recommend this to all men. The price was right and it looks great on my bathroom counter</li>
    <li> Its a pretty good product. Very slim and powerful enough.</li>
    <li> Great for the price on amazon. I got one on here and one at my local supermarket. I paid too much at the supermarket...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves well. The electric vibrate function is nice but you gotta go slow! Dont be a speed racer with this and try knock your shave time down to 30 seconds. That being said, it does shave well with one pass so you save time by not having to go over areas again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edger is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the trimmer attachments work well for trimming small areas but you wouldnt want to trim a whole beard with it.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, the longest clip size is great for gnarly eyebrows/sideburns. The small size is great for precision. Don&#x27;t expect to go buck wild and shave your head with this or anything.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Fusion trimmer looks really cool and fits great in the hand too. It has a rubberized feel, and is battery operated, running on 1 AA battery, which is included. Battery operated trimmers can be a bit of a double-edged sword, since you need fresh batteries to give it all the cutting power that it&#x27;s capable of. This trimmer comes with 3 different guards for beard trimming at different lengths, and a 4 blade shaving attachment as well. The trimmer is sharp and did a good job tidying up my beard. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using the 4 blade shaver much, but it&#x27;s an interesting idea to have it as an attachment on a trimmer. Everything&#x27;s color coordinated, and looks good, and functions well too. It&#x27;s nice and compact and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on my bathroom shelf, which is a plus. The base has compartments to hold all the attachments as well. The trimmer is not overly noisy which is also a big plus. I hate trimmers that rattle and buzz really loud. Here&#x27;s a helpful manscaping tip: put the longest guard on the trimmer, and run it over your eyebrows, so you don&#x27;t look like an unruly sasquatch! Oh and while we&#x27;re at it, trim your ear and nose hair too sometimes. There&#x27;s devices better than this for those purposes, but if you don&#x27;t have the appropriate ear and nose trimmer, this will make do. I&#x27;m always surprised at how many men walk around with disgustingly long ear and nose hair; and I&#x27;m not just talking about older men. It&#x27;s gross, guys, and doesn&#x27;t make you look cool or tough. Overall, this is a great little trimmer, and would be excellent for travel, given the size.</li>
    <li> pretty good at maintaining a beard, but the trimmer w/o any attachements does not get very close, still need to go back with the shaver. It does come w/ that so thats good but would have liked a closer non attachment trim. HOWEVER FOR THE PRICE EXCELLENT!!!</li>
    <li> Compact and useful. It has a &#x27;docking station&#x27; for all the tools, and has 3 different length guards for the trimmer which all work very well. They snap in solidly and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them sliding off. The powerglide razor is a nice touch, and it doesn&#x27;t become too unwieldy when shaving. All in all, this is a pretty nice thing to have.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this styler.  The add-ons help him keep his beard and facial hair trimmed to a length I can tolerate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;We ended up ordering this twice.  The first one contained broken trimmers and the second one didn&#x27;t respond to batteries and thus was broken.&lt;br /&gt;What a shame thought because they were great until they weren&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changed from a preliminary 5* to 2*</li>
    <li> Solid piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> This razor has a good grip and seems very reliable. Is certainly does the job for shaving but doesn&#x27;t shine like a star when it comes to trimming. I like it I&#x27;ll keep using it. But I&#x27;ll also use my regular trimmers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.At first I liked it but it stopped running after a few months. I change the battery and still don&#x27;t work. It trimmed well when it worked.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed by this shaver that I bought a second one. The only reason I bought this is because Amazon sells them for 12 bucks plus 3 or 4 dollar product coupon they offer. The total price is like 9 bucks for a trimmer/razor combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is electric and fully water proof. It has 3 fade clips and a razor w/ a trimming edge. The only problem is that it isnt a proper fine trimmer. If you want precise trimming, this thing cannot do it. I wanted to do my own edge up and slick Spaniard beard trimming w/ this thing (like in the commercials) but it can&#x27;t. I use another norelco electric trimmer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But still, at $9 bucks I definitely recommend this it.</li>
    <li> Just an all-around wonderful product. Very Affordable for it&#x27;s capabilities</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever owned. Its got a good price and is a great size. It takes batteries which is a plus because my previous shavers took forever to charge and never lasted long enough.</li>
    <li> I´ve been using this beard groomer for almost 2 years, previousely I had tested other brands and didn´t last more than 6 months. This is far the best beard groomer I know.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed that it worked so well</li>
    <li> Works Great, excellent quality, cheap</li>
    <li> Ok so I went through two of these things.  The first one lasted a few months and then one day just stopped turning on.  I emailed GIlette and they sent me a $25 coupon for a replacement.  My local CVS sells it for $28 + tax so I had to shell out the difference.  The thing literally broke on my very first use.  The head just broke right off, looks like the hinge that holds it together is just glue.  Cheap plastic construction, no durability.  Garbage product.  Steer clear.</li>
    <li> I like using this to trim in and around my beard. if only they had a size 4, but still its a very effective grooming kit. I had a con-air  trimmer but suddenly wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, so I upgraed to this one. Very happy with product and price</li>
    <li> I loved this ever since I started using it! It works amazingly and works perfectly to trim up your beard or to even shave off the whole thing. The only downside is that after a while it loses its power, but that is going to happen over time with something that is powered via battery.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the price, and what I use it for. Great for shaving pubes, and occasionally the beard. The waterproof aspect makes this a viable option.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product! It did exactly what I wanted it to do!  It provided a smooth, close shave, as well as helped me trim my goatee and mustache.  I was pleasantly surprised by the device.</li>
    <li> You can tell this was designed by a guy for a guy which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is clean and crisp and I like the clear shell can be re-used to pack it while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The non-slip grip is just the right girth.  I hate shaving with something too skinny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All components work great.  The trimmer by itself works perfect for shaping up your neck or sideburns.  The attachment guards are a good quality plastic and work great.  I really like the ability to just add on the razor blade and shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased so far and feel like they got this one right!</li>
    <li> I was *super* excited to try this new razor out.  I don&#x27;t particularly like shaving with a razor, and I often opt to use an electric trimmer.  However, even the best electric trimmer only gets so close to the skin -- a razor always gets closest.  So the prospect that a product finally combined the best of both worlds (that is, a razor to get real smooth in some places, and an electric trimmer to trim other places), was pretty inviting and exciting.  However, this device didn&#x27;t deliver.  Even without any clips/combs attached (and this razor comes with 3), hardly any hair was removed from my face -- definitely not a very good \\&quot;edging\\&quot; device, as advertised.  With the combs on, again, hardly any hair is removed -- I even tried shaving an area of my leg just for the hell of out (and my legs are very hairy) to no avail -- doesn&#x27;t look like I took a trimmer to them at all.  As far as the razor goes, it&#x27;s as good as any Gillette razor blade -- however, I don&#x27;t think the motor adds much to the experience, and, moreover, attached to this hefty handle, it makes shaving excessively bulky and awkward.</li>
    <li> The Gillette fusion proglide styler is the best on the market! After using this multiple times I&#x27;m a true fan and will continue to use nothing but this. It&#x27;s smooth and causes no burn or cuts.</li>
    <li> More heavy duty than i thought. Really like the storage container that comes with it, makes keeping all the pieces together easy. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This razor is a masterful piece of technology combined with fantastic ergonomics that makes for a great shave. I would highly recommend this product, and I already have to many of my friends and family. They were curious as to why my facial hair looked like it was crafted by an artist. The free razor that I recieved was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is a good concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was attractive but I had difficulty taking the attachments out of the package.  I almost broke one of the pieces.  I did, however, like how organized the attachment holder was and that I do not have to worry about losing pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very thick beard and found it difficult to make my face completely smooth with the razor but found it to be great in trimming my side burns, chest hair  and other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product and would recommend as a trimmer but not necessarily as a shaver.</li>
    <li> Had been looking at getting one of the these for a while, but never committed. Got lucky and got this free from Gillette to give it a go. Wish I would have gotten one a long time ago because it is great. The styler goes an awesome job of being a shaver, trimmer and trimmer with guides. The ease of is one of the winning features. One push button controls both the trimmer and vibration for the shaver. Also it is very simple to switch from shaving to trimming and back again. The blade snaps on to shave and pushing another button pushes the blade off allowing to you use the trimmer. It&#x27;s also nice how it comes with the three separate guides. This offers a really easy way to get things the length you want instead of eye balling it.&lt;br /&gt;While most of the styler is super easy to use I do with wish the trimmer guides were a little more user friendly. With the guides on the trimmer it&#x27;s not completely clear if the trimmer should be held horizontally or more vertically in comparison to what your shaving. I have had the best results holding the trimmer in a more horizontally position when trimming things up. Would definitely recommend this to only one that wants one thing to both shave and trim.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Power Trimmer is the way to go!  I cannot believe what an amazing job it did.  I normally take time trying to trim and sometimes I do a better job than other times.  When I used the Gillette 3 in 1, I could not have been more pleased. The razor was given to me via a program given by Gillette.  It was my pleasure to try it out.  I will continue using it because of this trial.</li>
    <li> This Trimmer is absoultly amazing! The price makes it well worth it - it does the same thing as the other razors out there that are over 100.00. The one flaw I do not like about this product is that I wish it was not battery operated - im not a big fan of produts that dont have personal chargers. SO far it has not stopped on me so im giving it its full chance and im very well impressed!</li>
    <li> When I received this trimmer for free, I am not going to lie. I was a little skeptical about it and how effective it was going to be. I have had different Gillette razors in the past and was pleased with all of them. This set came with the power razor, 3 detachable trimmers and the actual power trimmer itself. I have tried the trimmer itself as well as one of the detachable trimmers and they both worked great and really exceeded my expectations. If you are looking for a new trimmer I would highly advise you to pick this one up!</li>
    <li> When I first heard about the ProGlide styler I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve had bad experiences in the past with multi-in-one products. I received the Styler through a program by Gillette and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past week. I have to say, I am very pleasantly surprised by how well it works. Due to my job, I am not allowed to have any facial hair other than sideburns, and the ProGlide styler keeps them razor straight and trimmed to a good level. My only complaint is that it only comes with 3 guards for the trimmer; a 1, 2, and 3 guard. A 4 guard would make it perfect for me. Everything about the product is super convenient, including the handy little stand that it comes with, and the fact that its water proof.</li>
    <li> So, I tried out this new trimmer provided for free through a program run by Gillette. I grow a beard from time to time and do some occasional man-scaping as well. Normally I use a relatively cheap AA-powered Braun trimmer to keep my beard short and also to address any other &#x60;taming&#x27; needs that may arise. The trimmer was light in my hand and easy to use. However the trim head itself is on the small side and felt a bit underpowered. It took longer to trim my beard with this trimmer as I needed to make more passes over my face. For someone with a lighter beard this might be OK, but for me I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for something with a little more kick to it.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide Styler for free via a program run by Gillette.I found this finely crafted grooming tool both easy to use and quite efficient in it&#x27;s operation.&lt;br /&gt;I have used small grooming trimmers in the past and have found them limited in their ability to control my wild hairs on my body as well as my hair line.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a beard so my use of this finely crafted tool is in the shower to clean up my hair line and shave my face. Both of these chores are more comfortable and superior with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;As for the design, there is no question that much thought was involved, the handle is shaped for maximum control and comfort both as a trimmer and a razor, I have delicate skin for a guy and this is the softest, smoothest shave I can recall.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is with the packaging and the stand; the instructions do not offer a easy way to understand how to change the trimmer guides or whether the tool will work in a shower environment. The stand does not have a compartment for the extra blade guides and cannot be fixed to the wall in the shower. As a rating I would give this tool a rating of 95 and the stand a rating of 50.&lt;br /&gt;This tool is now my permanent grooming appliance and I look forward to enjoying it for a long time.</li>
    <li> The Power Trimmer was nice with the many different options of size and how it handle though thick hair and when it was use though spots that didn&#x27;t have as much hair. I found it easy to change to a different size guard easy and did not take a long time. Clean the trimmer didn&#x27;t take long either. I did appreciate get this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer though a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received my proglide razor in the mail from a program run by Gillette. I can say right now, you won&#x27;t regret getting this product. The trimer is ready to by o out of box.</li>
    <li> I tried several razors before finding this one. Easy to use, easy to charge, good cut</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer as part of a program run by Gillette. I can honestly say that this is one of the best trimmers I have ever tried. It trims close and provides easy lines. I also enjoy the battery powered feature, it puts my mind at ease knowing it is not going to die so rapidly. I would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I enjoyed this trimmer, it would be a good investment for a gentleman with a beard/goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;On/off button for the trimmer or vibrations for shaving&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer has a big handle that fits into your hand&lt;br /&gt;Has 3 guards to trim your facial hair. 1, 2 and 3 length guards&lt;br /&gt;A very handy ProGlide Caddie to store the trimmer, guards and razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Con I have is that it did not come with a little brush to clean out the trimmer blades or motor.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer as much as I actually did. Finally I can keep some facial hair on my face without looking like a slob!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest pros for me definitely would be: it&#x27;s much smaller then most products of this type, there is no powercord to get in the way, and it&#x27;s very simple and easy to use and figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have nothing bad to say about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer! It&#x27;s an awesome product and definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Received this as a freebie in a promotion run by Gillette. Small and convenient. Works well for the money you&#x27;re putting in to it. Only complaint is that it runs on batteries.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Styler from a special program by Gillette. The Gillette proglide styler is great! It&#x27;s got four attachments and its compact for traveling. The power on this styler is very good. It cuts through my thick facial hairs like nothing. I really like the size of it and its waterproof. This Gillette styler has just replaced the other machine I have.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer to test from Gillete and am very impressed with it. Being a wet/dry it is very handy to use it in the shower. With the variety of trimmer guides and the shaver attachment it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I once got a cheapo trimmer, thinking the job of trimming didn&#x27;t need a space-age piece of equipment. Boy was I wrong. The cheap trimmer didn&#x27;t trim to the proper length, and it didn&#x27;t even trim evenly. Thankfully, I received this Fillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free through a special Gillette program, and it has been simply amazing! It&#x27;s fast, easy, and effective. And the price is a super-steal too!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and since this is a #1 Dermatologist Recommended Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades I was excited about trying it. Let me tell you that I have no skin irritation whatsoever. I am happy with the blades and since I am a truck driver the system is compact enough for me to carry on the road with me and gives me that \\&quot;Barber Shop\\&quot; look that I cannot always achieve on the go. Thank You I am now a loyal ProGlide fan! If you have any doubts give it a try.</li>
    <li> May 24, 2013 by Louislampell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a Gillette promotion. First, the trimmer. I have a tightly trimmed goatee and have used a major brand expensive beard trimmer for years. The Braun trimmer that is part of the Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is better, It is more precise, easier to use, more comfortable and, with the storage stand, super convenient. My goatee has never looked better! Secondly, the new shaving blade is outstanding the improvement made to the trimmer blade makes it less irritating and the results are much smoother. The \\&quot;power\\&quot; shaving is the best I&#x27;ve experienced. Great product. I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received Gillette&#x27;s Proguide Styler Power Trimmer for free through a program run by Gillette.  The styler/trimmer is great and the choice on the different heads is amazing.  It gave me the ability to trim more complicated areas because of the smallish size of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product looks very appealing and the trimmer is very strong.  The attachments for the trimmer click on and lock on and can even be used in the shower.  The razor head is okay on it, but when you turn on the trimmer with the razor blade attachment, you do not get the cleanest shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the razor for about a week and my beard has never looked so organized and professional.  I have received multiple compliments on how straight the lines on my beard are and I plan on using the razor long term.</li>
    <li> This shaver system looks like it would cost $30-$40 buck.  It deff performs like it though.  It&#x27;s small compact design is easy to hold and vibrates to get even closer.  I use it everyday and just wish it had different speeds on it.  I love the attachments and how quickly you can put them on and off.  I m not sure if this is water proof or not but I assume it is.  The packaging seem to make is look more expensive then it was but the quality if it seems really good so far.  I would deff recommend this product for a higher end shaver without spending a lot.</li>
    <li> Outstanding device. Gillette sent me a free Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 Styler to try and I love it. The handle is comfortable to use and easy to turn on and off. Its easy to attach and detach different peice to the handle. I even shaved my head with it and it powered straight though it. The handle already had the batteries in it and a tab to pull to activate the batteries in the handle. It came with a razor and three grooming guards.  The stand that comes with this device is a great way to keep everthing the device comes with neat and orderly. I highly recommend this for trimming, shaving, and many other grooming needs</li>
    <li> I received my free proglider razor via a program run by Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;I have to say it is awesome. I was using Gillette Mach3 for years and convinced that there is nothing better than this exists but now that proglider has come it definitely tops the mach3. It is very smooth and feel very good on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing i could be improved in next version to make it rechargable batterys rather AA batterys.. it an additional exp to use it :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely 5 star...</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Opening the Gillette Fusion ProGlide was exciting. On first touch it was light and stylish by itself. I immediately tried out the trimmer heads and did a little mustache work. Though not obvious from the instructions, it was fairly easy to figure out which head was which. And without the guard, a clean straight line was easy to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a bit smaller than others, but that&#x27;s perfect in retrospect, because it allows for easy maneuverability around edges, affording you the ability to see the whole picture (think, making a clean cut around a beard line, or under the mustache). Other larger trimmers can leave zig-zag lines when the edges go out farther than you think (I have actually lost corners on my mustache from other trimmers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the same handle to shave with is another plus... it means one less thing to lose or one less handle to have hanging on the counter all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two small \\&quot;cons\\&quot; if I must:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s not completely clear that the entire unit can be used in the shower. I&#x27;m still not certain if the unit is sealed and what to do after it gets wet. There are also no cleaning or lubricating instructions for the trimmer blade (if necessary, how often should it be cleaned? What is the life expectancy of the unit overall?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The packaging looks great, but if this is supposed to be used for a case or stand, again it&#x27;s not clear what do do with the extra blades when buying a multi-pack (I assume they are sold as multi-packs, based on past experience). I would prefer, for the sake of all the plastic, to have a full \\&quot;Stand\\&quot; that accommodates multiple blades, and maybe even a carry-case for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, I&#x27;d give it an 90, and I am sure I will use it over and over and over again.</li>
    <li> I received this for free via a program run by Gillette. It did a really nice job of trimming up my sideburns. I have used other trimmers in the past but this one did a really nice job. I like that it comes with a stand to put it in, it helps me to stay better organized. The trimmer works well, is easy to assemble &amp; clean up. Overall a nice product.</li>
    <li> Recently had the opportunity to try the new Gillette Fusion Proglide power styler free through a program Gillette was running and I was definitely impressed. The trimmer is awesome, plenty of power pack into it, designed by bosch. I like that it comes with several different guards which allows me to choose how long I want to trim. It&#x27;s easy to use and was easy to clean. I&#x27;ve tried several different small beard trimmers and this one I think performs as well as the more expensive plug in models. I thought it was a great value and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer as part of a program running through Gillette. First, I was pretty impressed with how the trimmer and add-ons were packaged. It wasn&#x27;t shoddy or careless packaging, they really did a good job making sure all the components were properly secured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After unpacking the trimmer I was surprised by its heft. It didn&#x27;t feel like cheap materials or anything. I liked that it felt solid and durable in my hand. The trimmer comes with an additional razor attachment for close shaves, as well as numbers 1, 2, and 3 trimming guides so you have options for how close you want your beard or hair trimmed. There is also a stand that holds every attachment for a convenient display next to your bathroom sink. Also, it comes with an AA battery already installed so all you have to do is unpack it and turn it on, simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the trimmer, I was a little skeptical. Previously, I&#x27;ve really only had experience with the trimmer attached to my electric razor and it did okay, but I could never quite get the look I wanted because I had to have a steady hand and judge hair length on my own. I had many accidents where I accidentally trimmed my beard too much on one side so I had to even it out on the other side and it ended up being a mess afterwards. So when I first started using the trimmer I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I quickly grasped how powerful the trimmer is. It cuts hair like butter which was a welcome surprise in comparison to my electric razor&#x27;s trimmer. I started using the ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer more and quickly was able to get smooth, clean edges around my beard and it already looked way better after just a couple minutes of use than it ever did with my electric razor. I attached the number 2 guide to the trimmer and confidently started moving it up and down across my beard without fear of it cutting closer than I wanted it to. The guide does a fantastic job ensuring you that it won&#x27;t trim off too much. I switched to the number 1 guide for the top part of my beard for a light fade and it worked very well. In about three to four minutes I was completely done grooming my beard and it looked awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So before I started using the ProGlide trimmer I did not maintain my beard much at all because it was such a hassle with my electric razor. I usually only attempted it once or twice a week. Now, I actually look forward to the morning to touch it up again and make sure it looks its best each day. The trimmer is a breeze to clean, too. It&#x27;s such an easy and convenient tool to have and even if you&#x27;re only into shaving, the razor blade add-on cuts close enough to replace any conventional razor you have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the ProGlide Power Trimmer.</li>
    <li> I love Gillete Fusion ProGlide. Its pretty easy to use and takes care of my daily grooming need. very affordable as well.</li>
    <li> I was provided with this free razor via a program run by Gillette, it was ok for a trim but in all honesty it could use a bit more power or maybe rechargeable.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s perfectly portable, the only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t recharge.  A shame that it doesn&#x27;t recharge because the style, size and weight make it completely portable for traveling or taking it on the go in your car.  Other than that I loved the razor/trimmer!</li>
    <li> I got this proglide 3-in-1 styler free, from a program run by Gillette. I love the way it works on my mustache, side burns and eyebrows. I have very coarse, thick facial hair and had zero issues getting it to work just the way I like. I think this trimmer would be great to travel with and it worked excellent for me. I recommend it to anyone looking to easily keep groomed and wanting a great look.</li>
    <li> I found this to be easy to use, powerful enough, and gave great results.  I recommend to friends! If you are looking for a decent trimmer, this is it. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler free through a Gillette run program.  I was skeptical that this one product could fulfull all of my styling needs.  However, I must admit that I am impressed.  The razor provides a nice, close shave and the trimmer works very well.  My only complaint is that the trimmer and attachments aren&#x27;t easy to clean and clear of the removed hair.  It was also difficult to tell which of the three attachments provided the closest cut.  Overall, this is a gret product and is far superior to other razor/trimmer combinations that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> This styler is a very good product. number one because it is a gillette brand and they are known for exceptional razors. and 2 because it trims and cuts exactly what you want it to cu or trim and whever you want it to cut or trim. i do recommend trimming excessively long hairs at first because they will get caught in the trimming blades.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler works great! The best part about it is that I got it for free to try as a promotion through Gillette. It has so many different uses--I can trim my bread at different lengths, as well as shave. The only bad thing I have to say about this product it that I think it needs a more user friendly carrying case. Other than that I am thoroughly satisfied with this product and I definitely recommend that you try it out for yourself, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free by a program run by Gillette to test and give my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say it was great. I have been disappointed by other all in one products (not by Gillette) so I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using, Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer,I was pleasantly surprised and very happy. My other system of shaving used to irritate my skin so badly and leave me with burn marks all up and down my neck and face. I love that it goes in the shower as well, makes shaving easier. It also works great on body hair too. My chest and arm hair gets to long and it annoys me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can look great for my lady on our wedding day.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler was provided to me free of charge via a program run by Gillette - but I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to try it.  The styler helps make my daily shaving routine faster and cleaner overall.  The attachment combs are great for sideburns and the back of your neck - perfect for between haircuts.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer for FREE via a Gillette program. I&#x27;ve been using my trimmer for about two weeks now and I love it. I like the fact that you can attach the ProGlide razor to the trimmer and get a smooth shave. The three attachments that come with the trimmer are a good length and I like the fact that they are a fixed length. I used to have a norelco beard trimmer that did not have a fixed length and it moved while trimming making my beard uneven. The trimmer is really light and easy to maneuver. You will not be disappointed in purchasing this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have tried many trimmers and shavers over the years and was excited that I got to try one for free from Gillette condsidering that they can be so expensive to find the right one.  But let me tell you there will be no more trying for this guy.  I have found the one.  My facial hair is so thick that I have a hardtime using a trimmer because it gets clogged very easy and pulls my hair.  The Gillette Fushion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer did not do this.  I started with the shaving blade on the sides and then added one of the covers to trimm a goatee.  They both were effortless.  No need for shaving cream or after shave when I was done and no irritation from either the blades or the trimmer.  I have suffered from bumps and burning face after a shave that I have to use shaving cream and aftershave, but not with this one.  This styler leaves me smooth and bump free.  Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> i received my gilette proglide styler as a part of gilette&#x27;s program to try to product and provide feedback back. I have multiple reasons for liking this product, first of all, i like the design, its sleek and handy and extremely comfortable to use. I am easily able to maneuver and use it for trimming my facial hair. secondly, i like that it gives a close shave, my face is the kind where if i shave in the morning, by the afternoon, i will have a visible stubble. this gives a closer shave and my wife is very happy with me. the fact that it is water proof is an added bonus. I like that it has a number of attachments but i do not enjoy that the post trimming clean up is a pain. but when u gain something, u lose something and getting a clean and close shave is worth the troublesome cleanup.</li>
    <li> I recieved a free Gillette Fusion powerglide trimmer from a program run by Gillette. I got a Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer about 2 weeks ago and I love it. It is a more compact trimmer wich makes it easier to use. I have a very course beard and the trimmer cuts the hair of my beard without any difficulty. The The attachments are wonderful. The extensions do not have tynes that stick out so when I trim my mustach I am not sticking tings in my nose. It also comes with a razor attachment so I only need one item to do my personal grooming. I love this trimmer!</li>
    <li> Overall, this was a great product. I got this for free from a promotion Gillette was running and would definitely recommend it to others. It works just like it was described in the description and in the commercials. The trimmer was especially useful as I found most trimmers do not do the trick. This one is well built and seems like it will last me a while.</li>
    <li> I love the versatility of this product.  The razor does an amazing job when it comes to shaving, feels like you are not even shaving.  I would highly recommend the Proglide to all you men out there!</li>
    <li> When receiving the power trimmer I was excited to see how light it was. It was like no other power trimmer. You would think since it was so light it wouldn&#x27;t have as much power as many other trimmers but it did. My one wish was that it was a little bigger so I can shave larger areas but this is just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I got this product for free because it was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I recently received a ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a promotion by Gillette. Previously I have had to use a hair trimmer to help trim and maintain my beard. While it&#x27;s not very thick and not very long, it&#x27;s still a hassle to have to keep it trimmed down and this has so far been the best tool to use for this task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Power Trimmer is very likely going to replace my hair trimmer for this purpose. It didn&#x27;t catch on hair when I was using it and kept everything uniform as I trimmed my beard down. The styler also helped me keep an even growth after I had shaved so that I was keeping straight lines along my jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only three attachments for trimming and they are all relatively close in length. I don&#x27;t believe there are any extra extensions for this but that would be one downside in terms of growing a longer beard. I also don&#x27;t have very thick facial hair, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure how well this would work on a more fuller beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual handle and tool is just a bit larger than a regular razor blade system, like the Fusion ProGlide, and is very lightweight and portable. The razor blade and the trimmer attachments slide onto the handle and a small eject button easily removes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire kit comes together in a small package, about the size of a new razor, and the components fit together in a plastic holder so you can keep things organized and not just sliding around in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this will definitely find a permanent home in my bathroom for my future grooming needs.</li>
    <li> The trimmer / shaver combo is working fine. The trimmer works even for hair and it&#x27;s very easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I am very dissatisfied with the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-in-1 Styler.  It&#x27;s trimmer head is very dull.  I can&#x27;t do any trimming of styling with it.  A waste of my money</li>
    <li> TWO WEEKS BACK I RECIVED A FREE Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Trimmer FROM A  program run by Gillette,WHEN I GET IT I THINK ITS AN AVERAGE PRODUCT WITH A COMPACT SIZE . BUT AFTER FEW TRIMMING I UNDERSTOOD THIS PRODUCT IS VERY USEFUL FOR BODY HAIR REMOVAL SPECIALLY UNDERARMS AND CHEST ,ON BEARD ITS WORK AS REGULAR TRIMMER BUT EASY TO REMOVE HAIR  ON NECK AREA&lt;br /&gt;I SUGGESTING THIS PRODUCT FOR BODY HAIR REMOVAL</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion is just what I was looking for!  It was a free gift from Gillette, and I have recommended this to several of my friends.  Its not always easy to get to the barber shop - and now I dont have to!  The trimmer keeps my edges clean, and it is quick and easy to use!  Before this product my sideburns would grow out and I&#x27;d try to shave them down between haircuts - sometimes not so evenly.  Now with this, its super simple to keep them clean and even - saving me $$ between haircuts!</li>
    <li> This product gives a great trim or a great shave for a great price. I have had no problems and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program sponsored by Gillette.  I have to say with complete honest that I love this trimmer. It is very powerful for its size. I use it all the time just to keep my hairline trimmed. I would recommend this to any one. The only downside though, is that it is a little hard to clean.</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty impressed by this product.  I find that it&#x27;s typically hard to find a good trimmer at a decent price and the fact that this is a trimmer/razor combo makes it all the better.  I love the fact that this trimmer came with a stand and multiple trimmer heads for different looks.  That part is awesome!  Plus, it does pretty well in the shower which is a bonus since that&#x27;s where I do the majority of my \\&quot;manscaping maintenance\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I love this thing,(Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack) its the one product that can do it all. Not only does it give that awesome shave that you have come to expect from Gillette, But  it has a top notch Braun trimmer to get those clean lines for a just cut look. The Styler comes with a nice click and go system to change from razor to clippers with three different clips. Oh yeah did I mention its waterproof, so yeah you can trim any of your hair anywhere, whether its in front of the mirror or in the Shower. Way to go Gillette.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awesome. It gets close but has options with all of the attachments. I really like the straight razor attachment as well!</li>
    <li> This 3 in 1 styler was awesome. This is the type of product I would purchase in the future. I like that everything is included in one area. I like how it is powered also. The shaver provided a close enough shave that I could skip a day or two on shaving or trimming. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> First I received the Proglide as a promotion from Gillette. While I nver have given much thought to using a product like this versus a manual shaver,I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to use and handy it is to keep the Proglide in the shower and do my shaving and grooming all in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty lightweight and easy to control. Provides a close shave and the interchangeable heads provide a range of grooming alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely keep on using it to see how it wears with more usuage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the chance now to use the ProGlide Styler for nearly 2 weeks. I happened to be going on vacation the week after I received the ProGlide in the mail so it gave me the perfect opportunity to test out the new trimmer. I have incredibly thick, coarse hair that is difficult to work with. Conventional razors really wreak havoc on my face and cause all sorts of in-grown hairs resulting in bumps and breakouts. I have been using an electric (plug-in) trimmer for over a year to trim facial hair and my hair line in-between haircuts. I have to say, the ProGlide Styler is so easy to use! Not only is it incredibly easy to travel with, it is incredibly quick and efficient at giving me a quick trim in the morning before work. What&#x27;s best is that I have had absolutely no irritation and have used nothing but this trimmer since I received it. I like how sleek it is and the versatility of having all the different extensions for each application. I certainly plan on exploring more with the different extensions and taking my grooming to a whole new level. This is a great product that I have already recommended to my father-in-law, especially after seeing the price at the store, what a great value! I haven&#x27;t found a product on the market that compares.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive my free power trimmer through a Gillette program.  My excitement was well rewarded with one of the best, most versatile trimmers I have used.  I travel with my family often and find myself either failing to trim my beard on vacation, or having to lug around my razor AND a trimmer in order to keep my facial hair maintained.  The Gillette power trimmer was a great solution.  While it lacks in a wide variety of options for hair length, it does offer three choices, one of which easily suited my needs.  Running on a rechargeable battery, the system worked well, even in the shower, making for especially easy clean up.  Packing it was a breeze and it already includes the razor and only took up a little more space than my razor normally takes up on a trip.  The razor head was easy to remove in order to affix the trimmer attachments, and it all fit nicely into a convenient stand and hard plastic travel case.  I have been an avid fan of Gillette in the past, but the power trimmer has added a new degree of ease to facial hair maintenance, especially with the idea of travelling with less luggage.  I highly recommend this item to anyone interested in precision trimming and facial hair maintenance.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusin ProGlide Styler from a program ran by Gillette.  I was rather skeptical at first as I thought this is just another Fusion razor.  After using it one time I realized the shave is much closer than other Fusion razors and the handle is rather unique.  It is much easier to hold and does not slip out of your hand even if it gets wet.  I also like the fact that it has the combs that make it easy to trim sideburns.</li>
    <li> This is a handy grooming tool that was provided via a program run by Gillette for free. It was smooth, accurate and convenient!</li>
    <li> I was provided this product from Gillette for free to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;It works so well i almost want to send them money for it...almost. It easily trimmed my vacation beard and some pesky neck hairs in between haircuts. This product feels heavy in the hand, but in the way a quality product does. The ProGlide is awesome and i&#x27;m glad i have it.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer for maintenance and it is perfect! I&#x27;m not sure it would be for you if you are looking for something more than just maintenance.  It probably won&#x27;t be strong enough for much more. But for the price of this trimmer with several attachments it&#x27;s pretty darn good!</li>
    <li> I recently received the  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler as part of a promotion from Gillette, and it has significantly improved my shaving experience. Previously I had been using a power razor, so there probably is little comparison there, but the Fusion shave is about just as fast and the results are phenomenally better. I won&#x27;t be going back to the power razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor allows you to shave with or without the power on, I prefer to keep the power off just because I think it feels smoother, although i tried it both ways and the results were comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the trimmer on my sideburns. I can keep the ends of the sideburns clean when i use it without any attachments, and i keep sideburn hair length good when using the #3 attachment. This lets me get an extra week or two in before i need a haircut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to exclusively use a mach 3 when i did manual shaves before, probably for the last 15 years. I prefer the Fusion as the razor itself has a better grip and I feel the blades cut better, with the mach 3 i would shave down on the face and up on the neck, with the fusion it is one stroke all the way down, and its clean all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying out, especially if you want to shave and trim.</li>
    <li> I got this proGlide styler free as part of a Gillette program and Man it is one heck of a shaver. After using it for a month I can say that I will be using it for life. Other than the fact that it takes AA batteries and does not plug in, I can&#x27;t find fault with it. It really vibrates strong to give a nice clean cut whether shaving or trimming. Smooth clean cuts for trimming edges and consistent when trimming length. It is an all around great product. Nice size and weight. Small but fits nicely in my hand. I have average sized hands and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler is a really nice inexpensive trimmer/shaver.  I received a Proglide Styler under a free trial campaign from Gillette.  It builds on the Gillette Proglide Fusion razor, using the same disposable cartridges.  About 4 months ago, I decided to grow a beard so when I received this styler, I was only shaving my neck every few weeks.  However, before growing my beard, I had used the Gillette Proglide Fusion Razor every day and found that the blades were very high quality, giving me a close shave without the nicks and scratches I always got from cheaper disposable blades.  I have very thick coarse hair and other razors would only last a few shaves before giving me a very rough shave with a lot of nicks and scratches due to chips and cracks in the blades.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I now have a beard, I still have to keep the edges trimmed up, as well as my eyebrows.  I had been using my old electric shaver/trimmer and because of the size as well as the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; trimmer that pops out of the back of it, it made it difficult to clean up the edges of my beard and really hard to keep my mustache and eyebrows trimmed.  With the Proglide Styler, I am able to trim my mustache, beard and eyebrows using the included comb attachments easily and without having to use a comb, which has always been difficult for me.  The precision edging blade makes it real easy to define the edge of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler is very sturdy and comfortable to hold.  It feels solid when you hold it and I like the way the open the trimmer to clean out cut hair.  I really like the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof and you can use it in the shower as well as clean it out with water.  The only problem I had is where the button is located.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the way I hold it or a design issue, but it kept turning on when I was putting an attachment on the trimmer.  The button was not going in enough to completely turn it on but just enough to run until I moved my hand.  Other than on the bottom, I&#x27;m not sure where else they could locate the button to keep this from happening.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in standard plastic packaging that I personally dislike as the only way to open it without breaking anything is to cut the edges off.  The internal packaging is actually a stand for the trimmer and all the attachments that it comes with.  I like the stand and it does keep everything easily organized but I wish that they had made it slightly bigger so that the comb attachments went in a little deeper on the back.  As it is, they stick out enough that if you pick up the round stand, like you would a glass, your fingers can easily dislodge the combs.  Otherwise, it was a well thought out design.and.

    <li> Love the item and works great. The package it comes in is a lot better than in store. Bought one for myself and one for fathers day. By far amazing works well and will update if any issues.</li>
    <li> I received a promotional Gillette Power Trimmer from bzz. I discovered it provided the functions for grooming that previously required a number of different products for my grooming regimen. The 5 blade razor, pivots so it follows the contours of your face really well without having to pull and stretch your face to get all those different curves. For a regular shave worked out exceptionally well. I am happy that now have a razor for trimming and shaving that I can take anywhere and that performs well beyond expectations, perfect for traveling. I gave the trimmers a 5-out-of-5 because it trims sharp and perfectly, easy to clean, and it&#x27;s electric. I can definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of the Gillette Fusion line.  This razor is just as good as the other Fusion products.  I like the handy case that holds everything so the counter isn&#x27;t cluttered.  I have sensitive skin and the Gillette Fusion razor doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin the way others do.</li>
    <li> I received the power trimmer as part of a free trial program run by Gillette and I absolutely love it. I don&#x27;t have facial hair, but I do have short hair and the power trimmer is a great tool to keep my hair looking great. I&#x27;ve used it to keep my side burns and hair lined up in between haircuts and it does a great job. I&#x27;ve noticed that since using it I can go about an extra week in between haircuts. I also use it to keep my eyebrows trim and it works great. A definite advantage to this product is its size. My old trimmer was much bulkier than this trimmer so it was hard to see what exactly I was doing. WIth the Gillette Power trimmer this isnt a problem and the results end up being much better. I highly recommend this to any guy looking for a grooming tool.</li>
    <li> fusion proglide power trimmer was provided fpr free via a program run by gillette* I have been letting my beard grow and it was looking wild so I thought it was time to put this trimmer to the test and it did not disappoint. It lined up my beard straight, took all the annoying little hairs that were out of place, the handle is sturdy and easy to grip for a close clean trim thst leaves your facial edged correctly and straight.</li>
    <li> With all the gadgets out there to help make a stylish beard... Proglide Styler has everything in one.  It&#x27;s made my life so much better getting ready in the morning by having everything  all in one place. What a great product and high quality!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette for letting me try this for free!  It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> I really like this styler.  The large handle is easy to grip.  The trimmer works well for its intended purpose,  touch up and trimming.  I like to use the trimmer with a guide to trim down my eyebrows.  The blades are pretty easy to clean,  just snap it forward and blow or wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the styler free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I just get it like 2 weeks ago and cant complain about anything... It come with everything razor, trimmer, different clips so no matter what you want, this trimmer has it.</li>
    <li> This tool helps keep me trimmed just as I like.  Small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  Easily gets those hard to trim areas.  I use it in the shower daily to keep my facial hair cropped.  While I use the same attachment each time, the multiple guides are a great option.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive the trimmer in the mail, free, from Gillette. I was impressed with how small, but how powerful the trimmer is. It trimmed up my beard with no problem, it never hesitated through the thick parts. I didn&#x27;t have to stop to let the trimmer catch up to the speed of my hand. It cut close and didn&#x27;t leave spare hairs behind. It did a great job grooming my chest, left just enough hair to still look good. I am not one to shave fully but it did a great job cleaning up any unwanted hair. The only problem I had was trying to shave ,the trimmer handle was to big and didn&#x27;t feel right. The other problem was the battery didn&#x27;t last long enough, and I found myself going to get another battery. I will recommended this to friends.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler as part of program run by Gillette.  At first I was skeptical because I figured that I would not recieve a quality trimmer, but Gillette has proved me wrong!  I travel quite a bit for my job, so having the ease of portability is very important to me.  Also, beign able to take it from wet to dry is essential.  Overall it&#x27;s a quality product and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.  I had previously used an electric razor and separate rechargeable trimmer.  The trimmer is not quite as powerful as my old rechargeable, plus there is no attachment for trimming nose hair, but for everyday use, this razor is more than adequate for the job.  I like being able to have everything in one tool, and the caddy is small enough that I can keep it on the counter.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> When I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler from a Gillette promotion I was skeptical that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well as some of the most expensive razors I have used in the past but I would have to say I am pleasantly surprised it provides a good clean shave. I really like how it has so many attachments that I can use for many different things. The trimmer worked really good and gave me a close shave. I had no nicks or cuts using using this styler. It also worked well trimming my side burns. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have to say that i liked how way the product was to use and how well if fit in my hand. after using my face was smooth and my beard neat and trim without any nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> this shaver is great it is an all in one deal you don&#x27;t need anything else when shaving. This is a great shaver because I like to change it up every now and then so it goes right along with my styles.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is the complete package for grooming facial hair. I use it to keep my goatee in check and the power razor is awesome. I had an old beard trimmer that was on its last leg and this power trimmer is great for the job. The shave is great when the power is turned on you can&#x27;t tell your even shaving. you can use it in the shower whitch is great as it saves time.</li>
    <li> I received the razor free from a promotion that Gilette was offering.  I was skeptical at first because I have the regular Proglide Razor from Gilette, but damn it has nothing on the Proglide 3 in 1 Styler.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the handle of the allows for a better grip than any razors I&#x27;ve ever used.  It must be due to the thicker handle which I prefer over thin razor handles.  The Kung fu grip that the razor provides along with the extended length of the razor head due to the separate attachable desired clip on allows for a even more flawless shave or trim.  I hate shaving but this product makes shaving tolerable.  The best part is when my fiancée says that my skin is baby smooth!  I highly recommend trying this product as you will be pleasantly surprised as I was.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free through a program run by Gillette. I found this to be a great trimmer. Easy to use, comfortable grip, easy to change trimmer combs. unlike other trimmers I have tried this one doesn&#x27;t seem to pull and scratch. It actually takes me less time now because it glides instead of pulling. I really like this trimmer and would recommend it as it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as a promo thru Gillette. I was hesitant at first at trying this but it far exceeded my expectations. It works wonders on body hair and left me smooth and razor burn free</li>
    <li> The item is an overall good item.  I received the item through a program run by Gillette.  I am glad the the trimming blade even with out the guards is gentle on the skin.  The storage could be a little better designed, and offer a plug in rechargeable option and I see this being a 5 star item in no time.  The guards are great lengths for different hair types as long as you haven&#x27;t gone more than a week with out trimming..  I do really like the fact its all trim and shave in one, makes the morning shower routine much easier.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from a program that&#x27;s run by Gillette. It&#x27;s amazing. No razor bumps or burns. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I actually received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler through a program run by Gillette. If you have been letting your beard grow for a while and want to trim, this isn&#x27;t for you. This trimmer is good for daily users or every-other-day users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect this trimmer to trim every hair on the first try Its definitely not that powerful. You will have to run it over your beard over and over before its nice and even. If you have curly beard like me, it&#x27;s going to take a while to trim it. Another down side with curly beard is that you might have to clean during the trim because the hair gets stuck in the \\&quot;little compartment\\&quot; which is very easy to clean though. You can hear the hair getting stuck in the trimmer by the sound it starts making. However, this wasn&#x27;t a big issue for me since it very easy to clean but it may be for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you cannot complain about build quality. I don&#x27;t expect is to last me years but maybe several months or a year or so. It seems very sturdy in the hand while trimming. I thought the attachments clips would break after couple of times but after being used for couple of weeks, by 2 men (me and my dad), it just like new. The styler has a rubber outing on it for a better grip. The size is just great; it&#x27;s very easy to hold in your hands. It makes you feel like you&#x27;re in control of where it goes. It works in the shower as well. It comes with a \\&quot;caddy\\&quot; which holds your razor, styler, and the attachments. For the price, you would expect it be cheap looking but honestly it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cleaned other body hair with this and its completely painless and effortless. All in all, I would highly recommend this product. The only cons, I noticed were the hair getting stuck in that little area and perhaps it being little more powerful so it got perhaps get all the hair in the first try. But the pros outweigh the cons. I would buy this again and especially for a vacation.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 Styler free to try from a program Gillette has. This product is worth the $20 it costs. This is a great tool for me to have being in the military, it helps maintain my hair in between haircuts. The only thing missing is a nose/ear hair trimmer attachment. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the item yet!</li>
    <li> I  received this trimmer during a promotional campaign by Gillette and I had the opportunity to test it under &#x27;extreme&#x27; conditions. Stationed in a far distant sandy environment was the perfect place to test the endurance of this man-scaping machine.&lt;br /&gt;It dislikes hair as much as I do! I learned a long time ago that face &amp; body hair retains heat. So...it has to go. The Gillette Proglide Styler did an amazing job of keeping my hair at the desired length (from head to toe). It had all the right attachments to get the job(s) done.&lt;br /&gt;My rating of 4/5 stars is only due to clipper &#x27;bogging down&#x27; on thicker hair and not having a recharging feature. You will need to have a steady supply of AA batteries available!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free via a program run by Gillette. I tried it first to trim my moustache and goatee. It worked okay. The battery life wasn&#x27;t the best. I do not think I would pay $20 or so for this type of product. I normally use a disposable razor to do the job anyway. For trimming sideburns it worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m not a fan of shaving. I typically nick myself or give myself razor burn even after trying a variety of shaving creams and razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide Styler has given me a super smooth shave. No nicks. And although I haven&#x27;t felt many baby&#x27;s bottoms in my life time, I would say my face is smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom. The large size blades make shaving a much faster process and a much closer shave compared to other blades I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a beard, so I&#x27;ve only tried the facial hair trimmer on my sideburns. Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that great, because of its low cost, but it works pretty well. Whenever I shorten my sideburns, many times they end up crooked, because I&#x27;m using a cheap disposable razor. But with the Fusion Proglide, it&#x27;s much much easier to have super straight lines. I&#x27;m surprisingly really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is how the Proglide styler will wear in six months. Some of the extensions feel kinda of cheap. So, we&#x27;ll see how that works out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*For full disclosure, I did receive the power-trimmer free from a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I recieved this to try as part of a program that i am part of. I thought all trimmers were the same! I am loving this neat little gadget. I was expecting a cheap plastic razor type thing, but this is the real deal. It fits perfectly on the bathroom shelf and holds everythign together. Love that you can trim and shave and the blade can get so close to the skin without irritating as most others do. The price is great too. for $20 retail, you really cant beat what you are getting.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Fusion ProGlide works great I got it free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette  I  tried and loved it works well and easy to use can do several areas with it it was light and easy to handle so it made it easy to use nice job</li>
    <li> First off the Gillette fusion ProGlide Style Power Trimmer is a pretty awesome idea.  A normal razor-check; an electric trimmer/razor-check; beard trimmer-check; body hair trimmer-check.  This product is the Swiss army knife of body hair removal devices.  The kind of gadget that James Bond would have had to groom himself in a pinch, (for the bond girls of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay that is out of the way.  Now for the meat of this review:  This product doesn&#x27;t exactly do what it should.  Oh, yeah you can throw on some Gillette Fusion ProGlide Clear Shaving Gel and get a decent shave but what I learned from using this product is you may have to do one or two more passes over the same spot.  Using this product to trim say, sideburns, proved to be difficult too.  The size, bulkiness, or the Power Trimmer was a bit cumbersome when trying to maneuver to the right spot.  This is in contrast to a Gillette Mach 3, which I&#x27;ve been using for 10 plus years; the mach 3 is slim, and a really, really good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I&#x27;m trying to say is that this free razor I was given as part of a program run by Gillette is a great concept, but so-so in execution.  I would love to try other new product by Gillette and will continue to be a user of their products.</li>
    <li> This power trimmer is the way to go.  I received a free razor from a program ran by Gillette and couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the results.  It has everything you need for a complete shaving system.  The attachments are great and offer versatility with the convenience of disposable blades.  I ended up buying one for my Dad and he is now a faithful user as well.  I have had a hard time finding a razor that works for my sensitive skin, but the gentle vibrations leave my skin feeling smooth and never razor burnt.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is very convenient, as it allows easy trimming of facial hair and hair lines to ensure a clean look between haircuts. As an officer in the Army, I must stay within the grooming regulations and serve as an example to my Soldiers. This makes this very easy and convenient. The best part of the trimmer is the angled head that allows precise trimming, along with combs to regulate the length of the remaining hair as with larger trimmers. The vibrating function of the trimmer doubles as a power shave, which is very effective in attaining a close shave. The one complaint is the high cost of refills, though this is far from unique in quality shaving products. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to stay looking sharp.</li>
    <li> First, full disclosure - this was a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.  That being said, I was asked to provide honest feedback and that&#x27;s what I am going to do. This product is amazing.  I have been using it now for 2 weeks and I have to say that I am absolutely satisfied.  I trim my beard at least two - three times weekly.  It contours to my face rather nicely and does not cause unpleasant cuts or burns.  It is rather sturdy and great on battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to shaving my face, I use the trimmer to tape my hairline and for the occasional \\&quot;man-scaping\\&quot;.  Allow me to say that it is an all purpose tool.  Unlike competitors it does not fall apart after prolonged use and does not require constant upkeep (i.e. oil) to keep it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would say this, but shaving in the morning has now become a pleasure.  I can seamlessly alternate between the standard trimmer and the razor to get the perfect shave.  The 3 Exchangeable Combs are perfect for any length beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most surprising part of this device is that although it is battery operated, it works in the shower!  How exciting is that?  I can attest to the fact that the device is water tight and did not stutter during a 30 minute shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can safely recommend this to anyone who trims on a regular basis.  Is this a professional trimmer, no but is it a quality trimmer for an unbeatable price, yes!</li>
    <li> I received my trimmer through a program run by Gillette. My job requires a smooth face and neatly trimmed sideburns. Having my wife get the clippers out is a hassle and can be time consuming. With this tool, I can shave my face and quickly change to another tool to trim up my sideburns. The whole process just takes a few minutes, provides excellent results and rinsing the tools is a breeze. I will definitely continue to use this!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler get the job done.  For the price and all the options it offers you can&#x27;t go wrong. All the attachments worked very well.  This is a great product for the summer.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mainly as a trimmer for my beard, and it&#x27;s a great precision tool.  It&#x27;s a bit slower because it runs on a single AA battery, but I don&#x27;t need to worry about cutting myself around tough areas.  It has a small head, so again, it&#x27;s better for precision trimming than trimming an entire beard, but it has still become my go-to.  There are a few attachments as well that I frankly don&#x27;t use, but seem to be normal.  I got the razor free from a Gillette Promo.</li>
    <li> I recieveed this razor free from a program run by Gillette Fusion. Once it arrived i was so excited to try it, that i opened it right away. Right from the start, i loved the presantation. Black and blue are a great choice of color. Also, the fact that it has its little stand to store the 3 different combs, makes it great. I dont have to worry about losing any of the pices. I have a beard and mustache, and it was getting some what long, so i used one of the comb heads to trim, and it felt effortless, like the power trim just glided and trimmed extremely well, what i like was that my hair wouldn&#x27;t get stuck on the comb. Then i used the trimmer with out a comb and something i liked was that, compared to other power trimmers, the metal piece didnt get hot.i was impressed with the  maneuverability i had with this razor. i love this tool, its my ultimate styling tool. i don&#x27;t need any other shaving tool, to achieve a styled looke.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler is an easy, effective way to keep yourself properly trimmed.  Recently, I had the opportunity to try this trimmer for free as part of a promotional program offered by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job and is very easy to use since it is much smaller than most trimmers I am used to.  I also really like that it is powered by batteries so you can take it anywhere and don&#x27;t need to worry about bringing some charger cable.  If you are looking for a simple way to eliminate unwanted hair, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a promotion from Gillette and at first I was a little iffy. I already had a trimmer and I already used their fusion proglide so where would this new product fit in. Well I tried it as a replacement for the other two and the fusion proglide power was definitely better than the original. It cuts through easily and has a really smooth shave. The trimmer worked great and was able to shape my beard just like my other product. The only issue I found was that hair got caught in the electric razor and it was tough to get out. Over all I would definitely suggest this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great accessory to have with my razor.  By no means is it a professional grooming kit, but for touching up sideburns and light trimming is is excellent!  It also comes with different length combs if you are trying to keep a specific length beard.  Personally, I got much more use from the trimmer alone; keeping my sideburns from creeping down my face.  The combs and blades are easy to put on and take off and the over sized handle give a much more steady feel in my hand.  I&#x27;m not sure I would have gone out of my way to buy something that like this that appears to be a mick, but I was given this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette.  I can honestly say that this is a well functioning addition to your basic razor and definitely performs as advertised. I really like my new trimmer!</li>
    <li> I got this razor via a program that was held by Gillette and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is a keeper! I love that everything that you need for a morning shave is all in one razor. The simple adjustments are easy to use and I love the snap action of the trimmer or razor. This razor makes my mornings easier and I don&#x27;t have to search around for different tools because they are all in one place! I love that the trimmer is also  battery operated. I would recommend this product to everyone, especially if you travel because it has everything that you need!</li>
    <li> So I picked this little gadget for free to try out and what a steal! This trimmer is amazing! Handle was a bit big at first but this gadget is so unique and versatile. Trim your side burns or add the blade with ease for a close shave. A must have for the traveler too, compact for on the go business men.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler is an excellent product for the money. Have I used a better styler before? Sure, but you get what you pay for. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is much cheaper then other brands and works just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is nicely shaped to fit easily in your hand. There is no slipping with the rubber grip, which is important while shaving. It makes for a comfortable and smooth shave. It is much less awkward feeling than the pencil thin razors I typically use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easily one of my favorite tools for everyday grooming, but it would not be powerful enough to cut through thick hair. The accessories make trimming a breeze and allow me to get the look I want, however if I go a few days without using it my hair becomes too thick for the trimmer to work effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision blade works very well. I was able to get an extremely close shave without irritating my skin, however it did clog with hair and was difficult to clean. The 5 blades on the front of the razor were extremely easy to clean. A little bit of hot water and the hair was gone instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This little setup has 3 guards plus a typically razor head for regular shaving.  I use the device sans attachments to trim facial hair.</li>
    <li> This is an upgrade to my preferred means of having, the Mach 3 Turbo. The electric trimmer and attachments are a plus so you do not have to choose between an electric or straight razor. This only downside to this razor is the straight razor attachment feels too flimsy. All in all, it is a drastic improvement to Gillette&#x27;s razor line.</li>
    <li> As a participant in a program run by Gillette, I was sent a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free to try and I love it. In fact, it is all I use now. I found it to be the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It is a clean, smooth shave that lasts throughout the day and into the evening. The attachments make it easy to stay cleanly groomed and changeover from one attachment to the other is so quick and seamless, it&#x27;s like you haven&#x27;t even done anything. Nice selection of lengths too!</li>
    <li> When it comes to styling my hair with a razor I am a really picky person and I know I need the right tools to get the job done.  I often use a T-outliner electric razor to style my hair, but I wanted to try different products to broaden my horizon in a way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Proglide Styler......The initial look of the product gave me the feeling that I could leave this on my kitchen table as a center piece. The product looked and felt really comfortable. The grip on the device was also really functional. You never know how you are going to end up holding the razor, but this blade managed to feel firm in all the crazy angles I could think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems I had with the blade was that it started to pull after my second shave. I always expect a pull when shaving, but it seems like the razor wasn&#x27;t going to last a long time after a couple of uses. I got to try the razor free through a program run by Gillette. I would have to try the razor for a couple more months to see if it is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors overall performance exceeded my expectations and left me with some pretty sharp angles.  I would recommend the Proglide to anybody looking for a premium shave.</li>
    <li> Received this thru a program Gillette had.  Great product for $20 and seems like they always put out coupons to cut the price down. Great for trimming up facial hair, eyebrows and body hair.  This is def.ly a product I would recommend to others.  Great way to groom at home.  Easy to use.  It&#x27;s convient with the 3 in 1 tools, can shave and trim with grabbing out one tool.  Close shave, razor doesn&#x27;t dull quick.</li>
    <li> After receiving the Proglide Styler through a program run by Gillette,  I couldn&#x27;t help but think, this groomer from is great! It&#x27;s a quality product that runs for around $18 give-or-take. For the price, the value is excellent. It has excellent feel in the hand and I can just about trim all my body hair without worry. I have not had any problem with razor burn or bumps, ever. My beard is easily trimmed and shaped in a few minutes effortlessly. Manscaping only takes a few minutes as well and is really easy. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used to use an expensive bulky electric razor.  I received the Proglide for free via a program run by Gillette.  I will seriously never go back.  The razor is small and easy to handle so I can get into those hard to reach places.  I like that it is run on battery so I don&#x27;t have to plug it in.  Also, I don&#x27;t need shaving cream or get razor bumps.  I would highly recommend this product, even over the expensive ones out there.</li>
    <li> The styler is an awesome tool. As someone that uses trimmers frequently to touch up my beard or to clean up after a shave, I can say I was delighted to try out this product offered  for free by a Gillette Promotional Program. As a long time user of their fusion razr blades I was expecting a similar level of quality, and it did not disappoint. Sleek and compact, the styler definitely packs a punch. Unlike other trimmers the Gillette styler cuts precisely and without much of the noise and hassle of some other products. I will say that the styler is in fact quite small and is great for light trimming and styling where as a larger and possibly plug in model would be great for those with hefty beards. But overall the Gillette styler lives up to the Gillette fusion reputation and offers solid construction and design with effective performance to match.</li>
    <li> the best shaver and styler on the market for the price it is the cheapest best one ever. For Gillette</li>
    <li> I recieved the Gillette Styler pack free from a progra Gillette was having , let me tell you this product is great!! Its an all in one multi tool. Use it  before the shower during and after. This is a great manscaping tool with all the extra clips for the desired lengths. Gillette has done a terrific job with this product.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free razor via a program run by Gillette.  I wanted to try it mainly for the shave (which is great) but I figured I would try the trimmer, as well.  I do not have any facial hair but I did try it to remove body hair and it worked very well.  It removed the hair smoothly and did not burn my skin, as I might have expected.  I also tried it to trim my hair but it will take me some time to fine tune that procedure.</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide Styler free from Gilette and I have been pleasantly surprised by the performance of the product.  I&#x27;ve used it several times to shave my face and trim my sideburns.  The handle is well-balanced, though a bit bulky. The quality of the shave is very good and clean-up is a snap--just rinse with water.  No nicks or tugging, a smoothe shave.  I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times and the blade is still sharp.</li>
    <li> After receive my gillete proglide styler via program run by gillete, i&#x27;ve use some trimmers in the past but occasionally, at first as always with new items i was hesitate to go beyond my beard limits to explore what my gillete proglide style can do, but a few seconds later i was using all over my beard, I&#x27;m not a hairy person bur for my job i have to travel every month it makes perfect fit on baggage. i like the fact that i can use all the styler tools at same time and not using a razor and a trimmer then another one to define beard edges.&lt;br /&gt;a little bit noisy at first but it gets time to get used to it. in a few words it makes a perfect tool for all my needs also gives me precision and a fast shave...1,2,3 you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;as everyone shave is not a popular task but proglye styler makes it easy with a few moves and easy to clean. i like how the engineering has become a concern for shave and daily usual personal care tasks.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: noisy if consider that not always is used at home.&lt;br /&gt;  Organizer and length combs not always fit as they should in organizer.&lt;br /&gt;  razor not suitable for small spaces ( i.e. under nose mustache hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Excellent for traveling&lt;br /&gt;  very robust design and durable materials&lt;br /&gt;  easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;  waterproof.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a recent program from Gillette I was provided with a free sample to try out. I have been using this trimmer for the past few weeks and enjoy the close shave I get with it. After about 8 uses I had to change the battery out. However, this could have simply been a bad battery as that has been known to happen. The fact that this trimmer is water proof is great in addition to the fact that you can use any of the other fusion blades with it.</li>
    <li> This electronic razor gave me the close shave that I never experienced with a traditional razor. I was able to use this razor without shaving cream, and felt no aftershave burn.  For the price point, I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer. I received mine free through a program through Gillette. The trimmer works great for a little manscaping or trimming down the sandpaper face.</li>
    <li> I received the \\&quot;Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler\\&quot; for free thanks to a program run by Gillette, and here are my initial thoughts on the razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Initial impressions were that of a contemporary design and durable feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Size and accessories I think are best for travel purposes, in fact, that&#x27;s how I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use and change attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-However, when compared to a separate high quality trimmer, it&#x27;s lacking in precision and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I would pay up to $15 for this item.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-in-1 Styler free by a program run by Gillette. First of all, I like the fact that it only requires 1 AA battery. I like the idea of a battery operated vs plug-in. Makes it convenient for traveling. Also- great to use in the shower as it is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned with the weight &amp; size of the razor handle and took a little bit of getting used to, but, after using it many times it has come to feel more comfortable than a classic manual razor. This has now become my everyday razor. The handle has a nice size and good weight. It&#x27;s got a rubber coating that makes for a nice solid grip and remains so even when wet. Due to the easy release the cartridge head it&#x27;s a breeze to take off and interchange with the other attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you are not going too be able to give yourself a buzz cut with this. It&#x27;s designed primarily for upkeep and grooming. It works great to keep sideburns &amp; eyebrows trimmed. It has 3 different length attachments for variations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage caddy is surprisingly functional. In the back it has 3 slots to store the grooming attachments. On the front it has a place for the handle and then a compartment for the razor cartridge. I like the fact that the razor cartridge is stored upside down away from little fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product, been using it for about a month. Curious to see how long it will last.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette to try out.  I really liked how well and close of a shave I got.  The trimmer was very handy to get rid of any unwanted hair.  It is kind of expensive but well worth the investment compared to disposable razors or fancy electric razors.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing razor it provides a close and comfortable shave. The blades help you achieve clean looking lines and the combs are very easy to use and very sturdy. I like that this razor provides a close shave and a great grip. This razor was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette and I was very glad to try it. The results provided by the pro glide styler are similar to those you would get at a barber.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler free thru a program by Gillette.  I like the comfortable compact design and that the holder keeps all attachments in one spot so your not chasing them across your bathroom or losing them.  This is my first experience with a styler of this type and I really like it. It is good that is battery operated so there is not another cord in the bathroom. The Styler allows for quick and easy changing of attachments and fits effortlessly into a weekly grooming routine.  Makes for easy between barber shop visits touch ups.</li>
    <li> Bathroom storage space is definitely at a premium so I&#x27;ve had to rely on drop-in visits to the barber shop for a neck trim...until now! The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler has been a great help, keeping the back of my neck and sideburns well kept without spending more time in the chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(FYI, I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free via a program run by Gillette)</li>
    <li> This razor was provided for free via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be reviewing the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler as compared to my typical go-to razor for the past few years since this is all I have to use as a comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades:&lt;br /&gt;The blades on the Gillette Fusion give me an exceptionally smooth shave.  Of the 8 times over the past few weeks that I have shaved,  I have felt no tugging that I typically feel when using my triple bladed razor.  I have also noticed that my face also feels slightly smoother for a longer period of time than my usual razor.  Even with over a week of facial hair, the blade was able to easily remove all hair without any tugging!  That is very impressive coming from my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;One drawback is that I have never been able to overcome getting the areas under my trouble spots cleanly shaven in just one pass (the jaw joint area - TMJ) regardless of the razor brand.  It always seems to take multiple passes in multiple directions in this area even when using the Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer on the Gillette Fusion is a nice touch.  I usually wait about a month to cut my own hair using electric hair clippers.  In the meantime, the hair around my ears starts to make me look really ragged.  The trimmer allows me to quickly take care of this issue without me having to pull out my clippers.  The Gillette Fusion trimmer is good enough to do a quick maintenance job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof:&lt;br /&gt;This feature does not matter to me since I do not shave in the shower, nor to I have the urge to shave underwater.  But, I&#x27;m sure Aquaman would really dig this feature.&lt;br /&gt;My old razor was equally waterproof, but did not have a battery pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;This is the biggest drawback for the Gillette Fusion.  Typically I purchase an 8 pack of my usual razor blades for around $10, and this razor kit alone costs around $18.  Plus, a replacement pack of 8 blades currently costs around $32 on Amazon.  Being frugal (cheap), that price is a little high for me.  It works out to about $1.25 per blade vs. $4 per blade plus the cost of the kit.  On the positive side, the blades can last a month or more, so in the long run, I could make a case that the replacement blades are really not much more expensive.  My other blades last less than 2 weeks, and then I start to get major tugging.  If you can find some coupons, then it is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to dish-out a little extra cash, you can expect a very smooth and comfortable shaving experience while also keeping the maintenance up on the hair around your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 5 stars</li>
    <li> When I first got this product I just thought it was just another trimmer, boy was I wrong. I could see and feel the difference and Its so much more convenience. I mean I don&#x27;t have to shave with one product and then get a trimmer out. so the clean up is a lot faster too. My wife said my face was so smooth and I didn&#x27;t have a five o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m a big fan of Gillette products. They make quality products at affordable prices, and the Proglide Styler is no exception. I keep a goatee and the Proglide styler has really made my before-work routine  much easier and much quicker. Before, I actually was using 3 -4 different tools for grooming--manual razor, trimmer, clippers and a few times a week, an electric foil razor. I used the trimmer for certain  parts of my goatee, the manual razor for general face shaving, the clippers for the thick, beard part of my goatee and my eyebrows and the foil razor for touch-ups on my neck and jaw line. With the Proglide Styler, I&#x27;ve eliminated the use of the clippers for facial hair trimming, manual razor and the other trimmer--which didn&#x27;t work NEARLY as well. The guides work great for trimming my goatee and brows, I love the subtle vibration when using the manual razor along with the power turned on--makes  for a closer shave, in my opinion--, and the trimming blade is perfect for sideburns.  The rubber grip--it;s rubber, not hard plastic--prevents drops and slips and is comfortable to hold, easy to guide and fits i hand nicely--not to bulky at all. I received my Proglide styler as a promo through Gillette, but would pay full price for it any day.Totally worth it, especially if you keep facial hair that needs trimming on a daily or few times a week basis.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what I want. I will recommend this item</li>
    <li> While the product is versatile, it is hard to believe that Gillette would not only make the attachment that connects the razor to the main body of cheap and flimsy plastic, but also not sell replacements for these attachments! Why should I have to buy a whole new set for the same of one broken attachment?! I&#x27;m definitely not buying a new one.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome, and a GREAT value! My $70 Braun electric razor/beard trimmer started to lose steam, so I bought this, and it&#x27;s great. The biggest plus is that there&#x27;s no internal battery that will die out eventually. It&#x27;s just a AA that I can swap out easily. PLUS it&#x27;s a straight razor, too! All in one convenient device.</li>
    <li> Good one.... never gives up...but not of much use</li>
    <li> Great little shaver, especially at its price point.</li>
    <li> pretty sick i use it couple times a week very impressed,if you like having some manly stubble get this,dont buy expensive s***</li>
    <li> I picked up one of these at the local drug store last night after having a coupon to get $3 off. I had a similar styler, but the blades were dull and a pain to groom myself with. It&#x27;s quick, fast and easy to use, helping you to always look your best with all your quick grooming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as cheap as the Gillette styler was, it sure is my new favorite tool to groom with! It&#x27;s got a lot of nice features that more expensive stylers have, but for around only $20, plus it&#x27;s water proof for use in the shower! First off let&#x27;s start with the fact that it uses pro-glide fusion disposable cartridges, how amazing is that? I can now toss out my old fusion power pro-glide handle since this one works even better. The cartridge snaps right onto the top of the styler, and with the press of the on button, it vibrates just as well, if not better than the standard power handles on the disposable shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is nicely molded, very clean look and provides maximum grip. The black is actually soft rubber, not hard plastic, so you won&#x27;t find yourself dropping the styler or having it slip out of your palms. The power button is very small, but easy to press to turn the shaver on and off, the LED light is also nice and not blinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the standard motorized blade directly on your skin without worrying about cutting yourself, or scratching up your skin. It&#x27;s sharp, but only for your hair. It also includes 3 different style \\&quot;combs\\&quot; to attach to the shaver so you can style your side burns, beard, mustache, anything else you&#x27;d want to trim. With all these little plastic attachments here and there though, you&#x27;ll need a place to store it all! Gillette is two steps ahead of you, because the packing it comes in also doubles as a stand and accessory holder for the styler itself, and all the little attachments included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nice thing not many shavers or stylers have is the ability to open the compartment behind the blade to clean out hair that can cause jams. The Gillette styler has a hatch you can pop off, and snap right back down to clean out any hair or gunk so your styler never jams, and will always work reliably. This is a huge plus for me since my old one was becoming weak and dull from all the hair trapped in the mechanism slowing down the blade and motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the styler and the accessories, I received Gillette brand cooling lotion to use after shaving, and non burning shaving gel. I tried both, and liked them very much. The shaving gel made my hairs pirk right up after a few seconds, making shaving so much easier. I felt no burn or sting while using the gel, so it really does work. Afterwards I put some of the lotion into my palms and rubbed it onto my face where I had shaved, it did have a nice cooling effect, but I could have lived without the lotion, it has a nice light scent to it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For under $20, the Gillette Styler really can&#x27;t be beat. It&#x27;s cheap in price, high quality, comes with tons of accessories and samples, and it does a good job. It would make a great gift to any guy you know, or a gift to yourself!has a hatch you can pop off, and snap right back down to clean out any hair or gunk so your styler never jams, and will always work reliably.

    <li> I already knew that the fusion razor was great, but the styler is really something. For the price of this 3 in 1 product I really can&#x27;t say anything negative about it. I just hope that it would last.</li>
    <li> I Love these its great the only thing i hate its where u place the battery seems like it can break easily</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has very sensitive skin. After each shaving he had lots of red spots on his face and neck. With this Gillette Proglide he just cuts his facial hair with the shortest head. After using it he still looks well-groomed. He looks like if he had shaved on the previous day.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x60;s quick, easy to clean and store with the stand.</li>
    <li> I have used the fusion before, but as I have a full beard and mustache, I have had to use a trimmer and scissors also. Now I have it all in one small unit. It functions well, but is not for ear/nose area. I do like the unit for shaving and trimming, but it&#x27;s not really as good as a full functioning plug in trimmer. For everyday it is more than adequate.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product. I love how the blades just glide over my face and it leaves you with less irritation than traditional shavers. I love the versatility between having a shaver and a trimmer. Great for detailing the sides. Overall, very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this thing 5 stars worth, but there are a few opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES:&lt;br /&gt;- comes with a fusion razor (best razor on the market by far)&lt;br /&gt;- Precise trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- ergonomic handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES&lt;br /&gt;- trimmer&#x27;s shortest setting not short enough&lt;br /&gt;- multiple, unattached pieces make it inconvenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I like it pretty well.  I wish the trimmer length was adjustable (though since i usually go shortest length, it&#x27;s fine - I never seem to remove the guide for the shortest beard length), and wish the razor wasn&#x27;t a snap on snap off piece (same for the trimmers).  I don&#x27;t seem to use the razor blade - I use my separate Fusion razor for shaving.  In the end, I have a really good $20 trimmer, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
    <li> very convenient ... easy to use @ home, easy to take on travels and consolidates all the tools required to shave, take care of beard, etc. I took to an overseas trip where the product was not available and lots of friends would like to have one. The weight of the product is also RIGHT ON, no too light or either to heavy. Gets the job done!!</li>
    <li> Received product as scheduled. Very satisfied with product. Would recommend to others. Plan on giving as gift, packaging was adequate.</li>
    <li> If I could shave with both hands at the same time...I would buy two of them.  The product does what it says it does and is great.</li>
    <li> The product worth to buy and tested with few friends and all of them rate it 5 stars so that why I purchased them.</li>
    <li> works well so far, it does all that it is supposed to do and I have not had any problems with it. The different lengths for the trimmer are nice and it works well</li>
    <li> The quality is cheap. Now what I&#x27;d expect from Gillette.</li>
    <li> Great product. The only thing that went wrong is that the blades eventually started slowing down. But 2 drops of oil fixed it right up to speed!</li>
    <li> I do not find any upgrade on the regular rotating Proglide.  A trimmer to cut hair in the nose should be added. The 4 items I bought as presents, didn&#x27;t include a case for traveling.</li>
    <li> Love it. Perfect for the price</li>
    <li> A shorter guard length for beard trimming would be fantastic. That is my only qualm with this product.</li>
    <li> Worked alright for about six months.</li>
    <li> Great tool for all unwanted hair, works good easy to handle, storage does not take up much room, great for travel. Have fun,go bare.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Made of cheap plastic! Blades did not seem sharp when trimming beard. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> I am happy I got this. It takes one AA battery. It works better than any shaver I&#x27;ve had before. It&#x27;s also a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It makes for a perfect travel buddy. The price is unbeatable too.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer is really great for the value. I primarily use the level 3 trimmer for my beard. Usually it doesn&#x27;t get all the long hairs but it does get most of it. I also tried the razor it comes with. It is definitely a nice razor however it does feel a little weird since I am used to a normal Gillette razor. So far I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries and I&#x27;ve had it for approx 2 months. I would definitely recommend this product. It&#x27;s a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Verry good shaver and trimmer much better than more higher priced trimmers. I would buy again and suggest to my friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product! One again Gillette hit on the spot. The best Price and the quality comes from Braun Shavers. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Ich nutze den Gillette Fusion ProGlide 3 In 1 Styler seit ca. zwei Wochen und bin sehr begeistert. Er ist etwas l&amp;auml;nger als ein normaler Rasierer und hat einen breiteren Griff, das ist zuerst etwas ungewohnt. Jedoch gew&amp;ouml;hnt man sich schnell daran. Die Handhabung ist sehr einfach und narrensicher. Das Ger&amp;auml;t macht einen sehr guten Eindruck und ist seinen Preis absolut wert. Das Nassrasierergebnis ist wie bei ProGlide sehr gut und gr&amp;uuml;ndlich. Mit der zus&amp;auml;tzlichen Style-Klinge kann man super Konturen ziehen. Jedoch ist der Rasierer um eine elektrische Trimmerfunktion mit drei verschiedenen Kammaufs&amp;auml;tzen erg&amp;auml;nzt. Alles kommt in einem praktischen Ger&amp;auml;tehalter! Gerade auf Reisen spart man sich so einen zus&amp;auml;tzlichen Rasierer mitzunehmen.  Alles in Allem ein Muss f&amp;uuml;r jeden Barttr&amp;auml;ger, gut aussehen tut er auch!</li>
    <li> Ich durfte den Rasierer bei trnd testen und finde ihn sehr gut. Er sieht sehr hochwertig aus und liegt auch gut in der Hand. Beim 3in1 Styler funktioniert sowohl das Rasieren als auch das Trimmen oder das Konturen stylen tadellos. Für das Trimmen lassen sich die 3 Kammaufsätze von 2mm, 4mm und 6mm -für die individuelle Haarlänge- gut wählen. Das besondere an dem 3in1 Styler ist, dass man für alle 3 Funktionen das gleiche Gerät benutzen kann! Die Klingen entsprechen Gillette Standart und somit klappt auch das Konturen stylen sehr gut.</li>
    <li> This works great to keep your beard trimmed up nice and even! Personally I am not a fan of the fusion blades, they irritate my skin, so I use solely for the trimming function. The edger is nice too if you have an intricate beard that needs precision edge trimming. Still on the first battery and have used it every few days for a few weeks now. Easy to clean out too, just take off your attachment, and the head of the trimmer flips up allowing you to washout stubble that gets left inside the trimmer. Waterproof too! Just go ahead and buy it! Won&#x27;t find a cheaper trimmer</li>
    <li> I was roped in to buying this by all the good looking dudes with perfect beards seen in the commercials.  But keep in mind that the blades are twice as expensive as the blades you are probably using now.  And getting a perfect beard - well, this will help, but not do it for you.</li>
    <li> I like that these were received quickly and on time.  They are going to make nice presents for the men in the family.</li>
    <li> This is a great razer and i am kind of person who likes smooth finish so the razer with multiple blades works wonderful. I use the trimmer to trim my body and it does the job in a few minutes. I got a promotion on this which saved few bucks but I think this is worth a buy even at the full price listed.</li>
    <li> hola todo finohola todo fino gustaooo muchoooooo everything right all excellent recommend&lt;br /&gt;y poreque esta muy buernono em ha llegadotodo bien lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> As an asian i don&#x27;t have to shave very often.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second pair of styler: and both fall apart in about two months..and i usually shave once a week.&lt;br /&gt;an absolute crap is what this is.</li>
    <li> I discovered this razor completely by chance. The main attraction is that since I travel a lot, the integrated trimmer, means that I can avoid taking a separate beard trimmer for my goatee. The combination is far lighter and handier for travel. In day-to-day use I find I prefer the shave much more than with the regular Fusion razor. First the larger size feels more natural in my hand, and second I think the bigger battery improves the vibration effectiveness to help the shave.</li>
    <li> For under $18, I got myself an excellent 3-in-1 groomer.  It would have been swell if it was also rechargeable as in my former Gillette cordless groomer which I gladly gave away to my father.</li>
    <li> Pros: It shaves&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Battery Life isn&#x27;t that long, On the small side so it takes a while to shave.</li>
    <li> I debated about a battery operated trimmer, but this one is exceptional, and it also does a great job shaving with the blades. It is small, light, and easy to store. I found it esay to handle as well.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this shaving kit to anyone for moderate trimming and fine shaving with a smooth shave. groomer feels great in the hand and stays relatively clean with ease. very nice kit to have</li>
    <li> This clipper set is $22.95 at Walmart, that&#x27;s about $4.50 cheaper and this thing trims backwards from my old Norelco which is something I always wanted. For me, but I&#x27;m weird, trimming my moustache with the Gillette is not as refined as I want so I am using the beard trimmer on my Philips Norelco NT9130 D-Finer Precision Trimmer set. Which is no big deal because I have both out at the same time anyway. I just can&#x27;t believe the price is so low. It must be because it&#x27;s made in China like everything else. I&#x27;m waiting to see if the Chinese quality has improved on this product. At this point, I would gladly have paid twice the price for it if it was made here in the USA.</li>
    <li> Smaller than i expected - i was worried about shaving with a huge electric thing vs a regular razor but this is fine and i really like it. Feels like high quality. Works very well. I&#x27;m surprisingly happy with this purchase, especially considering it was only $18. I would have paid more for it.</li>
    <li> I love it. Easy to use and very smooth on the skin that doent cut even in sensitive area. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband is retired and decided to take on the Grisley Adams look because shaving became too much trouble.  This gadget is easy to use and he does not mind grooming with it occasionally.</li>
    <li> It can do so much for a low cost. Don&#x27;t particulary like the stand for holding all the parts when not in use but the razor and attachments are great.</li>
    <li> My electric shaver was broken, and I was on budget.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best pack I could find, price was more than ok, and the quality of Gillette is well known.</li>
    <li> A decent product worth the money. Probably not the best product that you can get, but definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor from Amazon for Christmas gifts and kept one for myself, this is a great starter razor, it trims and shaves as described.</li>
    <li> When i first saw this i thought, wow.  Finally somebody figured out how to get both into one razor and that saves space (which is key when  you travel for business).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then i received it and had 2 immediate thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) There is NO cover for the razor blade when it is in your toiletry kit.  The blades are left out and fully exposed.  That&#x27;s just dumb.  With all the plastic pieces that ship with this, they couldn&#x27;t have thought of one that provides safety as well ensuring the blades dont rub on things and get dull???  This was particulary important as my boss shredded his finger by this very issue this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The razor does not have a setting that is even close enough to be useful.  i keep my beard and mustache very tight.  No matter what i used, this is essentially worthless as a trimmer. This too is very frustrating.  Great concept.  Poorly thought through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the weight of the razor is excellent and if they fixed the top 2 issues, it would be 4+ stars for me.  Come on guys. You do this for a living.  Finish the damn product before you ship it and think about the people that use it daily and need to travel with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item at BJ&#x27;s a few months back, and it did Jam when I was using it.  you can pop open the little hatch, and turn it on, but when it&#x27;s closed, the shaver part will not work.  It&#x27;s quite annoying, and it costed me 80$ at BJs.  I am dissapointed with this product, and can not figure out a way to clean out the compartment as there are no screws to take apart.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this just for the beard trimmer part because the head of the trimmer is very narrow and you are able to shape your beard &amp; mustach the way you want very easily. It comes with 3 different trimmer depth attachments which is nice. the razor blade itself is awesome. It really gives a smooth close shave with no irritation but the replacement blades are just way to expensive so I will continue to shave with my Gillette Mach 3  which has cheaper replacement blades..</li>
    <li> Husband loves it.  Hasn&#x27;t cut his head or ears yet! There was no learning curve with this blade! Great job!</li>
    <li> Oh yea baby this is a life saver, hubby loves it and we use it to cut the hair of my toddler with it without any problem very much recommended</li>
    <li> I will update my review once my husband starts using product but I wanted to mention to anyone looking into this as a stocking stuffer, it looks very cheap. The pieces look like they will break with little use and I don&#x27;t like the packaging. It comes in a box made for all the pieces but all the pieces are not secured or covered so everything was thrown around the box. I&#x27;m disappointed. Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this. May return.</li>
    <li> Perfect for shaving, excellent product!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent seller</li>
    <li> Skip the attachments, the razor itself is basically a 1 guard and is very good for trimming to a stubble. Long life from a single AA battery is a plus.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer!</li>
    <li> Great product works great would buy again</li>
    <li> I used to have a little vibrating razor that took a very common 2 blade head.  I loved that little thing, but it was China made, the battery died, and it wasn&#x27;t replaceable, in fact, it was so rusted out on the inside I was surprised it functioned at all.... anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little treasure rocks.  Easy to clean and maintain.  When you remove the blade section, it properly sits in the holder so that the water will drain off the sharp edge of your blades to the back where it won&#x27;t do any harm.  This simple feature will extend the life of the blades by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I am still on the blade that came with it, the Fusion Proglides, but I also ordered a pack of Fusion Manuals, I will update when I get into them if I feel there is a difference in the blades on this handle.</li>
    <li> every guy need one of these item, likes the why it cuts for all type of sytels a guy needs, down fall i wish it waas easyer to clean</li>
    <li> I love this new 3 in 1 syler, its great, easy to use hard to make a mistake with it!! works fantastic!</li>
    <li> once taken apart, i DARE you to put it back together.</li>
    <li> I tried trimming my beard with the number 2 setting and sometimes it would trim well, other times it would trim &amp;#34;too well&amp;#34; (e.g. leaving holes in my hair. So basically, unless I had an even pressure the whole time I shaved, it ended up looking uneven. I also didn&#x27;t like that it was NOT a rechargeable battery shaver. Returning.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in my manly areas. works great</li>
    <li> The new Gillette ball straight razor is much better, this does an OK job, but too thick and heavy in my hand.</li>
    <li> Bought this 18 months ago and am still using it.  It uses 1 AA battery and works like a champ!  Battery lasts a LONG time.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  It comes with a little more than what I needed (the extra clips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I cannot complain at all.  This product is excellent.  It served the purpose of trimming the beard, overly long arm-pit hair, and even sideburns that grow in a little too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build is of high quality.  You can really tell that they did not cut corners on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far, really liking this thing.  Cleans easily.  Multiple lengths are nice, but could use one that&#x27;s slightly longer than the longest setting...</li>
    <li> works great... face and elsewhere!</li>
    <li> it shaved the side burns nice but it lacks flexabilty its stiff. the holder is nice to store all the stuff when someone else does the trimming it works but trying to do your self its hard to do. I would not buy it again sorry but I just not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Does its job well. You get a bit more than what you pay for, in my opinion..</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the satnd of the Racer i love it so far so good i have not had any problems with the thing... i will haly recomend it to every heary men  outthere &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Everthing you could want in a razor/trimmer and more.  Smooth, effortless shave with no razor burn, great attachments to trim or style any kind of hair, not to mention convenient and portable able to fit in my toiletries bag.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is great, the trimmer combs are great and store easily.&lt;br /&gt;I travel alot and these are great because of the single AA battery it requires not converters or adapters needed.&lt;br /&gt;would be great if it had a travel bag to out these all in.</li>
    <li> these work great, but this is my third one in just over a year.  They all stop working after a few months.</li>
    <li> this is a very useful tool to have in the bathroom for your next trim and shave. comes with 3 size trimmer tips, a shaver blade for regular shaving and clippers. runs on batteries. very cool.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a program sponsored by Gillette.  The trimmer is very good product that provides a quick and easy way of touching up side burns or around ears. Its compact size and ease of use make it a must for anyone.  It&#x27;s a durable trimmer compared to others but the battery life is a little short.</li>
    <li> Good razor if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like razor bumps or burns and great for lineups.thank you Gillett for letting me try a free razor</li>
    <li> Love this razor. With the trimmer right there it&#x27;s less things in need to keep in the bathroom. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I recieved this free from a promotion sponsored by Gilette. This is a great little trimmer. I really like the fact that includes a razor head as well. Everything I need in one convenient package. I also like the fact that the packaging includes a stand that holds the trimmer and attatchments all in one place. The trimmer definitely worked better when my beard was dry. Overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to other shoppers.</li>
    <li> Before i got this product i wanted to know if can replace my old power trimmer that never worked to well and was not wireless which was always a pain because i constantly had to plug it into the outlet in the bathroom this was costing me major time and money. The Answer was YES !!!!! this replaced my old trimmer. the old trimmer is making its way to the landfill as i write this review. The Power Trimmer was very easy to use and was waterproof, which means you can take it to the shower with you(optional). when i first received the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER POWER TRIMMER. i said \\&quot;uhh here we go again, now i have to spend like an hour reading the instruction manual to try to figure this thing out.\\&quot; Well i was wrong in fact i never even touched the instructions manual. all i had to do was press the power on button and that&#x27;s it. i was easily able to remove my sideburns.the trimmer worked on a single battery for a weak. that&#x27;s right a whole weak. 1 battery !!!. the device is very power efficient. That&#x27;s good for both the environment and your wallet. after i successfully removed my side burns i opened up the compartment within the trimmer were supposedly all the hair that go into the trimmer was. i removed it and rinsed  it off with water and that&#x27;s that. i couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong with the device, i have had it for two weeks and now and i have loved every part of it. my favorite part of the device is the design it allows me get a good grip on the device and its size makes the device very portable. Please note that a free GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER POWER TRIMMER was provided to me via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I got the power trimmer free from Gilette and it is the best one I have EVER used! Gilette never let&#x27;s you down with it&#x27;s quality products. My manscaping has honestly never looked so clean and groomed! Also, the power of this product is outstanding! I would highly recommend this product. If I could give this a rating of more than five stars, I would.</li>
    <li> This power trimmer is so easy to use! Great to clean up and trim the edges of my beard. Glad it uses batteries instead of having to plug it in.</li>
    <li> As part of a promotion from Gillette I received a free razor.  I know it&#x27;ll sound like that clouded my review but honestly, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have sensitive skin and no matter what I try (all those new razors with 5-6 blades, the lubricating strips, etc.) I always end up bleeding or at minimum with my neck very red, bumpy and on fire.  Not so with this razor.  I&#x27;m able to get an incredibly close, clean shave with minimal effort and no irritation. Normally I&#x27;ll have to wait a couple days or so between shaves or else my skin is just too sensitive for a shave, with these blades I&#x27;m able to shave every day.</li>
    <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette, I stared at myself in the mirror, wondering on what I&#x27;d be using the system.  Blessed with the ability to grow nothing more than hobo-stubble, I realized that it would take an act of God for me to grow a beard in time to trim it AND review this item.  That being said, I definitely have sideburns, and being a grown adult, I also have....body....hair.  With that in mind, I set about my task of trying out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer, to see how it would stand up against other trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, the form factor of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is fantastic.  It&#x27;s small and light, and being operated by nothing but batteries, it&#x27;s easy enough to tuck into any shaving kit and take with you anywhere you might need a quick trim.  Unlike plug-in trimmers, there&#x27;s no real need to have this constantly plugged into the wall.  This also makes it incredibly easy to utilize the biggest talking point of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer, the fact that you can take it into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer can be used for more than a quick beard trim, and despite the fact that most folks won&#x27;t talk about stuff like that, being able to take the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer into the shower means you can trim up from the floor up.  Once you&#x27;re finished trimming whatever it is you want to trim, you can give it a quick rinse and tuck it away for later.  The razor.  Tuck away the razor for later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #1 Dermatologist Recommended Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades also make it incredibly easy to get baby&#x27;s bottom smooth, and with the small form-factor, you can hug any curves you&#x27;ve got on your body.  The safe and close blades mean you won&#x27;t cut yourself, and good luck getting this thing to give you razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this little guy, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.  Maybe one day, when the Gods of Flannel decide to grace me with a mighty beard, I&#x27;ll be able to keep that looking awesome, as well!e this little guy, and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.  Maybe one day, when the Gods of Flannel decide to grace me with a mighty beard, I&#x27;ll be able to keep that looking awesome, as well!</li>
    <li> For the last week or so I have been using the Gillette ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer that I received via a program run by Gillette. I was impressed by the quality and durability of this styler. From the package it looks rather small and maybe even cheap, but it is both sturdy and powerful. It trims hair well and does so with ease. I love the various attachments and the compact holder that keeps everything organized. I have tried using this product in water, although I was a little skeptical of how well it would hold up, It seemed to work just fine. You can also clean the machine under water. It only takes one AA battery and it still runs well after a week of use. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for an inexpensive waterproof trimmer.</li>
    <li> What a great trimmer.  I&#x27;ve never used styler trimmer before so I didn&#x27;t really know what I was getting myself into.  But, I received a free razor from a program ran by Gillete.  So, overall, it&#x27;s a great product.  It shaved smooth and really felt like it helped my skin.  I loved that I can shave and trim all with one tool.</li>
    <li> This product is the best trimmer/styler I have ever used. Its so light and portable, easy for traveling. My wife loves the way my facial hair looks now. I received this via a program from Gillette and am not disappointed!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical on how the Gillette fusion powerGlide styler trimmer would really work. Then Gillette provided me with the opportunity by giving me a free Gillette fusion power glide style or to test out, After using it now for a while it does a really good job it cuts even works well on trimming hair on all parts of your body. This trimmer works so good it&#x27;s earned a place on my bathroom counter top and will you be used regularly.</li>
    <li> I was offered  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler through a program sponsored through Gillette.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is awesome!  I love the fact that can shave and groom everywhere I need without having to switch to another costly razor!  It also comes in a sleek case that can keep everything together rather than everything just being a total mess and trying to keep up with all the pieces.  It offers a close shave or even one that isn&#x27;t so close if I need it.</li>
    <li> I have received a free Proglide from Gillette two weeks ago. I waited for this and when it came in I was ready for a good trimming. I used the number one blade to trim myself up and the shaving blade to shave my cheeks and neck. I was happy with the shaving blade but not sure about the trimmer blade. I takes about three tries to cut all the hair evenly, a little frustrating but maybe I was still excited about getting the free trial from Gillette. I am still going to try the styler for awhile. I do like the feel of the styler and that it is water proof. I also like that all the blades fit right into the holder and fit snug, that way when I travel I can just throw right into my bag a go.</li>
    <li> I received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from Gillette about a week ago and I&#x27;m fully impressed. I didn&#x27;t expect a trimmer that was so easy to use and convenient to be as powerful and precise as it was. I just saw how much they sell for and i&#x27;m blown away. No way you can get something this awesome for less. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. 3 useful tools in one package. The bare trimmer is perfect for side burns and other \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas. On top of that you have the three combs for getting beards and what-not just the right level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor head that clicks on the end is totally functional. The nice fat handle makes shaving easy. The vibration didn&#x27;t really do anything for me when using the blades, but that&#x27;s secondary to me. Bonus: this razor doesn&#x27;t require any new and strange razor heads. It takes the normal Gillette Fusion blade heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has earned a place on my countertop.</li>
    <li> I love my newGilette Fusion Proglide 3-in-one Styler Special Pack! I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail! I have used it on my face to trim and to shave. It&#x27;s amazing! I love how it&#x27;s easy to use and that it&#x27;s all in one! Now when I can&#x27;t make it to the barber shop, I can do it at home!</li>
    <li> This Gillette Trimmer not only gives a smooth shave but also trims places like Facial hair, eye hair and eye brows. This trimmer is very easy to use and comes with 3 guards.I received the Trimmer free via a program run by Gillette. I would recommend this trimmer Highly.</li>
    <li> Great product; I was impressed with the quality and blown away by the price. The only concern is that there may be too many accessories to keep up with and understand.</li>
    <li> For the price this a great product . The case is nice and the product is not to powerful . Bud it does the job . I love the trimmer on this product it is an easy way to trim up if you have a beard or a mustache . The razor has sharp blades and glides across the skin easily . Over all i&#x27;m happy with this product .</li>
    <li> The only downside to this product is that it is quite loud and sometimes hair gets caught above the razor and often needs to be cleaned.</li>
    <li> As a guy who spends a lot of time on the road, I have always faced the dilemma of how to maintain my beard, without packing the bulky electric trimmer that doesn&#x27;t leave room for much else in my shaving kit. The Gillette ProGlide Styler is the solution to my problem. Now I do not have to worry about looking like Grizzly Adams, when I stroll into a meeting. Nor do I have to spend quality time manually trimming my beard with manicure scissors. Thanks Gillette, for making my life a little easier!</li>
    <li> I would have never thought this razor would be so good. Got it to try free. By Gillette and I really like it. I got a close shave was a ble to line up my goatee nicely and it&#x27;s waterproof even better.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer has in fact given me the power to manscape with precision. I use it for basically every area mentioned on the package. I love that it uses only a single battery and can be used wet or dry. This product was provided to me via a program that is run by Gillette for free. I will be sticking with Gillette for all of my manscaping needs from now on.</li>
    <li> immediately upon opening the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer i knew i would be in for a good product. I was lucky enough to be provided this trimmer free of charge via a program that was run by Gillette themselves so i figured why not give it a shot. a power trimmer i currently use was put to shame by this. I tend to do my trimming while in the shower and with this product it is completely safe to use which is important to me. My current razor would always snag and end up pulling hairs from my beard out instead of trimming them as they were supposed to. With this new razor from Gillette i have not experienced this one time. every hair was cut at an equal length and totally painless. Also with the small thin handle it is simple to maneuver and can get into all of the natural dips and bumps in the skin. This razor is not only good for just a quick trim but it is also an excellent way to get a nice close shave. If someone was to ask me what i disliked about this product from Gillette i honestly wouldn&#x27;t be able to answer that. There isn&#x27;t a single property of this product that i don&#x27;t totally approve of. i would recommend this to any one that is looking for a quick efficient and painless shave.</li>
    <li> Tried it and loved it. Works just as well as my expensive trimmer and now when I go on a trip I only have to pack one razor.</li>
    <li> I received my proglide razor in the mail from a program run by Gillette. I can say right now, you won&#x27;t regret getting this product. The razor shaves and trims everything with ease, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet, and I shave every day. The cool thing about this is that you can also shave in the shower, which is easy as pie, as surprising as that sounds, because it is a power trimmer, and you use batteries to power it. No scratches or nicks! I highly recommend getting this, as his has replaced every other razor I have used. It&#x27;s all-in-one razor too, which is great!</li>
    <li> I received the item as part of a free program run by Gillette.  I really like having the styler for my sideburns and it even works on the back of the neck.  I feel that it is very well made and the fact that Gillette teamed up with Braun makes this a premium product.  The only thing I am not crazy about is that it is bulky.  I&#x27;m used to holding a smaller razor when I shave, but I&#x27;m still very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Not going to replace your barber, but it&#x27;s ok for trimming touch-ups.  It&#x27;s worth what you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;It clogs easily, so like I said- touch ups are fine.  Comfortable to hold and easy to manipulate and no nicking - all plusses.</li>
    <li> I must say gillette out did themselves with this producted and sending me a free one to try out. I got it in the mail, went right up stairs and groomed out my goatee. I must say it is light weight, small but got some power. it cleaned me right up, now my girl can not keep her eyes off my sexiness. I must say i do suggest you get this product, it is well worth the 20 bill you put out for it.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer provided by a program run by Gillette works extremely well. Compared to other brands of similar product the Gillette trimmer is efficient and doesn&#x27;t stop working after 5 minutes of use. It also does not nick your skin like other trimmers. Definitely the best trimmer I have ever used. The convenience of having a razor and a trimmer all in one is also a major plus!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette fusion proglide styler power trimmers free for answering a few questions. Like any normal person I was skeptical about a free item but I was quickly ewlieved to know that this trimmer is by far the best set I have ever used. I have other sets and I will only be using this one. It styles my facial hair just perfectly.</li>
    <li> Well I am a big time neat freak with my facial hair, I was one of the lucky ones to be able to try out the pro style glidder from a company via gillette totally complimentary.I am here to report this product is awesome it really does the job with only one product.you can give yourself an edge up and close it off with shaving clean.I would highly recomend you give this a try.</li>
    <li> The trimmer feature of the gillete styler worked a lot better than expected. When I first received it, I didn&#x27;t think it would be as powerful as it ended up being. The three comb lengths were perfect and I was able use them for different parts of my body according to what length I wanted. It&#x27;s also great that the storage rack it comes with allows you to store the combs in the back, because in the past I have repeatedly lost combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature for me was the size. It is super portable and doesn&#x27;t take up much space, which is perfect for traveling and people who would like to trim on the go.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler 3 in 1 Special Pack was awesome.  I have never had a trim that good.  It gave me a trim so close that I could easily use the free razor provided by a program run by Gillette to get a very close shave.  It felt really gentle and never pulled on my hair and never cut me.  I also like the style of it.  It was not bulky and allowed me to maneuver to the right cutting angle that I wanted.  If I were to buy a styler in the future, 10 out of 10 times would be this one.</li>
    <li> As a faithful Braun and Gillette user, the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer was a must try for me. I&#x27;ve always had a great experience using their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve ended up going out to the store to purchase this product eventually, but I was lucky enough to have been sent this product for FREE through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did when I received the trimmer was touch up my sideburns, my chin, and my neck. The trimmer is very smooth and glides across the skin effortlessly with little to no discomfort or pull. The sideburns were trimmed with one pass. Impressive! It gives you the close shave that you would normally get with a $50 or $60 trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the variety of guards that come with the trimmer, however the one thing it is missing is the mini foil attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about this product is that is very compact, which will make it easy when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proglide Styler is definitely a must have for any man that cares about his face and body as the product is great for trimming your beard as well as manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product from Gillette, and would recommend it to any man looking to purchase a new trimmer.</li>
    <li> I used to hate trimming my goatee and mustache but it&#x27;s not a pain now. Gillette sent me a trimmer to try and it works perfect. It has a stand and three guards so you get an even trim. My goatee is thick and it plows right thru it. You get a nice even trim all over. This is a good one.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Trimmer from Gillette. Yes, THE Gillette. For free! Thanks Gillette! It was a free razor/trimmer provided via a program run by Gillette. This Trimmer (from Gillette) was great! Really enjoyed the close trim. However, I wish there was an on/off button. Would make my life easier. Anyway, thanks again Gillette for the free trimmer!</li>
    <li> The Proglide Trimmer Gillette is a great product. The trimmer is sharp, cut close, and feels good in the hand. My only issue with it is the fact that you need to continuously hold down the power button to keep it on. I would prefer an on/off switch. I would definitely recommend this trimmer to anyone.</li>
    <li> Just got my Proglide and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Easy to use and the shave is really good.  I recomend shaving in the shower with the blade attachment as I get no skin irritation whatsoever!  The trimmer is good, gentle and has multiple attachments.  Overall, a very good product.</li>
    <li> Pro Glide styler is the way to go. The trimmer truly allows you to fully customize your face and keep the rest of your body hair to a manageable length. No more embarrassing body hair. The Styler allows you pick a length from three trimmer attachments.</li>
    <li> I just started using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, it was a free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and can say this razor is far superior to any Schick razor I have tried, with less nicks and shaving in the shower gives me a great close shave. My only complaint is that the replacement blades are too expensive!</li>
    <li> I tried this product out hoping I could use it to trim my moustache. It trimmed my moustache perfectly it wasnt to short like I thought it might be. It has a # 1, 2, and 3 guard so you can chose how much you want to trim. I use an electric shaver so I didn&#x27;t use the razor thats included in the package. I didn&#x27;t even have to have a \\&quot;AA\\&quot; battery thats needed to run the trimmer, it came already installed, the cooled st thing is I got this product free from Gillette!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive a Fusion Proglide Styler from Gillette to test. Since it is shower-safe, I tried it out for the first time while showering and was pleased with the effortless close shave with no visible stubble on my face.  I then tried the trimmer on my sideburns.  Since I was having such good results, I used one of the combs to touch-up my hair.  I anticipate saving money on fewer trips to the barber. It was very easy to clean the razor while still in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern in the price of the blades, but since they are advertised to last up to a month, I won&#x27;t have to purchase the cartridges very often. Overall, I give this new power trimmer a thumbs up and plan to purchase one for my Dad for Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor I got free through a Gillette sponsored program. Although it has a disposable blade, it shaves like an electric razor.  My face was so smooth and it was easy to use.  I travel a lot for work and this will be a convenient way to get a close shave without having to take an electric razor along. To make it even better, it also trims hair because it has interchangeable heads that are small and compact.</li>
    <li> Great product that is affordable and can really do the work of something much more expensive. You do not need to worry about irritation because even without an attachment it does not irritate and is a very comfortable product to use, like how versatile it is!</li>
    <li> The Gillette razor and styler i received was the best razor i have ever gotten. It shaves so close and so clean without cutting up my skin. Definitely recommend that you Check Gillette!</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette products before, but this is one of my favorites. the shave is very close and smooth. The trimming tools with it worked great! The vibrating in the razor was a nice touch. would buy again. I received this razor free and was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of trimmers and this is the first one that can trim my thick wirey beard. Granted its a small trimmer that has a cheep price tag. Don&#x27;t be fooled. with the exception of the Razor attachment that I was unimpressed with, The trimmer was the first trimmer that I have tried that can actually Trim my beard. Trim my beard without pulling hairs or pushing them down instead of cutting them. I wish it came with a #4 and #5 size for the blade guard instead of a razor that seems misplaced; however these are small concerns when compared with the quality for the price and the fact that it actually works can&#x27;t be understated. I would like to add that the trimmer without the blade guards trims against the skin without pulling hairs or pinching the skin :)</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer in the mail a few of weeks ago from a program run by Gillette and I have been using it consistently sine then. I use it as a beard trimmer and when I give haircuts as an edger to make straight lines in the back of the head by the neck and behind the ears. It is stylish-looking and well-designed, making it easy to hold and use. It is a fantastic product that gets the job done very well. I only wish it was rechargeable instead of being run on battery. Other than that I have no complaints and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this for free via a program run by Gillette.  When I saw the package, I thought it was one of the coolest shavers &amp; trimmers I have ever seen.  I typically use the trimmer on my shaver but it get clogged too easily.  This trimmer went through with no problems.  I also like the attachment for beard trimming; it took my 4 day old beard and made it look like a 1 day.  Finally, I think it was nice to see a company include the battery in the product.  There are too many times I buy something and the battery is sold separately.  Good product!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack, is a great shaving kit, the trimmer that is included with it gets close to your face but, doesn&#x27;t pull any hair and gets very close. The trimmer does not bog down when you are cutting longer hair, but if you need to look \\&quot;clean shaven\\&quot; after you go over the longer hairs with the trimmer you will have to still hit it with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, the depth combs are not as useful as you might expect given that there is a very limited number of settings (three), but they might be more useful for someone that normally keeps their beard or mustache really short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer would even work to trim your hair on top of your head but, probably would not be the best choice for normally trimming your hair. But say if you were traveling bringing an extra battery or two you could keep your hair short, if you normally keep your hair very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The option to attach a shaving razor to the trimmer is a great option, though I think it is intended to be used with the trimmer turned on so the razor vibrates to help cutting the hair. Personally, I don&#x27;t like using the razor with the trimmer turned on the vibrating makes it feel like my hairs are getting pulled out, but without the trimmer vibrator turned on it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did receive this free as part of a program Gillette was running this did not influence my review to be any more positive.</li>
    <li> I was able to try out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer free of charge through a program ran by Gillette. I have never used any type of styler before, but this product will change that from now on. This Power trimmer made tidying up my facial hair extremely easy. The entire styler is water-proof, which is phenomenal, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any nasty electric shocks if you get it wet and it is very durable. The power trimmer has a few different, interchangeable heads that can style to varying lengths. This is a great product and I&#x27;m really glad that I was able to try it!</li>
    <li> I just got one of these trimmers. It works great. The small packaging fits well in my bathroom. The best part about it is it will replace my much larger trimmer because it will do the same job, but better.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received this trimmer as a part of a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little trimmer packs a punch! I&#x27;ve tried using scissors. I&#x27;ve tried other electric trimmers, and this one has some significant advantages. When I used scissors, trimming my beard and mustache was a chore that I usually put off. My other electric trimmer (which has found a new home in the dumpster) would snag and always resulted in vicious split ends that would stab into my unsuspecting fingers. This ProGlide trimmer suffers from none of these disadvantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con is a fairly universal problem with electrics: shaving longer hairs, especially in the shower, leads to frequent jams. I still enjoyed the convenience of taking care of one more step in my grooming process in the shower, so it probably won&#x27;t stop me from continued wet use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big plus is clever packaging. The stand in the box holds all the various attachments in a nice, clean, compact package.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new beard trimmer, since mine is old (real old), and Gillette just happened to be offering this little guy for free. I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle the greatness of my beard. Boy was I wrong! This thing is great. It took care of the beard and since it can get wet, it took care of other things as well. This trimmer has a small head, so its great for detailing. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone looking for something compact and powerful. The only issue I have is that it takes a while to trim the beard since the head is small. Other than that it&#x27;s an awesome trimmer that I hope lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free ProGlide Styler &amp; Trimmer from a Gillette sponsored program.  I was very impressed by the quality of the shave, but most importantly the quality of the trimmer.  The trimmer is powerful and the battery lasted longer than I expected.  For only $20 it&#x27;s a an above average trimmer and razor, but not a superb one of either.  The fat handle makes it a bit awkward for a traditional shave.</li>
    <li> I loved the gillette fusion proglide it had been a few weeks without shaving and the trimmer part of the razor really got the thick growth off then the rest was easy with the blades that came with the razor the guide combs that are also included where great for making everything else nice and even. Overall a nice shave.</li>
    <li> I received this free from a program Gillette was running.  The blades cut as well as the normal pro glide. The trimmer has a little bit of a learning curve to it when trimming the around sideburns. The length attachments surprisingly worked well. This product is defently not as good as a stand alone beard trimmer but is worth the price if your in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I received the styler free via a program from Gillette. For being an inexpensive product that is run via a battery it has good power behind it and had a good weight and balance. I typically keep stubble on my phase, so I have only used the shortest guard (bonus, I use it in the shower) - it is also nice to change the head to a traditional razer and clean up around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is how to store it all - it doesn&#x27;t really have a good stand, and the big box takes up a lot of space - plus having little kids, I don&#x27;t like an exposed blade out, so I am forced to keep it in the original packaging.</li>
    <li> I used this promotional trimmer from Gilette for light moustache, goatee edging around face and mouth and I have say, thank you Gillette for making me a believer. Futuristic design, light and easy grip handle, (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4\\&quot; so my hands are big) I found it comfortable, time saving and convenient to use than ordinary shavers for edging those sensitive areas around the mouth, neck and face. May not be for guys with beards or thick growth, but medium haired guys like me, perfect. Not only the trimmer but the space age looking shaver and attachments for desired hair lengths included, was to say the least impressive. I&#x27;m pleased and Gillette will definitely be on the top of my list when looking for grooming products from now on.</li>
    <li> i loved how precise the edging worked and how clean and smooth the shave was. my wife even liked the edger so she could keep up her eyebrows  and other things. this is by far the best razor i&#x27;ve ever used!! this is now my go to razor/trimmer/edger.</li>
    <li> The razor was provided to me by a program run by Gillette.  The proglide styler was very functional and worked to give the perfect cut. However, after several uses it did get clogged up with the hair some and wasn&#x27;t as usable.  The material used for product is durable enough to stand a few months of usage but probably wont last forever.  Overall, a good feel for the razor, and a neat clean shave.</li>
    <li> I received Proglide Styler through a program run by Gilette. I&#x27;m really impressed so far. I like the size and feel of the device. I&#x27;ve had other trimmers that felt flimsy in comparison, and don&#x27;t want anything that looks like it belongs in a barber shop in my bathroom, so the Proglide Styler is a good fit for me.  The attachments are helpful for ensuring I&#x27;m not trimming too close.  I wish there was a smaller attachment for ear and nose, but all in all, a great device.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer - This product is great for trimming facial hair and side burns.  It works well in the shower as well which is a major plus to me. The case/stand that came with the razor is also a plus because it keeps the product neatly stored and off the counter.</li>
    <li> This is great.  I had not tried this before.  I am going to be using this product in the future.  Really does and nice job and makes me feel much more confident about myself.</li>
    <li> I received this styler for free from a campaign run by Gillette.  The razor itself works fine, not the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but good.  I really like the attachments.  The edge blade is good for cleaning up my sideburns in between haircuts.  I no longer have my facial hair, but when I did, the trimmer attachment would have been perfect.  It makes a lot more sense to buy something like this for this price to do your trimming than a more dedicated trimming comb for a lot more money with a lot less function.  If I still had the goatee, this would be the perfect choice.  As just a razor/side burn trimmer, you could get by with a standard razor, but the price really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> After receiving my free razor through a special program run by Gillette, the first thing I noticed was the quality. The quality surprised me being that it is a $20 trimmer. After opening and installing the battery it was obvious that it was a strong trimmer that could handle prolonged use. I have tried other trimmers in the past and a battery wouldn&#x27;t last long and would choke up quickly. This trimmer breezes through and facial and body hair you use it on. It is easy to see where you are trimming which is helpful when trying to get straight lines on your beard or side burns. The trimmers blade placement also is more convenient than any other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. The only complaint that I could find is that when using the guards on the trimmer, there is a small space below the blades that tends to fill with hair and clog. Other than that I love the product and would recommend it to anyone, especially for the awesome price.</li>
    <li> I recieved my Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer for free from a program run by Gillette.  This styler-trimmer from Gillette is great and it is a quality product. It has excellent balance and I can trim my facial hair with ease and without worry of razor burn or bumps ever. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer through a program by Gillette .I love it works great for my needs and with the vibrating function it shaves close and smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d suspected the multi-blade razors were all hype until I was given one as part of a program Gillette runs.  After clinging to my beard for a few more days (12...), I used the trimmer to get down to a shaveable length.  It would have been worth the cost just for the beard trimmer--usually I cut a beard down with scissors before shaving it off.  The trimmer powered through that tangled hedge like it wasn&#x27;t there.  The five-bladed final shave was the smoothest and most comfortable I&#x27;ve had in years.  YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer&#x27;s been good for my sideburns since.  Just note that the lowest cover is too close--took out half a sideburn with that bad boy when I pushed too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system made a multi-blade believer out of me.</li>
    <li> I usually use an aging trimmer to shave -- my baby skin doesn&#x27;t like a razor -- so I was pretty stoked to receive this Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free via a program run by Gillette. By the time it arrived in the mail, I had a decent neck beard blooming and was anxious to try it out. Initial results were impressive -- it felt good in the hand, was easy to maneuver around my face, and did an awesome job at trimming. However, because of it&#x27;s smaller size, I don&#x27;t think the Power Trimmer will replace my workhorse. It will come in handy for the smaller touch-up jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Looks nice. Easy to wield. Three trimmer guard sizes that compliment my usual trimming routine. Apparently waterproof (haven&#x27;t yet tested). Comes with the Fusion ProGlide razor blades to finish up. All pieces fit into included holder. It&#x27;s perfect for the goatee and other small jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The guards didn&#x27;t really want to stay in the holder. The blade pops back for cleaning, but doesn&#x27;t open very far so it&#x27;s difficult to get all of the hair out. Narrower blade than my regular trimmer so it will take awhile to shear off that face forest.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Trimmer free from a Gillette program to evaluate.  My son, a new &#x27;shaver&#x27; at the age of 17 needed a gentle shaver due to the sensitivities of young skin.  The shaver gives a very close shave and is not irritating.  Works very well on the more mature skin as well.  I highly recommend this product as wall as what a bargain for the money!</li>
    <li> love it! its super light and easy to use and cleaning it is also super easy. has several nifty attachments for different lengths and a flat razor attachment for super close shaves! makes trimming and man-scaping way quicker! super great product i would recommend it to any one who wants to keep there facial or body hair looking great!</li>
    <li> I recieved the proglide styler power trimmer for free by a progrm run by Gillette. I have a soul patch that I have to Shave everyday. I used the trimmer side for that and loved it. I also used the razor to shave. It is one of the best razors I have ever used. I will not go back to another razor. The blades cut through so smoothly. I haven&#x27;t gotten razor burn which was always a problem with other razors. It glides perfectly around my face.</li>
    <li> The Gillete Fusion Proglide 3-in-1 Styler Special pack razor is very powerful and works great!  This is so compact it will go everywhere with me!</li>
    <li> I received this newest technology through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Did you ever want the great shave and trim of a barbershop at home then the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Style Power Trimmer is for you. It addresses ALL our grooming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an ergonomically designed shaver/trimmer.  It is user friendly on several levels:&lt;br /&gt;easy access to the battery; a breeze to change attachments;  changing of the blade was snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrating handle eases the shaving process. The razor blade was exceptionally sharp.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer function gave a clean and \\&quot;smart\\&quot; barbershop like cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like it will travel easily.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this item.&lt;br /&gt;It is like having a mini manual electric shaver</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack was provided to me via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Very smart Packaging of all you need to groom, tream and style yoursef. The smartest and softest, safest and high quality kit for the man. Power Trimmer works practically perfect. The only thing I would mancion as critique is stand - is not the most comfortable and fitting - could be something more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I got the razor through Gillette program to test out.  Prior to using this razor i was using an electric shaver.  So it was a bit different switching over this.  What i like about this razor is that it hardly ever misses a hair when i shave.  I also like the fact that it is a multi-option use type of razor. However, I was not able to use the trimmer since I am Asian and am not able to grow thick beards.  Overall, the product is a good and gives the flexibility and definitely a useful multi-use tool.</li>
    <li> recieved this product for free from Gillette just in time to get ride of my seasonal beard.  It helped to remove my winters growth and restore my clean shaven face. I was amazed when I did not have a single nick or cut when finished(the first year ever for that)An amazing product.</li>
    <li> So I am a typical razor blade user. Not too big on the power heads and such. But this little Power Trimmer! Wow. Not only does it double as a razor... It lines up my hair line perfectly for those between hair cut touch ups. Very glad Gillette sent me this Power Trimmer free. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it... oh wait, I wouldn&#x27;t be lined up looking sexy!</li>
    <li> Excellent made all my expectations</li>
    <li> Wow! I received this free razor from a program run by Gillette. I was excited to try it once I got it in the mail. This trimmer is really great. I use it to trim up my chest/stomach hair, along with my neck hair. It works really well and is easy to clean. This product works well in the shower, but works even better dry. It is very precise and creates clean lines. Worth buying!</li>
    <li> I received the trimmer free for product testing from Gillette. It is as advertised. It makes daily grooming a breeze. I recommend the trimmer to anyone needing a reliable product to \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; your body with. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is now part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> After having used this trimmer for a couple weeks, all I have to say is that it is a great product for the money.  THe shaver is the same fusion shaver I&#x27;ve been using for a while now, but the trimmer is decently powerful, easy to clean, and seems to run for a rather long time on one battery.  Could be a little easier to get the attachments off, but overall a very solid product.</li>
    <li> This little styler was provided free by Gillette, and I am truly impressed, I have the ability to trim my facial hairs closely and my face is left without any stubble,I have tried other brands in the past and they do not even come close to this Gillette product, I am very happy and satisified with this product and would recommend it to everyone to try it out and see the difference, you will fall in love with it after the first use.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product as part of a program run by Gillette and could not be happier. I have owned many body trimmers in the past and did not think this little trimmer could handle all of my hair. Boy, was I wrong this Braun trimmer is top notch! it performs flawlessly. I am very impressed by the feel of the product as it feels very expensive. It is very easy to grip the rubber handle even with wet hands. Needless to say I am throwing out my old trimmer and shaver as this one is replacing them both!</li>
    <li> When I got this trimmer free through a program at Gillette I was worried that it would scratch  my body like other trimmers I have used. But it was actually a great trimmer that had no problem trimming hair and not hurting me. I would very much recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette.  This trimmer was easy to use and the shape/size was perfect for my hand which allowed for the best control. The trimmer was easily maneuvered regardless the contour of my face and chin.  The trimmer made quick work of the job that typically would take longer and at times does not come out as even as the job done by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other positive features of this product are the three heads that provide flexibility and control that you need to make the hair the length you need.  Finally, the trimmer does not have to be tied to an adapter to keep it charged.  Drop in a battery and you are set to go again.</li>
    <li> I love my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. Since receiving it I have used it at least 2 or 3 times a week. What a great tool! It helps keep my sideburns trimmed and neat. I use it to keep my nose hairs in check and the hair on my neck from from growing wildly out of control. It has a razor I use for shaving and get a smooth close shave. The blade is staying sharp is easy to clean. I love my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. It is the best thing since slice bread. Which I had one sooner.</li>
    <li> I have used this new Gillette product now twice, after I shave my hair I use this for touch ups. Works great, doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and cuts very close. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to other guys at the station. Worth every dollar!</li>
    <li> I got this for free from Gillette. I was skeptical because I only like certain razors and don&#x27;t like to switch very often. Honestly, my wife made me try it because it was free. The trimmer is small but has so many attachments so it seems like a big trimmer. I used it bare, on a \\&quot;zero\\&quot; to trim my coarse goatee hair. It got a little bogged down on the longer hairs, but it did the job expected for it&#x27;s size. The really cool part is that you don&#x27;t have to switch over to a razor, just attach the blades to the trimmer. And the vibration I swear, makes the 5 blades work even better! My normal razor has 3 blades, and at first 5 seemed like a bit much. But I have to say I love it! It cut down what it needed to and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. This is a winner!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide styler a couple of weeks ago thru a program run by Gillette and was finally able to try a product that I&#x27;d wanted to for so long but wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the money.  Well I was wrong, do you here that wifey, I was wrong, you were right.  This styler truly impressed me and was far better than the one I had received as a Christmas gift a few years back.  I have always had a moustache and I absolutely hate trying to trim it with a pair of scissors that I usually have to hunt for.  This styler surprising trimmed my moustache quickly and evenly and also did a great job on my sideburns and hairline.  My son even used it to style up his crew cut.  Even though the blades are a little pricey they tend to last longer than the disposables and since my wife almost always has a coupon it works out well.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Styler packet from a free program by Gillette a couple of weeks ago and have since used it many times.  I&#x27;ve used it for trimming my side burns in between haircuts as well as keeping my 6 year old son&#x27;s sideburns trimmed as well.  The trimmer works well and I don&#x27;t worry that it will nick my son&#x27;s face while I neaten up his hair.  I have not had to change the AA battery and it has been well over a month but then I&#x27;ve only been using the trimmer once a week.  For people who use it more often, I would imagine you would need to change the batter at least once a month.  People should not expect this product to be like a professional trimming at a salon but more like a trimmer to just do touch ups in between salon visits.  It is compact and fits in my bathroom shelf nicely without taking up precious space.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free via a program through Gillette.  I am extremely satisfied with this razor and setup in general!  I will continue to use it and the Gillette brand as I have for over 20 years.  I have recommended this to many friends and family members as well.  I love the comfortable grip handle and the handy storage case for all of the different parts.  I get a very close and smooth shave and it is very easy on the skin.  I am a very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> This body groomer from Gillette is great. It is a quality product. It has excellent balance and I can trim my body hair with ease and without worry. No razor burn or bumps ever. My goatee is easily trimmed and shaping around my nose and mouth is quick and painless. Other unwanted body hair is also a snap with this body hair trimmer. I highly recommend this produc</li>
    <li> I am not sure what I like the best about the Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer.  Is it the pakaging of the product where everything fits neatly into a compact stand or the best in class shave closeness you come to expect from Gillette products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the type who leaves things sitting out, so I am sure thats what Gillete had in mind with the verticle stand for the trimmer, and the storage in back for the height adapters.  It just works and it neatly stores on the countertop in your bathrrom, no drawers needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also performed a side by side test of the razer on the Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer and what was my everyday mach 3 turbo.  I was skeptical the vibrating razor would get closer, but in fact it does!  The side of my face that I used the ProGlide styler on was smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you are like me, and you shave clean on a daily basis you really only need the trimmer for sideburns, and some other light duties here and there.  I have another set of clippers to do the same stuff.  In short if you are like me this product really replaces the traditional clippers.  At the end of the day this product replaces 2 items you have your bathroom...</li>
    <li> The trimmer was good but don&#x27;t try to shave your whole face with it it is what it is a trimmer.  I have a goatee so I trim everyday this does make it easy between shaves. I got this free razor and  it was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me one of these for free and this thing is awesome. The no slip grip not only makes it look cool, but helps you grip the trimmer at any angle. I mainly use the trimmer on my facial hair, but the attachments it comes with are great for manscaping as well. It is compact and ready for travel. This trimmer is definitely one of my favorite items in my grooming arsenal.</li>
    <li> Once i received this product I was skeptical at first...but once received the free razor from  Gillette  i started to use the many different features and i LOVE it and 4 of my friends already bought it</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide trimmer/clipper is decent enough.  Good for small jobs such as a quick trim, or face/body hair cleanup.  Bigger jobs would benefit from a bigger, more precise clipper.  But there are a few really nice features that other options may not have:  You can take this thing in the shower, get it wet, do what needs to be done, and it will be just fine - it&#x27;s pretty rugged.  Cleaning it is also easy with water.  Alone, the trimmer isn&#x27;t much more than a basic trimmer that is water resistant.  Where this thing really shines is the whole Fusion Proglide kit.  Now here I must mention that I received this trimmer for free from a program run by Gillette, and as such I needed to write a review on the trimmer.  But I feel that the kit as a whole is what really makes this thing worth consideration.  It comes with the trimmer, and 1, 2, and 3, setting length clipons, one Fusion Proglide razor blade (which attaches to the top of the trimmer pretty conveniently), and a nice little caddy to store everything together in one place.  The whole kit comes together to provide a quick and easy method for most any manscaping maintnance.</li>
    <li> The Gillete Fusion ProGlide Styler, is a neat little gadget! My free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and I&#x27;m happy I got one! The trimmer is very stylish itself, with easy to use attachments. I use this to keep the mustache perfectly trimmed and to bring the hair down to razor length, when I want to go totally bald.&lt;br /&gt;Great Iteam!</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer for free as part of a promotion from Gillette. And, I am glad I did. What an awesome little trimmer. The trimmer itself fits in your hand well, is waterproof, is small enough so it doesn&#x27;t take up sacred countertop space and has a nice holder. I do wish it was chargeable. I don&#x27;t shave every day so when I have to, I use this to help ease the burden of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When changing from the razor to the trimmer head, I do recommend you be gentle. I think that part should be designed a little better. It seems a little delicate for a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; razor/trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, a nice product. I will keep this in my bathroom and should the need arise, buy another one. The purchase price is decent for what you are getting.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusin Progilde Trimmer for a week and a half now. I think it does a great job and triming and keeping my beard and sideburn&#x27;s in check. No pulling and ripping my hair out! I Love that it has so many different attachments to get the perfect look you are going for and is easy to store! I love that it is one double A battery (which is included in the package.) Mind you this is not a hair cutter it is a beard trimmer and does a great job trimming! I recieved this product ran by a Gillette Fusion program BUT this is my true and honest opinion!</li>
    <li> Gillette let me try this shaver for free from a program they ran, great idea. This is the most amazing shaver i have ever used. Gets right up to your facial hair so it looks perfect every time. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and I am completly satisfied with the shaver. I am positive I will continue to use it. Recommend to anyone with facial hair, want a perfect shape? Get this.</li>
    <li> Great for the price, it&#x27;s an inexpensive way to groom your beard inbetween barbershop visits,  i received the trimmer free through a promotion via Gillette and i use it everyday.  there no fancy settings just 3 different clips and a razor attachment.  i&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and i&#x27;ll definately reccomend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review under my wife&#x27;s account since I don&#x27;t have an Amazon account.  I recently was fortunate to try this product for free thanks to the great site, Bzzagent.com.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial grooming but it definitely worked great when trying to get straight, smooth lines on the side burns.  I also used this on my chest and I had no issues with it pulling on the hairs or causing any kinds of ingrown hairs.  I love the fact that it comes with a stand to keep everything all together on the counter without causing massive clutter.  Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I recently was given a free Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack, through a promotion by Gillette. At first like most people and their opinion of new products and their hype, I was very skeptical and was not sure what to expect. After just a couple of uses I was convinced. I am now a believer in ever sense of the word. If you want every man&#x27;s dream when it comes to shaving then look no further. If you want to trim with Braun engineered technology and look your best. Braun is the best electric and battery powered technology on the market today. A very sleek,slim and easy to maneuver design for even trimming. Includes three combs for custom length, so it can tackle even the toughest of trimming tasks. All of this is what you&#x27;ll have with Fusion ProGlide Power. Gillette&#x27;s most advanced blades on the market. Incredible closeness and comfort. You can trim and edge like no other with Precision Edging Blade,designed for crisp, defined lines and is only limited by your imagination and style choices. You&#x27;ll never look back once you have tried and loved ever single aspect of this fine tuned shaving paradise.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. I really didn&#x27;t expect a lot from it considering the price, but was pleasantly surprised. It is very easy to use and does a nice job trimming. Perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time to run to a stylist every time you need a trim. The fact that is is battery opperated so there is no need to plug it in and charge it every time you use it is also a plus. For the price I would definately reccomend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> (written by the hubby) I received this Fusion proglide styler free as part of a Gillette campaign.  This is an ok little tool! It comes with three combs and a battery, ready to use.  I don&#x27;t have a face full of hair, but I do use this to tight edge out my mustache and beard when I let them grow out a little.  It&#x27;s great for trimming sideburns too, because those always seem to puff out before you need a trim for the rest of your head.  It&#x27;s not a tool to use to cut all of the hair on your head, I think we&#x27;ve covered that.  It&#x27;s easy to clean too, that&#x27;s a big plus for me.  The caddy that it comes in is substantial enough to hold everything without tipping over all the time.  You can also use the manual razor, which works fantastic for everyday shaving, I have use Gillette blades for a long time because they last a lot longer than other brands, and twice as long as store brands.  I don&#x27;t get any cuts or nicks around my nose and mouth, and I like the handle better than the one I had before.  All in all, its a super value for $20!</li>
    <li> I was sent a Gillette Fusion ProGlide as part of a Gillette program and am pleasantly surprised by both the razor and the trimmer. The trimmer is lightweight but very effective even though the trimming head is relatively small. And being new to the Fusion razor series, I was impressed by the close comfortable shave it provided. I will definitely use both regularly now. And because of its light weight and compact design, I will be taking the set with me when I travel. Lots of bang for your buck here. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The good. Small and powerful. I like the fact that it fits in the palm of my hand. Easy to travel with. Smooth shave it glides on the face very well leaves no razor burn or bumps. Easy to switch between the different heads. Great Battery life. I would recommend this to anyone who travel or is always in a hurry. I also got a free razor with this and I loved it and will buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my new trimmer for the quickness and accuracy it brings to my shave. I have thick facial hair and must keep it neat for my job. I can easily trim my face every morning without fear of razor burn. I did feel that it dulled faster than the more expensive options I&#x27;m used to, but for the price I am not complaining.</li>
    <li> I received this free kit from Gillette, and was quite amazed by the product. It didn&#x27;t look like those cheap disposable products that already is a plus. But After trying out, seals the deal! I was amazed, I bought products like that in the past and it always gives me the same problem - it gets my beard caught sometimes because its so thick! But this product really did otherwise. When it says it glides it really does, I didn&#x27;t get a single hair caught and it was easy glide and smooth! Yes I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The power trimmer from Gillette is great. It is a quality product. It has excellent balance and easy maneuverability.  I can trim my body hair with ease and without worry. No razor burn or bumps ever. I highly recommend this product. I received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to find out I was selected to receive a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler through a program Gillette was running. I own a different trimmer so I couldn&#x27;t justify buying this one. I wish I had though. This is a great product!!! The fact that you can bring it in the shower makes manscaping a lot easier. I also shave my head and it seemed easier to do so with a bigger handle to grip. The only thing I wish the Styler had is a nose and ear trimmer attachment. That would truly make it the best trimmer out there. I wish I hadn&#x27;t taken so long to use this but, hey, you live and learn.</li>
    <li> I am typically an electric razor user. I hate nicks and the feeling of razor burn... plus I am not a big fan of the mess of the shaving cream and the stubble a razor leaves in the sink. Usually, it is much easier to just run the electric razor over my face on the way out the door.&lt;br /&gt;Gillete gave me a free promo Fusion ProGlide Styler to try out. The ProGlide Styler is almost like a complete electric razor; both a blade to shave your face and small clippers with attaché&#x3D;ments to trim up facial hair and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me tell you about the blade itself. The clipper handle is an electric handle that vibrates when you draw the blade across your face. And the best part is that the blade is so great it just takes on pass over each area to provide a shave much smoother than my electric razor could ever do. Normally I need to make several passes; but not with the Fusion ProGlide blade. It actually took me less time to shave with Fusion ProGlide Styler than my Electric to get even better results than the electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope! Not at all. I tried the Fusion ProGlide without the handle vibrating and the shave was everything I hate about blade razors. Turn the handle on and it is smoother than the electric and it only takes one pass instead of several. I had less irritation with the ProGlide than the electric. \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; indeed! The addition of the trimming tool could replace my electric shaver entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only piece of this equipment that I am not 100% convinced will allow me to toss out an electric razor is the trimmer. It is small, and not very powerful. While it is good in a pinch, it is not extremely precise and took several passes to make my side burns look as good as normally get with my electric trimmers. Still, it is not bad, just not powerful and the trimming head is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to get back into the bladed razor world. I recommend the Fusion ProGlide Styler. The only bad thing I can say about it, is thatit still makes a mess in the sink and the trimming head is a little small. However... you can take this \\&quot;electric\\&quot; ProGlide handle into the shower (it is waterproof) so if you have a mirror in there, you are all set. Plus it has the different trimming head attachments that come with the razor, so it really is an all-in-one package. This is really great for traveling if you want a good professional clean shave, the ability to trim your facial hair and don&#x27;t want to pack-up cords or a charger.</li>
    <li> Wish i knew about this sooner. Such a great deal. 25 bucks (after shipping) is a crazy good price. Even came with batteries. Very happy with this. The buzzer is strong and powerful and the razor blade itself is great. Perfect for keeping my beard shaped up nicely and shaving unwanted areas.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler it provides a very comfortable, smooth and effortless shave. I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation or cuts. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Gillette for years and once again, I can say, that I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler.</li>
    <li> I got the Styler for free from Gillete and the bottom line is that it fills in well for some grooming, but is not going to replace my other grooming devices.&lt;br /&gt;Good: Good shape and size, easy to use, and reasonably powerful for small tasks. A well put together device with a few good options for how you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Less good: Not adjustable, and may not be appropriate for the most delicate jobs.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette to try out.  On the plus side, the razor worked great for trimming areas like the back of my neck.  It would have also been great as a bear trimmer.  However, as just a razor for a close, smooth shave, I was disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t cut very close or smooth.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to receive the Fusion ProGlide Power Trimmer through a program run by Gillette. I say fortunate for two reasons. 1) I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this trimmer. 2) I had previously seen it advertised but wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to make another investment (only to be disappointed like so many before its time). I need something affordable, durable, and solid in performance, and this trimmer delivers. It is battery operated with a good grip, yet a little heavier than others I&#x27;ve used. I like having the option of different trim lengths with the 3 attachments provided, although I don&#x27;t typically use them. I like to have a little stubble to work with, but only grow a beard every once in a blue moon. I found I can use this trimmer without the comb attachements, and it still seems to work fine that way. It  maintains a little bit of growth while keeping it looking purposeful and groomed. I do believe for those who prefer beards, this trimmer will work great. Perfect for a quick touch-up of any random, stray hairs before you hit the door. This trimmer offers a variety of options (as it also comes with a razor attachment for a clean shave). It does just what it says it will, and I will certainly continue to use. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> About 2 months ago I received the razor/trimmer free provided via a program run by Gillette. Every time I used the trimmer I was pleased. I dont often grow out a beard or mustache but I do keep my head hair VERY short. This trimmer is excellent for a quick trim on my head! I would for sure recommend this product to anyone whether it be for head or face!</li>
    <li> Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Proglide &#x27;3-In-1 Styler&#x27; is a nifty and stylish product that adequately handles most of your facial/body grooming needs.  Full disclosure - Gillette provided this product to me in exchange for product feedback and after putting this styler to use over the past 4 weeks I can wholeheartedly recommend this product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Compact sizing - if you&#x27;re still using a full sized head trimmer to mow down your facial hair you will really appreciate the slim size of this styler.  About as big as a compact mag-lite, this product is easily transportable while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;+ Flexibility with &#x27;closeness&#x27; - This styler effectively has 4 hair length adjustments with 3 guards and a no-guard option.  Utilizing a no-guard option will give you an all around 5-o&#x27;clock shadow look while sizing up with one of the guards will preserve desired hair length.&lt;br /&gt;+ Good razor - The styler is an effective multi-tasker and becomes a great razor when you insert a Proglide cartridge (1 is included).  This 5 bladed cartridge provides a tight and smooth shave and is compatible with Gillete&#x27;s line of Proglide grooming products.&lt;br /&gt;+ Waterproof - You can use this device while powered on in the shower and clean up is very simple and effective.  The rubber gripping is very comfortable and always feels secure in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;+ Stylish - This is a handsome product with blue and metallic accents and looks even better when propped up in the included stand sitting on your sink.&lt;br /&gt;+ Affordable - For less than 20 bucks you get a fully functional hair/body groomer and powered razor to boot.  The product is ready to go right out of the box and comes with the styler, stand, 3 guard attachments, Proglide razor cartridge and a battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for a great product.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. 3 different levels of closeness plus the bald blade nice out of the was stand to keep organize. Runs rather smooth for it being battery operated.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said it runs good for it being battery operated not great. IDE personally stick to my elecrtic trimmer but this one has the over covienence for travel.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided to me by free program run by Gillette. The first thing that impressed me was that it came with a stand and a battery , therefore I didn&#x27;t have to go out and buy a battery!!! The blade cut effortlessly and smoothly and left my face not only smooth but without a cut face or that reddish look you get when the shave is not smooth. Size of the razor was perfectly fitted towards my hand and the fact that it had a grip on it made it easy to hold on to in a wet shower. That with the fact it has a holder with it meant no dropping of the razor or the razor slipping off shower edge. The razor head was easy to put on and take off and switch with the trimmer. Overall a very good product.</li>
    <li> Received the styler free from Gillette. Was actually impressed by the quality of it. It&#x27;s a very sturdy little trimmer/styler. I normally use an electric razor for shaving, and it has also covered the trimming duties. However, I really like the way this thing works . Handles unruly sideburns with ease. Very comfortable to hold in the hand. really works well on eyebrows, and although others have said it doesn&#x27;t, I found it handles the peachfuzz between haircuts quite well. Chest hair and back hair(with assistance) also found worked quite well. As far as the shaving aspect, as I said I have been using an electric razor for years. My face just does&#x27;nt really like razor blades, but it did provide quite a close shave, although when using the power function, alot of razor nicks for me. All in all a keeper</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide styler I received as a promotional product and I absolutely love it. I have had facial hair since I was 14 years old and it has sort of become a trademark to my look. I love the trimmer because it has three combs that have a spot to set in the back of the holder. I like to keep my goatee one step longer than my beard and sideburns. It also is really nice that it is waterproof because it&#x27;s easier to shave with a shower mirror while the beard is wet and soft. The trimmer without the comb does a good job getting close enough to the skin. I&#x27;m looking into trying new designs with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has an attachment which holds a blade. The handle lifts up the black trimmer so the blade can fit onto the handle. It&#x27;s thick and long enough for a comfortable secure grip. So when you shave with the handle turned on the blade has a vibration that helps cut the hair effortlessly. I am not a fan of the Fusion blade without vibration because the manual version does tear my skin up even though it has 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have converted from my Shick Hydro 5 blade for this one merely because of the vibration in the blade. Otherwise I would still use the Hydro for my razor shave and the Gillette Styler for my grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product hands down. They outdid themselves with personal grooming this time.</li>
    <li> I was provided with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a program ran by Gillette. I&#x27;m a very hairy guy all around. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I tried it out but I was pleasantly suprised by it. The styler itself is very small and easy to carry around which makes it great to take on trips and then you can simply attach the shaver on to the styler. Th.e styler is waterproof  and make it easy to clean. It&#x27;s nice to have one machine for it all. I used the styler on my beard and head followed by the shaver and it did a great job. Very minimal tugging. I&#x27;ve recommended this little machine to all my guy friends.</li>
    <li> I was provided it free through a program run by Gillette. It has an excellent trimming motor it trims very well (I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to trim very well for running on batteries). I can also trim my body hair easily and without it pulling the hair or giving razor bumps. My goatee is easily trimmed and shaved to perfect length and shape. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler thanks to Gillette. I have used this Styler trimmer for about 3 weeks now and really love it. From day one when I received the trimmer I noticed that the way it was built it felt like it would hold up for a long time. This system comes with a holster that holds the Gillette Fusion, Blades and Guards.  When I opened the package they had everything packed very organized. It came with a AA Battery which was a shocker. The AA battery that came with this product is the same one that I am still using 3 weeks later and I have been using this Styler almost every day.  I have noticed that wile using the trimmer part of it the trimmer head will start to get clogged. That does not bother me because I can wash it out but if you are in a hurry to get the trimming done and you have a thick mustache or beard then it may slow you down a little. I had a thick beard and it cut right thru it all like nothing until it got clogged up. The other plus about this product is it is waterproof. You can take it and use this in the shower if you would rather shave in the shower.  Has a nice rubber grip on it so that it will not slip out of your hand.  It also comes with 3 Guards so that you can trim your beard to a different size if you wanted to. I like these since they are not resizable because the resizable ones always wear out allot faster. These are set lengths. They fit nicely into the back of the holster. When they are wet they will drip thru the holster. The holster has holes for the water to run out. This trimmer also turns into a razor. When you pop the razor attachment on it and turn it on the blades of the razor will vibrate and cause your hair to stand up and get a closer cut.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is my new best friend! I got the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette and decided to give it a try. I do no have a huge beard, in fact, I don&#x27;t like having a beard or shaving, so at first I was apprehensive about using this product and not sure I would love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong. With it, the task I really hate, shaving, is so much easier and precise, leaving no stubs behind and giving me a very pretty and clean look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is uneven and my skin gets irritated easily, so with the great razor, the ability to use it in the shower, on or off, make it a perfect item that I will for sure take anywhere I go!</li>
    <li> Make each time that I need it a touch up more easy to do great inexpensive power trimmer that could get the job done easy to handle and works in the shower. It&#x27;s great ! :)&lt;br /&gt;Got this complementary from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler from a program run by Gillette. I thought what the heck, I would give my old trimmer a rest and try something new. After using it for a couple of weeks I would just like to say how pleased I was with this product. I have used it for edging my side burns, goatee, and other body hair and it has not disappointed. It has plenty of power to get through my thick facial hair without pulling hair or leaving burns and cuts. Here are a few points that I like about this trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Included are three detachable guards that allow for different hair lengths. (plenty of choices to suit my needs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It is shower safe. The grip has a nice feel and does not slip when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Gillette thought ahead and designed the packaging to double as storage for the trimmer and all of it&#x27;s accessories.(A handy feature in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It comes with a Gillette Proglide Power Blade attachment. This adds vibration to the already awesome Power Blades.(a very nice shave!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I can get a nice smooth shave and a fast, precise edging/trim from the same product without missing a beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very impressed with the design and functionality of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> My wife signed me up to try one of these for free with a website. I didn&#x27;t think much about it until it came in and I was actually surprised by how cool it was. It comes with a nice little caddy to store everything in on the sink. It works really well for my wife to clean up the edges on my neck between haircuts. It is easy to use and comfortable to hold. It has several attachments for different purposes and you can use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife kept hinting about how it could be used for manscaping body hair, apparently she doesn&#x27;t like werewolves in real life, only in books. I gave it a shot and actually didn&#x27;t have any problems. Everything I wanted left intact was unharmed, and I felt five pounds lighter afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously a nifty little tool. Pick one up and give it a try!</li>
    <li> Gillette had been running a free promotion to try the power styler and was very appreciate of that as it was a very neat little product. It worked really well at trimming sideburns or anywhere else really. Was powerful enough and water proof too!</li>
    <li> (I have updates below. Read the original review for backstory only).  ORIGINAL REVIEW  I&#x27;m so pleased with this device. I had a Remington something or other that cost me around $50. To my disappointment, it wasn&#x27;t even worth the $19.99 I later saw it selling for at a different store. So after over a year of anguishing under such tyranny, I decided it was time for an upgrade (and a less dramatic outlook on life). Enter the Proglide Styler (under $20!). The trimmer, when used with 1 of 3 combs, gives you fast and easy facial hair trimming. Pop off the comb to easily establish lines. Pop on the razor attachment and press the power button for what may be the closest, most comfortable shave you&#x27;ve ever had. Use the precision blade on the back of the razor to get those lines nice and sharp. It&#x27;s even easy to clean. Just push the trimmer head back, rinse the hair-filled chamber, and you&#x27;re done. The bottom line is, if you have facial hair, you should buy this product. I&#x27;ll give an update in a few months, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this thing can do no wrong.  UPDATE: April 18, 2014  So I&#x27;ve been using the Proglide Styler for a few months now and here&#x27;s how I feel: I&#x27;m still very pleased with the Styler as a beard trimmer, but not so much as a razor. I like the precision blade on the back enough, but the razor itself, with or without the power on, cuts my neck like the dickens (that&#x27;s right, the dickens). So lately, I&#x27;ve been using the much more comfortable Magnum 3 on my neck (with no major cuts and only the occasional little nick), and using the Styler&#x27;s precision blade for cleaning up my lines, retiring the Styler&#x27;s main razor entirely. And even the precision blade isn&#x27;t that comfortable. In reality, you&#x27;re probably better off using the Styler only as a beard trimmer, and getting a good, comfortable razor with a precision blade for shaving. As you can tell from my original review, I&#x27;ve radically changed my view on the razor component&#x27;s quality (I even called it the &amp;#34;closest, most comfortable shave you&#x27;ve ever had&amp;#34;). But I guess the blades lose their goodness after the first use.  UPDATE: July 2, 2014  Okay, so since my last update this device has proven even more unreliable than originally given credit for. After just a couple uses, the motor starts laboring like the batteries are about to die (&#x27;cause they are). Additionally, the plastic nib thing on the comb that clicks it into place will disintegrate and chip off, making the comb unusable unless you want to press your finger against the comb at all times to keep it from falling off. The trimmer itself isn&#x27;t even that powerful, come to think of it. When I first reviewed this thing, I gave it 5 stars and sang its praises with no complaints. Now, I&#x27;ve taken it down to 2 stars and added a cautionary &amp;#34;Or So I Thought&amp;#34; to the title due to its faulty and flawed multi-blade razor, precision blade, battery life, and comb adapters. I don&#x27;t know which beard trimmer out there is a good one to buy, but I intend to do so ASAP and throw this thing in the trash where it belongs. (See new update below)  UPDATE: December 26, 2016  &amp;#34;The Peanut&amp;#34; by Wahl. Buy that. Only 3 adapters, and those 3 don&#x27;t offer much length variety, but it&#x27;s a good quality beard trimmer with plenty of power, thanks to the fact that it plugs in and doesn&#x27;t run on batteries. Since my last update, I&#x27;ve thrown out the Proglide Styler, but I&#x27;ve actually bought another one because it makes an inexpensive waterproof trimmer for my...not my beard. So its low quality isn&#x27;t as much of a problem. But it still sucks as a beard trimmer. Meep.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product, but I purchased one in theorde number 104-7628990-4265053 in january 5, 2014 and it&#x27;s missing 2 of 3 combs that was supposed to bring; and the base &amp;#34;organizer&amp;#34; is broken in the middle. So I lost it!</li>
    <li> This is a great little unit which my Fiance&#x27; loved and the price was much better than any where else including Wally World. He trims with this regularly and I do have to say his beard looks much better now than it did before when he was using another trimmer :o)</li>
    <li> What can I say, this is a very good trimmer that operates on a AA battery. Cleans easily and the combs are easy to switch. I have yet to find a use for the razor blade attachment, as if a vibrating unit of 5 blades is going to shave any better than a hand. From that perspective the unit is over priced, but since I had a coupon and this was on sale, i&#x27;d say I broke even.</li>
    <li> I bought this solely for the beard trimmer, as I use Dollar Shave Club for my shaving needs (seriously, you should check them out. They are an inexpensive, well made alternative to the overpriced shave gear put out by Gillette. Hit me up and I&#x27;ll send you a link, or Google it).&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer seems to be made well. It has a heavier feel in the hand, which is something I appreciate--I don&#x27;t like the feel of cheap plastic--and the blades/teeth do the job. There are two issues I have with it, which might be minor for some folks. First, it burns through batteries if you use it more than once a month, which I do. Because my beard grows in thick and full, if I don&#x27;t shave for a week (which is common), I have to do a once over with a beard trimmer before I can shave. As a result I go through batteries fairly quickly with this. The other issue I have is the contour of the trimmer head. I find it more cumbersome trimming over my ears when cleaning up my sideburns. My last beard trimmer (which met an unfortunate and rusty demise at the hands of my unknowing wife, who assumed it could be rinsed off with water--a tale for another time) had more of an open trim head, allowing me to glide over my ears when shaping the burns. Not so much with this one. It&#x27;s better for squaring things off, which would work well for me, if I sported, for instance, white walls; I grow a little something past the tops of my ears, and thus have to spend more time finessing areas that require more than a right angle.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this isn&#x27;t a bad beard trimmer, it just isn&#x27;t the greatest one I&#x27;ve used, and I will be buying a replacement for the one my wife accidentally destroyed (we could never have a robot child, because she would forget and try to bathe it).</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver because it can be used in the shower. I&#x27;ve used it many times now and it works just great. I love the 3 stylers that comes with it so I can get a close shave or let my beard grow longer. It&#x27;s my choice. I&#x27;d surely buy it again and recomend it to my friends. Shipping was great also.</li>
    <li> very good product! can be used in the shower because it is water-resistant. the trimmer is great for the chop! the only drawback is related to the price of razors that are very expensive and along with this handset comes only one.</li>
    <li> He loves the fact that he can used this system for all his facial hair. I&#x27;m glad that he liked it.</li>
    <li> I bought my boyfriend this shaver as a late V-day gift but to also eliminate the cost of going to the barber shop. Going to the shop every two weeks for a hair cut and beard trim costing approximately $40 per trip. While with this razor/trimmer you can do all beard and mustache maintenance for yourself. Easy to store and clean, easy for you to learn and use!</li>
    <li> I got this to trim my beard. It works great! Very happy with the product and it was a great price.</li>
    <li> All the pieces and the machine are great. The razor specially; no more aftershave rash. Highly recomended for people that have to shave everyday.</li>
    <li> I like the styler, however, the razor attachment leaves a little to be desired. Cannot seem to shave with it without cutting myself due to the size and angles.</li>
    <li> I recived my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler from Gillette and tryed it out. The shaver is so smooth theres hardly any resistance when shaving and the trimmer and styler works well on sideburns and chest hair. This is going to be my choice of razor for a long time.I would recomend this product to a friend and/or family member</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Style Power Trimmer is awesome.  I do like to be well groomed and \\&quot;man-scape\\&quot; regularly.  It was easy to use even in \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot;.  I had another trimmer but I think I am hooked on the Gillette, it gave a much nicer shave and had more accessories to make getting different areas easy to do.  I got this razor through a program run by Gillette.  I still remember getting a razor from Gillette when I turned 18 and it is great to see that they still will give you a good product.  Gillette has been and will be the only brand for me.</li>
    <li> Received this product via a free program from gillette. Singly handily the best product that I have ever used. For the price, it is a no brainer purchase. If this product ever stops working, without hesitation i would buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the entire Face/body, the product works perfect. Product works in the shower which is super convenient. Even if you have sensitive skin(which I do), it wont matter because it doesnt bother it, the product is a perfect purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a must buy...</li>
    <li> My husband is very impressed with this new ProGlide trimmer we received from a program ran by Gillette. It&#x27;s easy to customize with the three styling blades, easy to operate, easy to change out the attachments and the holding case. My husband ditched his old trimmer as he can now easily trim his sideburns, chest hair and even eyebrows without any patches or bald spots. We highly recommend it as it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> The Gillete Fusion ProGlide Styler is an answer to all my grooming needs.  Thanks to a program run by Gillette, I was able to try out the ProGlide Styler for FREE!  I love the 3-in-1 feature so I can trim my beard with one of three length trimmer guides, shave my neck, and Edge my sideburns all using the same trimmer.  Switching from trimmer to shaver could not be any more simple.  With a flick of the thumb, you can snap in and out in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is incredible, especially when you shave in the shower.  Taking advantage of the waterproof capability, I was able to trim, shave, and clean up while shampooing and conditioning my locks.  With another flick of the thumb, you can open the trimmer compartment and wash out all the hair clippings so it&#x27;s ready to go for the next manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and will be disposing of my old trimmer and razors.  The Gillete Fusion ProGlide 3-in-1 Styler has taken care of all my grooming needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer for a few days now after receiving it through a  free promotion put on by Gillette. I have thoroughly enjoyed the different features that the power trimmer provides and think that the razor does just as good a job if not better than the previous power razors i&#x27;ve used before.  It is small, light, has four different settings between the razor and beard/facial/body hair trimmers and it does a great job.  I would highly recommend someone try this new device if you&#x27;re looking for something that offers you more than just being a razor.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer works great!! I wasn&#x27;t to sure if it would work very good at first and I was proven wrong. It&#x27;s performance is amazing the blades were nice and sharp and gave a very nice close clean shave. All the other products I have tried cannot compete with this one. I was fortunate enough to receive a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette. I would definitely keep this one and use it time after time again. Anyone who is nervous about getting this and not sure if paying for this is worth it I am telling you now it will not disappoint!</li>
    <li> Husband loves this product! He had no problem using it all over his body...face, sideburns, hairline.  It literally did glide over the suface of his skin, no bumps no nicks!  It gave him the smoothest shave he has ever had.  Well worth the price as it is versatile to use all over the body, and I even tried it myself.</li>
    <li> I was given a free trail of the razor from a program by Gillette. I really enjoy the product. It is great for trimming facial hair and giving a clean shave. It works well on body hair and arm hair. It is a great combo razor and I recommend it to anyone.The only down fall is that you do have to use the straight razor to have a smooth face.  The blades give a smooth easy shave on my face. I do not have much of a beard but it does help trip under my arms and my chest hair. It does the job well and I have thrown away my 2 other trimmers because of the proglide styler. I even bought one for my brother. Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> I have a much larger beard and mustache trimmer that is charged using a power cord.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler has as much power as my larger trimmer.  The Proglide Styler has much more precision because it is so much smaller.  The Proglide Styler is the first trimmer I have found that allows me to trim the area beneath my lower lip without having to practically shave it off.  This allows me to keep a much neater appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that it only comes with 3 guides for the trimmer.  My goatee is blonde and to keep my chin from just looking dirty I tend to keep my goatee a little longer so the hair is darker.  The longest guide still trims my goatee shorter than I normally like but this length will be good in the hot summer months not to mention it keeps my face cleaner and neater which the women in my life prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is great, it functions just like my Gillette Fusion Proglide Power which is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  Day in and day out I&#x27;ll still use my Proglide Power to shave but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use the Proglide Styler to shave.  When I travel it will be the only thing I take.  No longer will I have to pack a razor and a beard and mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old beard and mustache trimmer is about to wear out so I&#x27;ve been looking for a new trimmer and I had been leaning towards the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler powered by Braun.  I figured any styler tied to Gillette and Braun had to be good and it is!  I lucked out and was able to get a Proglide Styler for free through a program run by Gillette but it only confirmed that I was leaning towards the right styler.  Even with the guides trimming my goatee a little shorter than I prefer this is without a doubt the best styler/trimmer I&#x27;ve used in the 16 years I&#x27;ve had a goatee.</li>
    <li> Received this product from a program ran by Gillette. I loved it! The trimmer cut right through my thick facial hair, and the styler made my goatee look great! I especially like the fact it is shower friendly. My wife always complains that when I shave it makes such a mess. No mess this time! Great product Gillette! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer for free from Gillette and I really like it. It is small enough and compact enough to sit on the counter. It comes with an organizer for all of the parts which is convenient. I used the trimmer to trim my beard. I also used the blade portion to shave off my mustache. It was the best shave I have had in a long time. the Edging Blade did a wonderful job of making my beard look neat and clean. My wife even tried the blade portion to shave her underarms and she said it was better than her blades she is using now. It contoured to her underarms and was a very close shave. This will be a good trimmer for traveling because of it compact size. Overall, I still prefer my old trimmer but will keep this one for traveling purposes and for the Edging Blade. The Edging Blade worked better on this trimmer than on my old one.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Style Power Trimmer I received free from Gillette. I used it to trim the hair that grows on the back of my neck between haircuts. I have tried attachments on razors (manual and electric), but they are harder to maneuver and are usually not easy to hold. Even though this trimmer also has a shaver head, it has a substantial handle that is easier to hold and control. The process was much faster and easier than anything else I have tried before. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the results were not as clean as I would have liked, which I can easily take care of with the shaver head.</li>
    <li> I am pretty impressed with the trimmer.  I had received it as part of a free campaign from Gillette and probably would not have purchased it otherwise.  I have used the combs to trim my sideburns since I really not like when they become bushy.  After testing the 3 sizes I liked the #1 since it kept them nice and short.  It is easy to maneuver and seems to be just the right size.  I am very happy with the trimmer and will absolutely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This was good for trimming my facial hair. I did not see a need for the additional clips but that could be due to the fact my hair is so short</li>
    <li> I grow a lot of hair, all over, and this trimmer really does a wonder for my manscaping. I has a nice cut to it and doesn&#x27;t pull on the hairs as you trim. I would fully recommend this to all my guy friends. The only downfall is thay it tends to eat up batteries pretty quickly.This product was given to me for a promotion by Gillete.</li>
    <li> Recived this as a promotional item.I love the added on trimmer that the razor came with. Thats about it.  The blades to refill still cost a fortune. Hence the reason I stopped using these long ago. Never been a fan of the multi blades, They clog easily.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer was fine for trimming beards and Goates.  Will need to lube it up after every few cleanings as typical with trimmers. Seems to have enough power to get through my beard!!!</li>
    <li> GILLETTE is the only brand that anyone can ever think off. There is no match for this razor, very smooth. Light and totally safe to use in wet area. I received a FREE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER POWER TRIMMER tat was provided via a program run by GILLETTE. The blades are what actually make these razors special. I have very sensitive skin and the razor does a great job...but the replacement blades are bit expensive but it is worth the investment. When it comes to shaving the fit, thin, fine Fusion ProGlide Power Blades gives you the most clean comfortable shave. The Edge Blade that u can find in the back of the cartridge helps you to make crisp and defined lines and good finished looks. GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER POWER TRIMMER come packaged together in an organized case this ll help u to store it organised n r always on hand.u can see in the pic i uploaded. From ur facial hair style like chinstrap or clean shave or a goatee  to styling your chest, back, underarms or ur groin  you can make it look its best. i ll deffinetly stick to this... n i suggest tat every one should hv one of these.&lt;br /&gt;(PS: commenting through my wife&#x27;s account ;).. )</li>
    <li> I received my Gillete Fusion ProGlide Styler Trimmer as part of a programm run by Gillete. When I first saw it, I thought the packaging was good and I could see the parts that made the whole trimmer. I like the setup and stand of the trimmer as it doesn&#x27;t take much space in my bathroom. The trimmer is easy to handle and comes with three exchangeable combs that I thought were fantastic. The combs are easy to put on and take off. The first time I used the trimmer was in the shower. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but found that the trimmer performed well when I used it to man-scape. I am not a very hairy guy, but I do like to keep things tidy and the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Style Power Trimmer is in my opinion a great tool to do any kind of grooming I might need in the future.</li>
    <li> So a couple days ago I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free to try and let everyone know what I thought.  At first I was thinking this Power Trimmer looked nice and it is going to do a great job.  Well I was wrong after trying it a couple of times it was not all that it was cracked up to be.  I was trying to trim my side burns to make them nice and neat and it took forever, the trim didn&#x27;t work that great.  The Power Trimmer does come with three attachments that are  different sizes which is a nice feature but like with the trimmer they didn&#x27;t work that well.  I would not spend my money on this razor till Gillette can make it better.</li>
    <li> I cant say how wonderful this product is. Totally worth the cost for what you get and the quality of the shave/trim is flawless. Comes with the battery installed and trim attachments as well as a convenient stand and Fusion Blade. I obtained this through a Gillette test program and am very pleased. This product exceeds my expectations. Ive been using Fusion products for years and this is just another I plan to keep in my bathroom arsenal. The styler glides across your face literally. No pain or pulling when shaving. You get a quick smooth shave in less than a few minutes. Literally with a fresh cartridge you can shave even a large amount of facial hair within moments. The trimmer is quick and easy to use. The size of the product in your hands appears big but is actually a comfortable size considering many men have large hands like myself. Battery replacement is quick and easy with a twist of the bottom part or the styler. only uses one battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I was thankful to be provided this razor through a program run by Gillette! The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer has been by far my favorite razor I have ever tried. The Power Trimmer has a great contact with skin; gliding along, tackling any stubble in its way without tugging, scraping, or causing irritation. The ability to use it in the shower was what made me excited to use it. The attachments allowed me to keep my look clean and fresh with touch-ups between shaving. I was more than thrilled to try this and will definitely keep using this product! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was provided a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer to try out via their program and I have to say I am pleased with the results. The trimmer is an excellent choice to pack in my dopp kit as I travel quite extensively. I have to be honest and say that I would not use this regularly at home as fit a shaved it is a little bulky and I prefer a straight razor but I love it as a travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The best use for the trimmer is of course as a personal groomer because in this day and age man scaping is a must and overall more hygienic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this a 4 out of five simply because it&#x27;s not the ideal size for shaving but it&#x27;s still effective.</li>
    <li> When Gillette provides a program which provides any of their products free it&#x27;s a good idea to take that offer. First thing I noticed was how easy the packaging was to open, no hassle there. All of the pieces including it&#x27;s stand were easy to pull out and put together. I like the easy access of it all, the stand also fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet. Another bonus was it comes with the AA battery it needs, ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips are easily put on and taken off the trimmer. And everything just needs to be rinsed and put back into it&#x27;s place. Another cool thing about the trimmer is it&#x27;s shower safe, no problems with water contact at all. I also use it to trim around my ears when I buzz my head as clippers don&#x27;t work very well around them. Overall I&#x27;m quite happy with the Fusion Proglide Styler and would definitely recommend it to fam/friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer and razor combo for about 3 weeks now and I am never going back to the old ones. In fact I can&#x27;t...I threw them all out! My wife will tell you this is the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and the trimmer glides through my semi-curly thick beard with ease. Get one if these.....you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> So I regularly use disposable blade razors.  Until now I have always used disposable razors as I have had the best results with them.  Powered shavers, mesh and rotary style have always aggravated my face and neck, usually from the cut being too close resulting in ingrown hairs and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was leery of using the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power trimmer because of those past experiences.  So far, the trimmer works great, the attachment combs for body trimming work very well and the ProGlide&#x27;s Power blades give a great shave and I have yet to have irritation.  The rubberized water proof unit looks great and is easy to hold and use.  The vibration function during shaving enhances the shave resulting in a shave not too close to cause irritation, but just enough to leave smooth skin.  The disposable power blade heads also have a sharp defining blade at the very top for fine tuning your style.  Many thanks to Gillette for letting me try and keep (for free) the unit they sent me to try out.  Very generous and this goes a long way to expose new customers to their products and keep loyal ones.</li>
    <li> The ProGlide Style Power Trimmer had a tall order ahead of it. Thankfully, it held up very well. I took it against a full, weeklong beard and it managed to hack through with nary a fuss, precisely and consistently. I usually would not even give a battery-powered trimmer a second look, but because I was looking for something I could use in the shower, I decided to give it a shot, especially because Gillette was offering them through a special program. I took the trimmer for a round against my underarms and again it performed amazingly and comfortably. The only gripe I really have is against the packaging, but, what package is actually easy to open?</li>
    <li> Now this is the trimmer I have been waiting for.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the size it fits perfect in my hand. The weight of it is just right. The trimmer is the right size for most areas, even the ears. I can get it wet I can do all my trimming right in the shower and wash right off.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for the mustache and around the mouth. The guards work well for the eyebrows. I keep my beard short so this is perfect, but I couldn&#x27;t see this working on a thick beard... it got a bit stuck on my thick chest hair when I tried that area out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this trimmer that I received to try out through a program run by Gillette, now I don&#x27;t have to drag out the big trimmer, untangle the cord and plug it in, this does it all.</li>
    <li> I was surprise how well this trimmer worked. I was not pleased with the cheapness of the plastic trimmer guards. I think they could be better. It is a good trimmer to take with you if you travel and need a touch up trim while away from home.</li>
    <li> After receiving the FREE razor via a program by Gilette, I could not wait to use it.  I have been thinking about contouring my beard, and after using this, I am glad that I waited.  It was so easy to use, and it literally glided over the contour of my face.  I am so impressed with this product, I have already started telling my friends and family about it.  This would make a great gift for any guy looking to sculpt their beard quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that I wish it was electric instead of battery operated.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free of charge via a program run by Gillette. This product is not meant to be at the same level as a barber shop, but it does get the job done to handle areas that need to be cleaned up. It is small and compact and can easily fit in any storage area of the bathroom. The compartments for all of the clips and additional razor make it easy to access and not lose them. The design of this item is second to none and looks like a 21st century product. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice tool to have to assist in men&#x27;s grooming needs.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Like all the things that it can do. Would like it to be easier to switch blades and also easier to clean. Should come with a cleaning tool also. Great close shave and very gentle on face. Gets hair to be nice and smooth and also trims very well. I would tell my friends to buy this. Very powerful. The one thing i dont like though is how fast the hair gets stuck in the blade and then it is harder to cut or trim your hair after that happens. I will give the product 4 out of 5 stars. The container it comes it i would also like different as it is very difficult to get the blades in and out of there and also very hard to put everything back in nice and neat. Maybe switch to a little travel bag. You would want to know that this shaver works great on every part of the body and you are not limited to what parts of the body you can use it on.</li>
    <li> I was able to try a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer Set through a program run by Gillette. I really enjoyed using this shaving and trimming system. I like how it comes with a variety of different attachments for so many different purposes. I also like how it comes with it&#x27;s own stand to hold everything in quick and easy reach. It is small and takes up only a small area on the bathroom counter. The grip is nice also. Doesn&#x27;t slip and slide while trimming.</li>
    <li> I would recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 3-in-1 to anyone who is looking for that easy on the go quick touch up. It has 3 different size attachments that are easy to pop on and off with the convenience of just a regular razor as well. The only thing I would say thats bad is the attachments dont sit very will in the holder but other then that! nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> I love this styler. It was sent to me free by a program sponsored by Gillette. I have a lumberjack beard and I do like to keep it all one length for my wife. It didn&#x27;t pull or rip any of my facial hair out like most trimmers I have tried. I also like that it has a razor on it so I can clean up around my neck. It did a very nice job and I have told my I ends and family all that they need this styler. Great job Gillette!</li>
    <li> After my previous trimmer broke I saw the commercial for the The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. I liked the versatility of being a trimmer, edger, and shaver! I got the The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer and was immediately impressed by the storage stand that is actually functional, unlike ones I have received with other products. I was also thrilled that it included a free razor provided by a program through a Gillette progam.&lt;br /&gt;Being Greek I am naturally very hairy and maintaining a fresh look was very burdensome, and not something I ever looked forward to. After using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer I actually enjoy grooming. The razor provides a smooth close shave that goes through the thickest of hair and those trouble areas like a hot knife through warm butter.&lt;br /&gt;With the three different size guards makes it quick and simple to maintain side burns. I never have to use a comb and scissors, or have them look like bushes on the side of my face again. The edger provides me that polished look by allowing me to have sharp straight edges. The trimmer is also wonderful for that unsightly back hair, while keeping my chest hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am exceptional happy with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer and recommend it to anyone who always wants the fresh sharp look.</li>
    <li> The fusion proglide styler and power trimmerhas made shaveing so easy. I am transitioning from the militarycand finally can grow out my facial hair. This styler has made it easy to keep it looking neat. I was not a huge fan of the actual razor atatchment but with the styler I can trim it down and use my fusion proglide to painlessly transition from having facial hair to being perfectly clean shaven. And I got it free from the Gillette program</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was the best razor I have ever used it trimmed the 1st go around with precise detail. The ProGlide Styler is super convenient to carry on trips. I was given the free razor as a program run by Gillette to try and I would buy one to give as a gift or to use for my own personal use.</li>
    <li> Recently I was selected to receive a free Gillette Fusion ProGlider Styler Power Trimmer for testing and wondered how I&#x27;d use this new device, since I don&#x27;t do stubble, mustache or \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;. However, over this long holiday weekend I gave up shaving, and then I found the value in the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. In no-time I was able to trim the stubble, shape up the sideburns, and even trim the unwanted hair that seems to sprout from the ears and nose as we men get older. Next came the time to test the blades, and it was effortless and smooth. I&#x27;d been a longtime electric shaver man because of sensitive skin. This new Gillette has changed the way I view shaving with a blade. The Gillette Fusion ProGlider Styler Power Trimmer is a great new device I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this product free but as soon as you see all the accessories of the ProGlide you cant help but think of the many things you can do. We all need razors so to have that as an extra feature makes storage even better. The vibration almost makes the hair stand up so you get a fast clean shave. The combs allowed me to trim my sideburns and slowly blend in to my fade so that it looks like i have a professional touch up. Take the comb off and get a quick edge up. It is all stored nice and neatly. Its also not big so it fits in your hand and can get small corners with ease. I LOVE my ProGlide and have since bought the aftershave and shaving cream. This product will not disappoint you in one bit.</li>
    <li> Try something like this for the first time, and it was pretty easy to use. Gillette has some good products and I&#x27;m for going to keep looking into every single one</li>
    <li> After Gillette&#x27;s program provided me with the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer, I just had to try it out. I must say that it is an excellent addition for my grooming needs. The trimmer gave me a close shave, while still leaving just a little stubble for a manly look. The blade guards allowed for me to leave just a little more when desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent trimmer for smaller areas. The trimmer is just a bit too small though for larger shaving areas. Although it took just a little bit longer, the shave was still exactly as desired and the results were great!</li>
    <li> This product is mind blowing from Gillette. You would definitely need to buy this because,&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, convenient and cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, its compactness and size.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, the amazing experience with trimming and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Total payback for what you have spent, actually more than that!</li>
    <li> Gillette was kind enough to provide me with the new Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer and normally I don&#x27;t write reviews, but this time I felt compelled. If you&#x27;re looking for a low cost, versatile, effective, and simple solution to male grooming, then this is what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Small, lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- Handles trimming head or body hair&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with an attachment for shaving&lt;br /&gt;- All-in-one device that is just as effective as separates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t trim as close as specialized trimmers, but the price makes up for that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall fantastic product that I&#x27;m excited to have because I can keep this at home and bring it with me traveling just as easily. Keeping track of different razors and devices is annoying, this allows me to keep everything in one place that handles everything I need from shaving for work or manscaping for a date..</li>
    <li> The gillette fusion proglide trimmer and razor is a very good product!! The battery last a long time on the trimmer and is a precise grooming tool! I was able to shave away unruly body hair with ease!! The razor gets a close, smooth shave as well! I would highly recommend this product! It is a whole lot better than expensive razors on the market.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver from a campaign by Gillette and was excited to use this product. It works flawlessly! The high quality razors with the power feature make this a very comfortable and clean shave. Also, the trimmer with added combs make it very easy to shape your facial hair to however you want! This is a great shaver system, and you wont be disappointed if you spend the extra money on it. This shaver can do it all, and it won&#x27;t let you down!</li>
    <li> So, I just got the GILLETTE® FUSION® PROGLIDE STYLER through a program run by Gillette! I knew it was coming in the mail, so I did the unthinkable... I grew out my beard against the will&#x27;s of my wife! For two weeks, my wife bugged me to shave, but I told her I had something coming in the mail. When I got that box in the mail, I was a kid at Christmas! I immediately opened it and looked at all 4 parts.. immediately it had begun, my body was a piece of art!&lt;br /&gt;I made several shapes and designs in my beard with the guard/trimmer and slowly my beard dwindled. My wife did not like the designs so I used the razor for a nice, smooth, clean, baby face. Apparently, I loved the trimmer so much, my wife called me \\&quot;metro-sexual.\\&quot; I did not find any flaws with this new styler. I have mentioned this to several of my hairy friends and my wife has too. I will continue to use Gillette products. They had me at &#x27;Hello.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I really liked that this came with a trimmer attachment.  This is a great shave and a great trimmer.  Trimmer works great with any part of the body.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving and because of that I usually only do a few times a week with the cheap disposable razors. If it&#x27;s going to itch and burn anyway I always preferred not to spend 10 bucks on a razor blade. But on the other hand I can&#x27;t stand more than a few days growth without it getting itchy and irritating. I got this product for free through a Gillette program and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The fusion razor blades work great if it&#x27;s a smooth shave you&#x27;re looking for. I&#x27;ve used them in the past, but didn&#x27;t continue with it because of price. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the vibrating razor so that doesn&#x27;t do it for me. What does it is the trimmer. I don&#x27;t keep much facial hair, no mustaches or beard or anything, but by using this trimmer on my entire face the result I get is a look of about 1-2 days of stubble. Perfect length that it&#x27;s not irritating, but short enough I can still get away with it in the corporate world. The razor is now for special occasions and this trimmer will take care of 99% of my grooming from now on. If this one ever wears out I&#x27;ll buy another that same day.</li>
    <li> As part of a promotion from Gillette I received a free ProGlide Styler. This Styler is the only Trimmer you would need to Look and Feel Great.I love the feel it Glides around my face to give me a Quick and Clean cut. This Styler is very easy to use. The best thing about it is that it comes with 3 trimmers for all types of face hair needs.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler for the past week, and since I am not a particularly hairy person have had no need for the styling features of the razor. However, I do have some comments about the razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Feels good in one&#x27;s hand, is very comfortable to hold and easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Produces a slightly smoother, closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;No need for any beard softening procedure (hot towels, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Reduces shave time slightly.&lt;br /&gt;Can use less shave cream for excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;Reduced chance of nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Assuming a 30 day life to the blades, the razor is twice as expensive per shave as the TrackII which I have been using prior to this.&lt;br /&gt;The cost to benefit ratio is poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Because of the high cost of replacement cartridges, In my opinion, this razor cannot compete with Gillette&#x27;s other products, and when the present power cartridge becomes dull, I will not replace it. I will return to using Gillette&#x27;s Track II razor, which I find more than adequate.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very handy, all in one tool. I wouldn&#x27;t consider my facial hair to be high-maintenance (typical goatee) but I will definitely be keeping it neater with the easy access to all the tools at once. Usually I shave daily and only trim on an as-needed basis with the electric trimmer, but if you have more ornate facial hair or like it well-kept, this is a must-have tool. Only negative I found was the handle is longer and larger than a typical disposable razor, so it takes a little bit of time to get used to when just using the razor. But I&#x27;m sure that will go away with more use.</li>
    <li> May 28, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler and found it very easy to use. I have very coarse facial hair and the styler trimmed it very easily. It has 3 different setting caps for the length but the handle is too thick. It was very cumbersome to try and shave holding such a thick handle. There is enough storage for the trimmer heads when they are not being used. Overall I liked the close, smooth shave. The trimmer trimmed my mustache and beard easily.</li>
    <li> This styler was provided via a program run by Gillette and when I first held it, it felt super comfortable.  I do have slightly larger hands than average but the rubber grip made it better than all the other trimmer/stylers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming tools and attachments were very nice.  I needed a haircut but had no time so I used this and this worked out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the razor attachment is why I like Gillette razors.  It was smooth and not irritable like most other razors I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This kit provides a smooth shave and convenient access to accesories for trimming my facial hair and side burns. It will replace several other things that I will not be using any more. Thank You Gillette for including me in this campagne. The only thing I would change is a place to store replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide Styler free to try and review, through a program run by Gillette. When I got it in the mail, I admit I was a bit weary. It looks rather small and weak. I have a full thick beard/goatee, so I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work well. I was pleasantly surprised though! I used the trimmer to shave my face and it went through my weeklong beard with not trouble. The trimmer comes with 3 guards, so trimming my sideburns and goatee was super easy. An easy pop on of the guard and I was set to go. When I was set to trim my mustache (above my lip and under my nose), I just popped the guard back off and found that it was much easier to maneuver the small trimmer than the normal clippers I use! It was the quickest, easiest shave I ever done. Since I still had time, I decided to go ahead and slip on the proglide power blades, too. I am very happy with the trimmer in it&#x27;s entirety. The attachments make shaving super easy and quick. Glad I got to try this out, I honestly would have never purchased, just by the looks of it.</li>
    <li> I received the Proglide Styler a few weeks ago to try through a program run by Gillette.  I&#x27;m always a little nervous to try new razors because I have very sensitive skin and have run into more than a few problems with new razors over the years.  For the last 2 weeks I have used only the Proglide Styler and am absolutely in love.  The 5 blades give a smooth, clean shave and I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with my skin.  They trimmer has 3 different length attachments just like hair clippers so I can decide what length I want my beard and keep it looking neat.  My wife loves the results, I even had a few comments at work about how good it looks.  I will absolutely continue using this and I highly recommend that everyone try it!</li>
    <li> I received the razor free from a program with Gillette. The trimmer works better than all the electric razors I have ever used. I love how it feels in my hands too. It isn&#x27;t to beefy or tiny like all the other razors. It has a happy medium girth. The trimmer works great and gets all the hair, it doesn&#x27;t leave any hairs behind. The 3 guards are great. I use the 3 on my side burns and 2 on my beard. I also used the trimmer on body hair, my chest and back, and my side burns, neck, and around the ears. The razor works great like all the other Gillette blades do. Like I said earlier I like the size of the handle better than regular razors. Overall, fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Trimmer as part of a Gillette sponsored trial. I have shaved and trimmed with it for 2 weeks and I think it works well as a shaver and so so as a trimmer. The vibrating shave is nice. The trimmer did the job, just didn&#x27;t get all the hairs first time. I liked that the razor is the same as my normal razor. I don&#x27;t like that the trimmer is not rechargeable.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used a Gillette Fusion manual razor for years with much satisfaction.  I have recently started experimenting with a beard during the cold Southern California winters and when I was offered the opportunity by Gillette to try the Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 Styler for free I decided why not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself works very well and has a design that allows for you to get very close, sharp edges when self trimming.  The 3 additional combs it comes with fit easily to the trimmer and help you keep a consistent length, unless you want to grow it out Grizzly Adams style.  I like the stand it comes with which compactly holds the 3 combs and the razor attachment, but the packaging the Styler came in was a little excessive.  Using the razor attachment was a little awkward because of the thickness of the trimmer.  My shave routine took some adjustment to accommodate the bulky handle.  I&#x27;m sure it would be easy to get used to but I think I will stick with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor, which I have found to give the closest shave.  Finally, it is water proof, which is great for those of us who prefer to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you already have a beard trimmer then this is probably unnecessary unless you want to have everything all in one compact apparatus.  If you don&#x27;t have a trimmer and need one, this trimmer is unbeatable for the price.  The only real complaint I have is that I would like for it to be rechargeable instead of requiring batteries, but it is nice that batteries are included with the initial purchase.  If you have a trimmer but need a good razor, I would recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor (I know it&#x27;s a mouthful).  Fortunately both the Styler and the Power razor work with regular Gillette Fusion cartridges, which are just as good as the Proglide and Proglide Power cartridges in my opinion, so that will save you some dough!</li>
    <li> I love this power trimmer ! Thank you Gillette for giving it free to try! Now I will always buy your product! This trimmer lets me shape my beard up so nice and neat! Thanks best one ever</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the greatest inventions ever. The 3-1 trimmer set is amazing. It leaves my counters in the bathroom free of clutter and it is available for whatever job I might need in the morning. The razor makes it easy to change out the cartridges when its needed and the trimmer is lightweight and free of the cords. Which makes it easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> Although, this was a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette, I would definitely purchase/recommend this product. I have replaced my normal trimmer and razor.</li>
    <li> This razor was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette. I love this product. First time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it left my face feeling. Even my wife would agree. It didn&#x27;t cut my face and shaved/trimmed my mustache and beard area softly and fast. Makes shaving time a lot faster when I&#x27;m on the go since I&#x27;m always so busy. I would recommend this product. Does the job right.</li>
    <li> This was provided to me as part of Gillette Program that they were running for free.  This is a great addition for anyone who deals with facial/body hair and wants to keep it clean.  The trimmer is great for trimming down the body hair and making your chest look smooth.  When you put the guard onto the trimmer you can clean up your beard/any other facial hair.  For me this worked out great!  The razor was my favorite part.  I have always loved Gillette&#x27;s blades and this one was another one I loved.  It gave me a really close shave.  Closer then the ones I have used in a log time.  Overall this is a great quality product to have!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a razor and trimmer this is the product for you! Gives a smooth shave and trims with ease. Has cut down my grooming time tremendously! This is my new favorite razor combo! There is not one bad thing I could say. It is the whole package guys!! I guarantee you will be as happy as i am with this razor/trimmer. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for any part of your body...you will love this trimmer.  Fast and easy to use with the power to trim anywhere on the body so you are summer ready.</li>
    <li> I have tried other trimmer before and none compare to this one. You can shorten your beard and keep it nice and shaped up with this kit. I recommend it to anyone with a beard and anyone wanting to manscape other areas of their body.</li>
    <li> I recently got my Styler through a campaign ran by Gillette. I love it and I use it every day. The trimmer not only allowsyou t chave your face, but it also allows you t keep a more professional look onthe backof your neck and anywher else. The trimmer allows you o pick a length, 1, 2, or 3, to give yu the option on ow you want your beard look.  highly recommed this poduct to everyone looking to maitain a profecional look.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used.  This product is just unbelievable .  The handle makes the shave experience superb,  the power is strong and provides a smooth shave.  The blades are the est I have used.  Overall, this is e first Imelda I have flt impelled to write a review of my shaving experience.  Just great.</li>
    <li> Got this product from Gillette and my husband is trying it out.  He said...Easy to use! Love the way it trims hard to reach areas. My husband is a believer now!</li>
    <li> Finally! A razor made for man-scaping. Gets the job done.  My wife it ecstatic that I do not have to use her \\&quot;personal electronic trimmer\\&quot; anymore. It worked great on the areas I used it (back of the neck and below the belt). Great for men who like to stay neatly trimmed... A little hard to clean but other than that its great. (Product was provided via a Gillette promotion)</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette ProGlide Styler for free through a program fun by Gillette.  I was not let down by the product.  First, I loved the size.  It was too large and bulky in my hand which was nice, especially for those miniscule trimming maneuvers.  The vibration of the blade was fantastic.  It did not pull my hair in the least.  That was the main aspect that sold me on the product.  Many times I used the product in the process of shaving, so my hands were wet.  The grip on the trimmer was sturdy and tacky enough that it never slipped out of my grip.  It was an overall great trimming device!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and I&#x27;ve found it to be perfect for shaping and cutting down beards that are just a little to long for a razor. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it has nice grip so you don&#x27;t drop it. I don&#x27;t use the clip guards but I can see how they can be useful. As all of Gillete&#x27;s products it&#x27;s easy to swap out blades and switch to the clippers. I&#x27;m certainly happy I got item.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is the best grooming product I have ever used! Thank you Gillette for allowing me to try this great product through the free program! I love the fact that you can use one battery operated item to do so many tasks with. I literally cut my hair with it, shave and shape my mustache, and even do my eyebrows with this product ( shaped them to keep them from being so bushy). It is a precise cut and cleans up very easy. I am recommending this to all my friends and family- everybody needs one of these time and space savers!</li>
    <li> I received the power trimmer through a promotion offered by Gillette. Overall, I think this is a great product given its 3-in-1 design for styling versatility. I typically go for a clean face shave and haven&#x27;t had issues thus far with razor burn, bumps, or irritation. Smooth, comfortable glide. Great for quickly cleaning up sideburns. The watertight design is a huge win, and I love being able to take the power trimmer with me in the shower. In my mind, this feature alone makes the product a good buy. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The GILLETTE® FUSION® PROGLIDE STYLER is one of the best portable shavers on the market to date. I took this thing to Vegas and it was a huge lifesaver!!! It never faltered once, and allowed me to keep my facial hair exactly how I like it with little effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Te one downside to the shaver (which may be an issue with just mine) is that sometimes the battery dislodges partially, which causes it to slow down. You can shake it a bit to have it get back in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually received this razor via a program run by Gillette, but had I known about this razor and what it could provide, I would&#x27;ve picked it up a lot sooner.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know I needed the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer until I received one in a free Gillette Program.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my moustache and as an edger. It was easy to handle in the shower and out. I like to stay well groomed, so it&#x27;s good for maintenance,&lt;br /&gt;but I don&#x27;t know how powerful it would be for rough growth.  Anyway, I liked it and will add it to the other Gillette products I buy.</li>
    <li> Gillette ran a program for a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer so I signed up. I found the product to look good in package but it was un-neededly difficult to remove from the package. The razor shaved and trimmer well. the changing of heads seems a little sloppy and will be curious on how well it holds up with time. Also don&#x27;t know how long the batteries will last. Would prefer if it could be recharged. It did shave well and trim well though so it&#x27;s main functions hold up.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer free through a promotion from Gillette, and I am so glad that I did. I also have another trimmer, but will be giving it away or throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette trimmer works great on my side-burns, shaping and trimming. I have always trusted Gillette as a brand, and this product is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to any guy that needs a cool little tool to help maintain his facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;good qality, good value</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer, really quite great.  Only two things I might change about it:&lt;br /&gt;1) I would rather stubble somewhere between the #1 setting and using no trimmer head, but oh well.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is a bit noisier than I might prefer.  I haven&#x27;t heard of any trimmer much quieter, but I am sure they can do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a battery is fine, I haven&#x27;t replaced it yet, and I have had it for 4 months, trimming once per day, or every other day when I get lazy.  The razor head attachment is a nice bonus, for sure.</li>
    <li> I love it. It provides what it promises. Great and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> about 4-6 months ago I purchased a proglide styler razor. After my first very unsatisfactory shave I went out and purchased  new a package of blades, thinking that i had gotten a bad blade with my proglide, Well I was wrong. I tried two more blades and still got a bad sbave with a lot of pulling the beard out rather than cutting it.  I then wrote th Gellette informing them of my problem, never even received an acknowldgement of my e-mail, a few months later I resent the e-mail, again no response.  I finally took the new pack of blades and used them with my old pro glide and found the shave to be excellent( like most Gillette razors.  I did not expect Gellette to refund my purchase price but they could have at  least sent me any razor model that did not pull me beard out by the roots,  Felt like I was using three month old razor that my wife had been using on her legs.  Shaving with the styler was like shaving without water or shaving cream, I mean this razor was a total hunk of junk  or a piece of s***.  I have benn a gillette cutomer sense back in the 50&#x27;s.  No more: Guess , I&#x27;ll look for another brand. I honestly expected a lot more from Gillette  I have had bad products before over the years and most companies go out of their way to resolve the problem,GILLETTE DID NOTHING , DID NOT EVEN A  acKNOWLEDGE MY COMPLAINT WHICH i FILEd DIRECTLY ON THEIR SITE, SO i KNOW THEY HAD TO HAVE RECEIVED IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brock a.</li>
    <li> I do not need any expensive shaving set to have the perfect shave. The Gillette Fusion Proglide does it perfectly at less than half of the price of other shaving sets. I am so happy with it that I have bought a second unit and sent to my brother in London, England, and he is now having the best shave of his life with that unit.</li>
    <li> This product is very comfortable and easy to use, the quality is also very good feeling, but I do not know why this product received when the battery has been installed? !</li>
    <li> Do get this product. It is the most useful grooming tool i have ever bought, a must have for any man.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected but it will do until I find what I am really looking for a trimmer for myself</li>
    <li> Bought this a couple months ago, use it about three times a week. The different attachments are very handy. Would definitely recommend this, its easy to care for and take with you if you travel.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is waterproof and I like the fact it is cordless. I am on Oxygen so it is so much safer to use then a trimmer that plugs in. It is very light and easy to use. It is perfect for trimming my goatee. I am glad I finally found something so easy to use.</li>
    <li> The trimmer comes with 3 attachments of varying lengths as well as a razor attachment. It works well and I have had no issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the clippers of trapped trimmings isn&#x27;t easy and no tool or brush is included,  but this is definitely not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Excellent beard and body hair grooming system</li>
    <li> I have purchased many trimmers over the years. This one is the highest quality for the price. Nice and small for travel as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend after seeing him struggle with trimming his beard. and he loves it.</li>
    <li> it look good but dont work that much. need to improve this product. what they say didnt found like that way.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it lasted a very short period of time. I used it 3-4 times and then it wouldn&#x27;t work. I thought it was the batteries, so I replaced them. It worked the one time then gave out again. I have replaced the battery 4 times thinking... ok it may be the brand of batteries. Nope.... It worked one time each of the times I replaced the batteries. Wont buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is such a versatile personal groomer.  Great with sideburns and hairline trimming.  The clipper attachments are easy to put on and take off, and they adjust the length of the hair trimming very well.  The shave is smooth and close and is not comparable with other shavers.  I like the larger handle; it fits easily in the hand and has a reasonable weighty feel to it.  I am giving it as gifts to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Wow! The idea behind this shaver is so simple, and yet here I am writing how awesome this thing is. Simple to put on the other types of clips on it, as well as the razor top. Seriously, for this price its hard not to get it! Now if only the replacement cartridges were less expensive...</li>
    <li> Awesome...works perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> My second purchase and I gotta say I love this thing.</li>
    <li> The attachments appear to be made from very cheap plastic. While trying to attach setting #3 the small plastic &#x27;hook&#x27; that secures the attachment broke off.  While it did a fairly decent job, I&#x27;m going back to Panasonic, and use this one solely for lightweight travel purposes.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this quite often, this replaced his old one because of a great sale.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd 3-In-1 Groomer from Gillette. The first got a lot of use and broke after an accidental drop. I love how close this gets. It&#x27;s nicer than shaving and even though the head is narrow I can zip through trimming my face in less time than I can with bigger clippers. Not having to plug the trimmer in or recharge it is nice. I have handfuls of rechargeable batteries around the house.</li>
    <li> Good cheap groomer that goes with my razor. Only real problem with it is that the handle sometimes doesn&#x27;t screw back to its original position, allowing water into the battery compartment. But if you are careful you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Got this as a trimmer for various hair, and it works great. The different guides are good for trimming beard/facial hair to different lengths. This is also a great &amp;#34;water resistant&amp;#34; trimmer that runs off of a AA, and has a nice caddy to go with it. If this somehow breaks in the near future, or someone wants something remotely like this, I&#x27;d recommend/buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very good quality of product. You may ask why not 5 stars and I&#x27;m going to tell you. I think there&#x27;s such a waste of paperboard on the box of this item. Is way too big so I disagree with it. I had to pay more for the shipping than the product because of the volume /weight.</li>
    <li> It is easy use and perrty safe. It will shake when turn on, so do not worry about cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Bought this for use as a powered trimmer.  The trimmer is smaller than some in its class.  If you don&#x27;t plan on using this as a shaver (as in razor option with shaving cream), there are better options available that are larger and more powerful yet still not too large.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like about this thing?! The handle is actually big enough to hold easily, and the groomer is great for my beard / mustache. Also, I&#x27;ve had this thing for almost a year, used it daily and it&#x27;s still using the battery that came with it!</li>
    <li> The trimmer is probably good for basic facial use, but it&#x27;s head is too small and not powerful enough for body grooming. It was a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Just the finest styler that I could have hoped for. My new beard is now more professional groomed than before. A must buy for anyone wanting good quality at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I thought the quality would be what I am used to  with Gillette .  Instead you get. A product wrapped on plastic hard than the razor it took for ever just to get it open so I could put together. It would not cut my back hair and more easily took small bites out of the groin area and way it was put together  it is very hard to reach those tight spots.  I have never had a unit that has lefty skin so rash and ache  looking. Within a week I when&#x27;re to the  Norelco wet &amp; dry and it is fantastic much better</li>
    <li> This simple little trimmer works great for an hair facial or body. It cuts through a decent amount of hair with ease and is very convenient to clean being that it is waterproof. It may go through batteries quickly if use daily but for my once a week use the batteries last about 2-3 months which is acceptable for a single AA. The stand is nice as well as the cutter guards, however I typically use it with no guard as the guards are all too long to get a slightly clean shaven look.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face nice and clean...</li>
    <li> Works really well and trims evenly! This was the first trimmer that I used outside of a regular electric razor to achieve the desired &amp;#34;5 oclock shadow&amp;#34; look. For the price, it didn&#x27;t do a bad job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer comes with three different trim guards that keep the hair at desired lengths. As the hair on my face grows unevenly and somewhat patchy, I was able to alternate the guards to different parts of my face in order to achieve a consistent look. It works pretty good for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs off of a double A battery that for me, lasts about 2 to 4 shaves. If you use rechargeable AA batteries, this shouldn&#x27;t be much of a problem. However, it would have been nice if it was rechargeable. I would have paid more for that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is small which is really good for the under the nose area. A lot of the bigger trimmers have problems in that area. I also use it without the guard to thin out the denser portions of my facial hair and find it to be the perfect length for a 5 oclock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need to oil the blades from time to time. Once it stopped and I thought the battery was dead - switched it, and nothing! I thought the razor had died until I tried a little oil on the blades. It had just locked up after the course of a year. Now, it&#x27;s still running just like when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer does get a little clogged in the shower, but overall very nice. Wish it was rechargeable, but at this price It&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> Worked well for about 1 month. I thought the battery was dead, but I put in a new AA and it still does not work.</li>
    <li> the product works great,everything was recieved on time</li>
    <li> My BF LOVES this trimmer. Easy to use and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Works well but its a little small of a head and its a pain to clean the hair out of the inside.  Overall I&#x27;d recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> Worked fine in the beginning, but now, after a few months , it gets stuck through my beard and doesn&#x27;t trim as well. You get what you pay for. My tip for you- get a better quality machine than this one.</li>
    <li> this was a gift and well liked by the person who received it</li>
    <li> Hate shaving with anything else</li>
    <li> traveling set for me.  for the price this is great.  trimmer is on point.  if youre looking to do full body trim i recommend something a bit more powerful but this is great for everyday use for shave and beard trim</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer, although it&#x27;s had some iffy reviews. The razor works well, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it does a good job trimming my sideburns and other areas. I&#x27;ve not tried it with a &amp;#34; serious beard&amp;#34; and suspect it would not stand up well, but it handled my short trimmed facial hair just fine. No issues</li>
    <li> I was a little bit weary about using an 18 dollar trimmer around my goods but this trimmer works great. Just use light pressure and it won&#x27;t ever &#x27;bite&#x27; you. Also the extra guards are good for trimming your sack because there&#x27;s even less chance of getting a &#x27;bite&#x27; from it. All and all a great value, I just wish I could use it on my face now lol</li>
    <li> I generally agree with the positive reviews. The shaving is great but the quality of the product, particularly the power components and trimming guides, etc, are poorly made and don&#x27;t last very long. I honestly can&#x27;t recall how long I&#x27;ve had this. Probably a couple of years. Use once, maybe twice a week as most, and the trimmer head will not stay locked in place; the power works a reduced power, and the guides have easily broken. I love the idea but am looking for another similar product that provides the shaving and trimming capability.</li>
    <li> Razors come in all shapes and sized and I have tried millions. This looked cool and it was for an amazing price, so i tried it and i have had it for months now and it is still freaking amazing.</li>
    <li> I already had one of these and its getting old so was looking for a new one. Absolutely like dealing with Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy and handy couldn&#x27;t wish for anything better. Easy and fast when you want to stay a little bit longer in bed</li>
    <li> This gift was perfect for my dad for Christmas. He is always trimming his mustache with scissors and it irritates hims. Now he can trim it with the cool mini buzz clippers it has. The razor is also great for his sensitive skin so now he doesn&#x27;t have any bumps or nicks after he shaves.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my husband. Terrible product! The only part he uses is the razor! He says everything else doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Don&#x27;t buy! Or just purchase the razor solo. Shave your money! Not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I had the chance to test the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler as a member of trnd.com and my first impression is quite good. Easy handling and clean shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially in combination with the clear shave lotion it´s easy to style your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the price is fair, good quality. negative that you might only be able to use it for your beard, for chest hair etc. I won´t use it.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;test-drove&#x27; one of these a couple years ago when they first began developing the product. I was intrigued when I opened the package (as I had no idea what I would be getting). Then, as I dug into it, I realized it was everything I needed to get ready for work or going out - but all in one package. The fact that I had everything all in one device was magical. The razor blades work just as well as my Mach 3 blades. The trimmer worked as it should. The trimmer worked beautifully, as well. I was very disappointed that I had to return my test item and now I need to buy one for myself. You won&#x27;t be sorry... grab one! :)</li>
    <li> My last trimmer was getting dull so I went with this all in one.  Have not been disappointed.  It shaves and trims well enough.  Not exactly rocket science.</li>
    <li> I have still not used it, because I received 1 of the 3 comb adapters (Comb #1) broken from the teeth. It has been a day already since I sent some packaging feedback and still no response from anyone. I can&#x27;t find a way to file a claim either, I don&#x27;t want to return it I just want a replacement for that specific piece.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;chrome\\&quot;-colored plastic plate with the trimmer blade is *glued* to the main handle unit with a very thin/weak strip of glue.  This thing came loose within a couple weeks and by one month, the chrome plate had come off completely.  The whole thing is very cheap and shoddy.  The light blue rubberlike strip on the razor blades peels off at the sides and actually causes irritation.  The refills are quite expensive too.  Before this I used the [[ASIN:B001MIZMRK Schick Quattro Titanium Trimmer]] which is heavier, made of mostly metal rather than cheap plastic, and 100x better-quality and more durable product.  On the Schick, the trimmer is a METAL plate screwed to the unit with metal screws, rather than plastic &amp; glue on this cheap Gillette.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use. Feels comfortable, easily adjustable, easy to clean, no complaints. Would buy again, Gillette has been very reliable for me.</li>
    <li> Has four heads all interchangeable, they fit into snug slots in the back of the holding case so there is less chance of loss. Easy to use trims and grooms better than those expensive models.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer and it worked well for a couple of months..but started showing problems soon..While trimming, hair keeps collecting near the moving parts, although the booklet says cleaning under running hot water is sufficient, this has not been enough. I am now in a situation where if I open the top and switch it on I can see the motor running well but when I close the top, it doesn&#x27;t work anymore..so something is stuck inside. After annoying stoppages while using it (leading to hair pulling) I decided to call the customer care and complain. They were helpful and offered a coupon to buy a new one, but it takes them 2-3 weeks to send a coupon! That is quite unhelpful (and also backward in the 21st century). How long can it take them to offer a one time use coupon and email it to me. Am I supposed to wait for 2-3 weeks to cut my hair?&lt;br /&gt;(Note: I have oiled the machine, which did not solve the problem)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review after using the replacement trimmer, whenever I get it that is.</li>
    <li> I have used this quire often since it is a very good razor. One of mine broke by mistake and hence I bought this since at Amazon it was on sale.</li>
    <li> very nice  love the price always wanted one great for triming beards etc nice holder, replacement blades are expensive buy it</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very handy. Shipped within two days! Lost a star due to the fact that the machine is slightly hard to clean.</li>
    <li> This worked as described! It shaves everything nice and clean. And don&#x27;t worry about cutting yourself, because the razor has a round shape to prevent that. So no worries when going to those dangerous places!</li>
    <li> Let me first start off of by saying I received this free from a promotion run by Gillette. As far as this trimmer goes it does a really good job. My only complaints are that the trimmer is not small enough for more detailed looks and the handle is awkward. The different combs it comes with that nice too but don&#x27;t use it with out them! I tried it this way and lost a huge chunk of skin! This is an ok product for a beard trimmer but for a more detailed look continue looking for a better product. As for the shaver part it was way to awkward trying to hold this and shave with it. I couldn&#x27;t seem to hold it at an angle I was comfortable with. I like the thinner handle of the PowerGlide over this. Over all not bad but not that good either.</li>
    <li> I was recently given a gillette proglide trimmer through a program put on by gillette I always had issues trying to keep my beard trimmed and the same length. Sobi was given a gillette trimmer and was very pleased it kept eveything the same length and was so easy to use and it looked like a professional did it. I will recommend this product to all</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is a great product in addition to being a high quality facial razor that we have come to know and love from Gillette this unit also combines the functionality of an electric clipper which comes with several different \\&quot;length guards\\&quot;.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer makes maintaining styled facial hair a breeze!  Before getting my hands on this product for free by a program run by Gillette i had to use 2 different products to achieve the same results.  I really do not have anything negative to say about the product other than blades for it will be a bit more expensive than some of the other brands but it is well worth the money for the smooth quality shaving experience it will yield you.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette products for years. I have always found them to be of the highest quality. I do not want to count the number of trimmers that I have owned over the years. ConAir, Remington, Oster, Wahl. I have tried them all. While each product had benefits, I didn&#x27;t find one product that did it all. Gillette has hit the target in that respect. Facial hair, body hair, shaving, detailing can all be handled with the Gillette ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer that I received free from a program by Gillette. The Gillette trimmer operates flawlessly. Coarse or fine hair were no problem at all. Styling my facial hair was a breeze. The Gillette trimmer gave me more control that the larger units that I have used in the past. Greater control results in a much neater trim. I definitely would recommend the Gillette ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received this gillette fusion proglide styler as a gift from Gillette.  I really think this is a great product, love the size, the ease of use, great for taking with for travel. It gives you a great shave, and is easy to trim to whatever style you&#x27;re looking for. All of your trimming needs can be taken care of with this product..can even use in the shower. Definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> First off, I received this through a program run by Gillette. Prior to this, I had thought it would be MUCH better for my face and other parts of my body if I could try this, but the price point turned me off, for one. For the other, it kind of looked cheap and dinky. Upon removal from the packaging, I noticed that it felt substantial. A quick perusal of the literature/instructions reveal it is Wahl technology. They are an old and well known company that makes hair trimmers. The night I got it, I tried the trimmer (without attachment) to shorten my chest hair in prep for a smooth shave. While in the shower, I used the shaving head to complete the job. While I had to rinse the blades more than my usual razor, it wasn&#x27;t a problem. A couple of days later, I used the longest style blade to Overall, I think I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
    <li> First, I have to admit that I got these through a special program from Gillette. I usually use an electric, but wanted to see if this was a better option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product to be a little bit of good with a little bit of bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the trimmer mechanism and I think it&#x27;s a good option for manscaping. It easily cuts through hair and allows for different lengths of hair depending on choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was disappointed by the lack of a great attachment for sideburn trimming. I had to try to use the regular blades to raise the bottom level up on my sideburns, whereas most electrics have really simple ways to trim the sideburns more easily. Since this is a more common task than manscaping, I&#x27;d say that was a miss.</li>
    <li> this free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, and i love it. it gives me a nice smooth shave with the electric open as well. i am very pleased with the shaving results and how smooth it is. i would definitely recommend buying this and it makes a great gift too!</li>
    <li> I was recently given a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette.  I already have a trimmer that I regularly use, but I thought it would be interesting to try out something new.  I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few weeks, and if you&#x27;re looking for a quick recommendation, then I can certainly say that the Proglide Styler is a great and versatile tool.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for an in-depth review, then read on.  As a side note, this review only covers the trimmer even though it comes with a set of Proglide Power Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about the trimmer is how well-built it is.  The handle is larger in circumference than a traditional razor blade but it smaller than most traditional trimmers.  Personally, the size of the handle suits me just fine.  The handle, itself, is covered in an easy to grip rubber.  You won&#x27;t have any trouble gripping and holding on to this trimmer.  In terms of appearance, the blue trim goes nicely with the traditional silver color that comes standard with most trimmers.  The touch of blue might not seem like much, but it makes the product just look sleeker and more expensive.  The trimmer is powered by a single AA battery, so there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of weight to the trimmer although it also isn&#x27;t so light that it becomes hard to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming blades themselves work very nicely.  The head of the trimmer is contoured in such a way that makes it easy to trim your facial hair.  I used the trimmer for my mustache and goatee and had no trouble at all trimming around my lips and shaping my goatee.  The single AA battery provides more than enough power to the trimmer, which allows you to trim and shave yourself cleanly.  As for battery life, I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer every other day for the past 2-3 weeks, and the trimmer is still going strong.  Some would probably prefer a rechargeable battery, and if that&#x27;s the case, then it&#x27;s easy enough to buy a pack of Sanyo Eneloop batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also comes with 3 sets of guards for those that want to clean up their facial hair.  There are some who might have preferred an adjustable guard, but in my opinion, the individual guards are the way to go.  My previous trimmer had an adjustable guard that became unusable after a while because I pressed the guard too hard against my skin.  The individual guards allow you to really do a thorough job of trimming your hair to an equal length.  The largest guard is about one-half to three quarters of an inch, which is perfectly fine for me.  However, if you like to grow your facial hair out longer, then this product won&#x27;t work for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product will primarily be used for facial hair trimming, the fact that it is waterproof means that you can use it in the shower to trim other areas of your body.  I don&#x27;t personally do this, but I can attest to the waterproof nature of this product as well as the well-built guards and strong power of the trimming blades.  If you want to use this product to groom your body, then it will more than do the job provided that you are not looking to trim your hair to a length that is longer than the largest guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also comes with a base that holds the trimmer, guards and the blade (not reviewed here).  The base is made of plastic, but it is sturdy and holds the trimmer and accessories without any problem.  The base, itself, isn&#x27;t very large.  If bathroom counter space is sparse, it still shouldn&#x27;t be difficult to find a spot for the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t really find any flaws with this product other than the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a rechargeable battery.  It is easy to handle, look sleek and performs well.  I was passively looking for a new trimmer to replace my old one, so it was very nice to be able to get a free product from Gillette to try out.  Based on my experience, I will continue to use this trimmer from here on out and would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.</li>
    <li> The styler was good but I think it&#x27;s a little under powered using just batteries.  The replacement blades are also very expensive.  All in all it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer as free product to try from Gillette. While this isn&#x27;t a top of the line trimmer it does a great job for a product in its price range. I am able to get a nice easy even trim without any bumps or irritation. It might not last as long and stay as sharp as some of the higher priced trimmers, but since it is inexpensive it is not a big deal to go out and buy a new one when the trim of this one deteriorates.</li>
    <li> I really liked the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. I used it to trim up my goatee. I also used it to take care of my side burns. It worked well. It took care of my side burns and trimmed up my goatee nicely. I was impressed with the results. This was a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Having received the Gillette Brand \\&quot;Fusion ProGlide Styler\\&quot; from a promotional review program provided by the Gillette Company, I was surprised that such a small package consisting of a several plastic pieces (adapters), a razor and a battery powered handle could make such a difference in the way I groom my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all products, good packaging has to be able to catch the consumer&#x27;s eyes.  From the plastic box that Gillette&#x27;s \\&quot;Fusion ProGlide Styler\\&quot; comes in, you can tell that this is probably going to be an expensive product.  Surprisingly though, it retails for about $26.99 (in my local area) and for the price, it does what it sets out to do very well.  I also liked the fact that the box it came in can also be used to store the set when its not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teaming up with the Braun Company (known for their innovative Electric Shavers), Gillette has designed and produced a product that most men who groom their facial hair can appreciate, especially because of the clever and easy to use design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion ProGlide Styler comes with a powered \\&quot;Styler\\&quot; trimmer handle which doubles as a mini electric shaver (powered by a single cell \\&quot;AA\\&quot; sized battery) as well as the \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; platform in which the \\&quot;ProGlide\\&quot; razor is placed on to.  Also included are three adapters (made of plastic) which can snap on to the \\&quot;Styler\\&quot; trimmer handle to regulate the distance from the user&#x27;s facial hair while trimming, so the facial hair length is evenly cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adapters for the \\&quot;Styler\\&quot; trimmer handle work very well and are designed to accommodate even the thickest, paintbrush like facial hair.  The adapters are numerically labeled \\&quot;1\\&quot;, \\&quot;2\\&quot; and \\&quot;3\\&quot; to indicate the size of the spacing between the trimmer blades and facial hair.  The \\&quot;1\\&quot; adapter is for the shortest setting with the \\&quot;3\\&quot; adapter being for  the longest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my goatee and mustache to be somewhat short but not face hugging, so I was quite impressed when Ifinally received the Gillette \\&quot;Fusion ProGlide Styler\\&quot; for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the different adapters for the \\&quot;Styler\\&quot; trimmer handle, I found that the \\&quot;2\\&quot; setting is perfect for my preferred mustache length and the \\&quot;3\\&quot; adapter suits my preferred goatee length just right.  Switching out the adapters is also very simple and easy to figure out.  Even though the set does not apparently include detailed instructions, anyone with a little bit of technical common sense will be able to figure out how to swap out the \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; adapters in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice part is that once I&#x27;ve achieved my preferred facial hair length with the trimmer, I can then finish the grooming job with the included \\&quot;ProGlide\\&quot; razor which provides a smooth shave without too much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the vibration and sound of the \\&quot;Styler\\&quot; trimmer handle are easy to deal with as it does not vibrate so much as a plug-in electrical shaver/trimmer would so you can easily maneuver the trimmer around your desired trimming areas with precision.  The battery life from a single cell (included in the set and a high quality \\&quot;Duracell\\&quot; brand battery, no less) is also surprising; I was able to get at least a good 6 trimming/shaving sessions in, averaging at about 10 minutes each session before the battery life started to affect the performance of the \\&quot;Styler\\&quot; handle.  It would still cut fine, but you would have to make more passes at the particular area you wanted to trim.  (Always remember to change the battery out once you start to see a drop in performance)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed at this entire set.  Before I had the opportunity to receive a sample set to review, I was already considering purchasing this product from my local big-box store (i.e. Target, Wal-Mart, etc.) simply because I wanted to have a facial hair trimmer/razor that was not only compact but could handle the more precise trimming jobs such as my mustache hair, which a normal razor cannot trim effectively and larger electric shears/razors cannot do with precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette has finally released a product that I am very pleased with.  I will definitely be purchasing replacement razors for the set because everything works so well.  As for the \\&quot;Styler\\&quot; trimmer handle, I can&#x27;t believe that such a great product is available for less than the $29.99 MSRP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Brand \\&quot;Mach 3\\&quot; razors for over 10 years.  Now I guess its time to upgrade to the new \\&quot;Fusion ProGlide\\&quot; razors since they&#x27;re a part of my new favorite facial trimmer set.  Not to say I&#x27;ll give up using the \\&quot;Mach 3\\&quot; razors; I&#x27;ll just use them as my travel razors since they are also high quality razors.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer! Small size, waterproof, long battery life..what more can you ask for.  This is not something to use on long beard trimming, this is for the person that keeps their facial hair tamed and wants to keeps clean lines.  Best thing of all, I received this for free from a Gillette promotion, they gained a new customer, I will continue to use this great little trimmer!</li>
    <li> My Husband received the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free from a program run by Gillette. He says: \\&quot;I really enjoy how it is easy to use and the handle has a firm grip to it. I use this on a regular basis and I would definitely recommend it. It comes with batteries, too, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about finding batteries for it. I will definitely look forward to buying this brand in the future.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> So i received a 3 in 1 styler thru a program sponsored by Gillette for free. I think it is the most amazing thing i have ever received. I also will never but another product again for the amazing price it does everything. its a wonderful trimmer and an amazing razor. This also makes the perfect gift for any man in your family.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler as part of a trial campaign from Gillette.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Usually I use a big, salon style, trimmer for my facial hair, but the Proglide Styler has allowed me to try new things with my beard and sideburns.  The only thing I wish the Proglide had was a power cord.  The batteries become cumbersome after some time.  That being said, the combs are great, the power of the Proglide is great and the styler really makes it easy to shave/trim hard to reach places.  I would recommend this razor/trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a free program run by Gillette, and have used this product for about two weeks now. I own an electric shaver, and don&#x27;t get me wrong - they are wonderful. There are features about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide that warrant a mutual friendship to be had with my little old electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is unique about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide is that it can trim with ease and precision with the different blades it comes with. I did not use any shaving cream (a bad decision, I know) but it shaved around my mouth and nose quickly and painlessly. I like how the pieces are snap-on and disposable, but this did not detract from the overall quality of the product. Think of a shaver that barbers use for your hair with all the intricate pieces to get your style down to the finest detail - yes, that is what you are receiving with this product - a groomer with many different options to fine-tune your hairy bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and would definitely purchase one in the future in addition to my electric shaver  :)</li>
    <li> I was able to get the Gillette ProGlide Styler through a program by Gillette. I was EXTREMELY pleased to be able to try this. Because of the potential cost (I&#x27;ve found it around $35), I probably would not have bought it. I would urge anyone to spend the dollars for this one. What you get is a trimmer/edger that is one of the smoothest trimmers that I&#x27;ve felt. It is definitely not for the most sensitive skin, but any place on my face and neck provided a very smooth feel. There is are 3 different length trimmer attachments that fit on very easily, but they&#x27;re a bit difficult to remove. For my beard, mustache and goatee, it&#x27;s perfect. Then there is the razor, that fits on the trimmer just as the other attachments. The real plus, outside of a very good razor is the combination of a smooth razor and the vibration from the trimmer when it&#x27;s turned on. It&#x27;s an incredibly smooth final product. This is, truly, an all in one product that you can count on for face and body hair management.</li>
    <li> I was sent this razor free to try and review for a program that I am a part of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until now I haven&#x27;t been able to find a trimmer that works well for me but the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 was PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well made and easily interchangeable from regular shaver to mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve given this razor a lot of use since receiving it and am now \\&quot;addicted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Gillette for making a razor that FINALLY passed my tests.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this to try, I love it it is compact, light and easy to use. The best trimmer razor combo I have ever tried!! Thank you Gillette!! I have gotten compliments on how well my beard is perfectly trimmed . I will recomend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I recently was given a free Gillette Fusion Proglide though a Gillette program to get me to test the trimmer. Before getting this product I was skeptical about how well it would work being priced at only around $20 but I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike other discount electric trimmers that I have owned in the past, this did a great job of quickly touching up my facial hair without catching on it or forcing me to go over it several times.  This product is not a substitute for a professional trimmer by any means but it works well for a quick trim every once in a while.  I have never found the add-ons to be that useful but the basic trimmer works well for what I need it for.  It is also easy to transport unlike other trimmers.  It is very small and can easily fit in a travel bag.  I recently brought it on a trip to Florida for a wedding and it work out perfectly.  If you are looking for a quality product but aren&#x27;t willing to shell out over $75 on a trimmer, this is exactly what you need.</li>
    <li> i recived this free from gillette to try and i think it is a great value for a really good trimmer the acctaul trimmer does well for just about anything you to need to keep trimmed up and i really like the razor attachment how ever the razor refills are kind of pricey in my opinion so if all you want it for is a razor i would buy something eles</li>
    <li> I was happily surprised with the results after receiving the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer has really helped me trim unwanted hair on my body that no other razor/trimmer has done well for me. I have had no issues with accidentally cutting myself because of the differing guards that come with the power trimmer and have been pleased that I have not had any razor burn because I am now using a trimmer instead of trying to use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that I have been very impressed with and very thankful that I was able to be involved in this program put on by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I recently received the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE 3 In 1 Styler through a program run by Gilette and after using the non powered version for years I was surprised at home much better the powered version is. It gave a smoother feeling shave, and was a closer shave. It also caused less of an irritation after shaving was complete. I highly recommend it. It was nice having the buzzer to trim my goatee as well. As a man who shaves his whole head I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this Razor as part of a program run by Gillette and I am so happy I got it.  I had no idea I could achieve such professional results at home with so little work.  With three different options to choose from I am guaranteed to get the right cut every time.  I have no stray hairs any longer and I look trimmed up perfectly all the time.  The trimmer comes with its own very nice compact storage for both the trimmer unit as well as the attachments.  My wife has helped me trim up my stray neck hair and she has found it to work wonderfully too.  The unit looks like it would be a littlebit cumbersome to hold but it actually fits nicely into my hand.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about plugging it in and I can achieve these same results in the shower.  I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Product is just what I had been looking for. It is easy to use and keeps my face and chest hair trimmed up great.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free via a program run by Gillette and was amazed! Honestly if I was in the store I probably would have passed over the razor because of the price of the replacement razor heads. I am so glad I got to try this. It&#x27;s worth the price because I can use the heads a few times before they go dull and I get a close shave every time without any hairs being yanked or pulled out unlike disposable razors. The trimmer with the different attachments is a bonus it makes it so easy to get everything shaved with one tool and not have to worry about pulling different ones out of the closet. It literally cut my time getting ready for work in the morning in half. It also helps that you can use it in or out of the shower. I will definitely be sticking with this razor.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have sensitive skin. The proglide was amazing. I used it for shaving and had no skin burn at all. Trimmed my hair with the styler with no problem at all. I will continue to use this product and recommend to everyone. Makes all men care easy.</li>
    <li> This is a very inventive product which I can happily recommend.  While I&#x27;m still not sold on the value of a vibrating razor, everything else about this Fusion Proglide is a great idea.  It is well-designed and easy to clean (just run under the water! My Braun trimmer can&#x27;t get wet...boo!).  The trimmer is weighty and feels good in your hand and the changeable heads are easy to swap out.  Comes with a battery which is nice and the power seems good.  The plastic caddy it comes with is also nice, though the combs jut out the back a little so the caddy won&#x27;t square up again the wall in my bathroom.  Minor issue.... wish there was a comb which was a little &#x27;longer&#x27; as I keep my facial hair about 3/4 of an inch and the included longest comb wants to cut them to about 1/2 an inch.  Again... not a big deal.  All in all a nice product, and its about 20% less expensive than other trimmers AND it works with my standard Fusion razor heads.  Bonus!  FYI, I got this as a free sample to try out... just wanted to mention that.</li>
    <li> the gillete fusion proglider is a nice razor thank goodness gillete sent me mine cause i dont think its worth paying 20$ for it its ok.  The hardest thing was taking it out of the package the vibrating feature was the best part about itit cuts good the attachments need some fine tuning i mean they cut but not great i hope this helps you out.</li>
    <li> I received the unit as a program via Gilette, I gotta admit I&#x27;m impressed.  Sometimes I let my facial hair get long but always prefer to have it clean shaven.  It&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s pretty much an all in one unit, no more switching for me!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t been looking for a product like this. So, if I had not received it as a free promotion run by Gillette, I would not have thought to search for it. Now, I won&#x27;t travel without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I frequently travel on business and speak at conferences. My appearance is important. I always pack both a razor and a trimmer. Carry-on bags get heavy and tight on space. I&#x27;m always looking for ways to offload weight - even a few ounces. The Fusion ProGlide Styler combines an excellent razor and an easy to use trimmer in one light, compact device. It&#x27;s small, fits in the hand ergonomically and enables me eliminate the weight and reduce the space taken by my old bulky trimmer. Some folks might not think reduced weight and space are a benefit. But, frequent travelers will understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer for sideburns, I don&#x27;t know how well it will work elsewhere. But, it&#x27;s a lot easier to maneuver than other bulkier trimmers I&#x27;ve used. Finally, its worth mentioning that I had been using the most recent Gillette razor and thought the blades were pretty good. But, the new blades they designed for this product are outstanding.</li>
    <li> I received the Gilette Fusion Proglide Styler for free through a program they ran, because to be honest I don&#x27;t have that much facial hair to style in the first place. However once I received it I realized how useful it was for trimming sideburns. The razor attachment also allowed me to replace my current razor. All in all a great product that I will continue to use!</li>
    <li> After being sent a complimentary Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette. As soon as I received the product, I immediately tried it out. To my dismay I discovered that while the item itself is easy to hold, waterproof, and portable. The trimmer is not something you would use to shave your whole face. If you are looking for something that is on par with similar items, you might want to go with another option. It may be just me, but I found that it didnt appear to shave my facial hair all that easily. I suspect it has a lot to do with how far the trimmer blades extend beyond the base. I do not think I should have to press it so close to my face in order for it to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if I am just trimming my eyebrows back to something manageable or evening up my sideburns, the device is perfect. Overall, it is a good budget trimmer for the average consumer.</li>
    <li> I got my Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-in-1 Styler FREE! through a program offered by Gillette, and the styler features out perform my old Shick by miles!  The multiple length guide comb attachments let me manage my beard and sideburns to perfection..more length options means no more settling for the wrong length.  I&#x27;ll be buying the next one without hesitation!</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough in receiving Gillette Proglider Styler via a promotional program sponsored by Gillette. After close to a year of sporting a full scraggy beard, I was looking for purchasing an electrical shaver. Little did I know how expensive they run. Purchasing an investment of $70 just to use it once and keep it stored,for somebody like me who sports a clean face (I will let you know later the reason for wearing the beard), it did not come to pass. Thanks to Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler two things I was able to accomplish: 1)getting help with the Braun engineered power shaver, I got the heavy part of beard off. 2) a practical buy since once shaved I continue using the proglide razor ever since.&lt;br /&gt;I dedicate this review to Mother whose passing away have left a scar that time itself is not enough to heal.</li>
    <li> I wanted this product for right after I seen the first commercial for it but wasn&#x27;t sure if i should spend the money because I didn&#x27;t know if it would work like I thought. I ended up receiving it for free from a program supported by Gillette and I love it. It gets all the little places on my face that a regular razor can&#x27;t get and makes well edges.</li>
    <li> I can not tell you how long I have been looking for somehthing like this the trimmer is run by battery insted of a cord I am a truck driver and sometimes you just don&#x27;t get time to charge and extra batterys are easy to carry Love the fact it can shave live a real razor and trim also I have been using almost a month and have not used the life of the my batterys yet great product way to go Gillette. (I am a guy it just logs in under my wife)Recived this product FREE via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> The price for this trimmer is incredible! While I was given this razor to try by Gillette, I would have spent the money to try. The Fusion pro glide was easy to handle, trimmed neatly, and the blades left me perfectly trimmed. It is so easy to use and you cannot beat the price. I have had more expensive trimmers that have not done as good of a job as this one by Gillette--no nicks, cuts, or bald patches!</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It&#x27;s perfect for trimming my beard/sideburns, and works really well in the shower too.  I like how you can also use it as a razor by adding on the the cartridge attachment.</li>
    <li> I was given this product by a program to try.I was very surprized about what a clean. neat trim,it does. i love the holder for it, very easy to use, i really enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler for free from Gillette in a promotion and I absolutely love it!! It fits PERFECT in my hand and is extremely easy and comfortable to use.  The attachments are a snap to interchange and it is not noisy so I can use it in the morning when the rest of the household is asleep and it doesn&#x27;t wake them.  I will now use nothing but this handy, protable styler by Gillette...my favorite company.  Thank-you for my styler!!</li>
    <li> By far, this is the very best razor/styler I have ever owned. A month in, the razor head is still giving me a smooth shave from cheek-to-cheek. The supplemental heads for altenative \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; have also proven quite reliable, as my fiancee has kept the back of my neck tamer than any other time since we&#x27;ve met. Having so many tools in one device has been the absolute epitome of convenience. I have tried to find a flaw with this device, but have continually come up short. If you&#x27;re on the fence, BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I was happy with the product. I received it free through a program run by Gillette. I liked how it came with the razor attachment but wish it came with longer guards. As for the quality and make it has a very sturdy and long lasting quality. I&#x27;m happy that it wasn&#x27;t all plastic and provided a solid close shave. I like the option of only using one tool for all my facial shaving needs but again I wish it had longer guards on it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a great price!  When using the blade I was given a fantastic close shave.  When I used the styler, I was able to trim my beard to the level I liked.  I would recommend this to all of my male friends!</li>
    <li> I found the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler to be a very handy and convenient product for men like myself. I used the product while traveling and periodically used it to touch up my facial hair. I like the fact that it&#x27;s cordless and very light weight. I like that you can change the combs and decide whether to have thick or close beard. It was a pleasure using although I found the edging blade did not provide the accuracy that I had anticipated. The product and all of its attachments including the stand, combs, and organizer are stylish and essential.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free through a campaign run by Gillette. I specifically wanted the styler for &#x27;manscaping&#x27; (trimming body hair) and it works phenomenally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One aspect of the kit I really like is that the styler is waterproof and quiet. I was worried that people would be able to hear me trimming in the shower, but with the water running I was barely even able to hear it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought the attachable razor head was a little odd, but after using it I really like it. It is very smooth and the thicker handle is easier to control and feels sturdier in the hand than a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and I&#x27;m happy that I got it.</li>
    <li> Okay. I received this free razor provided via a program run by Gillette with no other incentives.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the razor and the integration of their blade was smart.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy for me to edge my beard and have a smooth shave where I didn&#x27;t want my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately- IMO- There aren&#x27;t enough sizes for the beard trimming (only comes with three). My hair isn&#x27;t thick enough to look good using the biggest size.&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is that I can use fresh blades for the shave- even if I was coming from the Proglide razors. (They are different colors but they still fit ;] ).</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I deliberately did not shave for two days to give this Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler a run for its money and it passed the test with flying colors it gave me a clean smooth shave. A thumbs up goes to this razor!!!</li>
    <li> First of all, I should say that I did receive this free from a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this package, I was impressed with the compact size of the clear plastic \\&quot;shell\\&quot; it came packaged in.  After fighting with it a few minutes just to get it open...not so impressed.  Once it was open, removing the plastic pieces was also a bit of a challenge.  It is obvious that the pieces were meant to stay in place to look nice through the clear plastic shell, but they are not easy to remove.  After I wrestled the stand out of its shell, things made a bit more sense, and the little guides fit easily into slots in the back of the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially impressed with the look of the trimmer itself...it is sleek, with a very attractive black and blue color scheme...kind of futuristic, if you ask me.  It feels heftier than one would think, with a good \\&quot;rubbery\\&quot; grip that I liked.  However, the power button on the underside of the trimmer is poorly placed; I turned the trimmer off many times accidentally during trimming. When the razor is attached, the whole contraption feels a bit contrived, and is long enough to look silly and feel a bit imbalanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works as it should.  If you&#x27;ve used Gillette multi-bladed razors before, you know what to expect (but as previously mentioned, when attached to the long trimmer, there is a sacrifice in comfort and precision due to the unwieldiness).  The vibration doesn&#x27;t do anything, as far as I can tell, to help with a shave.  It just feels gimmicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this combo really failed for me was the trimmer&#x27;s usefulness.  It really isn&#x27;t powerful enough to shave a thick beard or mustache efficiently.  In fact, it took me about four to five times going over each area to really get most of the stray whiskers to the same length.  When I passed the trimmer through a week&#x27;s worth of beard, the motor slowed down considerably, and one could hear it get lower in pitch as it did so.  One nice thing about the trimmer?  The guides were compact, and rounded, so there was none of the \\&quot;nose-poking\\&quot; that occurs sometimes with long, sharp guides, and I felt that the whiskers on my philtrum were trimmed easier and better than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this product doesn&#x27;t do anything that a separate razor and trimmer would do better.  I can&#x27;t imagine someone buying replacement batteries for the trimmer, or heads for the razor portion.  It would do in a pinch for a weekend away with no grooming supplies, but that&#x27;s the extent of its usefulness.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect little styler to keep my goatee trimmed up!  I love how everything is all neat and compact in the case.  and it is small and very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, i was just using the trim attachment on my electric razor, that that was bulky and never was exact enough.  this does not have that problem.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free via a program from Gillette, but I wish I had known about this sooner.</li>
    <li> Having used it for the past few months here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holding unit: It&#x27;s good, but somewhat weird to have as it doesn&#x27;t hold additional blades. Yet it does hold the additional attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer: It works like a disposable (non-professional quality) trimmer would. I do enjoy the easy cleaning and for the most part I have used it to keep the sideburns in check as well well with the trimmer attachments try to keep the hair in check too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen the spanish version commercial and it advertises it to use as a body grooming tool. Not sure I would but it does seem to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving attachment: It isn&#x27;t horrible and with the vibrations in seems to shave better. Funny thing with this attachment you have in theory a short shaving attachment that will give access to a quick blade shave without attaching it to the main device, for those I am about to get to work late moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good useful device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have been awarded with the Styler Pack from a program that is sponsored by Gillette. I saw this pack already in the store but was unsure on buying it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pack comes with a Plastic Stand that is well designed and fits perfectly into every corner of my shower rack. The Trimmer comes with several add-ons in different sizes. I do shave my Hair every time to a certain length and was happy to see that the trimmer had a add on with the same size. I trimmed the area around my ear after shaving and it looked perfect. The Handle is big and good to grab. All in all, this Product is absolutely amazing. Can definitely recommend this product to everybody who shaves on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> In a nutshell: If you can get it at a good price, buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full review (written by my husband): Gilette Fusion ProGlide Styler: I received this product for free as per a Gilette promotional program. GREAT product, just marketed &amp; packaged wrong. All it is is a nice electric trimmer which they&#x27;ve combo&#x27;d with a blade razor. I&#x27;ve read several books on marketing. It amazes me that large companies with millions of dollars at their disposal continue to make elementary marketing mistakes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake #1: Trying to make an all-in-one product. With rare exceptions, it&#x27;s normally a bad idea. In this case, they&#x27;re trying to dazzle you with a product that \\&quot;does it all\\&quot; rather than separate trimmer and razor tools. However, instead of 2 tools, you now have one base plus four LITTLE attachments that are easily lost. The pretty box is actually cumbersome for storage so you&#x27;d have to find your own special box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake #2: Brand confusion. It&#x27;s a Gilette razor with apparently a Braun trimmer with the Gilette name slapped on it, though it&#x27;s \\&quot;Braun technology.\\&quot; So is it a Gilette or Braun trimmer? And should blade market leader Gilette be in the electric trimmer business?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Problem: They went way overboard with packaging making the product look much fancier than it really is, which 1) means I&#x27;m paying for that packaging, 2) more plastic in our landfills, and 3) VERY DIFFICULT TO OPEN - it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to get the razor part out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakthrough: If you ignore the blunders above, you can actually salvage a terrific product from this kit! My suggestion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Forget the razor blade attachment - just take off the blade refill which you can use as a free blade for the standalone Fusion razor you probably already own (and enjoy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Of the three combs, pick out your favorite length, then put the others in a secure place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Use the trimmer normally. For edging, take off the comb and hold it in your hand while you edge. When done put the comb back on so it doesn&#x27;t get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIMMER PROS:&lt;br /&gt; * Very compact size - I can even edge my mustache easily&lt;br /&gt; * Watertight battery compartment&lt;br /&gt; * Takes only 1 battery + easy to change&lt;br /&gt; * Looks like good price even with all the packaging &amp; razor extras you have to pay for&lt;br /&gt; * Trims/edges well (better than my cheapy generic trimmer)&lt;br /&gt; * Easy to put on/off combs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIMMER CONS:&lt;br /&gt; * Combs are separate (as opposed to a comb with slide-adjustable length) and could get broken/lost&lt;br /&gt; * Confusing marketing (do I tell my friend to purchase a Gilette or Braun trimmer? I&#x27;d probably have to show him a photo of the whole pkg. to ensure he bought the right thing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Yes! It is worth buying - follow the easy 1-2-3 recipe above.</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer through a promotion run by Gilette. I don&#x27;t usually beard, but I found that this trimmer worked fantastically for maintaining my body hair and the occasional trim on my facial hair when I fall behind on shaving. I also like the fact it&#x27;s battery operated so that I don&#x27;t have any cords to get tangled when I have to trim in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a full size \\&quot;barber style\\&quot; trimmer for years.  Small trimmers always seemed to pull as many hairs as they cut, then Gillette sent me this sample to try.  It is awesome! It cuts smoothly and quickly with no pulling, it takes most of the \\&quot;work\\&quot; out of maintaining my hair and beard.  I use it every few days on my head to maintain that fresh buzzed look, so i never look shaggy anymore.  I have already recommended it to my friends and brother and, if this one ever breaks, I will run straight out and buy another!  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I received this ProGlide Styler for free via a program run by Gillette.  The three adjustable height trimmers are easy to snap on and off.  It trimmed/cut through mustache with ease.  The 3 heads make it very easy to use to shape my mustache.  It is very easy to clean and rinse.  Completely waterproof.  The only feature I didn&#x27;t really care for was the razor attachment due to its larger head and I found that the razor head pinched when I turned the vibration on.  The razor head is too large to trim close to mustache and beard. It&#x27;s awkward for a close clean trim next to a mustache and/or beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use a Wahl mustache and beard trimmer (comparable value to this Gillette product).  The Wahl trimmer is much larger and not nearly powerful of a trimmer.  The Gillette ProGuide Styler size and ease of holding is far superior to my current trimmer.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving.  Hate it. This is the perfect product to trim my hair without having to shave everyday.  It comes with different clipper sizes which is great for guys with longer hair, but I didn&#x27;t need to use those too much.  The fact that it comes with a neat little holder to keep everything in is even better.  I have bought trimmers before where you just get a bag to keep everything in and I always lose a piece because it will fall out and I won&#x27;t notice.  This will not be the case with this one!&lt;br /&gt;I was able to grab this for free through a promotion run by Gillette and I am so happy I got this.</li>
    <li> I was recently given a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette.  I already have a trimmer that I regularly use, but I thought it would be interesting to try out something new.  I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few weeks, and if you&#x27;re looking for a quick recommendation, then I can certainly say that the Proglide Styler is a great and versatile tool.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for an in-depth review, then read on.  As a side note, this review only covers the trimmer even though it comes with a set of Proglide Power Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about the trimmer is how well-built it is.  The handle is larger in circumference than a traditional razor blade but it smaller than most traditional trimmers.  Personally, the size of the handle suits me just fine.  The handle, itself, is covered in an easy to grip rubber.  You won&#x27;t have any trouble gripping and holding on to this trimmer.  In terms of appearance, the blue trim goes nicely with the traditional silver color that comes standard with most trimmers.  The touch of blue might not seem like much, but it makes the product just look sleeker and more expensive.  The trimmer is powered by a single AA battery, so there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of weight to the trimmer although it also isn&#x27;t so light that it becomes hard to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming blades themselves work very nicely.  The head of the trimmer is contoured in such a way that makes it easy to trim your facial hair.  I used the trimmer for my mustache and goatee and had no trouble at all trimming around my lips and shaping my goatee.  The single AA battery provides more than enough power to the trimmer, which allows you to trim and shave yourself cleanly.  As for battery life, I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer every other day for the past 2-3 weeks, and the trimmer is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also comes with 3 sets of guards for those that want to clean up their facial hair.  There are somewho might have preferred an adjustable guard, but in my opinion, the individual guards are the way to go.  My previous trimmer had an adjustable guard that became unusable after a while because I pressed the guard too hard against my skin.  The individual guards allow you to really do a thorough job of trimming your hair to an equal length.  The largest guard is about one-half to three quarters of an inch, which is perfectly fine for me.  However, if you like to grow your facial hair out longer, then this product won&#x27;t work for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product will primarily be used for facial hair trimming, the fact that it is waterproof means that you can use it in the shower to trim other areas of your body.  I don&#x27;t personally do this, but I can attest to the waterproof nature of this product as well as the well-built guards and strong power of the trimming blades.  If you want to use this product to groom your body, then it will more than do the job provided that you are not looking to trim your hair to a length that is longer than the largest guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also comes with a base that holds the trimmer, guards and the blade (not reviewed here).  The base is made of plastic, but it is sturdy and holds the trimmer and accessories without any problem.  The base, itself, isn&#x27;t very large.  If bathroom counter space is sparse, it still shouldn&#x27;t be difficult to find a spot for the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t really find any flaws with this product other than the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a rechargeable battery.  It is easy to handle, look sleek and performs well.  I was passively looking for a new trimmer to replace my old one, so it was very nice to be able to get a free product from Gillette to try out.  Based on my experience, I will continue to use this trimmer from here on out and would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try the  Gillette pro glide and I&#x27;m happy to say that I did. The styler trimmer trims everything on my face including my eyebrows evenly. I like that it gives you the option of the different blades. Highly recommend to any man.</li>
    <li> I never thought that I needed a trimmer before, but when I was presented with the opportunity to test one through a program sponsored by Gillette I jumped at the opportunity. I have been pleasantly surprised by the performance of this trimmer.  It&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold, works well both in wet and dry usage and does a good job trimming up my sideburns and neck hair.  I particularly like the attachments which allow you to clean up and maintain the sideburns so they don&#x27;t get too straggly. I honestly don&#x27;t know why I hadn&#x27;t checked into purchasing one of these sooner!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide since it was offered via a free program from Gillette and I have to say I am hooked.I suffer from terribly rough facial hair for electric razors AND sensitive skin so when I went to shave with an electric razor it just got well.. messy. Not anymore..the Gillette is small enough and sharp enough to not beat up on my face anymore, It&#x27;s small and compact and just works great. The attachments are perfect for your \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; needs and it&#x27;s a great travel razor too!!! It will definitely give you the confidence in your look!!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette fusion Proglide power trimmer for free through a program sponsored by Gillette. I was excited to try it to say the least. The only stipulation was that I share my honest opinion of the product after trying it. I do my fair share of Manscaping and normally use a pair of hair clippers for the deed. I was a little skeptical of the size and strength of the power trimmer. I started with my face and trimming back the sideburns. The power trimmer worked wonders, no surprise there, it&#x27;s what I expected. I moved on to the chest and underarms next, this was the area I was concerned about as I have very coarse hair. I used the smallest attachment and was surprised by how easily it made its course through hair. I would almost say it cut as smoothly as the hair clippers i normally use. Couple that with the fact that its smaller, which makes it much more manageable and agile, and I say we have a winner. I will be using the power trimmer for all of face and body hair grooming needs from here on.</li>
    <li> I got the product for free first of all through an outlet through Gilette. I like the product for keeping my goatee trimmed and for general face shaving.  This is a good product for general shaving and trimming.  This would not be one for longer beards like those you see on the guys in Duck Dynasty though.  Overall, I was pleased with the quality of the product but changing razors in these can get expensive.</li>
    <li> got this in a free trial from Gillette.everything you need for grooming,a great razor and trimmer and edger.would highly recommend to anybody.get everything in one package.</li>
    <li> have used gillette in the past, but this is my first time using the styler. it worked great. i was able to precisely style my facial hair to the way i like it. it works better than just trying to use a regular razor, because it allows you to more accurately trim the hair. i got this item for free from a program run by the gillette company.</li>
    <li> Gilletter Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 Styler is the best thing ever. I was given a free one from a program ran by Gillette. I can use it anywhere, home, work anad the gym!! It helps me to keep my mustache and sideburns looking good and I even use it to trim the hairs on the back of my neck.</li>
    <li> Overall the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler pack I received from a Gillette sponsored program is a good product. It&#x27;s durable, easy-to-use and provides all the necessary functions for properly grooming facial hair.  With that said, the styler is geared more for men who don&#x27;t have long facial hair.  I have been growing a beard for the past month now and outside of lining my beard or trimming my mustache I have a difficult time with it.  The shaver is a bit narrow, making it a little more difficult to trim down my beard.  Nevertheless it is a good product.</li>
    <li> The thing I love most about this shaver is its portability.  I take it with me everywhere, and it gives a great, close shave every time.  The 2nd best thing about it is that it is shower safe.  I love to shave in the shower, so this is a win win for me.  I did get this  free razor via a program run by Gillette, but this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this shaver, but it is not very durable as much as I expected it to be, which is the only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very reasonable price, and ultra portable all in in trimmer and shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, and gets the job done very nicely. You can shape your sideburns, mustache, and beard very nicely, and the final result looks very amazing and clean. Also, the attachments are very handy and you can use them as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives you clean and smooth shave even after several uses, and very minimum skin irritation. Blades glides very easily, and makes every shaving experience very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;The head of the trimmer which has some pins inside - breaks very easily after several uses. The blade from the trimmer comes off every time you try to change the head (attachments), which is very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Gillette fixes the problem about the head of the trimmer and this will be great product instead of a good product. Overall, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the product, and look forward to buy another one after Gillette fixes the problem.</li>
    <li> I recieved this proglide styler through a program run by Gillete.  First off the amount of rubber that is used for the grip is great and needed because when i shave or do anything with body shaving im usually in the shower doing it.  So the Grip is great when the hands are full of lather, water ,soap or just sweat.  The use of the proglide itself was great .  It cut smoothly without pulling and the included attachments made everything great.  Like having an expensive shaver but that much more portable.</li>
    <li> Gillette recently gave me the opportunity to test out their new GIllette Fusion Proglide 3-in-1 Styler Special Pack and I was very impressed. I did not expect this razor to replace the larger device I&#x27;ve used for years but it has. The small compact size really makes it easy to control and zip around the face.  There are different head attachments that change the height of the blade but honestly I will never use them.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best features of the razor is that it is powered by a single AA battery. Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I think would improve this product is a traveling case or pack of some sort to take on the road.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a fun little razor that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I really liked how this trimmer worked. The shaving was nice and smooth and didn&#x27;t leave any bumps.The trimmer is easy to use and is very precise, you can trim your face at very specific places.I like how smooth my face felt after I used it. My wife liked the smooth feeling also.I will use this trimmer again and again. This is my new trimmer.The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received this free razor provided via a program run by Gillette and I think it&#x27;s the best freebie I&#x27;ve ever received. It has 3 trimmer tools so you can get as close as you want to sideburns, beards, mustache and eyebrows. And it&#x27;s a nice size, easy to handle and maneuver, including a nice rubber grip since I shave in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t slip at all while in my hands.  It&#x27;s an all in one tool, the heads pop off easily to switch out from trimming to shaving and fit securely when in use. I was a Gillette fan before, but this is by far their best razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer a few times to groom my beard and shape everything up. I thought it was just ok as a trimmer since it comes with only a few length options. The shaver was also a little weird to me. It didn&#x27;t seem to lock in well enough, and with the shaver attachment it becomes a really long product. I felt like I didn&#x27;t have enough control when compared to a regular Gillette razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a decent product - pretty good value but not for me.</li>
    <li> I used this razor in place of a previously purchased set up.  I like the compact holder for the razor and accessories.  It doesn&#x27;t take much space unlike the razor it replaced.  I try to stretch out the time between haircuts to better suit my budget.  This razor did a good job of allowing me to trim up the spots around my ears and neck that grow long and bother me.  I could get a close enough trim without worrying about getting too close.  I also really like that it can be used in the shower.  This was convenient for trimming without making a mess as well as getting a better shape on my neck.  The shape of the handle is great for getting hard to reach places.  It is substantial enough to get a good grip but small enough to not be cumbersome.  It is also very easy to clean.  I received this trimmer through a program run by Gillette and it is something that I would highly recommend.  It has replaced my previous trimmer.  It may end up being on a stocking stuffer gift list for the men in the family.</li>
    <li> I received this buzzer via a free program run by Gillette. It is a solid product with good features. It runs for a long time on one AA battery and the battery is very easy to replace.The head on the buzzer provides a very close trim and can be easily cleaned by simply popping the top open. My only complaint is the largethe amount of heavy plastic packaging that gets thrown away. Overall a very good product.</li>
    <li> Was looking forward to using this free Gilette product, however, I found it to be too noisy.  I get up before my family and thought this would wake up my spouse, so it sat unused.  Great idea though.</li>
    <li> Everything you need all in one kit.  Makes it so easy for traveling since I go on many business trips.  Now I have everything I need in one kit so I don&#x27;t have to hunt.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is a great item to take with you and the shave is totally awesome.  From now on I will always have one of these packed in my suitcase just for travel and one at home for my daily use.  I received this free through a program that Gillette offered... thanks.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a program run by Gillette I love how it comes with 3 facial hair tools. With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer, it is quick and easy to use and it is easy to keep up any kind of facial hair .</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide Styler through a promotion from Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a new trimmer and was excited to see how the ProGlide compared to other trimmers I have used in the past. Overall I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the trimmer is waterproof which is a nice bonus. The trimmer fits nicely in my hand and is comfortable to use. Definitely not awkward.&lt;br /&gt;I think the trimmer/attachment holder is neat and tidy. It holds all the accessories neatly and takes up very little room.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use the size 1 attachment since the trim is close but not too close. The actual trim is great because it does not spread the hair/whiskers all over the place. While it does not contain the hair, other trimmers seem to \\&quot;shoot\\&quot; the whiskers all around.&lt;br /&gt;The color is appealing and the look is cool. The price is not bad compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest negative is that it does not include a nose trimmer. In my mind this is essential and I was surprised when I realized the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Styler did not include an attachment for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I am very happy with this trimmer and will continue to use it daily as I have been for the past month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a year.  Flawless.  Trimmer sharpness has lasted and the attachments are great.  It can get wet and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I used to own the Schick Quattro trimmer which was really similar to this one. I rarely shave but I like to trim my hair instead. This is a prefect replacement and it&#x27;s even better.</li>
    <li> I have a long beard, and have tried many Styler machines, this one is easy to use and easy to bag and carry if someone travels a lot</li>
    <li> Must of these trimmers are poorly made and die quickly..so far so good on this one. I hoe it does not quit soon.</li>
    <li> I needed something that would trim my beard quickly and efficiently. This performed flawlessly. The blade cuts through thick stubble with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the only things I would change:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to thoroughly clean the head of the trimmer is to attach the final stage (5 blade +trimmer attachment). the 5 blade attachment is the only one that will allow the trim head to open and allow for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this trimmer every other day, the battery will die quickly. It only takes a AA, so changing it is a breeze.</li>
    <li> This groomer works good. Keep a strong battery inside and it works seamlessly, other wise its an average trimmer. Worth it to try, don&#x27;t like it give it away to a family member. Works fine for Men and Women.</li>
    <li> This thing felt poorly made. Not very large, good for eyebrows maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t to my liking, returned it immediately. 2 out of 5.</li>
    <li> works okay , not as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler 3-In-1 Men&#x27;s Body Groomer With Beard Trimmer i like it arrived in time , its very soft and working good</li>
    <li> a lot better than the disposable $1 razors. Has the ability to store 3 extra blades and the blades last quite a long time</li>
    <li> Loved it. I use this every day and you can&#x27;t beat Gillette. Super sharp with amazing comfort. I would 100% recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> The fusion shaver is good. I&#x27;ve had better shavers, but I bought it for the multipurpose use. Good product - I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I just found out today that my 3-in-1 just became a 2-in-1. The trimmer is hard to clean and now it jams. I&#x27;ve oiled it and did anything possible without having to actually take it apart (which is not really an option) and still can&#x27;t get the trimmer to function. I feel duped by Adrien Brody and Andre 3000.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, last a long time, works well shaping my goatee, and it is a Gillette, cannot go wrong!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. This is exactly what I wanted. If you want to imagine the same, do not even hesitate!</li>
    <li> I love this proglide clipper! I just use it without any of the attachments and it gives me that one day beard growth look that I can do anytime of day, no need to shower or wet face first! Got a $3.00 off coupon from Amazon as I was adding it to my cart!</li>
    <li> Is the type of product you are not sure if will worth the money you pay but once you use you are happy to have it. Because is so smooth when you use it. so yes I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Must buy! Trims beard, side cuts very well. Usable on any body part. Great value for such a low price.</li>
    <li> This is the best i have ever used! The quality is perfect, Good customer service, on time, glad to work with u! ^&gt;^</li>
    <li> Best shave I ever had with a blade,actually best shave ever. I also purchased 1 for my son who loves it.</li>
    <li> Pros: Stylish product! Works great for trimming and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very hard to clean the under the blades, that&#x27;s about it!</li>
    <li> I used the previous Gillette razor, and this is a definite upgrade. I tried the sytler our and it is easy to use like any other generic remington or norelco beard trimmer you would buy. It lines up side burns real nice and is more precise. Although I don&#x27;t use the sytling feature as much, I feel that this is an updgrade to the basic power razor Gillette offers. I feel that it vibrates a little better and I get a closer shave with this razor, and knicked less. The trimmer feature is nice, but unecessary for me. I&#x27;d recommend buying this over the basic razor for the shaft and you can just buy any head for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the sole purpose for the beard trimmer, could care less for any blade which has more than 2 blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has 3 fixed adapters 1-3 lengths. Works better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AA battery needed, and it comes with one.</li>
    <li> Love this groomer! It is a surprisingly strong little thing... Works great!</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I bought this for the second time to replace the one I bought 2 years ago! My old one still functions as a vibrating razor perfectly however the black plastic part broke at the top so it no longer closes to function as a trimmer. Not bad for 2 years of using it every day! Was a no brainer to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used.  Have a full dark beard and mutton chop sideburnes and always have trouble finding a razor to trim and shave with.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 did the job with no effort at all, it was quick and smooth and didn&#x27;t leave my face red and broken out.  Thank you Gillette. And thank you Amazon for the great price you beat Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> The fusion proglide 5-blade razor is mostly a gimmick: it cuts only slightly better than my mach III. Not at all worth the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a neat idea having an electric trimmer built into your razor. For cutting flat surfaces like your face, it works great! I would caution you that it is NOT for trimming sensitive areas! The first time I tried shaving down there, I got 4 nice bleeders and gave up. Try something else if you intend to use this on anything other than your face.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer, and works well to shave with also, would have liked it to be rechargeable but overall great little product.</li>
    <li> ordered this after seeing the commercials on tv, and it was well worth the price the trimmer is very powerful for its compact size and had no problems tackling my bushy side burns, the edger was a little hit or miss because it is kind of hard to clear hair from behind the blade. The 5 blade shaver is really good but I really don&#x27;t think the vibration does much at all probably just a sprue feature to say that it is there. One problem that you will encounter is the 5 shaver blades get dull extremely fast and lead to knicks and cuts they are also very expensive compared to the ordinal cost of the entire kit.</li>
    <li> Buy 2. 1 for your face, 1 for your body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to never shave again. It gets pretty close, but nothing compares to a blade. Its powerful and the battery lasts forever. I use this in the shower since I&#x27;ve gotten it about 3 months ago and haven&#x27;t had to replace the Duracell battery that it came with. Used several cheapo brands before this and threw them out the same day this arrived after using this once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to you, your wife, &amp; your dog</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillete razors most of my adult life, and needed a new trimmer, so I tried this.  The razor does not shave well, and the trimmer function is slow and inadequate.</li>
    <li> It is a good item for what it does. I could probably do much better with a dedicated beard trimmer, as the blades sometimes get caught on my beard and jam, but for its price it works well enough.</li>
    <li> Got this on Gold box deals so my rating is based on it costing about $9. Absolutely worth the cost of a normal razor starter pack these days. Does the job, and does it well.</li>
    <li> always loved and always will love Gillette products. The product lives up to the name and delivers the quality for the amount invested!!! always will recommend this product</li>
    <li> Its just amazing.................&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler makes miracle...&lt;br /&gt;Its the best product of Gillette for the men....[[ASIN:B0062IWQVU Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack]]</li>
    <li> Most of my razors go bad very quickly because of use but this one is easy to use, stylish and has held up nicely.  I can&#x27;t complain at all including the great price I paid.  If you want a great little trimmer this is a nice addition to your bathroom equipment.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is not sharp, but beside that it&#x27;s perfect. Good built and good handling.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s feel light and stunning for under 15$.</li>
    <li> the razor is pretty good. but the clip that holds the razor to the shaver broke a month after i had it :( dont know if they&#x27;ll replace it now or not. i was happy with it until then</li>
    <li> arrived alive and works great. had one before and this one seems to have more power. great to keep beard trim. razor is bonus.</li>
    <li> It does not cut the hair evenly and its just a styler. Its just a blade holder and not a trimmer. The battery is not chargeable. If any one is looking for a trimmer , then please don&#x27;t go for this item. I am very disappointed buying this product. :(</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler 3-In-1 Men&#x27;s Body Groomer With Beard Trimmer works great and I&#x27;m satisfied it. it worth the price</li>
    <li> This thing eats batteries like nothing I have ever used before. If a battery lasted more than 5 minutes before it started slowing down, it would be great.</li>
    <li> I am a Asain so I don&#x27;t have so thick hair around my face.I don&#x27;t need those three &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34;.Maybe I need something else</li>
    <li> My husband needed a new beard trimmer after his other one died. So far he has been using this one for about six months with no complaints. The design is nice and easy to grip because of the rubber on the trimmer. It has a sleek and stylish design and the black and blue colors are very masculine. He has found that if he lets his beard grow a little longer than normal, the trimmer gets a bit clogged up  but it&#x27;s easy to clean it out. The back of the styler unit has space for each of the three combs and the unit itself is compact and perfect for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of counter space or who doesn&#x27;t want to have a trimmer take up too much space. This trimmer is battery operated so you don&#x27;t need to keep it plugged into an outlet. All in all, my husband likes this beard trimmer and for the price we paid, it is a great value and works really well. He recommends this trimmer to anyone who wants a good trimmer without spending a lot of money!</li>
    <li> Good enough little groomer for a non &amp;#34;bear&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great for balls. Dont see the need for the razor attachment though</li>
    <li> This little groomer is the best I&#x27;ve ever had in several decades.  I&#x27;ve had it for 18 months and never had anything but perfection from it.  Groomer is very well designed, has attachments that don&#x27;t break and are easy to switch for different trim lengths, and lasts months on a change of batteries. For guys who travel like me, this baby goes everywhere because it takes up no space.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift and my son uses it everyday. He says it is very handy and shaves close.</li>
    <li> This is such a huge improvement over the old trimmer I was using. It is very sharp and does an amazing job. With the five dollar coupon, it is an unbeatable deal.</li>
    <li> Super Kombination aus Nassrasierer und Trimmer. Klein aber überzeugend. Klingen sind superscharf und passen sich den Konturen des Kopfes perfekt an. Handhabung ist relativ einfach, bis auf die Konturenklinge.Hier ist etwas Übung erforderlich. Auch die Reinigung des Trimmers ist kinderleicht. Trimmer ist auch unter der Dusche einsetzbar. Schade ist allerdings, dass es keine Ladestation gibt, so bleibt nur Batteriewechsel. Empfehlenswert für alle, die keine Lust auf ständiges Gerätewechseln haben[[ASIN:B0062IWQVU Gillette Fusion ProGlide 3 In 1 Styler, Special Pack]]</li>
    <li> Excellent, much cheaper price here than there (grocery store, BB&amp;B, etc.). Works great, simi-good battery life (it&#x27;s only a AA). I used to take much longer in the mirror trimming my beard when I just used scissors and a razor. Comes with 3 guards and a razor head. Pleased with the purchase. Good for manscaping too.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these before. it worked well. After one year I decided to order a new one. This one does not cut at all.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. It works fine.  Gets the job done battery lasts long.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well for just about anything that needs to be trimmed. Nice, clean, even trim!</li>
    <li> I cannot comment on the battery life but this is a pretty good trimmer for how cheap it is.  I had to go over each area twice and that did the job perfectly.  I haven&#x27;t tried the electric razor on the end and probably never will so can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy another one of these if my one I just purchased breaks.</li>
    <li> The Proglide 3 in 1 is great for overall grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is the 5 blade Fusion with the back end of the razor for sideburns. Once you remove the blade you get the all purpose edger. Durability is great and the battery life is fantastic. I have changed the battery twice in a year. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This razor gives me the best shaving experience I have ever had.  It shaves super close and it makes your skin feel very soft.  Most importantly for me the razor does not cut or nick me.  I am on blood thinners so I would bleed a lot if I got nicked or cut so this razor makes my shaving experience very safe.  The price of the razor is higher than other razors but well worth it. As usual Amazon delivered the razor very quickly.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t use, and never intended to use the clipper, I  bought the &amp;#34;Styler&amp;#34;  for its thicker handle. I&#x27;ve had good experiences with Gillette razors, because they don&#x27;t come apart or break when I give them a  knpck on the sink to remove stuck hairs,(like Schicks do). Unfortunately, the razor attachment on the &amp;#34;Styler&amp;#34; is a couple of little plastic hooks that -do- break. Oh well, back to a &amp;#34;Fusion&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great if you&#x27;re too lazy to go to Walmart and purchase one there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself gets hair stuck inside that you need to clean out every so often, but that&#x27;s a given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice improvement on the plain Fusion Proglide</li>
    <li> Shaves face excellently in the shower.  Shave all body parts of a man great.  Chest, legs and privates.  Works on a battery and is waterproof so you can shave your face and body in the gym shower.  Alot of bodybuilders at my gym shave their bodies and I am spreading the word that the proglide shaves you fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin</li>
    <li> This is the best razor and trimmer that I have ever used. it is a one stop product for all your shaving needs.</li>
    <li> After trying this product, I felt a difference than from other razors and trimmers that I have tried. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a beard, goatee, or just their face as smith as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
    <li> I give this product a 5stars cause I love it its easy to use and easy to change from trimmer to shaver. Easy to clean as well not a bad product it worked great on my skin hard to find since I have sensitive skin and blades great didn&#x27;t irritate my face I would recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> I recieved the Gillette Pro fusion proglide styler free from a program gillette was running. When I first looked at the styler I thought it would never do the job. I figured id give it a try. I found the styler small, lightweight and maneuverable. This little thing packs a punch I finished trimming my beard in 5 mins with no hair pulled like my other trimmer... I recommend this product to any guys out there that have thick beards and want a quick painless trim. Plus waterproof is a big plus for me that saves so much time!!</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient little package. Whether on the go or at home you don&#x27;t have to spend precious minutes looking for a razor and a trimmer because it&#x27;s all right there. Very good shave and trim. Thank you Gillette for letting me try this product</li>
    <li> Received my razor from Gillette to try out and give feedback, so here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor came just in time as I was in need of a trim. You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck with this. You get the Trimmer, a shaving attachment, 3 different guards, and a little stand that fits nicely on the side of my bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions were that this trimmer felt nice in the hand and was compact and made shaving/trimming a lot more manageable, it also has a nice solid weighted feel unlike another trimmer I purchased not to long ago that felt a bit plasticy. Took it in the shower to see how it worked in water and it works just like it is advertised, and I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spots to get stray hairs, which is a plus because I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to be in the bathroom \\&quot;Grooming\\&quot; myself. After trimming up the face I took the razor and edging part&#x27;s to even up the sides and it had no issues getting the job done. The only negative I saw to this trimmer was the fact that it does give off a little heat after a few minutes of use but I have gotten that with almost every trimmer I have used. I would also recommend making sure all the water is off the blades after using in the shower so they don&#x27;t rust, other then that it is totally worth the money. My girlfriend even took it in the shower with her for her leg&#x27;s and had nothing but positive things to say about it as well.</li>
    <li> When I received The Gillette Fusion Proglide Syler Power Trimmer through a marketing campaign, I was kind of leary at first and when I tried it, itwas great on my my beard.  One of the most important details and I am sure that everyone would love to hear is that it is battery operated.  I really like the battery operated option because I do travel and when I travel I tend to forget the cords to the other trimmer that I have and it becomes costly trying to go buy a new trimmer or new cords.  All I have to do is buy batteries and keep the batteries in my case.  This trimmer also give me a better control over the areas and the closeness of the trim that I need for my facial hair.  I am required at my job to have a close knit shaved beard and on the go this allows me to have it wether be in the car or traveling, I was able to get the closeness and complete feel of professionalism from this trimmer.  The trimmer has power behind that you will not find from a plug in trimmer.  Good Job on this product.</li>
    <li> It is a little machine but it does the job.i liked it except for the fact that theres no kind of storage for when your not using it.the display that it comes in is more for the store display then for home. If it had a lil pouch to throw everything in it including the trimmer and attachments and shaver attachment.thats the only fall back is to store it when your not using it and so it wiil probably roam around in the cabinet and most likely lose most of he attachments.that really bites</li>
    <li> I received this product via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Fusion Pro-glide around 1 year. Now this is another amazing Gillette product .&lt;br /&gt;First , this little AA-battery-powered trimmer and razor attachment is great for home use and travel. It comes with a useful plastic stand that keeps the trimmer, razor attachment, and three comb attachments all neatly stored on your bathroom counter. And for travel, it all fits easily into a small toiletries bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second ,the handle is nicely molded, very clean look and provides maximum grip. The black is actually soft rubber, not hard plastic, so you won&#x27;t find yourself dropping the styler or having it slip out of your palms. The power button is very small, but easy to press to turn the shaver on and off, the LED light is also nice and not blinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third , the 5-blade razor is quick and sharp by itself, but when you couple it with the vibrating powered trimmer handle, you actually do get an even closer shave, even though it took me a few shaves to get used to the feeling. The back of the 5-blade razor has a \\&quot;precision edging blade\\&quot; that lets you precisely shape and edge your sideburns. How amazing is that .!!You can use the standard motorized blade directly on your skin without worrying about cutting yourself, or scratching up your skin. It&#x27;s sharp, but only for your hair. It also includes 3 different style \\&quot;combs\\&quot; to attach to the shaver so you can style your side burns, beard, mustache, anything else you&#x27;d want to trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nice thing not many shavers or stylers have is the ability to open the compartment behind the blade to clean out hair that can cause jams. The Gillette styler has a hatch you can pop off, and snap right back down to clean out any hair or gunk so your styler never jams, and will always work reliably. This is a huge plus for me since my old one was becoming weak and dull from all the hair trapped in the mechanism slowing down the blade and motor.</li>
    <li> I received my ProGlide Styler from a program run by Gillette, I used it for my side burns and it worked really well. The stand that is comes with is great, fits right into my medicine cabinet. It has power, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it on a real beard as it is only powered by 1 AA battery. It came well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Has three adapters for different facial hair lengths.&lt;br /&gt;Great grip.&lt;br /&gt;Clean outs a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Uses on 1 AA battery so replacement is easy.&lt;br /&gt;Would be ideal for someone who has a beard/goatee that needs to be shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Slightly low powered due to the single battery.&lt;br /&gt;When you add the manual razor on it becomes cumbersome and awkward to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic \\&quot;guides\\&quot; are cheap and if your not careful when removing may break.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! It works very efficiently and is a great quality product! I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try out one of the Gillette Fusion Proglide style power trimmer through a program run by Gillette.  I have been a long time user of the regular fusion razors so I already knew that I was a big fan of them.  However the power trimmer is really a very well made well designed product. I work in a large office environment and have a clean shaven head with a beard, which means I have daily maintenance to keep myself well groomed.  The proglide has worked far better than I expected. Being battery operated, there are no cords to deal with.  It came with 3 separate length guards so you can allow for different lengths in different places. The whole kit comes with a nice looking stand that my wife didn&#x27;t even mind it being out on the counter instead of banished to one of the drawers. If you are on the fence as to buy one or not I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received my free proglide styler  through a program from Gillette. I looked at the razor and found the sleek and stylish handle very appealing. I opened the package and held the razor. It fit perfectly in my hand. I have been an avid user of Gillette products as long as I can remember and this handle is by far the most comfortable to use out of any razor/trimmer they have made in the past. My hand fit perfectly around the sleek handle. The trimmer is a slim style with three trimmer attachments each a different length. Once done trimming just pop open the trimmer blade for quick cleaning under the faucet and then snap it back up and you are set to go. The only down side to this perfect trimmer is that it takes a single AA battery and is NOT a rechargeable. Aside from that, I find no other down falls.</li>
    <li> My least favorite part about getting my hair cut is when they use the trimmer on the back of my neck. The trimmers they use feel like a mix of sand paper and razor blades. I always like to do a little touch up in between haircuts. When I tried the Gillette Power Trimmer through a trial program, the trimmer was soft to the touch and didn&#x27;t leave my neck red and swelling like the barber. I may just bring the Gillette Power Trimmer with me next time I get my haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works so gently, that I&#x27;ve used it to trim up my 2-year old son&#x27;s neckline.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Style Power Trimmer from a Gillette promotion. I received the trimmer about a week ago and have been using it daily for manscaping and facial hair. The trimmer came with three attachments for different lengths of hair, and an attachment that uses a Gillette Proglide razor cartridge. The trimmer works very well for trimming hair no matter the location of your body. It is very much like a regular hair trimmer found a hair salon or a barber shop. The only problem I find with this trimmer is that it is very narrow. Unlike other hair trimmers it does not cover a large surface area. If you are looking to use this trimmer for trimming the edges of a recent hair cut or maintain a short length of body hair on sensitive body parts, this trimmer works perfectly. However, if you are looking for a trimmer that can be used as a primary hair clipping tool, it will work but is slightly small requiring more passes than that of a regular trimmer.</li>
    <li> This product was provided to me free of charge by a Gillette program.  My initial concern was the quality of the trimmer. I&#x27;ve used cheap trimmers that pull rather than trim. I was pleasantly surprised. This is not only a great trimmer it is small enough that you can trim in tight areas and get a good consistent length. I would highly recommend this to the traveling professional!</li>
    <li> I thought this product was great for chest hair and the vibrating head gave me a nice close and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This product was comfortable and gave me a very good shave and trim.  My beard feels great, and my sensitive skin felt refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic on the trimmers seems a little light-- I&#x27;m used to a trimmer with a little more weight, and not sure how it would hold up to rigorous use, but my experience trying it was awesome.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome razor.  One stroke and my facial hair is gone with a close shave and face left feeling smooth.  I used the trimmer to shape up my mustache, the outcome was remarkable.  I will continue to use this razor.  Keep up the great work Gillette, and thank you for the FREE razor through your program.</li>
    <li> So I have always liked to keep a little facial hair giving me a \\&quot;stubble-ish\\&quot; look all the time, and I have to say this product is great for that! It&#x27;s extremely convenient to be able to go from shaving my neck with a metal razor to trimming along my jawline with precision in a matter of seconds. Also, this trimmer feels sturdy and is really easy to clean out the excess hair so it doesn&#x27;t get jammed. I have used around 3 beard trimmers before this and none of them were as effective, sleek, or cheap as this one is! I would definitely recommend it and will buy one again if the need arises. I got this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler from a via program run by Gillette. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is a fantastic razor!</li>
    <li> Gillette just sent me a Fusion Proglide Sytler Power Trimmer to try out.  The Proglide is a bad mamma-jamma!  I tried the trimmer with the size 1, excellent!  I tried the edger (no guard) and that was great.  Then, I used the razor to get a nice clean shave everywhere else.  I also used it to shave my head.  This thing really is a great all in one solution.  It even works in those nook and cranny areas (ahem, ears/nose)!  I tried shaving with the razor both with and without the \\&quot;power.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m not sure if there was a difference.  More shaving tests will be conducted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint: I did have trouble getting it back in it&#x27;s casing.  I think it was probably user error though, looking at the pix here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> So, who would have thought that you could have one tool to trim and shave with at the same time.  Well, when I received my Gillette ProGlide Styler, free to try from Gillette I received my answer.  Extreme versatility in a small package is what you get in this device.  Powerful enough to trim and edge back of neck and around ears, yet gently enough to provide a super clean, close shave.  This little power trimmer has also given me a new way to comfortably manscape without having to drag out the large clippers.  So if you are looking for a way to keep you face, hair, and body looking its best, then this is definitely for you and I know its for me!</li>
    <li> I got this as a free tester product from Gillette.  I was so pleasantly surprised by this trimmer.  This trimmer is great quality for the price was very happy with the different attachments that allowed me to not only get a close shave but trim my beard with the same product.</li>
    <li> Great product for all shaving and trimming needs. Works good in and out of the shower. Highly recommend to curious consumers.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette and it was very satisfactory. While it won&#x27;t take the place of a hair trimmer for tackling my moppy mess of hair on top of my head, the trimmer is very easy to use for the smaller details around my face (which is the intended use). The trimmer fit well in my hand and was easy to turn on and off. I even washed it under the sink when finished using without detrimental affects.</li>
    <li> i love this product it works so well and does such a great job i dont want to use any other product</li>
    <li> the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. The sleek comfortable handle allows you to easily sculpt your beard with ease. The sharp blades cut effortlessly and cleanly and with the ease of the attachments  transitioning between them is smooth . Finish up with the shaving blade and its a complete experience.</li>
    <li> I received the Styler in the mail (from Gillette) in late April. Expecting it to be like any other piece of shaving equipment. I used it before I went to a family wedding. Of course the feeling of it didn&#x27;t change my life, but it was fairly surprising how comfortable the shave was. Also i received alot of comments on how \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; I looked, also that my girlfriend kept comparing my face to a baby&#x27;s bottom...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways... This all in one set gets the job done. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a \\&quot;clean and comfortable\\&quot; shave.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer did exactly what I needed it to do; it gave me a clean look between haircuts.  I was able to clean my neck up without any help.  It handles those light hairs on your neck really well and makes a clean line.  The longer setting also allowed me to trim my sideburns effortlessly and neatly.  The cleanup was also great; just run it under warm water and it is clean.  That was a great feature.  I would recommend this product to my friends for sure.</li>
    <li> Being in the Army I am required to look clean cut all the times. I get my haircut every other week. Keeping trimmed lines between cuts is a difficult task. I have tried all types of power trimmers of all different prices! I received my trimmer via a program run by Gillette. I researched it on Amazon and found it was very affordable. I am very impressed!&lt;br /&gt; I use the Proglide power trimmer every other day and it works to keep me looking like I have just left the barber shop! I used it on my sideburns and the back of the neck with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt; I love the fact that it is battery operated so I can take it with me to the field without having to worry about packing the charger and finding a place or a generator to keep it charged.&lt;br /&gt; It comes with three combs of different lengths so trimming hair different lengths is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt; To top it all off, IT IS WATERPROOF! Just rinse it off when you need to clean it. Use it in the shower for easy trimming of all or your body hair \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; needs to keep her happy.&lt;br /&gt; One of the best things about this razor is the price. I don&#x27;t have to worry too much if it gets lost or stolen since it is so affordable.</li>
    <li> I recently received this razor by a program run by Gillette.The Gillette Fusion Proglide Fusion Trimmer is a handy razor to have. This razor gives a nice clean, close shave with no irritation and it works well as a mustache trimmer too. My only issue is I wish it was rechargeable, other than that it works great.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer for free as part of a Gillette campaign. It works great. I&#x27;ve used it to trim my goatee and my side burns. It&#x27;s easy to use, great interchangeable combs. Small enough to just through into small bag and have it available for any overnight stay.</li>
    <li> When I first received the free package via a program run by Gillette, I was pretty excited BUT the fin did not begin until I actually got to play with it.  It works amazing!  It&#x27;s  like  amini version of the trimer I currently use.  It&#x27;s perfect for travel as it&#x27;s so small.  The only con would be that the plastic components seem too flimsy. So they may not last long if used daily, but perfect for those weekend getaways!</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor recently from Gillette and love this as a second razor. The handle is very comfortable and high quality. The power option on the handle provides for better precision and allows me to shave faster, as it removes hair faster than a regular razor. The razor comes with different trimmers which allows me to trim all the areas of hair that are difficult to trim with a regular razor and leaves no irritation. The handle is light and shower proof, which makes shaving even easier. The stand that the razor comes with is great because it stores all the different trimmer heads and sits perfectly on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> After having received Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Trimmer for free through a program that Gillette is running, I was very impressed. Here are the pros and cons of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It is water proof so it can be used in the shower. Also, when shaving I don&#x27;t have to make sure to dry my hands off before picking up it up, unlike other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;-It is ergonomically designed head is faced towards me so shaving is anywhere on the body is easy and seamless.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;-The attachments are easy to put on and take off.&lt;br /&gt;-It trims hair quickly and precisely to allow maximum control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-It runs on on battery. It would be great not to have to keep buying batteries since I already have to buy the blade attachment, which lasts one month.&lt;br /&gt;- The blade attachment had four blades, which made it kind of difficult for against the grain shaving although it delivered a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t earn 5 stars because of the small number of cons, but over all it is a great all in one razor with and awesome rugged manly look and, ITS WATERPROOF!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the most unique grooming item Ive ever used! I love the powered proglide razor attachment, it gets that close shave even closer! the trimmer is surprisingly powerful and very close! the three combs they include are perfect. The docking station is well thought out and there is a place for everything!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler free through a Gillette promotion.It has proven to provide a close nick free shave.The trim attachments has three different combs that I found great for trimming sideburns,neck hair, and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler would make a nice gift item.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this item. He uses it daily w/o any worries. keep batteries handy, it will bog down when the batteries are up.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free via a program ran by Gillette. I try out new products often, and they don&#x27;t always get a good review like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it&#x27;s battery operated, which makes it extremely portable.  I don&#x27;t keep a beard or sideburns, but I do keep my hair cut very short.  This comes in handy for me to keep the hair around my ears and on the sides of my head trimmed every couple of days.  I also use the trimmer to keep sideburns from even starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving attachment is pretty neat, too.  It felt kind of odd at first, mainly because I&#x27;ve only used manual razors for a long time.  But I get a really nice shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging said it was \\&quot;shower safe\\&quot;, but I never have cared for shaving in the shower.  But I did test that packaging claim.  It is, in fact, shower safe.  I even held it under the direct shower stream while running for a couple of minutes and it never missed a beat.</li>
    <li> The trimmer handle is easy to hold and makes it easy not to drop it like a regular razor. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut or buzz the hair on your head or beard, it pulls it. The battery power is inadequate to do the job, if it was more powerful it might not pull the hair so much. I&#x27;d rather stick to my regular buzzer for my hair and use my Gillette Fusion for my face and beard. I received this styler from Gillette in order to use and review it.</li>
    <li> I have been been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide styler Power Trimmer now for just over a week.  I received the trimmer for free  via Gillette through a program they are running.  Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with the unit as a whole it comes nicely packaged with a stand for the trimmer and all the accessories it comes with.  The trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and has handled all the tasks I have thrown at it.  It has a very solid build quality and feels sturdy.  Gillette continues to make quality products and continue the good reputation I have gotten to know.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer and immediately tried it to trim close to the mouth and nostril areas where a blade can be a little risky if you move too fast.  I then trimmed sideburn hair with one of the heads included.  The results were very good.  The small hairs near the mouth and near the nostrils were trimmed easily and the trimmer did not bog down with the head attached cutting the longer sideburn hair. I don&#x27;t have a beard, but this would be great for beard trimming daily using one of the three included heads as well as regular trimming needs.</li>
    <li> A program run by Gillette offered me the opportunity to test and review the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer for free. While my overall experience with the Power Trimmer has been positive, there are things about this trimmer I disliked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Handle is well designed and easy to grip, even in the shower&lt;br /&gt;-This trimmer includes 3 guards, allowing you to trim to your desired length&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;bite\\&quot;, pinch, or pull like many electric trimmers&lt;br /&gt;-Guards attach easily and remain in place. They are also easily detachable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Only uses one battery, which gives the trimmer very low cutting power&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t trim very close, even without a guard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using the Gillette Power Trimmer. If you have fine, not very thick hair, this trimmer works well. I happen to have very coarse facial hair and the product just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to trim it properly. If your beard is already trimmed, this will maintain it pretty well, just don&#x27;t expect to use this trimmer to shave/trim a fully grown beard very well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the Proglide trimmer being any good even when I got a free one as part of promotion with Gillette.  I felt better seeing they also made it with Braun.  The bottom line is it is a better beard trimmer than others I have had before.  The included combs latch in tight and make a consistent length easy to attain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a beard/sideburn/body trimmer, I would start here before trying a more expensive one. PLUS, you can shave with this, too, so you don&#x27;t need yet another thing in the bathroom since this does double or triple duty.</li>
    <li> What a great all-in-one trimmer. I received a complementary one from a program run by Gillette. It works great, it uses one AA battery, no need to recharge it, would be great for travel. Also comes with 3 different length clips, I tried the shortest, number one, just a little longer that I would have wanted it, by worked great, and after all its my first time growing out a beard after being influenced by some of the images on the packaging. To conclude, very easy to use and a great quality.</li>
    <li> I recently participated in Gillette&#x27;s trial campaign for this trimmer and I&#x27;m glad I did. This is the slickest power trimmer/shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I love the flexibility of being able to dry shave when I&#x27;m in a rush or wet shave when I have some time to slow down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m assuming the attachments are just as useful but I unfortunately don&#x27;t grow facial hair like Grizzly Adams :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable power trimmer/shaver that&#x27;s just as effective as the higher end ones, look no further and pick up one of these bad boys.</li>
    <li> Never been big on electric razors, but this one has won me over.  Its quick and easy to use.  It goes right through any unwanted hair easier than a knife through butter.  No matter what job, big or small, it handles it with ease.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer  via a program run by Gillette for free. I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product. I was able to trim and style my mustache and beard with out getting any nicks or cuts.It left my face feeling smooth which my wife likes.</li>
    <li> I finally received my razor in the mail after a program provided through Gillette let me try one.  After one use I was hooked.  The accesories, how easily they&#x27;re interchanged, and just how sharp this product makes you look is incredible.  I have shaved for years and still found myself asking the hairstylist to sharpen up hairlines, sideburns, and things that just a normal plain razor cannot do.  After using this I was able to do this on my own with ease!  This will definitely become the one and only tool I need for maintaining a smooth fresh looking shave.  Especially since I have a job that requires facial hair to be maintained and look professional, I found the right product for the job!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer- i received this trimmer free from Gilette as part of a program they ran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is great for an all around shave.  You can really clean up a messy face and keep it well groomed with this single tool.  The various levels and fader are great and allow for much better detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have the power of a traditional electric shaver, but it gets the job done just fine.  It also comes in a convenient carrying container.  I look forward to using this on business trips instead of bringing along my razor and electric clippers.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor/trimmer.It&#x27;s powerful and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t scratch or pinch your skin and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair.The razor gives a close, smooth shave and one blade can last a month or more, even on a moderately coarse beard. I received this as a free promotion by Gillette but I would easily purchase this again!</li>
    <li> It has some sort of brushes you can adjust so that it will cut your hair to a certain length or it will cut it entirely if you don&#x27;t use the brush thingys, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made recently. I never knew I needed a trimmer until I bought one. Having the trimmer and razor combined into one product is very convenient.</li>
    <li> This Razer is really good. Very close shave and really don&#x27;t have a major problem. I will buy this razer again</li>
    <li> If you have hair or even if you don&#x27;t you need this styler.  Great for trimming sideburns, goatees, mustaches etc.  Since it comes with a razor attachment it&#x27;s also great for shaving.  Liked it so much I have purchased three as gifts.</li>
    <li> I am overseas and left mine at home, so definitely had to get me another one. Very nice for small trimming jobs. Noise hairs, underarms, and other sensitive areas. Don&#x27;t care for the shaving attachment, but it&#x27;s always nice to have a extra one for my Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco G370 that I love (rechargeable) and use to trim my beard before shaving. But it&#x27;s not good for travel or use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product, having had two similar portable ones (a shick and a cheapy). I&#x27;m not hairy at all, so my needs aren&#x27;t as rigorous as some. But I&#x27;m so very disappointed in what this product can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can:&lt;br /&gt;- Trim thin hairs on your face and neck&lt;br /&gt;- Shave off your eyebrows (if you desired...I guess)&lt;br /&gt;- Irritate both you and your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t:&lt;br /&gt;- Trim your beard without pain&lt;br /&gt;- Trim without burning/irritating your skin&lt;br /&gt;- Trim without pulling your hair instead of cutting it&lt;br /&gt;- Trim without frequent clogging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t use this anymore because it is just too painful. Perhaps if it was more powerful it would be less of an issue, but really this is poor. Both the Shick and the cheapy did better (but broke). The Shick used AAA as well, so not sure why this one with AA is weaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a ton of great reviews so perhaps I got a defective one...but it&#x27;s not usable.</li>
    <li> a little pricey but overall a great trimmer</li>
    <li> Price was good. Shipped fast. Works as described, what more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> This is so awesome. You don&#x27;t have to buy a really expensive thing to shave. This one here works well.</li>
    <li> great product and price. fast delivery</li>
    <li> Compact design with right number/type of attachments. Perfect all-in-one tool for grooming.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this. He has a full beard and this keeps it looking great. Not if I could only get him to clean up the sink completely after he uses it. lol</li>
    <li> I bought this Proglide styler from amazon while I was travelling to London, used it just once when I was travelling, now I have come to back to Bangladesh and surprisingly it won&#x27;t work any more. This is very disappointing because I couldn&#x27;t even use it twice, I am now regretting because I threw away my Proglide Power before I came back to Bangladesh, now this thing don&#x27;t work, I can&#x27;t even send it back to amazon :( and I don&#x27;t know if there is a way to fix it.</li>
    <li> U cant get a better product at this price.</li>
    <li> This razor is great. It&#x27;s dozed through many areas applicable to &amp;#34;body grooming&amp;#34; devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have is that it&#x27;s hard to get the hair out of the head. It didn&#x27;t come with any little brush or anything to help coerce it out either.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriends birthday. Lets just say it&#x27;s so awesome I am ordering two more one for my brother and one for my cousin. My boyfriend absolutely loved it. He loves that its small and can easily be manipulated also that he gets no razor burn. He has thick facial and chest hair and this baby trimmed everything perfectly.</li>
    <li> better price than what you pay in a grocery store. I use it about once a month to trim my beard and mustache. I&#x27;ve bought 3, they seem to last about 5 months and then the blades start spinning slower. Still worth it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep up with the eggs that were droppin&#x27; when I was using this little futuristic bad boy. However, on the day before I went on vacation--just two months after I bought this--the usual hum that I was met with upon pushing the ignition switch was silent. The batteries were fine, but I traded them out for safe measures. Still nothin&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short- Awesome when it works, looks cool when you throw it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;2/5</li>
    <li> no more cheap shaves. i can no line up myself.</li>
    <li> I used to have a trimmer and shaver seperate but this one is perfect on the go buddy which i use for both and works with AA batter which is even good as i travel a lot.. excellent combo prouct.</li>
    <li> Obviously its not the greatest high end trimmers, but for the cheap cheap price. you cant really complain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;um.. I would buy it if your short on cash but need trimmers</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a cheap trimmer and couldn&#x27;t decide between this and the Schick Quattro Titanium Trimmer so I just got both. I figured I would need the other eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both get the job done and are about as good as you can expect in the $10-15 range. They both eat batteries like candy. I would recommend rechargeables. Both of the motors run really loudly and I get the feeling that they will die sooner than later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quality seems a bit better to me. Feels better in the hand, includes a nice organizer stand, and blade that came with the Schick felt very warn compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the main reason I choose this is the trimmer. For those delicate areas down there, this feels much safer than the Schick. That model felt like there was much less margin for error.</li>
    <li> Ladies, this Styler is great for all our areas we like to have groomed. I have been researching the best shavers for the bikini area without causing ingrown hairs and finally just bought this on a whimp at K Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs, underarms, bikini, can all be done QUICK fast with this shaver! I can literally shave my legs and/or bikini in like 3-5 mins. Now, using just the groomer head (no attachments) will leave stubble, like 1/8 or 1/16th in. of hair or so, but in the winter that&#x27;s perfectly ok with me! A couple passes with the groomer head first, then the razor will give the smooth shave we usually desire. So far the ingrown hairs are at bay, but thats because I keep the bikini hair down to stubble and don&#x27;t use the razor head. I&#x27;m loving this little thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and by the way, I paid $26 at K Mart which included an in store warranty thing that allows me to bring it back if it breaks free of charge for one year, I believe. Just in case anyone is interested!</li>
    <li> Not available locally I decided to import. The feel in the hand being both solid &amp; comfortable shaves smooth &amp; close. Without hesitation and reservation &#x27;The Best A Man Can Get&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Was a little concerned when I saw the small size &amp; low price, but this groomer has actually exceeded my expectations and I still use it to this day! Great battery operated option when a quick trim is in order!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spend tons of money in razors, shaving gels, creams and all sort of stuff to keep my lady parts in tip top shape... well I&#x27;ve finally found 1 device that that&#x27;s all in ONE.... WOW!! This thing trims, shaves and is gentle on my sensitive skin, no razor bumps, no itchng, no burning.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all it&#x27;s very affordable, shipping was on time. No problems  with this product. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I really like that you can use this trimmer in the shower. Its easy to use and very compact; definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product, trimmer is really smooth and its water proof. Every man should own one of these</li>
    <li> Overall I am happy with it. However it can at times nick your skin. If u r careful it works well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great! I love using it!</li>
    <li> I rarely give 5 out of 5 stars, but I think Gillette has a very good, innovative product here. I&#x27;ve been using their Mach III turbo razor for some time now and a Norelco styler for my goatee and &#x27;burns. Norelco has made quality shavers and trimmers for many many years, And the Gillette Mach III is a very good razor. But I have to tell you the Fusion ProGlide will shave you smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, I kid you not. The styler part uses Braun technology, and works very well. The three guards produce very good results with minimal getting used to. The handle is thick because it incorporates the battery and trimmer motor, so this part will take a bit of getting used to for shaving if you&#x27;re used to a thin handled non powered shaver. Some have been claiming to have problems with theirs, such as the trimmer motor giving out, easily broken guards. I will admit the guard hooks and latch seem a bit thin, but as long as you&#x27;re not ham-fisted with them they hold up well, and Gillette is always good about replacing a defective or broken item if you tell them, they&#x27;ve been good to me. At 14 bucks at Amazon online online and 18 bucks in-store at Walmart, you can&#x27;t go wrong to give it a try. And yes, it will make an excellent gift or stocking stuffer. It&#x27;s actually fun to use. I&#x27;ve had mine for two months and the novelty hasn&#x27;t worn off, lol. The downside? The blades. They are expensive like the Mach III&#x27;s blades, but they last a while, at least they do for me. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m quite ready to put away my Norelco trimmer yet, but it&#x27;s not getting used much now. A solid 4 stars. Good job, Gillette.</li>
    <li> I was completely happy with this product when i first bought it. it&#x27;s easy to use and a good product all in all. after 2 month it just stopped working and i haven&#x27;t done anything. it didn&#x27;t fall, didn&#x27;t even use it under water although it&#x27;s waterproofed, the blade just don&#x27;t shift left and right anymore although the trimmer is still buzzing, but no movement for the the blade. i am completely upset from this.</li>
    <li> I had recently purchased the Gillette Fusion ProGlide being told that I would join the masters of style. I have yet to receive notification from the organization, nor have I been laid because of it, which I am pretty sure that getting laid was and is the goal of the group. Therefore, I must say that the razor does not do as advertised but it still makes my pubes look immaculate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Do not use precision trimmer on balls</li>
    <li> Very good quality shaving. I just hate to got shave, especially in the mornings but not anymore with this I can get shave whenever I want.</li>
    <li> Works for all my needs!</li>
    <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Use it almost every day. 3 different levels helps for man-scaping. Works great with the vibration.&lt;br /&gt;Only flaw is battery drains pretty quickly (couple months), but it only takes a single AA.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for shaving your balls. Don&#x27;t try with your face.</li>
    <li> if you are in a rush and to shave fast with a safe this is for you guys try and you will say its what i call 10/10</li>
    <li> This is great but beware it kills AA batteries like an evil AA battery eating alien. I use it almost every week. Its great aside from consuming a lot of battery power.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Even used it to shave a portion of my head for a mohawk.</li>
    <li> amazing trimmer, have no issues with it whatsoever.</li>
    <li> 2 years of daily use on coarse Italian stubble that could be used to sand wood some days, and it still is perfect! Weekly(ish) goatee trimming and maintenance, even sideburn touchups on occasions, and it is better than every other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used (not to forget the ProGlide Fusion blades, which are top notch!)&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower, no issues.  I have used eneloop rechargeable batteries in it the whole time, works perfectly!  After using it for a while and loving the convenience I purchased another (gold box deal) as I figured it&#x27;d break at some point soon, given the price &amp; my experience with other, more expensive trimmers.  The new one sits unused in the original box - but I&#x27;m still glad to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 100% satisfied... I have ordered the Silver Swivel version (w/o trimmer) so that may shift my thinking some, by I look forward to years more use of the trimmer (and the interchangeability on blades with the swivel as needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible Improvement: One thing I wish it had (barring adding the swivel if I like that) is an ear/nose trimmer blade guard/attachment - but that certainly doesn&#x27;t warrant loss of a star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a trimmer with any regularity at all (or if you don&#x27;t, but should...) buy this now! You&#x27;ll be thrilled you did!</li>
    <li> Good for face but nothing else.</li>
    <li> love it,,,easy to use,,,light in weight.....excellent at the quoted price.....</li>
    <li> Works great and I think great value for the money. Trimmer especially good for beard and mustache. I use closest attachment for trimming since I like short beard. Close but not quite Ray Donovan close. Only negative is not that good using as liner. Probably not any better than any other razor, and not as good as fixed or straight razor. Shaves well though. Also, easy to change attachments and battery. Well made product. Love that it is waterproof.</li>
    <li> very good machine, i have been using it for almost a year now. The only concern is it is power hungry, you have to feed it new batteries almost every 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Fusion Proglide is okay , trimmer does not edge and trim like I expected it to. Trims down beard and mustache satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor not too long ago. Not from amazon. However, Its lasted me quite some time.. Its great, affordable.. Its easy to clean and its great for shower use. The only issue, is it takes awhile to trim and shave with.. there isn&#x27;t enough power in the motor to really get all of the hairs in one go.. but if you just rub it along your face a few times you get a decent trim. I SUGGEST!!! you purchase trimmer oil!! After awhile the blades on the trimmer dulled to the point where it pulls hair... Do to the friction creating heat, it dulls the blade fast.. that plus water on it a lot can dull it.. my fault for not keeping the blades oiled...But its decent trimmer..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, the blade part leaves much to be desired, but it does a good job, a must buy.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this styler. I use it often to trim my beard especially my moustache right above my upper lip.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer for the ~$10 price range. It came with 3 guards and one blade. it is very powerful and cut through my thick beard with ease. the stand that comes with it works well and has convenient little spots in the back for the guards.</li>
    <li> Worked out of the box. Great product. Good design.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when it first came out a few years ago, it only lasted a month, broken cheap plastic parts inside. I sent it to P&amp;G and they sent me a coupon for a free one, that one also crapped out on me after a month (same broken parts). So I gave up. Then I bought one about 6 months ago and I still have it and noticed they ditched the cheap plastic parts that always broke with durable metal. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my current one. It&#x27;s a great compact trimmer, and great value. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This thing is not powerful enough to handle beard trimming.  It is also horribly designed and traps hair in the compartment with the rotating motor causing it to clog and lose power. You won&#x27;t make it through a full trim without having to clean this compartment out (which requires removing the trim guard and getting in there with a brush which was not included).  I tried giving myself a trim this morning and it caught 6+ times, a few times coming to a complete stop.  After the sixth or seventh time it pulled hair out rather than cut it, I broke the f^$%^ing thing on the sink and threw it away.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband and he loves the different peices he has tried different ways of shaving since he got it and he gets compliments everytime he uses it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and due to an illness ended up being unable to shave for over a month.  Being chicken of then shaving this long facial hair, but dealing with a face that itched relentlessly, I bought the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler to trim it down close so I could shave.  This thing works great, and I ended up keeping a goatee that I now use the #3 trim head to keep it clean looking.  I would recommend this to everyone, it performs well beyond it&#x27;s price tag.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! I was waiting forever to purchase one after seeing it on TV. Lives up to it&#x27;s standards! I&#x27;ve had it for a year and just changed the battery for the first time last week!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good item...thank you</li>
    <li> I did tons of research before buying this, and saw a ton of positive reviews. This lives up to the hype and then some. I have used a dozen different trimmers over the years and none were satisfying. This one is. I cannot rave enough about this product. It delivers exactly what I want, is smooth and gentle, and does the job so efficiently that shaving has become a quick joy instead of a terrible task.</li>
    <li> I tried a couple different travel-size options for a device that would handle both shaving and beard-trimming, and this is far and away the best I&#x27;ve found; it&#x27;s light, compact, handles giving both a clean shave and keeping a beard well-trimmed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance as a hint that I would like him to keep up with shaving. His face is sensitive and whenever he would do a complete shave with cream and a razor, he was have very agitated skin and bumps. This product was perfect for him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has attachments so you can shave it at different lengths or don&#x27;t use the attachments to get a close shave. He has been using this for about a year and has never had any cuts to his face. This product doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin like a normal shave will. Overall this product is a great price, it is durable (going on one year now), and will keep your significant other happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my father as well. My dad actually keeps a mustache unlike my fiance who just does a clean shave all over. My dad loves this and uses it all the time. He says that it is small enough and easy to maneuver. It is great for designing with the facial hair and for trims!</li>
    <li> Trimmer works well although it takes a while to do a god job, shaver does a good job. lightweight which is good for travel and has a replaceable AA battery</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer for the price and convenience. However the shortest attachment was ended up being too long for the length of facial hair that I was trying to maintain. Other than that it&#x27;s great, especially since it&#x27;s waterproof and you can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month, and have used it 3-4 times per week. I&#x27;m still on the first shave blade. I really like the convenience of shave and trimmer all in one. The power bladed razor gives the smoothest one stroke shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced, using the recommended Gillette clear gel.  The trimmer blade (on the disposable shaver) is great for edging sideburns and goatee. The main electric trimmer/groomer is good to cut \\&quot;stray\\&quot; hairs such as ears, nose, even touch up scalp around ears. I also use it to \\&quot;groom\\&quot; chest around nipples, arms, shoulders, pits, etc.  As for \\&quot;down under\\&quot; 👇it feels safe and easy to trim, shape, and even shave all those creases, cracks, crevices, and cylinders and spheres 😷.  The AA battery seems to be holding a good amount of power after a month without a recharge (I use my own NiMh rechargeables). So far I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a excellent choice for any guys &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; needs. I am a hairy person and this trimmer has been an excellent weed whacker so to speak. The different length settings are kind of useless but the razor attachment is very nice. Also using this trimmer in the shower really helps cut down on getting hair all over the bathroom. I would highly recommend this to anyone regardless of their trimming needs.</li>
    <li> Bought the kit to replace my razor holder and take down my beard. No matter where I go these things are pricey. Thanks to safety razors becoming Hipster Posh they are also climbing in price. Beyond the price tag these razors do take down my wiry beard with ease. It only lasts 5-7 days not a month or more like it is stated in the commercial.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping my mustache and sideburns trimmed. I use the adapters to trim my eyebrows and thin out my sideburns.(gets the gray out.LOL</li>
    <li> Not really nothing fancy about it, but I do like it.  It takes the sames blades as the other power fusion so I didn&#x27;t have buy new ones.  Overall, a nice little gadget.</li>
    <li> this is a good product, shaver is a bit uncomfortable but generally does the work</li>
    <li> This product is very versatile and is a handy trimmer to have at home.  It is compact and comes with several clipper length adapters.I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice device! Nice styler and shaver - highly recommended product. And the best is that you dont need to charge, just replace batteries</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does everything that the description said it would and was a great gift for my husband.</li>
    <li> If I could give it six stars I would. I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Trimmer a few days ago via a promotion run by Gillette . It comes with three Interchangeable sized 1-3 as well as the option to shave with a razor head also Gillette . It&#x27;s gat from head to toe  Literally . If there&#x27;s any doubt in your mid get rid of it this is the perfect trimmer and razor combination if ever used, and I&#x27;ve used quite a few !</li>
    <li> This Trimmer is amazing it really gets the work done. I didn&#x27;t purchase it, i recieved it from a program that is runned by gillette but it is still an amazing machine for only 20 dollars Once you get this package with its three length razors and shaver there&#x27;s no way you can go outside your house looking bad. You save money going to barbershops when you can do it at home to your want. Its small, compact and ready for you to take it on the road. Go get your today</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and does a great job of shaping mustaches and goatees. The electronic charge raises the whiskers and also powers the electric clippers to trim beards.</li>
    <li> and no replacements are available. Might be able to repair with super glue though. Otherwise, best value price in the market!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he absolutely adores it! He uses it all the time and it is waaaaay better than traditional razors. He can also line his facial hair up, which I happen to like. Will be purchasing another one for my daddy!</li>
    <li> Trimmer is real good. Razor is good as well. Great tool for the price you pay. Looks good too. Very durable and gives a great smooth shave.</li>
    <li> The blades are way over priced but I&#x27;ve never had a better razor and I&#x27;ll bite the bullet on the refill price.</li>
    <li> a very high quality product was glad to deal thank you</li>
    <li> This is great for home use, however, its not as versatile as I anticipated. I wish it were better to travel with. It would have been better for the price of this ensemble to have included a small travel bag to keep all the pieces together as well as something solid to cover up the shaving blades for travel.</li>
    <li> This styler is compact and easy to use.  The packaging it was shipped in was way over the top for a wee little product which makes one wonder...did I pay extra for the fancy packaging???</li>
    <li> This trimmer is made of good quality materials so much so that it lasted nearly 3 years when the cheap plastic trimmer guards&#x27; teeth chipped off and rendered it useless.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free in a Gillette campaign and I&#x27;m glad I tried it. The product is of good quality, it has all these options for shaving and trimming for all kind of uses, even if you don&#x27;t have a mustache or beard.</li>
    <li> The power trimmer is outstanding, Gillette did it again with a free razor as a trial study program . The razor just glides across the surface removing hair with ease leaving the skin smooth, while the trimmer easily and powerfully trims the hair down to an even level. The only downside of the trimmer is that the hair gets collected inside of the rotating part of it, but it&#x27;s an easy clean.</li>
    <li> At first I was a little wary about purchasing this product because of the price. When I saw that Gillette was running a program to try it free I jumped on it. From day one of using it I instantly fell in love with it. The handle is very easy to hold and maneuver on my face. This handle would be excellent for older users who have a hard time holding onto smaller ones. It feels like you&#x27;re not shaving  at all. It glides along my face without any drag or pulling and cuts very close with one swipe and never nicks. My face feels incredibly smooth even hours later. The attachments are easily removed and changed making it an all in one product with everything at my fingertips. Before I would shave with a competitor&#x27;s brand then use a scissor to trim my mustache and then use another trimmer to even everything out. Now I have everything in one handle saving me time and the trouble of looking for everything. I would have to change blades every three to four days because they wore out and cut my face let alone the razor burn. I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide for a week now ( My wife took it in the shower to do her legs) and it shaves as close and smooth as day one plus I could even skip a day if I want. YES it cuts that close without having to go over the same area three to four times. The only complaint I have is now I have to buy another one for my wife so she leaves mine alone. I would recommend this product to everyone young and old. \\&quot;HINT!!! Fathers day is coming up soon if you want to give someone a really nice gift. HINT!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> At first glance the Gillette... Seems like a complete solution for shaving and manscaping. I was at a lost at first to know how to use the razor with the battery powered clipper attachment. I didn&#x27;t know whether to shave wet with shaving cream or dry as an electric razor. There were no specific directions. I tried it dry carefully on my face, neck and back with excellent results. The reach is exceptional. I could reach my back with no problems. The electronic clipper by itself works well on trimming side burns and around ears. While there are also other attachments for beard trimming, I personally don&#x27;t find them useful bc I don&#x27;t have a beard, but If I did, I might feel differently. However, I do like the size and ease of use of the battery powered trimmer. The clipper itself is worth the price of the set.  It&#x27;s perfect for traveling.</li>
    <li> When Gillette sent me a ProGlide Styler for Free I decided to try this new product! I was a little skeptical but I was in much need of a change because the current razor I was using was dead. Before I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I had bought two other types and had horrible experiences because they pulled my goatee and left my skin irritated. Immediately after starting to use this product I knew that it was different than the rest I felt no pulling and it was getting the job done quickly. When I was done I was very satisfied about the results and I have finally found a new razor for keeps, for the price and value truly a shave above the rest! Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> I got tired of carrying a Razor and trimmer in my bag when going on a trip. So I decided to give the GILLETTE® FUSION® Proglide Styler a go. Turned out to be an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;Not only do I save space, but as it uses regular batteries you do not need a charger either.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is just the right width to get the job done nice and clean. It works great in the shower as well unlike some other trimmers.</li>
    <li> The duality of the razor its great. I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide since it&#x27;s avaibility. Best shave ever and the convenience of the trimmer is perfect, easy to use, easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> This product met and exceeded all of my expectations. I have been looking for a quality trimmer/groomer for a while and this product was perfect for me. And for the price, it&#x27;s a perfect but. I will be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I owned a Wahl styler before the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler and the Wahl was always a mess. Even though they included a storage tray the pieces were alway all over the place. The Gillette includes a tray that neatly stores all the pieces and the power trimmer in one place and it is compact!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette trims closer than my Wahl and it can be used in the shower a bonus to keep the hair from getting everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;The third thing that the Gillette has going for it is that it has a replaceable battery! My Wahl is a little over a year old and the battery is starting to fail, the only solution to is is to purchase a new trimmer. The Gillette all I have to do is to replace the battery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars except that I am not convinced that the power shaver feature is of benefit. While it did give a close shave, so do the other shavers that have 4 blades. I usually use an electric razor to shave my face as I am prone to ingrown hairs, I will try this for a while to see how it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I did receive the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler for free to review, but was asked to be honest with pros and cons to the Styler.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product free and let me tell you it is totally worth the money I would have spent on it. It is the best trimmer I have used to date. It has every attachment you can think of and they all work great!!! It isn&#x27;t painful to use and it is easy to clean. The case that it comes in also has storage for each attachment. Really is a great product and I will continue to use it everyday!  #GotItFree</li>
    <li> After receiving this shaving kit free from a Gillette program, I tried it out. I really like how it is easy to control and allows to me trim where I want and how much. It also shaves really close and smooth. I like how it looks and it is easy to clean. Over all this is a great shaving kit.</li>
    <li> I was lucky to receive the trimmer for free from a program run by Gillette. First of all, I have to say, the style in which the product is packaged in looks fabulous. When I opened the product, and I grabbed the trimmer, the grip and style was great. It was by far very easy to turn on and easy to handle. It runs on a single AA battery and when I shaved my side burns, it left with no bits and was clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product was given to me for free via a program run by Gillette.  First, the packaging of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler was very nice.  Coming out of the box, my first impression of it was very good.  The container that holds the trimmer/razor is very sleek and you find yourself able to immediately view what the ProGlide Styler has to offer.  All of the pieces are firmly set in place in the container for no moving of the pieces.  One thing I really appreciated about this container is that it was easy to open.  I usually struggle with opening other razor/trimmer containers and with this one, I only had to pull on the tabbed pieces of tape to get it open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion ProGlide Styler comes with three combs to attach to the trimmer for three different lengths.  I only used one of the combs, but for people who want to try different styles and/or have body hair all over, I can see these being very useful especially when trying to find your own style.  They really open up your options to do what you want to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself is very powerful and feels like it&#x27;s built to last.  I can imagine I&#x27;ll still be using it months from now.  With the combs, you will never have to guess whether you are getting the length even and the trimmer practically guides itself.  It is also very maneuverable along edges and around curves, which is a great thing.  The trimmer is also shower safe, which is a nice feature though I did not use it in the shower.  The Fusion ProGlide Styler gives you all the options you need to master your style.  I&#x27;d give it a 9 out of 10.</li>
    <li> Ever since I received this brand new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a program run by Gillette, I&#x27;ve noticed such a change from other razors that I never want to go back! The styling features that this provides is amazing for the size of this! It is definitely worth a buy, with attachable and detachable equipment for either the length you want your facial hair to be, or if you just want to shave! My face is now as smooth as a babies. I&#x27;m glad I acquired this all-around razor and I&#x27;m never going back. 10/10</li>
    <li> Great product, if you purchase this, you won&#x27;t regret it. A program ran by Gillette allowed me to receive a free one to test and keep. It&#x27;s now my current razor .</li>
    <li> Love the Gillette fusion razor and trimmer!!! I use it all the time for tricky places to trim. It works great and lasts for a long time on 1 battery. It&#x27;s a great razor!! This razor was provided for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the people over at Gillette I was able to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer for free.  This comes with the trimmer, battery and 3 combs.  The combs allow these to be used in many ways.  The trimmer is made from Braun technology.  I use the trimmer itself to get a close shave.  I use the different combs to trim my goatee.  The combs allow me to trim my goatee to just the right length.  I no longer have to use scissors to try and trim my goatee and worry about getting it even.  The trimmer and combs take all the hassle and guessing out of it.  This trimmer just makes it so much easy to keep my face shaved and trimmed.  The trimmer and combs can also be used  on other parts of the body.  It can be used to anywhere you have hair that needs to be trimmed or removed.</li>
    <li> I was one of the lucky people who received this trimmer free via a program offered by Gillette.  After testing the razor for about a week I found the Gillette Power Trimmer is extremely easy to use, and with three heads, covers quite a bit of hair trimming for such a small trimmer. The battery life on this appears to be long lasting, which is always a good thing.  The 3 heads that are provided allow for different uses and levels of trim, which allow it to be used all over, and not in one spot. I primarily used it for body trimming and to keep my sideburns in check, and this helped to make that job much easier and quicker than it has been in the  past.  One thing I do not much care for/recommend is using the general blade on this for shaving of the face.  The handle is much to bulky compared with other razors to be used in that manner. For the general shaving of your face (minus trimming) I would use a normal Gillette razor. All in all, I would recommend this to anyone needing a trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler trimmer for free as part of a program from Gillette.  After using the product several times I have been extremely pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  I have used other trimmers over the years and yet to find one that offers the power of this one and goes in the shower.  The three levels of guards and the holder are very nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is a bit smaller than other trimmers, so if you are trimming a full beard it may take a bit longer.  Other than that, this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone that needs a trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Styler from a program that Gillette is running.  This item is great, it is easy to use and fits comfortably in my hand.  I would recommend this item to anybody...</li>
    <li> Awesome product! The trimmer is a beast when it comes to my sideburns and my goatee. I&#x27;m honestly very suprised by this product on how well it preformed.</li>
    <li> I typically use aloe vera enhanced disposable razors, however this was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s rear end.  I have very sensitive skin and I usually get small cuts.  I felt very confident with this razor.</li>
    <li> The ProGlide is a pretty good tool and meets my needs head to toe.  Not sure in the long run about using water to rinse the razor blade part because of the battery operation part, so that will be seen in the future.  The handle is nice and easy to use as are the attachments by popping off and on easily.  I am just not a fan of the cost of the razor blades, always expensive.</li>
    <li> I love the variety of this product. Gillette Fusion Proglide provides me with the volume and comfort I need. Great product overall! Defiantly worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I got this razor from a Gillette promotion.  This is a great razor. Works well. The only down side is that the blades are a little high in price</li>
    <li> This little powerhouse exceeded my expectations by a great number. This trimmer is capable of doing so many things, including the cleanest and easiest shave your face could get. I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler via a program run by Gillette, and I&#x27;m so happy I was chosen. Forget about razor burn, cuts, bumps, those these are long gone. I am a lover of Gillette products since they always deliver the best, this little styler is not exception. I got rid of all my hair from under my under arms, my belly and arms and the you-know-what part with such ease and perfection that there&#x27;s no more excuse not to get that hair out. (yes, I&#x27;m kinda lazy, don&#x27;t judge me ;)) What I love: it&#x27;s WATERPROOF! has a nice quality to it and it does not feel cheap. It does not take much space up, love the stand with the pockets to put the brushes and the trimmer itself. What I don&#x27;t like: It&#x27;s AAA battery powered, would prefer if it was rechargeable. Blades are a bit expensive but well worth it. So, if you can get your hands on one of this \\&quot;magic wands\\&quot; for your body and face, you won&#x27;t regret it, it would be the cleanest and nicest shave, and trim and whatever you want to do with it that you&#x27;d ever have.</li>
    <li> Just received the ProGlide Styler today, from a FREE promo that Gillette is doing!  Looks awesome!  More funtionality than I thought! So much to do and so little hair.  Shaver works awesome and i am able to trim my beard so it is not scraggly.  Definitely a must buy!</li>
    <li> I got this styler and tried it out. I&#x27;d say overall it&#x27;s a good styler. It&#x27;s easy to use an would be really convienent for traveling instead of taking a trimmer and razor it&#x27;s all in one. I really liked the razor attachment with it being powered it slides across the face no problem. Was probably the best shave I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I received this razor a couple of days ago. With budgets being tight, I picked up the razor from a free program offered by Gilette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the raazor, I was amazed at the compact size and light weight. what was awsome too was battery was included. I first used the razor using the trimmer in order to hack off my winters growth. It took the beard and mustach off with no effort. Almost didnt need the blade attachment, the trim was so close. I then used the blade attachment, and all I can say is WOW!!!. This is probably the closest shave I have ever had. I love the pivoting head that followed my facial curved wonderfully. The only down side I noticed was that there was a little bit of power loss fairly quickly. but still had plenty of power to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a great choice for those men that have thick wiry facial hair, as it removes it quickly and very easily. I have used other similar products before and have found that they often pinch and pull my facial hair. I experianced nothing of that with the Proglide. Another aspect I love is that it is water proof and can be used in the shower. Men how often do you find yourself short on time and need to shave. This is a great time saver as well. I will definately reccoment it to others.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide free as a program offered by the vendor not really knowing how I would like it. At first I thought it was just going to be some razor that I would end up throwing away. Boy was I wrong! Never have I seen a 3 in 1 hygiene tool that&#x27;s battery operated but you can use it in the shower! Right when I got it in the mail I ripped it out of the package and tried it. My skin is sensitive and I normally have problems with irritation but not with this. Gillette definitely gets a thumbs up from me with this cool gadget!</li>
    <li> the proglide trimmer and razor provided my gillette is an amazing product. I have never had the quickest, closest, and smoothest shave in my life. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received this amazing kit free from a promotion that Gillette was running which is amazing in my mind.This little tool will be a great addition to my arsenal during Mustach Challenge season.  I will no longer have to struggle using a blade and can have a perfectly trimmed face up until the day I need to shave the goatee off and have only a mustache.</li>
    <li> It is very good at edging and trimming and shaving. The battery life is awesome. I love it so so so much. I got it through a program through Gillette. I also found the battery life very good</li>
    <li> I got this set at a deep discount, and quite frankly, my expectations weren&#x27;t very high.  This is as good as my previous trimmer for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, Easy to Use. Worth the purpose i bought it for. No Regrets</li>
    <li> It works well on my thick hair.  It seems like it would be a gimmick but the motor in it does seem to help it cut my stubborn hair.  I use an electric razor to get a rough shave and this thing with the blade to finish with a close shave.  The trimmer part of it is less sueful but the small size does make touching up any facial hair easy.</li>
    <li> I have purchased more expensive shavers, in the past, for my husband but he said this one was the best he has used.</li>
    <li> Do not want to say anything about this but this is really powerful&lt;br /&gt;And the design is also good to adjust and work in all part of the body...</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed. Works well, battery lasts a long time, and the attachments are perfect.</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent. Trims right down to the perfect length.</li>
    <li> This shaver was well worth the price, and the comforbility of it is unexplainable, I love the feel of the razor!!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a mediocre (at best) trimmer, but my buddy convinced me to get one. The compact size is awesome. I don&#x27;t really care about &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; design but it is really comfortable in your hand. I was using a Wahl coordless trimmer before this and it was immediately outclassed by the Proglide. The small compact size of the Proglide and the narrow case it sits in takes up minimal space in a toiletry bag if you do a lot of traveling. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and haven&#x27;t had any problem with it. The only slight flaw I can think of is that while trimming, it tends to throw hair everywhere. Nothing a post-shave sink wipe down can&#x27;t fix. Comes with a $3 off coupon. You won&#x27;t find a better entry level trimmer.</li>
    <li> I love it this 3 in 1 shaver.  It makes my life easier to shave and I use it almost every day...</li>
    <li> Thanks to a program run by Gillette i gained access to a great product.The Gillette power trimmer!Has a great variety of attachments to get your beard and hair trimmed real good,and the power shaver gives you a close shave where ever you need it.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette ProGlide Style Power Trimmer as part of a promotion and having used Mach3 razors and blades but never a power trimmer, I was anxious to try it out. The only other buzzer I have is the barber-shop variety--large and clunky. It&#x27;s good for buzzing my head but the rest of it, no thanks. My job requires me to maintain a professional appearance (most of the time) so the chance to test this out was welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the ProGlide Power Trimmer. My sideburns and around my ear needed some trimming and this thing was just the answer. It&#x27;s size along allows you to maneuver it how you want and be way more specific with where you&#x27;re trimming. Though I only used the \\&quot;1\\&quot; clip, the option to have three clips is great. For the little but of stubble on your face, it&#x27;ll suffice but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll chop through a four- or five-day growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing it was a breeze--just flip the thing open and rinse it with warm water. Boom. I let mine sit laying down on a towel just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need is one AA battery and you&#x27;re good to go--and it&#x27;s included. Looking forward to my hair growing back quickly just so I can use this puppy again. Thanks Gillette for stepping up in the trimmer game!</li>
    <li> This item will help you in any area to stay clean and trimed. Its a must have in every travel kit..</li>
    <li> Received my Proglide a few days ago as part of a free promotion fro Gillette.  Shaving my neck is always a pain for me.  I have to shave in multiple directions which typically results in irritated skin.  The vibrations from the Proglide solved this issue.  Once pass up my neck and I had a clean shave!  Great to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> Gillette came up with a great trimmer and razor set up. I get a closer shave then normal and my wife loves me more for it. Great product if you have trouble with stubble try this you will get a close shave and be able to trim other areas. I was given an opportunity to try this powered razor via a program run by Gillette.  I will continue using this as long as I can.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to use this trimmer as I was very pleased with a trimmer I have been using for years.  This trimmer met or exceeded all of my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this trimmer for just about everything possible.  I used it first to trim down my beard, then do some precision styling, and finally threw on the blade attachment for a smooth shave.  The trimmer ran smoothly through the whole process.  The blade caused a little irritation, but that is simply because of the number of blades combined with the fact that I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor was provided to me free in a campaign run by Gillette, however, I would absolutely purchase one for myself.</li>
    <li> i love this shaver it is small and powerful. shaves with ease and quick. i would really like to recommend this product. the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> The Fusion ProGlide Styler powered by Braun is so easy to use offers all the features anyone could need...&lt;br /&gt;Best yet it was FREE via a program run by Gillette...&lt;br /&gt;I found it very easy to use not cumbersome..quick cleanup by the ears,back of neck..3 combs help with the cleanup between haircuts..the added bonus it&#x60;s a razor also...I myself don&#x60;t have a beard or mustache but this would be great keeping it groomed..It would be a worthwhile purchase for anyone as well as a great gift...</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, to the point I have given up straight blade razors. I decided to give this a try, with the vibrating blade it&#x27;s smooth as butter and leaves no razor burn or cuts. Plus my wife love the beard trimmer, since she cuts my hair. It works great on the neck line.</li>
    <li> This product was pretty good, but it was not as great as i expected it. I gave it 4 stars because i love all the uses and features, and how nice and small the razor is though. But i am glad i received it free from a program from Gillette  because its not to bad. Its a nice shaver and trimmer but its blades are not that strong.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer through a program run by Gillette. I have used other brands in the past and the first thing I noticed about this was the size. It&#x27;s very compact and fits well in my hand, yet has a lot of power. It is very easy to use and the attachments lock in very securely, not all trimmers do this. It handled my beard better than my electric trimmer. I was also surprised that for a narrow blade it doesn&#x27;t clog. I have a new favorite trimmer and being battery operated it&#x27;s easier to transport.</li>
    <li> This little compact razor called the Gillette Fusion Styler is awesome! It is light, powerful, versital and easy to use. I can vouch for it that its a wonderful little machine.</li>
    <li> This was provided to me free of charge through Gillette to try.  When the product first arrived, I was impressed by the nice packaging and case.  Upon initial inspection, I was happy to see that the trimmer also had a blade razor, and it had attachments for hair of different lengths.  This is a very versatile product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it came with a station for storage of the device and all its attachments.  Upon use, I also noticed that changing attachments is simple, and the device itself is very maneuverable and nice looking.  I liked how you could trim facial hair, sideburns, and virtually any other body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some negatives: The trimmer blade does get hot after a short period of time, which can be a bit uncomfortable.  Additionally, for my thick facial hair, the trimmer does nearly nothing and won&#x27;t cut any stubble, including near my sideburns.  I have a Norelco 1255x, and it is super smooth and quiet, and cuts right through coarse hair.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Trimmer is very loud and gives off a lot of vibration, which can be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried it on her arm hair, and the trimmer works better on her thin hair.  The power fusion razor blade does not offer a noticeable advantage when shaving, it just seems to vibrate your hand, but not cut any better.  Like other Fusion razors, cartridges are designed to wear out very fast with soft metal, forcing you to frequently purchase very pricey replacement cartridges.  I used to only get 2-3 shaves out of a cartridge with a good shaving cream.  I now only shave after showering (to soften the hair), and add shave oil underneath the cream, and the cartridges last about 5-6 shaves before being very dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is convenient to be able to have the trimmer included on the same device as the razor, making this a better travel or occasional use device.  This is a great idea, and performs moderately well for the price point, but could use some improvement for it to be a true all-in-one device.  Overall, a good value if you keep your expectations reasonable.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette to tryout.  After having tried out the product I want share the pros and cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;* It provides a good shave with an easy to snap on razor blade that will not pop-off like other shaving blades due to an advanced locking mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;* The power trimmer fits perfectly in your hand with a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;* The edger blade is smaller than a hair trimmer and provides better styling around the ears and for the side burns.  If you have a quasi-beard or several days&#x27; worth of stubble you can use the edger on your face to cut most of your long stubble away as not to dull the razor blade.  The edger will also remove a full-fledged beard as well.  The edger does not nick or cut your face.  The edger is powerful enough and has an easy to push button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;* The trimmer function was poorly designed. You only have three trim guards that trim so close that you might as well just be buzzing off your beard, go-T, or mustache.  The biggest guard trims so close you see through to the skin.  Using the trimmer on your sider burns between haircuts is out of the question as you see through to the scalp.  They should have made the trimmer guards to have longer lengths.</li>
    <li> I got to try out this trimmer by For free from a program from Gilette. I do not have a beard or mustache but this trimmer was a great and easy to use trimmer for my sideburns and eye brows. It had many attachments for different lengths and also converted into a razor for my everyday shave! I will now continue to purchase this as my daily shaver! Great job, once again, Gilette!</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me the fusion ProGlide Styler for free to evaluate.  The shaving experience is terrific what you would expect from a Gillette product.  On a recent trip I packed only the new styler instead of my normal razor and trimmer.  I found that the product worked great in both roles shaving and trimming.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer free via a program run by Gillette. This is a powerful, compact trimmer. It works great for trimming sideburns and under the nose where a razor can&#x27;t reach. I&#x27;ve used other rechargeable trimmers in the past but they always wear out and weren&#x27;t as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the packaging. It is not a very good holder for the trimmer and the accessories, and I don&#x27;t want to store it out of the package and risk losing the accessories.</li>
    <li> Overall I am impressed with this styling kit. When I used the powered trimmer, it seemed like it had a lot of power for its small size, and I was even more surprised when I found out it was powered by only one AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It clipped through my beard without a problem, and it was easily cleaned under a faucet. Apparently, it&#x27;s water resistant so it&#x27;s safe to run water over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the kit comes in its retail packaging, there&#x27;s a lot of plastic and whatnot that seems to make it take a lot of space, but once you get all the extra packaging off of it, all the pieces fit into the small stand that doesn&#x27;t take up much room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving blades themselves provided a good shave. I usually use a Mach 3 razor and I&#x27;ve had good results with those, and these ones do just as well. What I liked also was having the extra one blade for precise work, which was really handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like, however, was it seemed like there was a lot of wasted plastic in the retail packaging that I ended up throwing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this razor free from a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette ProGlide Styler for free via a program from Gillette and it&#x27;s a great product. It provides a clean, precise shave without irritating the skin. It&#x27;s also easy to clean. For me I think this will become my primary device in maintaining my facial and body hair.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from a Gillette sponsored program.  It was a great alternative to my multiple razors I had been previously using.  Its small and fits nice and compactly in your medicine cabinet.  The razor gives nice clean shave while not pulling on your hairs.  The only downside is when using the trimmer you run the battery down very quickly.  I would reccommend this razor to anyone looking to cut down on your time and get an nice easy shave.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler free through a program via Gillette.  I am in love with this system.  I call it a system because it takes care of most of my grooming needs.  It is awesome to be able to shave my face, trim my beard and clean up my neck line and ears with one handle and a quick change of attachments.  This gives a nice and close shave and the trimmer gives my beard a uniform cut.  This is a product I recommend to any man!!</li>
    <li> So I received the styler free from Gillette by a program. The only problem I had was the case was very difficult to get open. Then I have to use all my strength to get the razor attachment off! But once I got it on and attached ( kind of afraid of vibrating razors on my face) I shaved my two day old stubble. And well it was great!! I took a before picture and a 12 hours after picture to show how close it shaved.</li>
    <li> I went into this experience pretty skeptical. Most trimmers/stylers say they do all this stuff but done. Not with this pro glide styler!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provided a smooth shave and the trimmer ( which comes with three guards) worked wonders!!! It fit to the contours of my body and didn&#x27;t knick or cut my skin. The motor isn&#x27;t loud which is great! I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who likes to keep their body clean shaved and smooth.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free through a program sponsored by Gillette. Well balanced and easy to trim sideburns and mustache.  The shaving adapter worked great too.  Battery operated makes it easy to use. Nice!</li>
    <li> This is the best compact styler/razor ever! Love the fact everything is at your fingertips no hunnting things down! Only downfall battery opperated but on the plus side no cords. Will be buying as gifts for future occasions!</li>
    <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try a new product by Gillette through a promotion Gillette was offering; the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler.  I was excited to try the product the day I received it. I have been searching for a reliable, inexpensive system that was compact and easy to use. I wanted to do away with the dinosaur of a system I had been using for years. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer isn&#x27;t bulky, and makes maneuvering the contours of your body a breeze. The grip of the handle of the trimmer fits perfectly in your hand or your fingers and helps with the maneuverability.  You don&#x27;t feel as though you are fumbling while you shave and trim, and it isn&#x27;t like trying to shave with a weight. In fact, it is the polar opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted sharp, defined lines. The precision edging blade does just that, and more. The three combs the system provides keeps whatever you are choosing to trim / shave consistent, and can give you the look you are shooting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my system for over a week, and my blade is still super sharp; I predict it will last longer than most that I have tried. Thumbs up, Gillette! Finally, the system I have been searching for has arrived!</li>
    <li> I received the proglidge trimmer through a free program Gilette was promoting. The giellette fusion proglide is awesome! I was in the market for something like this and it&#x27;s the best purchase I have made this year. The trimmer is fantastic, and works really well. It&#x27;s easy to use and very inexpensive. I would recommend this for any guy.</li>
    <li> Got this to test through a gillette program and must say I was pretty impressed..love the long rubberized handle as I use my razors I&#x27;m the shower and as I shave my head the long handle was quite comfortable...3 different guards for the blades for trimming beards and mustaches..which the storage was a bit more compact..</li>
    <li> This product is great because it lets you style facial hair like you would with an electric trimmer and also give you the close shave like with your standard razor.  This for less than you would pay for a beard trimmer</li>
    <li> I am a person who used barber clippers for years, like the andis trimmer, to style my beard and mustache. But after using the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler I am never going back to those hard to clean blades again. I mentioned hard to clean because hat is the thing I am most impressed about this styler about, it&#x27;s very easy to clean thanks to it&#x27;s easy to open trimmer door. All you do is slide it back and run some warm water over it and the blades are back to being nice and shiny. As far as styling, it&#x27;s easy to handle, not to bulky and great grip. That makes it easy to get sharp edges that look like they were done by a professional. Bottom line is if you want an easy to clean and easy to handle styler/trimmer, the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler is just the product for you.</li>
    <li> The item was provided to me as a free product from a Gillette program but I would gladly purchase this item any day.This item is well made and is useful in the day to day life of the average man. The trimmer is easy to use and user friendly the trimmer is a complete package for the needs of a person looking to maintain the grooming of oneself. For the price of item is well worth it for what you get.</li>
    <li> this product gives you a great shave as well as a great trim. this product has everything u need to be silky smooth. all of the components that come with this product are extremely usefull.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any large, heavy maintenance facial hair, but I did want something that i could very easily trim up my sideburns, and for that, this works great. Its not the worlds greatest product, but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via a program run by Gillette. I really like the proglide styler.  It provides a clean trim and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Received this free from Gilette as a test product in a promo program. It is great, can do all the trimmimg &amp; shaving needed with one styler. Easy to use and change attachments,can trim sideburns, eyebrows &amp; shave face..no power cord to wrestle with either.</li>
    <li> Having recently received a free styler through a program run by Gillette, I was excited to see what it could do for my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was that it was a handy one-stop solution to being able to shave my neck and keep my beard in check. It&#x27;s a helpful tool for every-day use but a bit lightweight for a hefty beard that hasn&#x27;t been trimmed in a long time. I would prefer to use my heavy-duty clipper in that case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power feature is a nice addition and something I appreciated in the regular fusion power razor.</li>
    <li> Have to admit I was a little scepticle at first, but i got it free from Gillette.  It&#x27;s a small little trimmer, that does a lot more than first impressions.  The attachments are easy to use, and stay in place.  The shaver I actually prefer better than my other powered blade as it seems to run faster and stronger.  I enjoyed shaving with it.  As for the trimmer, this is the perfect tool for up keeping.  I&#x27;m a big hairy guy that likes to trim my chest and back.  I would HATE to use this as a starting point, but is perfect to maintain a nice trim look.  While you can use this to dive into a hairy manscaping job, it will take you a while.  Think mowing a lawn with a weed wacker... Can be done, just not pretty.  For under $20 bucks, it&#x27;s a good trimmer.  But depending on your needs, you may need a good buzzer to start.</li>
    <li> As part of a program run by Gillette I was able to give the Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer (there&#x27;s a mouthful) a try and was very pleasantly surprised. I was already familiar with the Fusion ProGlide Power razor which I love but I&#x27;ve always been intimidated about stylers and the fears of grooming body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For such an affordable and compact item I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but it worked great.  I&#x27;m a total novice when it comes to grooming but with the available combs to keep things even I was really able to easily get my sideburns \\&quot;just right.\\&quot;  And yes, it worked very well on grooming more sensitive areas of the body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need to know, it works better than you could hope for, it&#x27;s extremely easy to use, fits well in your hand so it&#x27;s not awkward like typical larger powered razors. Very compact so it&#x27;ll be easy to take with you on trips.  Very easy to clean, it&#x27;s a great item.</li>
    <li> After getting this product free from a program Gillette offered, I tried it and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It trimmed my beard and shaved my chest hair.  Did a great job.  No razor burn or bumps.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received this styler thru a promotion from Gillette. On first appearance it looks great. I was surprised that is felt as sturdy as it was for the price. I have used all of the attachments so far for trimming my sideburns and goatee. This is a very powerful little trimmer for being battery operated. I typically use rechargeable stylers that are much bigger than this. I don&#x27;t think I will be using my old stylers anymore. The Gillette styler works great, is a perfect size, and can be fitted with different attachments to tackle any job! I would highly recommend this product. It would be a great gift for men.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette ProGlide Styler free from a program run by Gillette. And I thought I should share my thoughts on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love that it comes with attachable trimmers and an attachment that has a razor on it.  The stand it came with was also nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is a nice product I must say that the attachable trimmer guards are quiet thin and can break easily if not handled well when putting them on the trimmer itself. I also wish the trimmer head was a little bigger, but it works amazing either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not too heavy nor too light and it works very well. I would highly recommend this product to any one who is looking for a new trimmer and possibly a new razor!</li>
    <li> The GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER POWER TRIMMER looks amazing on my bathroom sink. Usually I try to hide my razors/trimmers, but not with this one. After I set up the Power Trimmer, I immediately used it to clean up my side burns. In my opinion, a clean set up side burns really make the appearance, and the Power Trimmer did the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I finished with my sideburns, I worked my way to my unsightly back hair that peeks out of my shirt. I was able to clean it up and my wife was impressed. To complete this task normally, it&#x27;s messy, time consuming, lots of moving parts, but not with the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE STYLER POWER TRIMMER. Thank you so much for making a visually appealing and easy to use product. I tossed out all of my old razors after just two days! I was able to try this razor free by utilizing a program sponsored by Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette provided this for free!</li>
    <li> Ever since I saw the proglide styler introduced I thought to myself, \\&quot;this would be a cool product to own but why buy when I already have a normal power trimmer and a gillette razor.\\&quot;  Well when Gillette provided me a power trimmer to try I was about to find out.  The product is ready to go right out of the box and the directions were clear/concise.  Included was the trimmer itself, attachments, and your power blade attachment.  I knew my main use for the trimmer would be my sideburns, neck area, and underarms.  It passed all those tests with ease and then more.  The trim itself gave a nice close cut even better than the 40 or 50 dollar trimmers i&#x27;ve used in the past.  Cleaning the unit was as simple as taking the attachment off and rinsing it off in the shower or sink!  Simple is good and Gillette really hits the mark here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for anything negative I would have to say that the stand was a little unsturdy to use.  I was hoping the attachments would snap in so if I bumped anything I wouldn&#x27;t need to pick everything up each time.  Other than that Gillette has a great product which is a good purchase for any guy!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the trimmer/edger functions on this, but that Proglide blade is pretty amazing.  I have sensitive skin, and I thought all multi-blade razors would really irritate my skin.  However, the shave with this was smooth and my skin felt great.  I wear a full beard, and I was hoping to use the trimmer to edge out my jawline and do and all-over trim of my beard more frequently.  However, it the trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to want to do a clean cut.  Kind of disappointing, but I might try a regular-handled Proglide in the future.</li>
    <li> I just used this product a few days ago and it exceeded my expectations. The blades were sharp and the trimmer worked very well. My facial hair is dark, coarse, and very thick and I have used many different brands of razors and none of them could ever compare to this one. It is finally quick and easy to trim by beard and shave away my unwanted facial hair. I will never use a different razor again.</li>
    <li> I received my ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a free program run by Gillette but I have to say that I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase one on my own. I was very impressed with this all-in-one kit. I really enjoyed the shaver attachment, I was able to get a close shave and the blades didn&#x27;t pull my hair like other inexpensive shavers tend to do. It gave me a smooth close shave with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say the body is a little big for regular shaving. I&#x27;m a big guy with fairly large hands so it&#x27;s pretty comfortable and easy to hold for me. But I could see someone with smaller hands may find it a bit much to handle for a daily shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer attachment with the exchangeable combs works nicely for keeping your outline neat and trimming loose hairs between haircuts. In fact it allowed me to extend an extra week between haircuts which saved me $20 bucks which is great when I can&#x27;t make it to the barber. That little savings alone means it already paid for itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am impressed with it and will continue to use it on a daily basis. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through Gillette as a free promotion.  I really believe it is one of the most convenient and comfortable shavers I have ever used.  The shaving blades provide a smooth shave that actual seems to be rolling and bending around the curves of my face.  The attached power trimmer adds to the convenience by easily allowing me to clean up my sideburns and my hairline around my ears during the same shaving session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is heavier than your normal razor, but I didn&#x27;t seem to notice any hand fatigue.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a promotional program. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is a tremendous product if you are looking for a tool to trim. I have never had a good tool to handle my mustache or my eyebrows, and the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer handles both exceptionally well!</li>
    <li> This body groomer from Gillette is great.  No razor burn or bumps ever. My goatee is easily trimmed and shaping around my nose and mouth is quick and painless. Other unwanted body hair is also a snap with this body hair trimmer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i recently got a free Gillette fusion proglide styler power trimmer from a program run by Gillette. the fusion proglide styler power trimmer was everything i could ask for. the handle was easy to grasp and was comfortable. it gave an awesome shave. everything needed came in one package which was great &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough receive this product for free from Gillette . And lemmie tell ya, I have been using the the run-of-the-mill Fusions for several years now and love them. I was very excited to get my hands on the ProGlide Styler model with the finer, thinner blades and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint! The blade does a really nice job getting as close as possible without chopping up your face until my face feels buttery smooth. The Styler comes with detachable faces, one for the razor, for your beard (I don&#x27;t have one) and down to the nitty gritty to help with side burns and lining up your neck. I say BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I recently got this trimmer free via a program run by Gillette just to try it out because I&#x27;ve heard so much about it. All I can say is WOW. I love it. It is easy to use, and it provides good clean lines. I love the fact that you can change the tips and also attach the actual razor to it. I have stopped using my Nerelco shaver and replaced it with the Gillette Proglide and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette.  Great for shaving-With the fusion proglide heads, this razor is awesome. It has the same quality, but better since it has the higher quality handle. I threw away my old proglide handle in favor of this sleeker and more efficent design. As far as the face shaving aspect of this product, it&#x27;s excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for trimming your facial hair-Another aspect where the Styler is excellent. I&#x27;ve used it to trim my goatee and sideburns quite a few times, and it gives an even and effective trim. Plus, it&#x27;s the original reason I bought the Styler, since my other beard trimmer cut and trimmed my facial hair unevenly. With this though, trimming is very fast and simple. I also like how the trimmer comes with three length combs, making it easy when I decide to grow a beard and blend my goatee with interchangable trimmer combs. When trimming my goatee, I used the 3 guide comb, which is perfect for trimming the length on shaggy hair without completely oblitterating my goatee. Then, when I wanna grow my beard out, I used the 1 guide comb to blend my goatee in with my stubble. this Styler is a quality investment for any guy, but it would be nice it were rechargeable.</li>
    <li> I received these as part of a survey by Gillette. This little trimmer is easy to use, easy to clean and easily keeps me in trimmed shape.  Has several of changeable guides and blades.  Highly recommend this as an inexpensive alternative to more costly trimmers and razonrs.</li>
    <li> I am a man who likes to keep all of my hair at bay.  I used this little tool to help clean up my face after a weeks worth of growth.  It worked great.  I use to pull out the razor and go to town and it would tear up my face horribly. It took a little more time but in the end it was totally worth it and my face felt the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my chest, neck and other manscaping areas.  I was not disappointed at all with it&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this styler to any man who likes to keep all of his hair looking good!!!</li>
    <li> The styler is exactly what you should expect for your money&#x27;s worth. If you shave and line yourself up in your own home then this is the perfect product for you. The razor itself glides across your face very smoothly. The edger lines you up pretty nice as well. I shaved my face 2 days ago and it is still looking nice and clean. I recieved the styler for free to try and give my honest feed back and I can honestly say that I am glad that I was able to try this product.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a promotion run by Gillette.  At first I was fairly excited to try it out but soon realized it was not for me.  The trimmer head is just too small if you have a large portion to trim such as a full beard like I have.  Smaller amounts of facial hair would probably work well with this product.  I found the smallest guard to be the right length for the look I was trying to achieve, but the trimmer just didn&#x27;t have enough power to do it all quickly as compared to my normal trimmer. In summary, if you are looking for a product to do a small amount a trimming, and don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a large trimmer this would work well, if you don&#x27;t have a lot to do!</li>
    <li> Got the styler for free from a Gillette campaign and I could not be more pleased with the product. The different clip-on accessories make it easy to get the look you want with relatively little hassle. The head might be a little too large if you need something rather intricate but for everyday use it works fantastic. Will definitely be coming back to Gillette for just the level of quality they provide in their products.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Proglide for free or through a promotion by Gillette to keep my beard close and sharp. What I love about the product is the razor attachment. Before I was using a trimmer and a razor, now it is all in one. The three size attachment are great though I wish the smallest one was a tad shorter. The quality is great, the price is good and it is very versatile! I am very happy with this product and anyone considering buy it would be happy with their purchase.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it i tried the beard trimmer,and was very impressed with the cut it gave me. It was a very clean and fresh feel. It has 3 different lengths to choose from. It also has an attachment to shave. Both of which shaved close the first time and left a very clean feel. However the second time I used it it seemed to have lost some of its power. However still left a decent shave just not as good as the first time. All in all good product offers options and I recommend to anyone looking to clean up their look at a good price.</li>
    <li> Just received this product free via a program run by Gillette in the mail and really enjoyed it! Really felt that the trimmer provided ample power to accomplish any facial trimming needs with precision. Have tried many other trimmers out there and they didnt provide the even cut of facial hairs that the power trimmer delivers. Good Bang for your Buck!!!!</li>
    <li> I recently received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program that&#x27;s run by Gillette, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Up until now, I was using a Phillips Norelco Trimmer system that had different styling attachments which got the job done for the most part.  However, it&#x27;s been on it&#x27;s last legs so the timing on receiving the new power trimmer was impeccable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so after trimming up the beard a few times with this bad boy I can safely say that this thing does a great job.  It comes with three different trimming guides for different lengths, so you can really get the shave you&#x27;re looking for.  I&#x27;ve been using the #2, which is the middle size, and it cuts my beard to a perfect length.  I also love that this thing is waterproof and has a good rubber grip to keep it in your hand even when wet.  The whole thing comes with a convenient stand, which is nice because it keeps all the attachments perfectly stored.  I also like that this it&#x27;s battery powered.  My Norelco had a rechargeable battery, but the worst was when it died on me mid shave.  It wouldn&#x27;t work while plugged in, so I had to wait to get a charge to finish the job or go out looking like a weirdo.  Fortunately, I no longer have to worry about this since I can just pop in a new battery and be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some things that I don&#x27;t like about this trimmer though.  First, it&#x27;s kind of a pain to clean.  The trimmer edge pushes back so you can wash out any hair that goes down inside, but there are a lot of pieces that just don&#x27;t seem to want to come out.  I&#x27;ve resorted to using a q-tip to get the stubborn stuff out, but even then it doesn&#x27;t work all the time.  Next, the only thing that&#x27;s preventing me from getting rid of my Norelco at this point is the lack of a nose hair trimmer.  Really wish that Gillette had made an attachment for this because it would be this the ideal replacement for a lot of trimmer systems out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I found this to be a great little trimmer and was super ecstatic to receive one for free from Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer as part of a test program provided by Gillette and instantly new it was a winner.  The proven razor was icing on the cake but after the trimmer with and without the combs to manage my mustache and goatee; I found an all in one shaving and trimming tool that covers all areas of my facial needs.  The blades are sharp and move effortlessly across my face, the combs I use to cover various lengths of the mustache and goatee and the trimmer straightens the edges for me.  If your thinking about trying one, rest assured; you will enjoy the versatility and quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to think of this shaver or that I needed another one, but once I started using it, I really liked all the possibilities to use it for. I found myself using it much more frequently. And since it&#x27;s small and compact, it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room and isn&#x27;t a pain to clean up. I&#x27;ll continue to use it in the future. A free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette for this review.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed for my travel bag. Perfect size and will help keep my beard and mustache from getting out of control while on the road.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I do &amp;#34;manscape&amp;#34;. I prefer the clean bald shave. I tried to use this without a guard, that was a mistake. I ended up with several nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I actually enjoyed this so much, I ordered a second one to have and use at home.</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time finding a trimmer that works the way I want it to.  I like to keep my beard a bit longer and the hair on my face grows in several different directions. I have found that trimmers like this often leave my beard looking patchy, as they are good in trimming in one direction but not all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer works really well given that it is only powered by one single battery.  Other plug/rechargeable trimmers and shavers don&#x27;t work any better than this product, and I thought they would at first glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in using the 3 different comb attachments - they seem to all trim to the same length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem very sharp and moved through my beard without any pulling or irritation, which was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;using the shaving cartridge to shave my neck was an interesting experience.  I thought that overall the unit becomes a little to large/tall for shaving such a delicate area.  adding the vibrating experience by turning the power on made me a bit nervous, but the shave was incredibly close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall I would recommend this product for someone who wants to keep their beard very short - almost 5 o&#x27;clock shadow-short.  I would have expected to pay a lot more for this trimmer.  I was able to test this trimmer out for free through a trial program offered by Gillette - but I think it&#x27;s a really good value.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free from a program that is ran by Gillette and it did not disappoint. What I first noticed was how small the display case is and how all of the accessories are easy to access and fit right onto the display case. You can use this trimmer at home or on the go because all it requires is 1 AA battery - which is included. This trimmer was extremely easy to use and helped to style and trim up my facial hair and body hair. I also liked the fact that it is waterproof and can be used in the shower. I would highly recommend this product to all men that need help trimming or styling their facial hair or body hair.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and I was not sure that the Fusion ProGlide would be able to trim it evenly.  I was very surprised on how well it worked.  It was very easy to use and clean.  I used the razor to line my beard and it worked  well with the exception that the head of the blade moved a little to freely.  In order to get a straight line I had to hold the razor from moving.  This is a great product and if you are a person who uses two different blades to trim and shape your beard this will save you time and do a great job.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t trim my side burns, but this gives me the opportunity to do this myself rather than going into the hair place. Although I received this free provided via a program run by Gillette, I would absolutely go out and buy one!!</li>
    <li> Just finished using my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer that was provided free to me via a program run by Gillette. Worked great!!! I normally man-scape with the big old set of hair clippers. First thing that I loved was the ProGlide&#x27;s size, small and easy to use. Next was the fact that it was battery powered. No more cord making things difficult. What surprised me was that is did a great job. Other trimmers pull hair and this one handled it with ease. The biggest reason I love the trimmer is that it is one tool that does it all. No need for different shavers, just pop on the different attachments and go to town.</li>
    <li> I just had the opportunity to try out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler completely. I used it at first to trim around sideburns and keep my beard more tidy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I decided to go clean shaven, so I used the traditional blade. I pushed the power button, and it began to vibrate. While shaving I noticed how smooth the blade was going across my face and the the vibration made it feel almost like I wasn&#x27;t even shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have very sensitive skin, so when I know I have to look clean shaven for something, I make sure to shave a day or two before or I&#x27;ll have patchy red skin. With this, it wasn&#x27;t a problem! It&#x27;s been a long time since I have shaven without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the razor came with multiple trimmers and it certainly gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have been used GIllette products long time ago , But it is the first time I try Fusion. I am happy with this one.&lt;br /&gt;That not cheap at all, but good shaving. I shave 2-3 time/week,&lt;br /&gt;The head of the Fusion have 5 Blades, and is designed to avoid nicks, keep your skin soothed, and provide a smooth, super-close shave.&lt;br /&gt;It is 3 in 1 product, trimmer, cartridge, and comb. really helpful</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a free program run by Gillette. Not just because it was free, but this is a really great combo tool that utilizes the strengths of both a hand and electric razor with the addition of styling (my beard never looked so good)! Accurate, quick, portable, and very easy to use on my weekend trips. Can&#x27;t go back to my old razor after this!</li>
    <li> I have had trouble finding a good trimmer in the past, and so I was intrigued to receive this for free in a promotion run by Gillette. I am very happy with the trimmer and would happily purchase it, it has done a fantastic job of helping me tame my goatee and sideburns, and my wife has commented on how neat and trim they look</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a week and a half since I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer which was provided to me for free to review by a program run by Gillette. The trimmer works great on my beard to keep it nice and trim. I have read a some reviews that say it lacks in power, but I found that it worked just fine with trimming my beard with no tugging of hair. The Trim combs were great it give you enough options for any size beard. As for the shaver it works just the same as the manual ProGlide, which is to say smooth. No tugging or pulling, it did not nik my face, it ran smoothly thru my face leaving a fresh smooth feeling skin. And like the manual ProGlide the precision trimmer in the back worked great to shape my beard and mustache. Overall, it was a well thought out product taking everything into consideration and packaging it in one tool, it&#x27;s even shower safe. I am very impressed with the Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer!!! Would definitely encourage you to get one.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free via a program run by Gillette.  The trimmer works well and has three combs for different lengths.  The razor performs extremely well, although it is a bit bulky.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free to try by Gillette. This product is awesome! The fact that is very powerful AND waterproof makes it a hit. The only downside is its a bit bulky to shave with everyday but as a general trimmer and maintenance tool it&#x27;s great! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> First off, huge thanks to Gillette for accepting me into one of their programs which allowed me to be a test agent for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer! I&#x27;ve been a faithful Gillette man for nearly my entire adult life. And I plan to stay that way! My levels of excitement and anticipation majorly rose when I finally held the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. The packaging is awesome!!! Very modern, almost \\&quot;man chic\\&quot;, compact, and makes for secure travel/shipping. It definitely blows competitors out of the water with initial visual packaging and design. I like to do these tests without reading the provided directions, in order to test a product&#x27;s intuitive nature. This bad boy is pretty intuitive! Nothing took me more than a minute or two to figure out. That being said, while I appreciate how well they package said bad boy, it took a little doing to get the actual parts out of their plastic casings. Thankfully, you can remove them all individually. And the complete outer packaging was amazingly simple! Remove tape, press two tabs in, pop open, and voila! Once out of the package, I LOVED the look of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer as it sat on my bathroom shelving! It takes up hardly any space, and actually adds to the decor. On first unwrapped sight, I was a little worried about the smaller surface area of the trimmer not being able to do the job. But I reserved judgment for actual use. Fortunately, I really loved that everything fit in the sleek holster, there&#x27;s no cumbersome charger to store elsewhere, and that the trimmer guards having their own hide-away section in the back! Now to get down to business! I have to put out there that I&#x27;m a medium-big, burly dude. So my man-scaping takes a lot more doing than a little bit of attention to kibbles and bits. If you&#x27;re a smaller-built and/or less burly dude, I think the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer could work for your head-to-toe needs. For me, the smallersize of this trimmer made my larger-area man-scaping take 2-to-3 times a long as with other, larger trimmers. Because of this, I had to change my battery mid-scape (fortunately, all you have to do is twist the trimmer at the mid-point, and there ya go!). This took a few points away from the \\&quot;no charger props\\&quot; because I&#x27;ll go through batteries more quickly than usual if I stick with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for full scaping. On the plus side, I found that the trimmer without the guard worked well even under wet conditions. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer doesn&#x27;t come with a special trimmer/clipper brush...but I used a coarse hair brush to keep the blades clean, and had no problem. The guards were a different matter. I have to regrettably say that I didn&#x27;t find the guards to work well. Hair became caught under them, it was difficult to remove said hair without shutting off the trimmer, removing the guard, and cleaning it. In the end, I had to resort to the other trimmer I had for my larger, more burly areas. That said, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is hands down the best kibbles and bits scaper I have ever used! Not one nick, scratch, bump, or moment of fear. There is no way I&#x27;m ever using another trimmer for those endeavors! Overall, I recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer! I think it&#x27;s all about your personal needs, build, burliness, and all that jazz. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this as my sole \\&quot;special\\&quot; trimmer, and as a back-up if my other one needs charging mid-scape.</li>
    <li> I was able to test this trimmer thanks to a promotion by Gillette. This is the perfect tool for anyone that enjoys keeping a sculpted beard or \\&quot;manscaping.\\&quot; The precision blade made clean, precise lines and allowed me to trim back some of the hair I did not did flattering. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome trimmer. It comes with 3 extra guards &amp; a razor head. It trims nicely &amp; you can use it wet or dry in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is great for shaving small areas of you face and works great! I would recommend this to anyone wanting to shave the small areas!</li>
    <li> Mine broke after the first use. A huge disappointment and had to send my wife to the store to buy a replacement.  Not good, enough said</li>
    <li> This Gillette razor is worth the $20 it costs. I&#x27;ve used it several times already in the few days I&#x27;ve owned it. It&#x27;s great for shaving and the trimmer on the back is extremely powerful and handy. Every guy should have this on his sink for a fast, clean trim or shave.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaver I would ever buy. No price is too great. Shaves close with no nicks or cuts!  I wouldnt buy any other razor.</li>
    <li> The Gillette styler and trimmer is great for trimming up your facial hair and shaping up! I will continue to use it in the future. I would recommend all guys that shape and trim their facial hair purchase 1!!!</li>
    <li> I let my facial hair grow out a good bit, and my wife kept saying I was \\&quot;scratchy\\&quot;. It was so nice to have an all in 1 trimmer that does not pull AT ALL and leaves my face \\&quot;baby smooth\\&quot;. I did recieve this razor free from a program run by Gillette, and I do absolutely love it. It is a little hard to get the hair out after you shave if you leave it extra long though, would be nice if it came with a little brush like normal trimmers do!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for use daily. As a student I am always looking for a product that will last. I was pleasantly surprised by this trimmer. It&#x27;s a lot more solid than those things with the trimmer on one side and the razor on the other that breaks after a few uses. The trimmer is powerful, and is powered by a AA battery in a strong casing that screws closed and appears to be waterproof. My only problem I see with it is the trimmer guards it comes with are held on by a hard plastic tab on the back that looks like they may snap off easily. With care though I am confident this tool will last me a long time. It is indispensable. I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Styler packet from a free program by Gillette and have used it consistently since.&lt;br /&gt;I have a full beard and a bald head.  I typically keep it bald, but I wanted to put the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler to the test.  This is a very solidly built Braun trimmer, badged by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew my head out for three days to get all fuzzy and also wanted to trim my Hockey Playoff beard down since the Wings were eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proglide trimmer does definitely knock down the scrum from an unshaved head to a skin tight stubble.  I did this in the shower my scalp soft and pliable.  Then I attached the ProGlide Razor and finished the job with shaving cream.  The new Proglide blades are definitely thinner and as I have sensitive skin, it didnt leave any irritation or skin burn feel after shaving, like the earlier fusion blades.  Now, I know if I skip a day or two of shaving my head I can knock it back down with no irritation or pulling that some trimmers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enclosed with the trimmer are 3 different styling guide combs.  I wanted to sculp the beard, and not get rid of it entirely.  This tool is a basic, but solid trimmer.  It is not going to cut 3\\&quot; of beard by itself. I took a regular comb, and using it as a backer (like a barber would) used the trimmer with no attachment to take the beard down to a managable level.  Then I used the #3 comb attached to take it to a beautiful 1\\&quot; round and switched back to the normal trimmer to cut the hard lines of the beard (clean line on the neck and in with no effort at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to manscape a bit lower. The Proglide Styler manages to knock everything very quickly and the Proglide Razor attachment takes care of the rest very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Actually dropped the trimmer twice by accident and love how durable the ProGlide Styler is and how easy it is to clean, as the blade pops right open and freely rinses.</li>
    <li> I really like the styler. Small and compact.the Proglide blades work great .smooth shave with out skin burn. The buzz trimmer is easy to use comes with a few size combs give a nice even cut. The edget trimmer  is good but not great doesn&#x27;t really give a crisp clean edge. I recieved the product for free through a program.by gilette.Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product and was shocked it was only $20</li>
    <li> I was provided a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer by the company and asked to write a review. First let me start with I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, past military with a mustache and goatee and I have eyebrows that would have impressed Jack Elam which must be regularly mowed into submission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was it is a bit fancy and comes in a very large (and a bit wasteful) plastic box but it fits the hand well and doesn&#x27;t try to slip even when wet. I like the water proof feature as it&#x27;s very convenient to do my trimming while showering. It comes with three attachments of very appropriate lengths, runs off of a single AA battery and has surprising power. I&#x27;ve used rechargeable types which don&#x27;t last as long from a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it works real well at keeping the hair off my ears between hair cuts, trimming up my mustache, beard, eyebrows and the wonderful ear tufts that come with the onset of wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to travel and it fits very nicely in my grooming bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all devices there were a few of things I was not so happy with. The storage stand which if you don&#x27;t have a nice large shelf in your shower really has no place to be. It would have been nice if they could have come up with an optional suction cup system for attaching it to the side of the shower. The  packaging, there was probably more plastic there to be tossed out than there was in the trimmer itself. And lastly cleaning the trimmer. The instruction show just open it and run water through it. Well the shower has not had enough pressure to do that and I&#x27;ve found to really clean it I need to wait till it drys out and then use a small razor brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line I like it. It&#x27;s  compact, cuts well and waterproof. You could even take it camping since you don&#x27;t have to worry about a charging system and if you want to be green about it a rechargeable battery with a solar charger and you are all set.</li>
    <li> This is all I need for my grooming needs. Its a great trimmer that takes on the THICKEST of hairs with ease. And brings the close fusion shaving aspect with it as well. WASHABLE in the sink after each use just open the trimmer hatch and let water fall on it. So easy so affordable.</li>
    <li> I received this styler for free via a program run by Gillette. It is quiet, easy to use and works great. I like the versatility of it and how easy you can change the attachments. It makes my shaving routine so much easier and I love how smooth my face feels after using the styler. I have recommended this to all my friends and family. Great product!</li>
    <li> I received the power trimmer for free through a Gillette promotion. I honestly love this thing. The trimmer is great for edging and styling my sideburns. It is actually a lot smaller than what I thought it would be; its very comfortable to hold and operate. It has like a grip texture on the outside, this is great for when your hands are wet in front of the sink. One thing I was afraid of was that it would be difficult to clean. It is so much easier than my old beard trimmer. It operates on batteries, but honestly I&#x27;ve had the same batteries in there for a month, and I shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t really care for was the guards for the trimmer. You get three, and it seems the setting I want is between two of the sizes provided. My old beard trimmer used to have an adjustable guard so you could find just the right length you want. This provides you with three options. Also, I could really do without the stand itself. I get it, its supposed to utilize space efficiently, but in the end its a cheap piece of plastic that retains moisture and gets knocked over CONSTANTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In interest of full disclosure, I use this for man-scaping. It is excellent, and I have not nicked myself once. Not once. Nor do I end up all rashy and razorburned. I love this thing, definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer through a program ran by Gillette.  I liked this razor.  I liked that it could be used in the shower or not, so it didn&#x27;t matter if anything got wet.  It gave me a close shave.  The blades I think worked better with this system than they did while using the manual ProGlide Razor.  Overall, I have to give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Note: Razor was free and provided via a program run by Gillette. An amazing product. Price is reasonable for the first kit. The refills are pricey. Again, it&#x27;s a really great product. I like the options and variety it allows you to have when you groom yourself in a organized little caddy. My wife takes up most of the counter space, so it fits just right. It&#x27;s also great that you can take it in the shower for a quick shave. It&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
    <li> I got to try this trimmer through a program that was sponcered by Gillette.  I was surprised by how well it performed.  It trimmed great &amp; is lightweight &amp; easy to use being battery operated is also a plus.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  The only Con I found was it didn&#x27;t come with a cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> I think this is a really great styler for beards, mustaches ect. My only complaint is the sizing options for the trimmer. I think there should be more. I have a pretty full beard and it should be able to accommodate to it. Other that this is a great item. I got this item for free to try via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I got a chance to try this product for free via a program run by Gillette. It does a really great job on sideburns and eyebrows. The handle on it is very comfortable making it really easy to use, without dropping it. The blades last a long time and give you a smooth feel to your face. Gillette has always made great products and the Fusion Proglide is no exception. I will continue using this styler over a regular razor anyday!</li>
    <li> This Razor is Excellent,Hubby It Cuts Great and it is not dull It rim all of the unwanted Facial hair this is a Great Product and it works great.This were A  free razor and was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver. I got this product for free via a program run by Gillette. High quality material and handy accessory makes it the best shaver on the planet in this price range. Every tool snaps in flawlessly. Love this product very much!</li>
    <li> I just want to start off by saying I have been a loyal Gillette user since the day I started shaving. I have also grown to love the shaving products as well, shaving gel and after shave are a must for me. I had high expectations of it because I am so thoroughly happy with my other gillette razor and products. This was my first time trying a battery powered razor and new it was either going to be the next best thing or I was going to be left running back to my regular shaving stick.&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression of it was its an okay a razor I much prefer my regular simple razor but in a pinch this one could get the job done. I did notice after the first shave the blades didn&#x27;t seem to get as close as a shave. Plus points for the versatility of the 3 different combs and a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the end all be all of razors for me but for the person on a budget that needs the versatility I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide  free via a program by Gillette. I really enjoyed this razor and the overall pack. It was nice and sharp and will surely be buying it soon!</li>
    <li> Shaver provided adequate shaving of my chest, back and mustache! I loved that I didn&#x27;t have to change full items for each task. I loved it! It was a great free item from Gillette!! I will not use any other brand!</li>
    <li> Was very impressed. Small razor packs a lot of power. Great for trimming my sideburns and back of my hairline. My teenage son uses it to trim his facial hair and it did a great job. Handle is easy to hold and power has held up great. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a free promotion I received from Gillette which truthfully is the only way I would have tried it.  I was a little skeptical at first, using it to trim my beard.  It did an ok job at the beard, but once I decided to try it in the shower to trim everything else, it worked much better.  this is probably because I have quite a bit of hair.  This is the first trimmer that I have found to be good in and out of the shower.  The bonus is that you can also attach a regular shaving cartridge to it.  Having used this, I would now buy one if I breka or lose this one.</li>
    <li> I like this razor because of its usefulness, it has everything I need to get the shave I want, good product</li>
    <li> The styler is very good for the beginners as it had all the required equipment in a single product and quite easy to use,this free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and thethe shave is close,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer does a neat job and the plastic is quite cheap and feels very light... the styler is one very good product for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the beginners who dont want to spend more money ..worth  the money and good product</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from Gillette a few weeks ago.  I don&#x27;t have any facial hair (use the proglide razor) but my sideburns get a little crazy and wanted to see it this can keep them in check between haircuts.  It worked great.  Next was the hair on my neck.  The wife had to go this one which made me and her real nervous.  But she did a great job.  She continued on to a couple of little spots on my back and it worked great, but I need to do it every couple of week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got real brave.  Never had the desire to have a shaved chest being a real man, but I decided to clean it up a little.  Looked ok but the next day it itched like crazy.  May try other areas but the chest is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really like the trimmer.  Worked great and was easy to use.  The different heads were great also. Wasn&#x27;t as scary as a big trimmer.  My 5 year old son even let me use it on his neck and he does not like the big trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I first got this from Gillete to &#x27;give it a test drive&#x27; for free and determine the quality of the product, I thought that i would have to sacrafice quality for convenience, but I was pleasently suprised when I started using.  I used the styler on my stomach and chest and it did a fantastic job at getting hard to reach areas and sensitive areas without irritation and with ease.  Once I finished and attached the razor, I PREFER THE RAZOR ON THIS STYLER OVER THE TRADITIONAL RAZORS, I was able to have more control off the blades and able to reach areas that I typically have trouble with.  The only thing I wish is the battery life, but with the speed and precision of this tool, it is a very minor detail.  This product is comparable to a $120 set that I also have and I am using this over the other; this is a very wonderful product with premium features in a compact design.  The set has a very sleek, compact holding compartment for all of the accessories. For any guy who manscapes and enjoys precision, control and no irritation, this is a MUST-BUY.</li>
    <li> Designed by Braun, this thing is cheap and works well not great but well. Good for travel or shower use</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this out via a free promotion done by gillette &amp; I have to say I&#x27;ve always loved their razors &amp; how infrequently I&#x27;d have to shave due to it&#x27;s closeness. I&#x27;ve never been on to beard it up but decided to get lazy for the summer so it would give me an opportunity to try out this trimmer. I&#x27;ve used a couple of trimmers before &amp; have to say that this one in particular does it&#x27;s job slightly better as I&#x27;ve had NO issues with hair pull since using it, unlike the others. I also let my brother try it out since his trimmer recently died &amp; he definitely Loves it :) for me, however, I just simply love the convenience in the interchangeable razor &amp; trimmer heads. No more searching for that pesky razor wherever you may have taken it or what bag it was left in since your last few trips (i travel a lot) that &amp; anything that keeps from congesting the bathroom sink area is a HUGE plus for me :) simply put, if you have those urges to beard it up but also like to go for that clean shaven look every so often, this is the PERFECT combo for you!!!</li>
    <li> Great tool it&#x27;s small enough to detail yet large enough to trim my whole beard without me having to bring out my clippers. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I must admit I got this product from Gillette as part of a testing program. I love their products anyway, so I thought, &#x27;what the heck!&#x27;.  I was not disappointed. This ProGlide system seems to handle any grooming need a man might have. I trimmed my (gross, irritating, wolf-like!) nape hair with ease, and the grip for shaving is awesome. It really feels hefty in hand, but not too weighty or bulky, like a comfortable favorite pen.  The only problem I encountered was using the sideburn trimmer. It tended to pull and not cut a smoothly as I would have liked; however, I don&#x27;t trim my sideburns very often as my hair is long enough to cover it, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, I like it, and would recommend any guy to at least give it a shot before dropping a small wad on a more expensive item.</li>
    <li> The Pro Glider Trimmer by Gillette is a great idea. My wife usually uses electric clippers on me to trim my sideburns and ears etc., sometimes she uses scissors if she can&#x27;t get close enough to trim everything. I flinch because the scissors are so close to my face which doesn&#x27;t help. I have never used a trimmer like this before and I think it is great. It works nicely to shape my sideburns and trim my ears. It&#x27;s a close shave. It&#x27;s quiet so when it&#x27;s near my ears it isn&#x27;t too loud. I also like that it has it&#x27;s own stand. It doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in our small bathroom. It is also water proof if I want to use it in the shower. It uses regular size batteries, nothing special. I think it is a great product!</li>
    <li> So, I got this razor as part of a free program run by Gillette. It came to my house a few weeks ago, right before I was supposed to head out for a date - fortuitous, right? Well, I tried it out while I was doing my pre-date maintenance ... and damned if it didn&#x27;t work like a charm for me. I mean, the date sucked, but I felt good through it. It&#x27;s a great, flexible trim for all of the hair I&#x27;ve got (and it&#x27;s a lot of it); no nicks, no burns, no annoyances, just a good, close trim. It&#x27;s easy to clean, and the attachments are the perfect length - I like to use one on the top half of my goatee and a smaller one for the bottom half. It works, trust me. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about it? It looks sleek. I can fit it into the bathroom and it goes well with all of the stuff my female roommates have hanging around. I need to carve out that little bit of manhood in the bathroom!</li>
    <li> Its a good trimmer for short haired body/face hair. Works good and easy clean up. wish it had more attachable heads to power through the more scruffy beards but its a start. Also got it free through a promotion Gillette is running.</li>
    <li> I received Gillette&#x27;s powered Fusion ProGlide razor as part of a trial program through Gillette for free and was very excited to try it out. The package came with 1 blade and 1 AA battery, as well as a stand and beard trimming attachments. In addition to being a razor, it is also a trimmer/ styler. The attachments come in 3 different lengths for trimming and simply clip on.  This allows you to choose one geared specifically for the length you want.  All accessories attach and disassemble very easily. The trimmer works great. It would work well for maintaining and cleaning up a goatee or other facial hair. The three variable lengths seem to be adequate for most facial hair lengths. The trimmer could easily be used on facial hair, ears, and back of neck. I highly recommend this trimmer for small jobs as it doesn&#x27;t have the strength to go through thick hair.  It is a great value.</li>
    <li> He likes the size and ease of handling for his sideburns and goatee... he also loves the attachable razor blade and says it is very easy to shave with!</li>
    <li> I have always used an electric razor for trimming my beard and any other touch ups needed so the ease of having one that can be used in the shower was great. its small enough to carry with me to the gym and still powerful enough that it does not take all day like some others I have tried. I would buy this even if I had not got it for free from Gillette. Will be getting one for my son so he does not take mine.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about razors and most cut up my face. I normally use gillette custom plus pivot disposable razors but when Gillette offered me the opportunity to try this Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 I was very excited to try it out. The razor works wonderful and the blades last alot longer than the disposables i have been using which is a money saver!  Also the trimmer options work great to trim up your body hair. Especially during the summer I like to keep my chest and armpit hair shorter due to the heat and this does the job great I would definitely purchase this product. I have already purchased a blade refill pack and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The attachments are very fragile not meant for rough handling. It&#x27;s made from plastic and looks as if it might crack if not handled properly</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free via a program run by Gillette.  I think it works just OK. I have thick facial hair so it had some trouble cutting through my beard. I think it would probably work great for somebody with thinner facial hair. I don&#x27;t dislike the trimmer, I will continue to use it for smaller jobs trimming my facial hair, but for larger trims I need something more powerful.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide from a program run by Gillette, and I&#x27;ve been largely satisfied with it. It certainly didn&#x27;t blow me away and there are several enhancements I would suggest, but it is a very competent and useful device.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it provided a nifty little stand that sits gracefully on your bathroom counter, but there really isn&#x27;t anything special about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is rather bulky. The handle is disproportionately large, dwarfing the blade head. It looks rather comical, and it&#x27;s not exceptionally comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has no nose/ear hair trimmer. The default styler is too wide to be of any use in those areas. For a razor that looks like a luxury tool, I would like more functionality out of it.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is powered by a AA battery. If the razor&#x27;s stand could recharge a built-in battery, the razor would be more remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s by no means a bad product, but that same amount of money would be better spent on a more basic Gillette razor and replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer through a Gillette promotion, but I would definitely buy it if I were in the market. It feels very well put together. I like the locking mechanism for the attachments and the fixed guard sizes. Other trimmers I&#x27;ve had use adjustable guards, and they always become a problem. It comes with a nice little organizer to hold everything. It does a good job for me. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap styler so don&#x27;t expect very high quality, but it definitely outperformed what I thought it would do. I got to try it for free from Gillette so I was interested in seeing how it would work. This was great for \\&quot;manscaping.\\&quot; It trimmed my body hair down to an acceptable level for the wife, however the styler didn&#x27;t seem very effective. It would take multiple attempts to get my hair somewhat close to what I wanted. If you are looking to just cut down on some of your excess body hair, this will be great for you. However if you want something to get that chinstrap look for your beard, I would suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure up front: I received this product for free through a promotional program run by Gillette. That being said, I was in the market for a beard trimmer/body grooming tool, and due to past positive experiences with Gillette products, would likely have tried the Fusion ProGlide Styler regardless of being selected for the free program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall design of the product is quite nice. The handle is light and fits nicely in the hand. I also like that the product attempts to be an all-in-one solution, allowing you to shave, trim, and edge with a single device. Would be a great solution when traveling, especially when considering there is not a separate power cord to be packed since it runs off a single battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few weeks, I have used all of the functions of the Styler. I performs well as an edging device, cleaning up my sideburns easily. I was also pleased with the beard trimmer, which worked well and did not irritate my skin or feel like it was pulling at the hairs in my face. I also did a test of using the Styler to trim my chest hair and found that it was easy and effective as a body grooming device in this capacity. The ProGlide Styler also allows you to attach a Fusion razor blade for standard shaving. This was the only function that I felt the Styler was not great for, as the size of the handle and length when using with the razor blade attachment did not feel comfortable to me and prevented me from getting as good a shave as when using my standard razor. For someone using this at home, I would recommend using a standard razor for shaving and using the Styler solely as a trimmer/edger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general I was happy with the Fusion ProGlide Styler. I would recommend it to someone who was looking for a cost-effective beard trimmer or body groomer. I would also recommend highly for anyone traveling who was looking for a simple all-in-one device to take with them. I am taking away one star from my review due to the awkwardness of using the Styler for shaving purposes, but again, think this could be overlooked if I was using this on the road instead of in my home where I have my standard razor.</li>
    <li> After my styler came in the mail, I was eager to try this free styler that I received from a program sponsored by Gillette Being in the military, this razor comes in handy a lot. It is great for keeping your sideburns and hairline looking nice and neat while providing ultimate comfort. The trimmer felt great and did not pinch any of my skin in the process. I would definately recommend this styler to someone else!I cannot think of anything about this styler that would be negative.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer free of charge thru a program that was run by Gillette. That in no way alters my opinion of this product. So let me just say that this is by far the best trimmer of used. Very easy straight forward to use and switch out the different accessories. It provides a quick shave without feeling like I&#x27;m going to cut myself. I mostly use it to clean up my sideburns and around my ears and neck area. Like I said, very simple and easy to use. My teenage boys have even started using it for the same as I listed about. Will definitely keep using and would recommend this product to anyone needing a great multi-function styler.</li>
    <li> I use the Fusion Proglide razor but this 3-in-1 Styler is a better buy and I am glad that i ordered it.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I got the razor free because it was provided via a program run by Gillette. I love the razor and have used it quite a bit now. I&#x27;ve used the trimmer part a few times, but as I do not have a beard or mustache and I didnt have a lot of use for it. I did use it to maintain my side burns and for some minor trim ups around my hairline. Did the same on my three boys. I can see how if you did have facial hair to maintain that this would be very handy to have around.</li>
    <li> The Gillette ProGlide Styler is one of the most complete shaving accessories that I have ever used. While the trimmer is significantly larger than your typical razor, it still manages to get the job done in a big way. I was able to test this product for free through a trial from Gillette. The trimmer is great for styling your beard, mustache, sideburns, and almost any type of facial hair that you wish to grow. The part that I liked most about this product was that the trimmer was able to shave areas of my face that are harder to reach, that a normal razor would not be able to get to. This product sells for around $20, which is really a steal for all that it can do for you. I highly recommend this product to men with any range of facial hair.</li>
    <li> I got to try this for free and it surpassed my expectations.  I was expecting something cheap, but this is a quality product.</li>
    <li> I received one of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer sets as part of a promotion run by Gillette.  I have to say that it is a great product.  I use each of the heads for different purposes.  I use the razor and edger to clean up the edges of my beard.  I then use the trimmer to trim my beard.  It also comes with a nice stand that organizes everything for you and a case that makes it easy to travel with.  The only thing that I wish it came with were some longer trimming options.  The trimmer heads are pretty short so a longer option would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a must-have for any man, especially if you have a neatly-trimmed beard.</li>
    <li> [DISCLOSURE] I received this razor free through a program from Gillette. I am generally an electric user - I last used a blade back in the days when 3 blades was considered extreme. Razor technology seems to have come a long way. 5 blades does shave faster than 3, and the vibration gives it a soothing feel. (I&#x27;m not sure it buys you much as far as a closer shave.) In general I still prefer an electric. I just cut myself too often with a blade. Maybe I&#x27;m just a klutz. Still, for the price difference between this and an electric, the shave is comparable. The trimmer attachments seem to work well, and I love the idea of only having one device, but I didn&#x27;t use them much. My wife doesn&#x27;t want me to tinker with my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have one big gripe with it, however. I found the handle to be quite anti-ergonomic when holding the razor in a non-vertical position. For example, when shaving under my chin, the grip I used caused a fair bit of fatigue in my hand. Because of this, I would use this razor in a pinch, but likely would not make it my full-time shaver. The advantage of the vibration, for me, doesn&#x27;t offset the need to make the handle so thick and stocky to accommodate the battery.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer threw a free promotion that Gillette had going on. And i am very glad to have had the opportunity to try this shaver. I keep my face clean shaven so it is great around the ears and helps recover from when I decide to skip a couple of days. I even use it now to keep my sons hair trimmed in between barber visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gillette for keeping power and comfort in mind in this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I got this razor thru a promotion from gillette. This razor was very easy to use. I did shave in the shower with it and it did not short out. The attachments were incredible. They provided me with just the right trim.</li>
    <li> And as Gillette products go this is a pretty good styler/razor. However, my only wish is that there was a brush addition that would allow for a bit more control of the grooming. Otherwise, definitely something that will get a lot of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I had received this razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received this during a free promotion from Gillette.  I was skeptical at first, but this razor is hands down the best I have come across.  I actually enjoy shaving now!  Best of all I only need this one razor instead of a dozen tools.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to review from Gillette. As such, I was harder on it than I would be on other similar products. I threw my Duck Dynasty starter beard under the bus and tried all the attachments. This product handled everything I asked of it. I shaved my head with no difficulty. Then, the ultimate test came up. My son wanted to get rid of his thick mop of hair  in order to feel cooler for summer. This product, although obviously not designed for the heavy job of shaving my hippie son&#x27;s noggin worked very hard and performed admirably. I would recommend this product to anyone. There are no negatives or drawbacks that I can see in regards to using this fine product.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler free as part of a Gillette promotion.  There were things I liked and disliked about the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Overall a great trimmer for my beard and mustache.  The three attachments were good in helping vary the lengths of my beard, mustache, and goatee.  Convenient for travel, requiring only a AA battery.  Does an adequate job of lining the beard area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The trimmer while good for the face, is not so good at grooming body hair.  Any individual having more coarse body hair (or even facial hair) may find it lacks the power to quickly perform this task.  In addition, the trimmer requires oiling after rinsing out, but no trimmer oil was included.  Not as precise as I would have expected when lining the beard/mustache area, but adequate for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent trimmer for the roughly $17 price tag, but would probably only purchase with a coupon.  I give it 3 stars because it did not live up to my expectations as a body groomer.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to try this product free from a program put on by Gillette. I groom by face/body often so I have many pieces and products laying around the bathroom that gets on my fiances nerves to say the least. I was impressed by the Proglide styler after trying it, it was everything I needed all in one. Trimmed my face well with smoothe lines, and also did a great job taming my chest, back and shoulder hair as well. The holder it comes with is convenient for leaving on the bathroom counter to keep all pieces organized which makes my fiancé happy!</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this through a promotion from Gillette. I was hesitant at first using this because I was using another product at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a little while I have come to love this. I love how it has multiple attachments and is portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this and I will continue to use this product!!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this razor as part of a program run by Gillette. It&#x27;s a great unit cuts nice and close. I love that I can use it to shave and trim up my side burns while still in the shower.  I found it much better than of the other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past due to it being waterproof and powered. The vibration really does make a difference, especially on sensitive skin like mine. I would recommend it to everyone who shaves and needs a trimmer (can&#x27;t beat the all in one factor).  It is a bit large (I store my razors in the shower) but it&#x27;s really not that bad and once I found a home for it, it worked out great!</li>
    <li> I was provided this Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack via a program Gillette ran.It sure is my new favorite tool to groom with! It&#x27;s got a lot of nice features that more expensive stylers have, but for around only $20, plus it&#x27;s water proof for use in the shower! First off let&#x27;s start with the fact that it uses pro-glide fusion disposable cartridges, how amazing is that? I can now toss out my old fusion power pro-glide handle since this one works even better. The cartridge snaps right onto the top of the styler, and with the press of the on button, it vibrates just as well, if not better than the standard power handles on the disposable shavers.It is also very easy to clean,You just press a small button and the trimmer pops up and just run water to wash all the hair out. That easy.The kit includes enough accessories to make even the most high maintenance well-groomed person happy.It has 3 trimmer tools so you can get as close as you want to sideburns, beards, mustache and eyebrows.I am it&#x27;s fan.</li>
    <li> I received this razor to test out for free and loved it.  Greatest man-scaping tool, ever! No need to buy anything else. It&#x27;s quick and easy. Felt good and did a good job! Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> This product was great.  I got it for free in a program run by Gillette, so I gave it a try.  It was easy to use and I like that the handle was a little bulkier.  I was able to hold on to it a little easier and it feels sturdy.  It really feels like an expensive product without having a big price tag.</li>
    <li> I received this awesome product Free from a Gillette sponsored program.I was rather skeptical in actually buying it when I had seen it on shelf judging it won&#x27;t compare to the expensive stylers out there.So I was rather excited in trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would start with pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenient handle,easy grip and maneuvering.&lt;br /&gt;Precision and clean trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Different comb sizes for lengths desired.&lt;br /&gt;Easy cleaning.The styler has a hatch that can be popped off and snap right back on, allowing to remove stuck hair that results in jamming of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;Uses gillette fusion proglide razors catrdiges.Those are the best out there.Clean,proximate cuts.You can forget all about the nicks and scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some cons are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not designed for heavy-duty cutting.Like cutting bigger beards.&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication of blades need to be increased.(Can be overcome by use of post-shave balm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the product is amazing for its price.It is helping me keep groomed these days.I would definitely buy it in future.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power trimmer is great!  I received a free sample as part of being a BzzAgent reviewer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now and have been very happy with the results.  Battery life is very good, as I haven&#x27;t had to change them out in the six months I&#x27;ve used it.  The product comes with three attachments for grooming facial hair to different lengths.  If you have facial hair and need a professional quality groomer then this is the product for you.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve had with it so far.  Go get one!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by the ease of use this razor/trimmer was/is. It works great! I like how compact it is and how surprisingly powerful it is to trim my beard. It has 3 length settings although 1 more would be preferred for a little longer, but that is fine. It does not detract from the product. The razor tho this is extremely sharp and gives a great shave. I just love how small it is compared to the electric beard trimmer I had. So far I have used it over a dozen times and the battery is still running strong. 1 AA battery for this unit is great and keeps it light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a really good product. I received this for free from Gillette to try, and I am so glad i got it. It works awesome!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is not all the hype everyone describes it to be. After I got this razor I used it for a week. At first I really liked the shave, but the credit to the smooth shave needs to go to gillette&#x27;s razors. I liked the grip of the ProGlide Styler, however after just one week the razor it started to make a loud humming noise, and then just quit. I will never waste my money on this product. If you are looking for an alternative, I would look elsewhere; however Gillette razor makes an excellent razor for shaving.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler for free via a program run by Gillette.  I have always been a user of Gillette but this took shaving to the next level.  I so often have to use two blades to get a close shave, one for getting the original hair of me and another single blade to get at hard to reach places like right under my nose and this trimmer helps me do all that at once.  The trimmer itself is not the most powerful motor but it should do what it needs to do an the greatest part is that it a perfect shaver to travel with, especially when you are packing light.  I would endorse this product for buying.</li>
    <li> I got a GILLETTE® FUSION® PROGLIDE STYLER which includes a Gillette Fusion Pro-glide 4-blade razor attachment. I have always been a Pro-glide razor fan. I got the Styler for my mustache and other out-of-control facial foliage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of the product was what really impressed me. Easy to open, well organized daily-use storage unit with little cubbies for each of the 3 clipper attachments and one for the Pro-glide razor and the primary styler itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styler is high quality, heavy/solid with rubber non-slip grip. Easy to clean, clip-on/clip-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styler is quiet yet powerful and precise clipper unit. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this styler as a free product provided via a program run by Gillette. For the price it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. It worked well on my body hair, didn&#x27;t get as close as I would have liked though. However it did work really well on my sideburns. I especially loved the many attachments I had to choose from so I could pick how close a shave I wanted.</li>
    <li> this is the perfect all in one styler. My face feels so smooth plus I can trim my style right up. I always am prepared now thanks to this awesome product.</li>
    <li> I was provided the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a program run by Gillette. I was skeptical at first, but as soon as I tried the trimmer out, all my skepticism was blown away. The trimmer is much smaller than counterparts available making it great for both home and travel use. It also provide such a close trim and allows me to be professionally grungy! It&#x27;s easy and simple to use. I&#x27;m a convert and plan on buying a set for both my dad and brother.</li>
    <li> I participated in a trial being run by Gillette and received the power trimmer free to review. It was great. Starting with the packaging it comes with a little stand that holds all the attachments, the Power Trimmer handle, and the razor blade attachment.&lt;br /&gt;The it worked very well the first time I used it. I tried it on all the trimming areas one would want and got good results from all of them. Worked on the back of my neck, ears, underarms, chest, back, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am a Shower Shaver and love the fact that the Power Trimmer is safe in the shower and that means I don&#x27;t have to have a trimmer as well as a razor. I have both in one and it works in and out of the shower. It was surprising how well it worked!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I noticed was that it worked exceptionally well on course hair and only moderately well on fine hair. Other than that I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler razor from a promotion that Gillette was running, and I&#x27;ve not seen anything bad about it. I have been using the trimmers for about 2 weeks. There excelent! Unlike some razors, it cuts smoothly, it stays sharp, it runs off batteries instead of plugging it in the wall, and it has nice looking stand to put it in with all the accessories that come with it.&lt;br /&gt; The razor itself is amazing. It cuts me perfectly with no trouble at all. The razor is easy to clean. After you use your razor, just press firmly against the blades untill it opens and wash out with water. Its waterproof, so you can use it in the shower. The stand that comes with it looks very nice. The stand is organized perfectly. You can also hold it with comfort.&lt;br /&gt; There are three different trimers that come with it: small(1), medium(2), and large(3). The medium works best for me. The razor trims great and effectively.&lt;br /&gt; I gave this razor a 5-out-of-5 stars beacause it works great, feels great to hold it, it runs off baterries, its waterproof, and has a great stand.&lt;br /&gt; For under $20, the Gillette Styler really can&#x27;t be beat. It&#x27;s cheap in price, high quality, comes with a lot of accessories, and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> A little about my face.  I have a mustache with a goatee, with fairly coarse and thick hair.  I typically will let it grow for a few weeks, then will use a beard trimmer to get it down a bit, before using a shaving trimmer to get even closer, before attempting a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler as a promotion from Gillette.  I first pulled out the package and looked it over, looking to charge it for the first use, but found nothing to connect.  Then I realized, there was already a AA battery inside the unit, so it came ready to go.  Since my beard is fairly long, I wasn&#x27;t sure the trimmer guards would work well, but still wanted to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t start with a beard trimmer trim first, and dove straight in.  The Proglide Styler didn&#x27;t pull or tug on any of the hairs, but cut right through.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll have to do a double pass to get everything, but no such issues here either.  While it didn&#x27;t get as close as my normal shaving trimmer might, it definitely got much closer than a beard trimmer(which is half of the time, where I leave my shaving sessions due to time).&lt;br /&gt;I did try the guards, when trimming the lengths of the mustache against a comb and freehand, but that didn&#x27;t work so well.  There&#x27;s the three lengths, but they are all far too short for my current setup.  Using them as intended, I have no doubts they would perform as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connecting/disconnecting of the attachments was very simple, the button on the back for removal of the attachments is well designed.  It won&#x27;t accidentally pop off(like others I&#x27;ve used), but will easily when done on purpose.  The power button is flush with the Styler, so it&#x27;s unobtrusive, but at the same time easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;I almost didn&#x27;t find that the top flipped open to clean.  It could have been a little easier to clean, especially when wet, but overall not bad at all.  I think a detached head, or an included brush, would have done wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the device, almost simplistic while an eye on usability, really makes this a great product.  There could be some improvements, but they are minor and more personal preference I&#x27;m sure.  It looks manly, without the weight and harshness that typically comes with \\&quot;manly\\&quot; products.</li>
    <li> The ProGlide is a very good product, matter fact perfect. I love the duality of the razor and, the fact I can take it in the shower. The only issue I have is that it seems to drain the battery very fast, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power when I use it as a mustache trimmer. However, not enough to give it a bad review. Oh and the price of the replacement blades in my opinion is EXTREMELY HIGH PRICED. Other than that its the quintessential razor.</li>
    <li> Aesthetics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with the packaging, I have to say that I was even more excited about this product once I learned that it is manufactured, at least in part, by Braun. Braun &amp; Gillette are some of the most trusted names in grooming tools. I opened the package easily and found many pieces, of which I knew what they were, but did not know how to place them in the stand or attach to the unit. After a very short period of time (&lt;2 min) I had each piece installed in the trusty stand and had swapped them out on the unit to see how well they all fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For such a small unit it is somewhat noisy, but is not a deterrent. You won&#x27;t lose your hearing with a trim. The cutting blade is small and allows for intricate sculpting in areas of the beard, sideburns, or anywhere else you may choose to use this. I was skeptical about trimming my goatee with this unit because I have only had mediocre experiences with grooming tools that are not commonly used in barber shops / hair salons. I added the #1 guard to the trimmer and began to shave. I was THOROUGHLY impressed. The razor glided through my relatively thick beard and never snagged. If there&#x27;s one thing I hate, it&#x27;s when a hair gets painfully yanked out from the root. Because this is a battery powered unit, I was able to trim my beard in a much shorter period of time. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 blade razor attachment for a regular shave worked out exceptionally well too. I never had a razor that vibrated, but the feel and the way it glides over the skin made a very smooth shave, and I have had no irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to find fault with anything, I would only say that perhaps the instructions on how to store each piece could be better. Some people may have difficulty understanding how to store the pieces. That said, when all of the pieces are installed, the unit is small enough that I actually have the entire thing on a shelf in my medicine cabinet. I might also suggest an attachment for nose/ear hair trimming. I&#x27;d pay an extra $5 to get that in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Opinion / Rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am relieved and excited to now have a razor for trimming and shaving that I can take anywhere and that performs well beyond expectations. This is a product that is in no way to be considered disposable or cheap. I plan to use it as long as possible. Hats off the the designers and engineers.</li>
    <li> The Gillette fusion proglide styler power trimmer does what it says it does! Helps trim and shave facial hair. I was able to test the razor via promotion run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is good overall, it comes with a nice storage case that keeps all the parts and pieces in one place. Using the shaver is a little awkward because it is a longer than a traditional razor, but it is easy to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming blades all support a very close and well-kept beard. If you are looking a longer beard, this may not be the right choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product at a good value that supports all its claims!</li>
    <li> Overall this is a very good product. It uses the trusted Gilette Fusion ProGlide razor blades. Although the razors are fairly expensive to refill they last much longer and come far more sharp than bargain brands. The only comment I need to make is about the trimming (+1) blade the razor has. While it is great at what it is intended for, I caught my lip on an \\&quot;up stroke\\&quot; and cut it pretty badly. Definitely user error though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the great razor, the powered handle enhances its \\&quot;power\\&quot;. With the built in trimmer and 3 different attachments for different lengths of trimming, it has saved me valuable counter space over my old trimmer. Trimmers and the razor attachment are very easy to clean and swap out.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Proglide Styler for free as part of a promotion from Gillette and I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked as it wasn&#x27;t something if ever considered purchasing myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thicker goatee and the trimmer powered through no problem. It contours well to your face and best of all I can use it in the shower so I don&#x27;t have to get hair everywhere anymore, which my wife loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it doubles as an actual razor is great as well, one less thing to have laying around the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for me is the size of the trimmer head is a bit small so it takes a little longer to get the job done. Overall it&#x27;s a good little trimmer and I would definitely recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> I recently received, via a program run by Gillette, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. Its perfect for getting that perfect trim you want, without going to short. The power trimmer allows for a close shave without the razor burn. I also enjoyed very much, the ability to get various lengths of the trim. This styler power trimmer is a must have for any man who is dedicated to getting that right look for the ladies. I would definitely recommend this power trimmer to anyone who is looking to settle down for that perfect razor. Also would make an excellent fathers day gift.</li>
    <li> I am using my wife&#x27;s account to post this review.&lt;br /&gt;The Gilette ProGlide Styler so far to by the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I love the stand cause it holds all the attachments. Waterproof!! Thats a plus! It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to change the attachments. Perfect size styler for trimming around the ears.Also it cuts real close which I like.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. I received a free styler last week from and have been very pleased with the quality for the price. I know I got it free from a Gillette program but I am talking about the actual cost. I wear a goatee and have had problems trimming evenly. The profusion styler is lightweight and fits perfectly in my hand. The size makes it easy to travel with and the attachable razor is the same as my Gillette Fusion razor so no need to bring both. I think the next step for this product is to make it rechargeable.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer set free from a product testing program run by Gillete. I must say that I actually found shaving and trimming a pleasant experience for once. This shaver/trimmer come self contained in its own stand with a place for the attachments on the back of the stand. its small enough that I doesn&#x27;t take up much room, and I can take it with me in the shower. saves time from having to get out and run to the mirror. I love that I got to try this particular product. and have shared the word with all my friends.</li>
    <li> I received this for free from a Gillette run and so far, I&#x27;m impressed. Being a broke college student, I&#x27;ve never been able to buy myself an expensive $100+ trimmer, but I&#x27;d imagine it would work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is basically waterproof, as it mentions on the packaging. I&#x27;m able to bring it to the shower and have it work fine with water running and all. My only issue with this is that hair trimmings will often get stuck inside of the trimmer and is difficult to clean out. It will also not work if hair trimmings are stuck inside or between the trimmers, leaving it unable to trim until you clean it. I only wish that when you turn on the trimmer when the razor attached it would make a difference as opposed to using a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and it works fine. It does it&#x27;s job and makes my face look handsome.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use and not over priced as some pro models. Liked the ease and convenience of shaver and trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer for free by a program ran by Gillette. I have to admit I&#x27;m pretty impressed by this trimmer. I like how it includes several attachments for different things. Overall I really thought it was great and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I got try the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 Styler for free through a program. I like to use the trimmer. I use it on my face and hair. I like how it comes with a stand were you can put the trimmer and the heads. I like this trimmer a lot that I even threw my old one away.</li>
    <li> I tested this product from a Gillette sponsored program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came with 3 trimmer comb attachments, clearely labeled 1 through 3 for easy selection, as well as an attachment, and fusion proglide blade for normal shaving, as well as a Duracell battery instead of some unknown brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing out attachments is quick and simple with the slide release mechanism. As for trimming itself, after getting used to the trimmer blades being on an almost 90 degree angle to the handle instead of 45 degrees on other products, I found that this way seems to give better control and precision for trimming my moustache and goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can even think of is while trying to use it as a normal razor, the large handle seems a bit uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Works just as I would like for a 15$ trimmer.</li>
    <li> This ended up being a very loud trimmer. So load it actually surprised me the first time I turned it on to trim up my boy&#x27;s neck hair. It did the job okay, but I&#x27;m not sure we didn&#x27;t get a defective model.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer showed up at my front door at the perfect time in my life. The free trimmer was provided via a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;ve never been one to let my facial hair grow for longer than a few days, but this year I decided to participate in a beard growing contest for charity. Since I need to keep a beard growing until my hometown Boston Bruins exit the playoffs, I needed something to keep my facial hair looking clean and professional. This trimmer has allowed me to clean up scraggly neck hairs, shave symmetrically around my jawline, and keep my girlfriend happy. The clipper attachments will come in handy should I need to keep the thickness in check.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good basic trimmer, this is your product.  The stand is clunky and takes up a lot of space, and taking the razor head on and off the trimmer is kind of silly.  But the trimmer itself is great -- nice close trim, without any of the guards, it gives me a perfect about 5-day beard.  No nicks or cuts, just an easy to use trimmer, takes normal batteries, small and easy to manuever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> This product was great!  I just got it as a free sample from Gillette, free is always good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feature &amp; attachments are great for keeping man-scruff neat &amp; trim. I work in an office, so keeping a clean/manly look is good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor was tough to get adjusted too, because it vibrates and is rather bulky. After a couple of days of using it regularly - I have gotten used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus - perfect for traveling!!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program run by Gillette.  After using this trimmer several times I noticed some pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are it looks nice in the packaging, though this doesn&#x27;t really go toward the actual performance I felt it was worth noting.  It is also extremely easy to use as it fits well in your hand and it is even easy to hang in the shower.  It also is easy to clean which is a definite plus in my book.  Finally it is small in size so that would make it easy to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However there were a few cons.  It was very loud especially when using near the ears.  Finally the battery appears to drain rather quickly.  After only  four uses it appeared to be half dead.  Plus for those who have thick facial hair it can take several passes before you are able to get it all the same length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though I think it is a good styler for the money and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free through a program run by Gillette and I have to say its comes in handy almost on a daily basis. Not only is this trimmer great for trimming sideburns and other types of body hair, but its great for everyday shaving as well. The shaving blade is great because it allows for a fast and worry free shave (it must be the million blades stuffed into the small contraption that allows for less cuts on the face). It really sharp too, which is great (I cut my finger on it trying to get it out of the package). The trimmer is also great to use to trim the hair on top of my head too. I don&#x27;t know if that is what it was designed for but its an all-in-one product that can be used on a daily basis. Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler from a campaign ran by Gillette for free!! I was surprisingly impressed.. (come on it was free)..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer came with its own cradle that did not take up much space on my counter.. and to my surprise it also came with a battery so i did not have to purchase one.. in the back of the cradle was 3 different gaurds to allow for several levels of trimming.. attached to the top was a Razor.. I was really impressed with how great the trimmer worked. I have thick coarse facial hair. and this trimmer had no problems at all.. With its size it was easy to handle to get those sharp lines and clean look.. then when done  attach the razor to the trimmer turn it on and it vibrates to help lift the hairs to get that really close clean shave and smooth feeling.. I will be buying another to keep in my locker at work and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great trimmer that is really portable also..</li>
    <li> TRANSFORMER - I would be so characterized the razor correctly written that 3 in 1, all at your fingertips and shave and whiskey correct and podravnjat beard, my good acquisition.</li>
    <li> I have been a 3-blade razor user since the Gillette Mach 3 came out. I have sensitive skin and often get knicks and pulls that leave my face feeling irritated. Because of this, I was hesitant to advance my shaving utensil to a 4- or 5-blade razor. Often when I get a new Gillette Mach 3 razor, I get some minor cuts because the blades are so new and sharp. I cannot tell you if that was what caused me to grow a beard, or if it was just a fashion statement. When I recieved the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a special offer with Gillete, I decided I would put it to the test and get the full effect of this new razor... the beard had to go. I used the Power Trimmer with the 2-guard attachment to groom the entire beard down. This was a very power tool and much less bulky than the full clippers I was previously using. I then decided to have some fun and try out the trimming functionality, so I shaved most of the beard completely off. I was very pleased by the smoothness of the shave and didn&#x27;t get the pulls and knicks that I was used to with my previous razor. My wife was not as impressed as I was by my fu manchu, but in all honesty the trimmer cut clean lines and it was easy to shape a unique mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that have facial hair or conduct any regular man-scaping. I would highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. My only complaint is that my beard is gone. My wife likes the clean shaved look, so it will stay for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, I have used the vibrating handle while shaving and you get the feel of an electric razor with the closeness of a real blade.</li>
    <li> This following item the Gillette fusion proglide styler power trimmer is provide by our sponsor Gillette. The trimmer does a good job styling my beard. The trimmer is battery operated which is good because you just let it flow and you will trim your beard. Before I got this trimmer I usually go to the barber and they would trim my beard for me using a manual blade. For instance we men usually shave and sometimes we shave a little over and after a day or so the hair that is going to grow will grow dark there. With the proglider I can minimize cutting the wrong portion of my beard.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program run by Gillette to test their product...and let me tell you, The Fusion Styler has replaced my regular shaver and an electric trimmer I use to keep my mustache and sideburns in check!! As a trimmer it works better than the other trimmer I have been using, the head is smaller and easier to maneuver and perhaps even more effective. My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is I don&#x27;t quite have the knack of quickly popping the various heads off. Getting them on is a snap, getting them off a bit more difficult. Did I mention that it is waterproof, so you can use it in the shower!? I couldn&#x27;t even tell you how many trimmers I threw out over the years because I would get them wet. Maybe in the future they can add a tool for trimming those nasty nose hairs!! That is the only reason I have not thrown out my others trimmers. All in all, I love it and I give it a 4 out of 5. I think a lot of men out there will find this product very useful, maybe not all, but I would guess most would. Bravo, Gillette...Bravo.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor/styler set I have ever purchased!  Easiest the best shave, no irritation at all! I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> First off I want to mention that the Power Trimmer I am reviewing was received free via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very pleased with the Power Trimmer - it makes it so much easier to trim and shape my beard than using plug-in clippers. I got a smoother, straighter line. My wife loves the stand, It makes everything neater in the bathroom. I just put everything where its meant to go instead of leaving it all over the bathroom. I give this product 5 stars because it awesome, organized, and it works well.</li>
    <li> I received the ProGlide Trimmer for free through a program run by Gillette to give some honest feedback on the product. When I first received the trimmer, I was very impressed with the appearance of it - it certainly looked like a high end razor - not one that was $20! I liked how it came with a rubber grip because I tend to lose my grasp on plastic ones in the shower, especially with my rheumatoid arthritis. Because of my work, I can&#x27;t grow out a beard so I was unable to test the beard trimmer attachments. The trimmer/shaver itself, however, was great! I felt it did a thorough job on a 4 day growth with no pulling - it just did what a good razor is supposed to do, cut! I used the edger on my sideburns and I really liked the way it worked. My only complaint is on the holder for the razor and accessories. If you plan on using and storing this in your shower, it&#x27;s probably not the best way to do so in this holder. I was trying to put the razor back in the holder after using it the first night and right away the thing fell in the shower and all the parts fell all over the shower floor. If you like to use your razor at the sink or plan on keeping the razor and accessories at the sink and just taking the razor back and forth to the shower, the holder would be great for you. You could also find another way to store this in the shower if you wanted to. Other than the holder, I thought this was a great trimmer!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler through a free program being run by Gillette. This was just in time as my 20 year old trimmer just wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;cutting it\\&quot; anymore! I am very pleased and impressed by this little trimmer! I love that it can be a trimmer, a groomer or a power razor all in one compact device. This Styler works great for any look I am going for.....just a trim, a rugged five o&#x27;clock shadow, or a closer shave. The trimmer is compact and easy to maneuver. The different attachments are easy to put on and remove. My only real \\&quot;complaints\\&quot; with the trimmer? The attachments seem to be a cheaper plastic and I&#x27;m just hoping they don&#x27;t break anytime soon. Also, I&#x27;m not impressed with the stand. The trimmer is very wobbly when in the holder and the attachments don&#x27;t seem to fit very well into their slots. Neither of those things affect the fact that the trimmer works great! Very happy!!!</li>
    <li> The packaging set the tone right from the beginning. After receiving my free razor via a program run by Gillette, I was immediately expecting big things with how modern and hip the packaging looked. After gathering all of the pieces, it took a minute to figure out exactly what went where and how. The directions are also very helpful. You get the hang of it very quickly. The razor itself attaches on top and provides a really smooth shave. You can even feel the moisturizer from the green moisturizer strip on your face when finished shaving. I really like the trimmer on the back of the razor the best. It is great for evening my side burns and getting the stubble underneath my nose that the razor couldn&#x27;t reach. The trimmer with the 3 combs are very good for beards, underarms, and chest. I actually tried it with my sideburns. However, if trimming your sideburns I would recommend not using the comb attachments and instead just the base trimmer and your own hair comb. It came out a lot more even for me that way. Shaving works great in the shower, I prefer it; however, trimming sideburns, chest hair, and underarms is easier when dry in my opinion. Overall, a solid product that I would recommend and worthy of being in any man&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
    <li> I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler through a program run by Gillette a couple of weeks ago. The set is nicely compacted and organized and easily rests on my side of the bathroom counter.  It did take some time and effort to remove it from the packaging, but once I got it out, walah!  I like that I can shave and trim all in one without having to make sure my trimmer has been charged or not.  The Trimmer takes one AA battery which is included with the package.  My honest opinion is that you can&#x27;t go wrong with Gillette razors or products, they are the best out there but you sure do pay the price for a good, clean, shave.</li>
    <li> This product was received by me as part of a special promotion run by Gillette .Love the concept of this product.&lt;br /&gt;The pack contained 1 Trimmer, 1 ProGlide Power Cartridge, 3 combs, 1 battery, and an organizer. This product will be really useful when you go on a long vacation.As you dont have to carry extra items.i would definitely recommend this product to my friends. Gillette has always been my favorite brand when it comes to shaving and this product is beyond my expectations</li>
    <li> I was provided the Gillette Fusion ProFile Styler Power Trimmer for free through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to start with the trimmer set up. The fact that the trimmer comes with such a great stand is super helpful in it making my life easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has to come in a bit awkwardly to make sure that it trims well, but besides that it&#x27;s a great trimmer. My beard looks professional and taken care of rather than unkempt and unruly.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette and am very pleased with my experience so far. I have never used a product like this before and have found that it offers a lot of convenience in one neat package. I love the stand with the build-in storage compartments for all of the included accessories. I first started using it to keep my sideburns in check, and quickly discovered that it works great to tame my chest and underarm hair that were out of control. I had ignored these areas because I never had the right product to use on them. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Style Power Trimmer offers several interchangeable combs that helped me find just the right length for my needs. So far, I am very pleased with the trimmer and I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer compliments of a program run by Gillette. From the moment it arrived, I was impressed.  It has several attatchments for different levels of trimming, it is compact yet sturdy and you can take it in the shower so hair everywhere is no longer a problem.  It worked great on all the different areas/shapes of my body.  I really like that it is not disposable and that it works great.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the trimmer on this thing. I was so excited to recieve this free trimmer from a company run by Gillette. It helps to keep my mainly mane in check. Some of the extra attachements are unneeded but other than that this is the perfect razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power thru a promotion Gillette was sponsoring. I had to say I am not fond of the handle. I can&#x27;t say there is anything wrong with it, I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels in my hand. It is a little bulky which to me removes some of the feed back that the blades are giving as you shave.However I will say the blades gave me the smoothest shave I think I have ever had. The trimmer leaves a little to be desired, I don&#x27;t know that it does any better than a beard/mustache trimmer. I would recommend this product though if you wanted just one tool to do it all.</li>
    <li> The first time using my Proglide styler I was amazed at how fast and easy it was to use! I was sent this free through a Gillette promotion and I am recommending it to all my male friends. It is a no brainer when it comes to using the styler. If you haven&#x27;t tried it it is a must have for all men!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer to try for a while.  I&#x27;m a picky shaver and have long felt the technology in blades was a waste of my money.  I was happy with a good quality two blade razor but I wanted to know if the latest and greatest from Gillette would change my mind.  Well, the trimmer showed up and I was immediately impressed with the quality of the packaging, presentation and equipment.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been holding off on a goatee trim for about a week in anticipation.  My first reaction was this little trimmer is no match for the corded trimmer I usually use to trim up the facial hair but I was wrong!  It felt great in my hand and had plenty of power to glide through my course hair.  I really liked the fence was well since it didn&#x27;t clog up, glided smoothly across my face and came with three different heights.  I think I&#x27;ve got a new favorite trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Next, I jumped into the shower to get a good shave.  I stood there for a minute and re-read the box to make sure everything was water safe and sure enough it all is.  Looking at the mess I made in my sink I should have trimmed the goatee in the shower too.  Anyway, The shave head for this thing is a bit scary.  It&#x27;s got 5 blades and a back blade for tight lines and uses the trimmer&#x27;s head to create a vibrating blade.  Immediately I noticed that the handle, while small for a trimmer, is quite large for a razor.  It would take some getting used to and I had a hard time getting a feel for my face.  I ended up turning the vibrating portion off to get the feel and let the 5 blades do the work by themselves.  It&#x27;s a really smooth shave and the blades do a great single pass job and the lubricating strip works as it should.  I tried the back blade on the edges of my side burns and it works great but its not something I feel I&#x27;ve been missing all these years.&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s my bottom line.  This is a really great trimmer and a functional razor that will take some getting used to.  For me, the trimmer alone would be worth a purchase but I think I&#x27;ll stick to my old razor.  If you love technology in a razor and look for the smoothest and best shave then you can&#x27;t do any better than this.  But first, think about the feel of your razor in your hand and if you think something 3x as large will be a problem, this isn&#x27;t the razor for you.  For me, I&#x27;m going to use it travelling when I don&#x27;t want to carry multiple grooming devices.</li>
    <li> I was given this item to try for free by Gillette, and I was impressed by it.  It has a smaller head which is good for outlining boaters and mustaches and there are 3 guides which are good for different lengths of hair.  The only draw back is that the battery isn&#x27;t rechargeable.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is a great option for me to be able to clean up between haircuts. I don&#x27;t have a mustache or beard, but I am able to use this trimmer on my neckline and sideburns when the hair starts growing out and I can&#x27;t make it to the barber for a few days. It was comfortable to hold and easy to use. I sometimes have to meet clients at short notice, so this trimmer allows me to quickly look clean and professional. This set, with the various attachments, would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Gillette fusion proglide is very innovative. The razor and trimmer alike are unique. Even diehard fans of other competitors like Schick and Axe need to use the proglide.I can truly admit that I am hooked on to the Gillette styler. A perfect shave every day. Awesome, to say the least.</li>
    <li> I received the free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.  At first I though that this was more of trimmer/edger. I used this for trimming and edging. I was pleasantly surprised as I started to use the shaver. First off I never thought that the handle would be comfortable for shaving and to my surprise it seems like the right size !!!!. The 5 blades was a little scary to start with and I could not comprehend how the 5 blades can make such a smooth shave and it believe me it did. About the cost for the cartridges I firmly believe that the longevity and great shave will outweigh the additional cost. It&#x27;s a great multi-utilty product and I love the Gillette&#x27;s Blue color.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler as part of a promotion run by Gillette. I trimmed hair from all over my body and not once did the styler pull hairs. You will have to clear hair from under the guard at intervals due to hair building up at the head. The package comes with a battery powered trimmer, a multi-blade razor, several guards, and a stand. The only negative I found was trying to shave with the razor attachment. I would rather just use my regular Gillette handle. I can&#x27;t speak to durability of the styler do the short time of having this. I think this I a good buy and a welcomed addition to my grooming kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide trimmer for several weeks now and love it.  Although it&#x27;s a multipurpose tool, it doesn&#x27;t disappoint on any.  The holder is convenient and the multiple attachments make trimming a breeze.  Although it has the razon attachment, I&#x27;ve been finding myself continuing to use a traditional razor, mostly due to the thinner handle.  All in all, a very good product.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is a nice little trimmer.  I received the razor free from a program run by Gillette.  It&#x27;s compact and has 3 nice attachments for different lengths.  I use it primarily for facial hair/chest hair, just to keep things neat.  The good is that it uses only AA battery, so I never have to worry about it being charged or not.  That&#x27;s also the bad, you&#x27;ll go through AA batteries.  It&#x27;s safe to use in the shower, although I have not done this.  It&#x27;s a nice, easy to hold unit.  It seems durable and built to last.  I have used a different trimmer with good results so I only have a couple suggestions.  One would be to add attachment for nose hair trimming.  The other is to have a wider cutting area (or a replaceable head to do so).  Otherwise Gillette did a good job with the product.</li>
    <li> I have received via a program run by Gillette .  This Gillette Fusion Proglide shaver is very heavy duty in the hand,Very solidly built and the vibration moto/trimmer is amazing! It shaved through thick facial hair with easy and never snagged nor got caught up in all the hair. It is also very easy to clean,You just press a small button and the trimmer pops up and just run water to wash all the hair out. That easy. The best part is you can take it in the shower and not have to worry about getting it wet or ruining it. I have had friends notice how my sideburns are much cleaner cut now and they are now going out to purchase one for themselves.</li>
    <li> I personally love this Trimmer. I got this about two weeks ago. I have used a hair trimmer that I bought about five years ago, it was a little date and the Li-ion battery barely holds a charge anymore. I find that this trimmer has a couple great features that really set it apart. The fact that it is waterproof, and that I can life the head to rinse it off after use it is awesome. Every time I use my old trimmer, an infinite number of trimmed hair falls from the head. The fact that I can click a Pro Fusion Glide razor head onto it to shave makes it a nice all-in-one device. I get great trims out of the 3 different guards for beard length. My only qualm is that I wish the two additional length guards where a bit more durable.&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten this trimmer as a free trial through Gillette, but it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> After haveing the expericence of the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Trimmer, My face was left feeling smooth as a babies bottom. The first impression after getting the shaver in my hands was all out power of the ability to shave and trim with such little effort. Being that it is a power shaver, it seemed a little on the heavy side compared to what i was use to. Those cheap o depot disposables. But after just a few passes I was in love. With the ability to go from shave to trim in a flash, it cut down my shaving time almost in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The only down side to this razor would have to be the case was little like trying to open a childproof, double layer security, fridge door lock. Yeah that bad. But it might of just be me, due to the facts my hands in shaking so bad with anticipation of using this heck of a innovation. And to think that i was able to try all this for free thru a special offer from Gillette. The greatest razor manufacture every. Thanks Gillette..........</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Styler does exactly what it claims it can. This a the perfect tool for keeping everything clean and maintained. I would get this even if I was just gonna use the razor. The thicker handle makes it feel more comfortable than a traditional razor. I also feel like I have more control and am able to get a better shave. The design is also nice and wont make it look out of place on any bathroom counter. The bottom line is that for its cheap price but high quality this can&#x27;t be beat. It is a perfect tool for anyone just looking for a good product but don&#x27;t want to spend lots of money.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer as part of a program run by Gillette.  After seeing plenty of commercials for the product, I was excited to try it.  Like most guys I know, I hate shaving, but I hate looking like a bum just as much.  If only there was a tool that could get me somewhere in between - enter the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer.  This thing takes care of everything - EVERYTHING.  In addition to cleaning up facial scruff, it takes manscaping to another level - effortless and quick.  If you&#x27;re looking for a solution to your shaving needs, look no further - this tool is awesome.</li>
    <li> product performed quite well.  I use the trimmer for sideburns and was satisfied with the job it did.  Shave is superior, very smooth and comfortable.  Only negative is price of blades, which are costly!!</li>
    <li> Gillette knows their way around a razor and they gave me this one for free (alright Gillette). I could feel the fusion of the hair on my face and the hair in my mind as they became one and engaged in an epic struggle for dominance (this means I got the look I was going for, quickly and easily). The razor professionally glided along the coarse hairs of my neckbeard and trained them into obedience with the power of an ox and the supple, gentle touch of an angel. Oh I was styled. Great product, easy to use, lightweight, versatile, attractive storage, long battery life, alpha male approved and such a pretty color blue!</li>
    <li> This styler was provided to me via a program by Gillette and I&#x27;m in love. This product is so much better than those other bulky products on the market. Its so ergonomic and won&#x27;t cause a cramp. It gets the job done effortlessly without having to spend a lot of time getting your beard trimmed. The three different guards is all you need for whatever style you&#x27;re looking to achieve and the trimmer on the back of the shaving cartridge is plus. not to mention doing everything you need it to do while it vibrates also. I have nothing bad to say about this product perfect 5 out of 5 from me!</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette fusion pro glide 3 in 1 styler free from gillette . This thing was awesome! It trimmed good and I liked the design</li>
    <li> This small but powerful trimmer is perfect addition for you daily grooming routine highly recommended. I have replaced my old trimmer with this one with no plans to go back.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was provided to me through a program run by Gillette.  I liked all the different attachments and how they all worked together.  Gillette never fails to impress.</li>
    <li> I received one of these trimmers from Bzzagent and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty thrilled about the results and how it helps trim up my husband&#x27;s beard. He got it for his campaign and he has been using it non stop. It has clear cut lines and I see it&#x27;s not had any problems with leaving behind stray hairs. He has a pretty thick beard and to keep it trimmed is a hassle, but this product is pretty nice. The razor issue part is kind of odd - as it&#x27;s just a normal razor to me and to him, but he was glad none the less that it came with a little razor as well as the attachments to have his beard styled the way he wants.</li>
    <li> I received the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Styler has replaced my regular shaver trimmer. As a trimmer it works better than the other trimmer I have been using the head is smaller and easier to maneuver and perhaps even more effective. It&#x27;s quick, fast and easy to use, helping you to always look your best with all your quick grooming needs. With all these little plastic attachments and the good compatible stand that doesnt take much space makes it good An all-in-one razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A quality product - this body groomer is great. Trims my body hair with ease and without worry and wthout razor bumps My beard smartly trimmed and shaping around my nose and mouth is quick and painless. Other unwanted body hair is also a snap with this body hair trimmer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this styler for free as a promotion from Gillette.  Upon receiving it, I was impressed with the packaging and how professional the trimmer looked.  Once I tried it, I was extremely impressed with the ease with which it can be used, the closness of the trim, the power and the size of it.  It is small enough to get into small /delicate areas around my ears and jawline with precision and is much easier to use than my standard hair trimmer.  I would definitely recommend this product to any man with a beard that they try to keep up regularly.</li>
    <li> My razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. I have to say this Proglide Styler works well. It does a great good at trimming beards/goatees and gives you a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to hold up to course hair very well and gives you different guards to choose from. Its also not to loud like other brands. I will continue to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler because it does what it needs to do and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I was offered the opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide styler through a promotional program, and was very pleased with the results. Being a new shaver, I don&#x27;t have a super thick beard, but I liked that I could trim my sideburns and the back of my neck. The heads were easily exchangeable and easy to hold. I was a little concerned about the size of the handles, but it was almost easier than a smaller handle. Overall, this is a good product and I have enjoyed trying it out!</li>
    <li> If you go to a barber and you see one of those mini electric shavers that they use to clean up your sides or the back of your head, this is exactly what it is. I got this product for free through Gillette and boy am I glad. Light, easy to use, and very effective in trimming hair away from your head or body.  Let&#x27;s face it, we have hair that grow at different rates and in undesirable places. The Proglide is powerful enough to combat these areas. Ease of cleaning is great, its water proof so you can rinse it under the sink.  You can also attach a razor to shave if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, especially with its multi-attachments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big user of Gillette products.  But I was getting tired of my current product and thought what the heck. After getting the Proglide Styler which was provided via a program run by Gillette. Bigggg Thanks to Gillette!!! I was amazed with all the things it came with. The minute I started using it I knew I was going to keep it. If u have facial hair it&#x27;s a must. You can edge and shape like a master. Oh not to mention for all you guys with chest hair, you want to do some manscaping? it&#x27;ll work great. In the shower out the shower where ever. It&#x27;s a simple product that does so much. Get the Gillette Proglide Styler and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This proglide styler is awesome I must say. I got this from some special promotion from Gillette to try out. I have been a Gillette user for years and have always been satisfied with their products. I was a little skeptical at first though until I tried it and I felt like I got BEAT UP BY THE HANDSOME STICK. It looks bulky but it fits in your hand perfectly and the grip on it is awesome making it feel secure to avoid that occasional \\&quot;slip and cut leaving your face full of little pieces of tissue spotted with red\\&quot; look. The vibration feels stronger than the regular razors which gives it a smoother shave. The vibrations on this bad boy is strong enough that it could be misused as a vibrating razor. Batman may have his utility belt but Gillette has this in their arsenal in the fight against unwanted hair with the 4 different attachments. You might not have what it takes to be a super hero but at least you can have what it takes to look good.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer from Gillette and was asked to test it. It is a great product to maintain your look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already had a rechargeable trimmer that did an adequate job. However the Proglide Fusion trimmer immediately got my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely a nice looking trimmer. It also has good feel in your hand, not to light and easy to hang on to. The different trimming length attachments are easy to change and you can see that they are installed correctly. It also comes with razor attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is that you can use it in the shower. No more cleaning up hair on the sink! As I mentioned earlier, this is for maintaining your look. You will have a hard time shaving off a two year old beard. It is great for sideburns, trimming your hairline on your neck, or some manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs on a battery so you won&#x27;t have to worry about lengthy recharging times halfway through trimming, just replace the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes in a stylish holder that keeps everything in neat and organized.</li>
    <li> Great value, good buy thanks!</li>
    <li> I have a different, more expensive, trimmer that i&#x27;ve been using for a while. When I got this styler for free to try it out, it changed everything. I usually have to use a trimmer, a regular razor, shaving cream, after shave, etc. The fact that this styler has different attachments it makes everything so much easier. It also helps that it can all be stored together and in one place. It fits easily on the bathroom counter and isn&#x27;t an eye sore. I was able to complete any style I wanted to with my facial hair with this product. It&#x27;s easy to achieve any style you might usually do, or even try a new way. This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette and I am glad I did.  I love the fact that it can be used in the shower.  Also the blades have good spacing so it is easy to rinse.  Trimmer worked well on side burns and back of neck.  I really like that this is an all-in-one tool.  The only drawback was that the moisturizing strip on the razor did not last as long as I would have like.  Other than that I think this is a very useful shaving tool that I will continue to use. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this razor to try out and give my opinion on this razor this 3 in 1 pack was amazing its everything you would want in a razor pack...It has all that a man could want or use. It shaves wonderfully smooth and silky cleans easy and all stores in this wonderful caddy that comes with it...the razor it self never dulled the shaver worked wonderful great speed and sharpness never dulling either...I highly recommend this pack to everyone that wants a great razor...</li>
    <li> I didnt&#x27; think I&#x27;d like this product.  But the vibrating handle makes a big differnce with the closeness of a shave.  And the trimmer is something any guy needs.</li>
    <li> This has been the best razor/shaver combination I have used yet. Being on the go all the time I needed one device that I could shave with and  trim my mustache with out cluttering up my personal hygene bag with a lot of devices. This was the perfect solution for me and works way better than I expected to for the price.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was given to me through a program run by Gillette.  However, I&#x27;m under no obligation nor pressure to write positive feedback about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting that out of the way, let me simply tell you that this product serves as an all-in-one tool for your grooming and shaving needs.  Let me concisely list out the benefits I&#x27;ve personally found through using this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s waterproof! I shave in the shower so this is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;- It uses the Fusion cartridges&lt;br /&gt;- It has size 2 and size 3 that are perfect for grooming my sideburns.  Sometimes I notice that after getting a hair cut the stylist was sloppy and didn&#x27;t  clean up the sideburns.  Well, this comes in handy to touch up what was missed.&lt;br /&gt;- The container has a standing unit for everything to freely sit into.&lt;br /&gt;- Has the typical, precise shaving of what we&#x27;ve come to expect with the Fusion blades.  The vibration of the trimmer actually reduces the number of times you need to go over an area to ensure you&#x27;re completely clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this shouldn&#x27;t be used to shave your head or go crazy.  The product is convenient and is actually priced pretty well considering it&#x27;s multi-faceted uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor critique I have is it would be awesome if there was a way to strap on a 4-pack of cartridges, similar to other razors in the Gillette line, in the event that when traveling I don&#x27;t forget to bring refills because it&#x27;d already be bundled into the holder.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free through a program by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a very good razor, I liked the edger on back to trim up my side burns found it to line them up nicely. Product felt to have a good quality feel to it. Advantage to this product is that is that its one product to do several things. I usually have to have my razor plus my electric but this power trimmer is an all-in-one.It was very easy to interchange from razor to trimmer. Even when adding the adapter to trim my goatee it worked really well and trimming any facial hair down to stay neat and clean. Razor felt like it left a good shave, no razor burn for me... I would definetly recommend this product to anyone who wants one device to shave, trim and edge.Only negative so far for me is when cleaning out the razor it would come off when cleaning but maybe i was tapping bit hard against sink. but overall product worked well for me.</li>
    <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer from Bzzagent for being a member. This is a styler that a man needs all year around. The price is great for a electric razor. One bad this about it is that, I need to use the razor few times until I get clean face. Other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best trimmer out there for the money!! Its light, small and fits comfortably in your hand. I have a rough beard and this trimmer cuts right through it. I have not had any problems with it like most of the other trimmers I have bought in the past. Highly recommend this for anyone who wants a close cut beard. And I forgot to mention I got it free through Gillette!!</li>
    <li> Received this product via a free trial offer from Gillette. The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide 3-In-1 Styler is a really good product.  The size of the handle makes it easy to control while trimming facial hair and sideburns. The vibrating head allows for a close trim and shave. It&#x27;s easy to clean and the stand provides a nice way to store the accessories. The only downfall I see with this product is the replacement razor cartridges can be a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new beard trimmer and received this free razor via a program run by Gillette. This trimmer from Gillette is great. It is a well made quality product. I can trim my hair with ease. No razor burn or bumps ever. My beard is easily trimmed and shaping is quick. Other unwanted body hair is also cleaned up easily with this body hair trimmer. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recently received a Proglide Styler for free from Gillette and let me say that it is perfect for me.  I travel a lot for business so having both a trimmer for my goatee and and razor all-in-one is great!  The trimmer allows me not to have to carry my normal electric trimmer i used to use on those long trips while the single blade on the backside allows me to keep my clean lines between my trips to the barber.  No more botched lines!  I&#x27;ve been a gillette user since i&#x27;ve started shaving (free mach 3 turbo on my 17th birthday) and would never use another product!  This razor also allows me to shave my head with ease!  A true all-in-one tool for me!</li>
    <li> thanks to a program running my Gillette I receive a fusion progilde styler power trimmer. I&#x27;m a simple person and what I only need is a comfortable way to trim or shave my facial hair. The trimmer is quite easy to use, is water proof, is not slippery when touch with soap, the battery last a lot and is very comfortable to grab. It cut the hair very equal, I have abundant facial hair and it cut it very nicely without problem at all. It has three additional combs that are very useful. Cleaning the trimmer is not difficult just spray it with a blast of water and is ready. In my opinion is the best inexpensive retouching trimmer that I have tested.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I got to test this product thru Gillette , but I was very positively surprised. The Styler is made in cooperation with Braun. Two great companies created a really great product. It&#x27;s wireless and it makes it way easier to use than regular stylers with cable. Since I got it I&#x27;ve taken it with me everywhere, while business-traveling. It provides me with all the shaving options I need at home and during business-trips. It&#x27;s very good for your face, underarms, eyebrows trimming. If you maintain a beard or a mustache , it&#x27;s definitely for you! It doesn&#x27;t waste it&#x27;s battery too fast and you can use the handle with styler head or with razor blade. The design is perfect! The price is a real steal. You can get it for less than 20 $. Worth trying if you&#x27;re not sure!</li>
    <li> Wasnt to sure on paying such a high price for an item, but finally decided to get it and turns out it is a great item. Great shaving tool that every male needs in his house. It pays for it self in the long run</li>
    <li> I received the styler through a gillette program . I recently had back surgery and have been unable to care for myself. I received the razor in the mail and was able to shave, style and trim in no time at all. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free to use and share my thoughts. FIrst off, I do not have a thick beard, mustache, or fancy sideburns so I really cant speak much at all to its performance when it comes to edging your facial hair. I did try the shaver and it is, of course, just as good as any gillette razor except to me it was a little weird using a product so thick just for shaving. Where I really think this product is great is for quickly cleaning up body hair. Now it is not as powerful or easy to use as more traditional products, but what it lacks in power it makes up for in convenience and flexibility. You do not have to worry about it getting wet and you are not bound by a chord. It is an awesome item to pack up and take with you on trips. For these reasons I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> At some point every man has to realize that a $10 blade isn&#x27;t going to cut it anymore. For me, it happened not because of life changes or growing up, but when Gillette offered a freebie sampler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s familiar (I used the Proglide Fusion line before this).&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap. Yeah, I used to never think about this, but when I compared the cheaper razors to this Styler, the other razors look like toys.&lt;br /&gt;3. Goodbye, wayward facial hair. Mush easier than with a single razor.&lt;br /&gt;4. You can cut more than facial hair. Ahem, ahem.&lt;br /&gt;5. Waterproof so it lives in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;6. Less razor burn. Not sure why since I still use the same shaving gel and the routine is the same.&lt;br /&gt;7. Your shaving repertoire now includes trimming and edging. It&#x27;s time to get crazy.&lt;br /&gt;8. Cleaning is easy. Just pop it open and wipe off the hairs. No clogging.&lt;br /&gt;9. Kit is sleek and well-designed. Nice touch with the cartridges fitting in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It costs more than the most razors.&lt;br /&gt;2. Non-rechargeable battery. If you care about environmental consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you tell that I really like this Styler?</li>
    <li> Overall: This styler is great accessory to have in the bathroom.  It does exactly what it is meant to do efficiently, looks nice in a blue/silver/black grooved finish, and is compact in a nice plastic stand(which is a nice addition that did not even have to be included). Of course, it is not the best thing on the market, but it probably is the most cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal Use: Although I grow a full face of hair, I have had problems with how it grows.  My mustache grows faster and causes an awkward balance. The middle of my chin also darkens up quicker than the rest of the beard in a way that makes me look kinda like Wolverine. And I grow an unsightly neck beard.&lt;br /&gt;The last problem can be easily fixed with my disposable razor, but the other two are almost impossible to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got this Styler/Trimmer for free as part of a program run by Gillette and it makes me enjoy my facial hair again.  Before, I would shave completely and look like a baby alien for a few days, and then have a few glorious days of good rough, but not scruffy. However, after that, I deal with uneven hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device fits perfectly in my hand and is easily maneuverable; I never felt that it would slip out of my hands ever, and it actually feels very sturdy.  The edger comes with three different sized combs to layover for the trimming.  I did not grow out my hair long enough to use the larger sizes, but I can tell that they are definitely varied and the smallest one is perfect for having a nice amount of stubble. I did have to go over some spots on my face repeatedly and I noticed that hair would litter my entire sink and even get caught in a small space underneath the razor edges, but both were easily cleaned. I would definitely recommend getting this product.</li>
    <li> Why did I buy this product?&lt;br /&gt;I needed something that would leave my scruffy beard at the perfect length.. at it does! It comes with three clippers for a more customized shave, although I only use one of them for my sideburns and bare for my beard.I also use this to retouch behind my ears and the back of my neck. The razor is awesome too. I rarely use it since I don&#x27;t shave fully very often, but when I do it leaves my face like a baby&#x27;s butt. Easy to clean and it has lasted me for a while now... 5 years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Practical&lt;br /&gt;Easy for traveling&lt;br /&gt;No cables&lt;br /&gt;Customizable&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price. I will buy it again when mine breaks down... 5 years going strong!</li>
    <li> The second one i bought. The plastica parts are too fragile. I droped the first one and i broked it.</li>
    <li> I am going to rank this as the #1 Razor for MEN AND WOMEN!!</li>
    <li> I use this to help keep my facial hair trimmed and neat.  I don&#x27;t use the proglide razor so i can&#x27;t say how well that works, i prefer a standalone razor but thats just my preference.  Back the the trimming it works great.  It comes with 3 combs of varying lengths that have suited me perfectly.  If i remember right it just uses 1 AA but it seems to last pretty long maybe about 30 minutes of use if trimming.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my adult son as a birthday present, not knowing if it would be something he would like for his &amp;#34;manscaping,&amp;#34; but he came to me after using it and said it was the best present he had ever gotten!  He still thanks me for buying it for him every time he uses it.  It is very well made, does everything it advertises, and looks beautiful sitting on the counter, even for a manly man.</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> I wanted a cheap trimmer/razor combo that I could use and the shower and decided to try this. Although the trimmer is on the small side, it works well and only snags hair if you let the battery get extremely low. I have been using the trimmer for about two years and it still works great. For the price it is very hard to beat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem arises with the razors. Although they work very very well, the price to replace them is ludicrous. It is actually cheaper to buy a new set (razor/trimmer) then to buy a new pack of razors. I would recommend buying this and using the razor until it becomes dull and then switching to something like dollar shave club. If you use the cheap razors from them with the cheap trimmer from gGllette, you will have a very economically friendly way to maintain facial hair.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
    <li> Very good quality and the feel of the razor in hand is really solid. Although the attachments for trimming are plastic (could have been better quality) but for the price and the ease of use and portability, I think this is a very good product. The water proofing of the battery compartment is much better than the earlier Gillete razors with batteries.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this item to everybody...I love it.</li>
    <li> Rhis product is just how they describe it overthere. My skin face is so delicate and its irritate with everything, but since im using this proglide, this nightmare has dissapeared!!  Thank you  guys!!!</li>
    <li> This little piece of equipment is a must have tool for all men. It small light and efficient to give you the look you want. I have been using it for months and it hasn&#x27;t broken down or anything. The trimmer is powerful, the dual and single blades are precise and for something under 30 dollars its a huge bargain. If you use this one a weekly basis you only have to change the blade monthly which is very good, it lasts. Its strong enough to trim your face and body, the blades are good enough for beards and sideburns and the attachments are good for pretty much anything. Only complain i have is that i wish it had a rechargeable built in battery because for me i use it twice a week and the battery starts to die out the 2nd or 3rd time you use it but its a minor complaint and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Overall its a powerful grooming tool and after months of using it, it still remains strong as it was out of the box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an old Atra with Atra 3 blades since they came out. I wanted a more versitile way of straight edging my sideburns and such, so I ordered one of these. The shave is the closest I have ever had (sans the vib/cipper mode) and it&#x27;s very ergonomic. Does a fantastic job on my chin without the fight of a regular razor. Works wet or dry, an a plus product! If you still use an olderer gillette product, this is an amazing upgrade for your face. Get a Norelco Bodygroom and you have a total system for unwanted hair removal.</li>
    <li> This thing was just great!!! Then it stopped working): so I bought another one!!Not a good idea. It also died on me&gt;!!</li>
    <li> I received the trimmer and it came with a free razor through a program run by Gillette. At first I was apprehensive, because I&#x27;ve never put anything electric up to my face before. However, after using it, I realized how much I loved it. It trims quite nicely, and I later realized that it works great for manscaping. It&#x27;s easy enough to clean so I don&#x27;t need to worry about, ahem, cross contamination, and I will continue to use this trimmer for years to come.</li>
    <li> I like that this razor was built on the already trusted and widely used Gillett Fusion line of razors. This one product will help with my grooming needs because I don&#x27;t have to carry around a separate razor with blades and a buzzer. Everything stores conveniently in a small space so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my overnight bag. The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have storage for extra blades. I would recommend this product to my family and friends received the product for free from Gillette</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette and in all honesty it is the best trimmer I have used in a long time. Don&#x27;t waste your money on rip offs. this is the easiest to use and handle</li>
    <li> I was provided this shaver via a program Gillette ran. I was orignally thinking this shaver was going to be light with a cheap plastic design with a chepy motor,Boy was I was wrong! This shaver is very heavy duty in the hand,Very solidly built and the vibration moto/trimmer is amazing!  It shaved through thick facial hair with easy and never snagged nor got caught up in all the hair. It is also very easy to clean,You just press a small button and the trimmer pops up and just run water to wash all the hair out. That easy. The best part is you can take it in the shower and not have to worry about getting it wet or ruining it. I have had friends notice how my sideburns are much cleaner cut now and they are now going out to purchase one for themselves.</li>
    <li> I received my ProGlide Styler and Power Trimmer free through a program with Gillette.  From the minute I received it I was impressed.  The razor powers through my stubborn stubble with ease, even against the grain.  The first three shaves were tremendously close leaving my face extremely smooth to the touch.  I have noticed that the razor wears fast.  After the fourth shave the razor is visible dull.  It is also difficult to maneuver around the upper lip as the cartridge is very wide.  I loved (my wife as well) that I could man scape in the shower without concern for the ProGlide getting wet.  As a road warrior, I appreciate how it stores neatly in its own cradle and packs well for traveling.  Overall, I loved it and will most likely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice razor and trimmer combo kit. The razor is a smooth 4 blade razor that provides a very smooth and clean cut. It easily clips onto the trimmer as the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works very well. The guards clip on and off easily. I didn&#x27;t experience any hair pulling like I have with other trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the stand that comes with it, it keeps everything together so I don&#x27;t lose anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel like Gillette should have added a brush for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big \\&quot;manscaper\\&quot; (as a culture, we need a better word for this!), but I was provided the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free via a program run by Gillette, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  This thing works really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without attachments it shaped my beard really well.  With attachments it gave me a really consistent trim on other parts of my body regardless of the contours it was up against.  Biggest asset is that it can be used in the shower.  Works great both wet and dry, but the ability to use it in the shower and not have to worry about clean-up is great.  Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> As a bearded man, I have been on the hunt for the ultimate manscaping (beard trimming, shaving, etc) device for quite some time.  I was delighted to be selected by Gillette for their free razor program to review their 3-in-1 Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great and it included the trimmer, a few guards, and a Gillette razor to be added onto the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the trimmer to trim my mustache first around my mouth.  I&#x27;ve tried using hair clippers to do this task and I have been left at times looking quite crooked.  The trimmer did a good job with this task, however, I immediately noticed that the metal portion of the trimmer was very low and at times I had to angle the trimmer just right, in order to get the whiskers I was trying to whack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is pretty thick, so I&#x27;m not sure that this trimmer did as well as my clippers with a guard on it.  It could get the job done, in a pinch, but it took much longer.  If I only had a goatee that I kept relatively short, I&#x27;m confident that this device could more than take care of it.  However, for a fuller beard, this device may not have the &#x27;chops&#x27; to get it done with ease to the users satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor portion attached easily and with the vibrating function of the trimmer, it behaved just like the other Gillette razor I had previously owned that vibrated when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very good device that I could recommend if you are looking for a simple device to take care of basic shaving and trimming needs.</li>
    <li> I would have given four stars but the cost of the blades keeps it at three. The clipper could be a little more powerful. I was fairly pleased with the results from the use of this product. The blades left me with a clean smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Great Razor.  Worked great!  Razor and attachments were easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.  I have used many trimmers and razors in the past ut the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler is the best I ever used.</li>
    <li> Although I got this pro-glide styler free through a program Gillette was running, you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a great deal for a great product.  Battery powered, works in the shower and comes as a complete kit.  It&#x27;s not quite barbershop quality, but for an at-home, very inexpensive device that works well, it&#x27;s a win-win!  I would recommend trying it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son, and he and his wife share it. He uses the clipper/trimmer part and she uses the shaver. It does a pretty good job, and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This power styler is really good but really hard to get out of the package without breaking the razor. The razor is really easy to use and to change the attachments. You can really change your appearance really easy and fast with this razor.</li>
    <li> I was swept away by how smooth the Gillette ProGlide Power Trimmer provided a clean smooth edge to my mustache. I am very particular about maintaining a well groomed appearance and this trimmer does just that. Wow what a clean look. The resulting smooth line and clean appearance is what I strive to maintain. I am in the educational field, so my appearance is closely monitored by students. I would highly recommend this product to those who want to stay well groomed.</li>
    <li> Received a free Gillette Fusion Power Styler via program from Gillette.  Very powerful for a small trimmer.  Easy to use.  Attachments are easy to switch.  Makes for a very tight trim every time.  Shaved, trimmed, and styled my facial hair very easily.  Will purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette. I was given a chance to check out the proglide styler power trimmer. What I really liked about it was it&#x27;s slim fits nice in your hand and it was easy to use on my face, I like for such a small trimmer it really did the work of a large trimmer, the only thing i wish it came with was a brush to clean out the trimmer, and i also have to mention that i love it came with a built in case to store it that was nice with the blade guards, over all i really like this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool to have that can be used for shaving, trimming, man scaping, etc. thank you Gillette for this awesome product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a week ago in its anticipation for it being a great body trimmer, and it was! I even tried it in the shower just to see if the commercials/ads are real, and just in fact, it works at full power when wet or dry. What I love also about this is how smooth all of the blades are, especially shaving around my groin. Buy this product, its worth it!</li>
    <li> This styler really gets into the grooves and curves of a man&#x27;s body; it slides smoothly and comfortably. One dos not have to press hard.</li>
    <li> Before I received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer thanks to a program by Gillette, I needed both a razor and trimmer to get my shaving needs met.  Now, everything I need to keep my face and body trimmed just the way I like it is in one convenient and easy to use package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer to anyone who both shaves and trims for the following three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The quality of both the razor and trimmer is fantastic and everything you expect from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I love the fact that you can use the trimmer even when your face is wet.  Before I would have to first trim my face then finish with the razor and I would always find spots I missed that I had to wait for my face to dry to go over with again.  With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer I can go from shaving to trimming seamlessly and don&#x27;t have to worry about getting the trimmer wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is perfect for anyone who travels a lot.  It was always a pain to have to pack both my razor and trimmer with power cord along with everything else.  Having everything I need in one product that is cordless is so much easier.</li>
    <li> I was recently provided this product via a program that was run by Gillette and I have to say, I believe that this product is incredible. I was quite happy with its hybrid design where I was able to trim and shave with the same product comfortably. By that, I am referring to the aesthetics of the product because I have had previous products of the same nature but they all did not feel as right as this product did when being held. I was not only able to get a good clean shave, but I was also able to touch up some areas with the trimmer to get my beard as sculpted as possible. I would definitely recommend this product: it&#x27;s comfortable and it gets the job done incredibly well.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer was tasked with the difficult assignment of doing some cleanup work on my burly man beard this past weekend. Let&#x27;s just say, it was hardly up to the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the trimmer for free through a program that Gillette was running and was very excited to try it after seeing some ads for the product. I like to leave my beard a little bit on the fuller side, and the #3 setting was just a little too short for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the trimmer did help me was doing some work around my mustache area, trimming off any stray hairs that had gotten too long. I also used it to trim some chest hair that had gotten a little too wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the thing handled pretty well and didn&#x27;t feel as cheap as I was expecting. I do think it&#x27;s a pretty good product, just not what I was looking for to satisfy my facial hair needs. If I could give it a 3.5/5, I definitely would because I think it&#x27;s a solid product, just not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about a powered razor with disposable blades...But, since Gillette was running a program to try it out, I figured, \\&quot;why not\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And wow -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing GLIDES! It&#x27;s fast, smooth and comfortable - One try and I have no idea why I would ever use anything else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this with  a few days worth of growth - the razor made quick, one pass work. The trimmer and edge blade come in great - I have a goatee, and using attachment #2, was trimmed quickly and neatly in no time. The single blade edger was great for under the nose AND keeping the side burns sharp. This razor IS THE WAY TO GO!!! BONUS: It&#x27;s water proof! Works great in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern - The blades are pricey - but I&#x27;ve been using the one it came with for a couple of weeks, and it&#x27;s holding up fine.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s Amazon account... Great product for manscaping especially in the shower.  Will make this my new go to trimmer.  Very happy with the results and ease of use.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really liked the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-on-1. This was a free razor provided to me by a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;At first look i thought this was going to be a cheap plastic razor that would not hold up but it has proved me wrong.  This 3-on-1 makes it very easy to use having all the blades, trimer and shaver all at one place.  Having 3 combs provides the different trimming lengths which is very helpful when trying to find the correct length of trimming the chest hair. It also worked very well in shaving my face and trimming my mustache and left my face feeling soft.  This would be an exceptional styler to take on vacation beings it has many features.</li>
    <li> I recently tried out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer thanks to a free program with Gillette. Saying the name took almost as long as shaving, switching to the trimmer to clean up my sideburns and neck. The razor gave me a closer shave than I have had in a long time. The trimmer made it easy to shorten my sideburns and to trim the sides. Everything worked as advertised. The only thing that confused me was switching from shaving to trimming. I didn&#x27;t realize that you have to push the trimmer out a little for shaving and back in for trimming. Other, than that confusion it worked great.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is a good product for up-to-day touch-ups for any individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it may seem like a fairly small product, it actually packs a good amount of vibration when turned on with its AA battery.  I received the trimmer through a trial program by Gillette and it came in a plastic holder with all of the attachments.  The Power Trimmer looks very well made and has a good handle with enhanced rubber grip and stylish contour that fits well around the hand.  It felt light compared to typical trimmers but also packs the power expected in a compact trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for the price to pay, you can see the quality of the other parts diminish.  The combs were all made of a cheap plastic that I accidentally snapped while trying to fit around the holder.  Generally through, it snaps well around the head of the trimmer and release with a quick flip of the mechanical latch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the performance, the product gave me a reasonably good trim around my mustache and beard that I would expect from a Gillette product.  I brought the trimmer up to my skin without fear that it would cut and it seems to be just enough to reach the hairs.  Additional combs are placed around the head to vary the length of the reach.  When I rolled the product under my chin, I did have to stretch out the skin a bit to make sure it can get everything cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a good product for the price to pay and does a great job in everyday touch-ups to maintain your great look.</li>
    <li> I received the product free via a program run by Gillette. It was a very good product. These days I fine myself more interested in using trimmer so clean up my facial hair and this one (although made well and fully functional) was just too small and took too long to trim all my facial hair. The rest of the razor met all of my expectations so there are really no complaints of the over all product.</li>
    <li> This product is great, and very stylish. It is powerful and versatile. I used it to trim my beard and decided to try it out on my head and it did a great job of blending my fade in with more control than a larger buzzer. I love this razor.</li>
    <li> When I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a campaign by Gillette, I was anxious because this device seemed too good to be true, it was an all in one device to get things done quicker without only one device. The device comes with the trimmer and has attachments that can added to get the desired hair length in addition to the razor. The first time I shaved I felt a great difference in the way the skin felt, it was soft unlike other razors I have used to shave. This device does stand up to the ads, it does everything you want to do with it. It can even be used in the shower with no problem.</li>
    <li> I have a complex regimen of facial and body hair grooming and thanks to a program run by Gillette, I was able to try the ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free. The plastic stand fit the trimmer and combs nicely and has just a slightly larger footprint than a tube of hair gel. The fact that I could bring the trimmer with me in the shower was a huge win. Although the combs were not so easy to switch, especially with wet fingers, the grooming of my sideburns which cover half of my cheek was easy and second to none. Being able to go right from the shower and finish detailing in front of another mirror using the same appliance RULED! Grabbing a secondary mirror, I was able to square the back of my neck as well. All without having to switch to different blades/appliances, fumble with cables or worry about wetness. The ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is awesome.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the compact size fool you, this little trimmer packs quite a punch! Its small size is perfect for trimming my goatee. I was lucky enough to receive this product for free via a program ran by Gillette. I let my facial hair grow out before receiving the product and it did a swell job of trimming it back down. The grip feels great and the guard design is perfect and fits the trimmer flawlessly and is removed easily. I recommend this product for small trim jobs such as mustaches, goatees, and the like.</li>
    <li> I have been a firm believer in Gillette products since I was a little kid watching my dad using his Gillette razor (the only one he would use). So I was very eager to participate in a program by Gillette to get customer feedback on the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer which they provided free of charge. My reaction to the trimmer is I LOVE IT!!! It&#x27;s so easy to use because of the design of the body which fits the hand perfectly and the various trimmer heads allow trimming to just the length i want. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Gillette provided a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. I have always hesitated in buying a battery powered trimmer because they tend to tug and shave unevenly. I was very surprised with how this power trimmer performed. There was no tugging and it gave me a close, even shave. It edged my sideburns perfectly and it handled my manscaping needs as well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the total package.  Very close shave first, then snap off the shaving attachment and use the trimmer to even up the sides.  also works great for those pesky neck hairs between haircuts.  It all fits in the sleek and compact stand that stores easy on the counter top in the bathroom.  Best value for the price by far.  The best part is thanks to Gillette I was able to receive this as a free demo.  I have since purchased extra shaving blades for it</li>
    <li> I got a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer via a  program run by Gillette.  I have previously only used a regular razor to shave and trim with.  OMG this was the best thing since sliced bread.  I was impressed with how easy and how well the trimmer was to use.  It was so easy  to use compared to just using a razor for trimming and styling sideburns and I felt so much more comfortable using the trimmer for \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; than using a razor.  So much safer and so much smoother than just using a razor.  I will definitely continue using the trimmer over just a razor when shaving and manscaping.</li>
    <li> I already have ditched my electric razor and my Mach 3 hand razor for the Gillette fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a new option - I got this razor free from Gillette as part of a brand awareness campaign, so I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;This is SO MUCH EASIER than trimming body hair with a home hair cutting kit like I have been doing, because now I can do it in the shower, and in privacy.  No more sweeping up the kitchen floor and THEN showering.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is pretty solid for what it is. It seems to have good power. I like how there is a replaceable AA battery instead of an internal rechargeable one. For some reason I always forget to charge those and when it goes dead I have to wait for it to charge back up... with this trimmer I can just replace the battery and I&#x27;m good to go. The biggest downfall to this trimmer is the limited amount of combs included in the set, only 3 (a 1 comb, a 2 comb and a 3 comb). I mainly use this on my sideburns and don&#x27;t usually like them trimmed that close, typically like a 4 or 5 length. I received this trimmer as part of a Gillette promotion.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGilde Styler is by far my favorite trimmer out there. Not only is it affordable for all that it does, but it is more versatile and easy to use than most of the more expensive trimmers. You can shave clean, either vibrating or not, you can trim all body hair, and you can trim to different sizes. Simply the best.</li>
    <li> When I saw the commercials, I figured, ho hum, wont work for me, an african america with impeccable and somewhat sturdy facial hair. I thought about buying it, but decided it wouldn&#x27;t work and why waste my time...I WAS WRONG. 1st off, let me mention that the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. I tried it and loved it. I have never used something like this, and I&#x27;m hooked. small enough to carry around to freshen up between work and dinner, strong enough to cut my beard and I like shaving with the regular razor attachment as well.</li>
    <li> I just tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Power Trimmer through a program ran by gillette and I loved it. I did not have any razor burn or cut myself. It left my skin feeling smooth and not irritated. Not to mention it keeps my beard and other areas nice and trimmed without pulling the hair out. I would recommend the shave to every man in the world and plan on using this as my only shaver now. Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide 3 in 1 styler is a great all around groomer. I mostly love this product because of its portability. The 3 in 1 proglide is perfect for travel because it is compact and has three different trimmer heads and a smooth shaver. Personally i will be bringing it with me every time I travel, although I use it when I am not traveling as well. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> While I may have been put off by the fact that the trimmer runs off of batteries and does not come with a charger, the actual job it does is impressive. Not only does it look cool, but it&#x27;s useable in the shower. Not only does it work in the shower, but when your done you have an amazing compact stand to place the trimmer and its accessories. The trimmer cuts longer hairs quickly and allows for close attention to detail. I was very fortunate to have received this product via a program put on by Gillette. Knowing what I know now about this product makes me look forward to future trimmers Gillette puts out, this one was excellent for a simple trim. The accessory heads provided excellent protection from shaving to close and maintaining a precise style and length. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Received free razor through a program ran by Gillette. Have used it for about a week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the razor a couple of times. Felt a lot of tugging/pulling when shaving. Ended up with a lot of cuts / razor burn on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the trimmer, the included guides are not very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think I&#x27;ll stick to my old DE razor.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get a complementary Fusion Proglide Styler from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Styler is super smooth and easy to use.  For the first use, it was out of the package, in use and back in its stand within 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three different trimmer attachments provided make it a versitle tool for the face and head hair cutting.  Having a razor attached on the top makes edging really easy and convent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually just use my razor but having the styler on hand has changed the way I think about facial hair management.  A few quick passes with the styler over my beard makes everything nice and uniform.  I never thought I would be a trimmer guy but the Styler has changed my mind.  It saves me time and makes me look more presentable.  My girlfriend and coworkers have commented on my new look and that will encourage me to keep using the styler going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned trimmers and stylers and never really used them.  A lot of the time, they are too complicated, take up too much room and end up gathering dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the Proglide Slider makes it stand apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the stand it comes with is really great.  I live in New York and have a small bathroom and not much counter area.  Space is a premium.  The stand lets you store the styler and it&#x27;s attachments with a very small footprint.  Being able to leave it on the counter all of the time makes me use it to stay sharp more often.  You can tell that Braun took this into consideration when designing the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Styler is a great tool for keeping my beard manageable.  Razors don&#x27;t give you the control needed to keep your beard maintained without making any mistakes.  It is a fast and full proof way to stay looking good all week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color scheme is great.  The blue and silver is masculine without looking dopey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size and wieght is just right and feels good in my hand.  Even though it is all plastic, it feels likea substantial and quality tool.  It is also pretty quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having this styler has changed my habits and made me rethink my stance on trimmers.</li>
    <li> ﻿I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Trimmer as a trial offer free from Gillette. I was&lt;br /&gt;very excited to try the power trimmer when it came in the mail. From the time I opened up the&lt;br /&gt;trimmer and looked at it I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it. The angle of the blade was at a&lt;br /&gt;different angle then what I am use to on my other power trimmers. When I first tried the power&lt;br /&gt;trimmer I had not shaved in about a week so I had some good stubble to shave on. The power&lt;br /&gt;trimmer did shave the stubble but the blade didn&#x27;t seem as sharp as it needed to be to give me a&lt;br /&gt;close shave. I had to use my old power trimmer to get my shaver closer. I did like the grip and the&lt;br /&gt;easy push button on the Proglide Power Trimmer.</li>
    <li> I got this product free through a program run by Gillette. What I enjoyed about this product is that one razor has lots of different functions built into it. I can do my normal shave. I can trim the beard and the precision razor on the back worked better than I thought it would.  It comes with a nice stand where all the pieces fit rather than a bag where you have to dig through to find the right attachment. One of my favorite features is that the handle is the right size to be able to grip maneuver in your fingers which is helpful when you are trying to be precise in your trimming.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free power trimmer from Gilette.  I&#x27;ve now used it 4 times on various parts of my body and can easily say that it&#x27;s great.  The three different length accessories along with the razor/trimmer pretty much make it a multitasking wonder.  The only thing you would have to replace is the razor blade and batteries.  I really hope the blade lasts a while.  The vibration of the trimmer provides a super close shave I don&#x27;t get with a traditional razor.  Way to go Gilette!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide styler through a promotion from Gillette. The trimmer was excellent, it was sleek compact and easy to travel with compared to other trimmers I have purchased before. It trimmed my beard evenly compared to others as well. The best part is, it can be used in the shower as well. It contours to the shape of your face due to its sleek design. The only drawback that I had were the combs being difficult to lock in place at first. After trying it out a couple of times I was able to figure it out. I give this an overall 5 stars for its sleek design, ability to trim evenly and ability to be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying that I recived the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free as a part of a program that was run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance the trimmer looked sturdy and had a rubber grip on it. This grip I thought would be great considering most trimmer are smooth and somtimes slip out of my hands when they become wet. The trimmer/styler comes with 3 clips for the length you would like. The trimmer is battery operated and comes with a battery already. This is convient for me when I travel for work. I also like the batter aspect about this because I live in a area that is affected by major storms and I tend to loose power alot. The trimmer itself is very powerfull and can handel and hair length, thickness and course. I let my hair grow in full and I had not problem using the trimmer. In a nut shell this is the best shaver money can buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-waterproof&lt;br /&gt;-battery operated&lt;br /&gt;-durable&lt;br /&gt;-able to use with any hair length&lt;br /&gt;-light weight&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-easy storage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont have any :)</li>
    <li> So prior to trying the Proglide Styler I had a razor, a shaver, a standard trimmer and a \\&quot;manscaper\\&quot;. After getting this product I now have one stand in my shower that includes all of the above!!&lt;br /&gt;The ease of transforming from razor to trimmer is amazing. Most of these types of devices are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth but with this it is definitely convenient!! I love the razor, have been a Gillette fan for years and this does not disappoint. With the addition of the trimmer and accessories I have a complete shaving system that keeps with the quality I have come to expect from Gillette.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel an adjustable trimmer would be better than the different depth attachments but honestly, that&#x27;s me being picky.</li>
    <li> This shaver is absolutely perfect for the part-time beard grower like myself. Many hockey fans grow beards during the Stanley Cup playoffs, and in past years my beard growing was amateur at best. This year my beard looks perfectly lined up and just the right length. It looks so good I may just have to keep the beard after the Bruins win the Stanley Cup!</li>
    <li> I received this free form a special promotion from Gillette.  I must say this is a must have for all men!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was a it wasy to use, it is very versitile.  I can use this in the shower, and on the go which is great for me considering my mornings are pretty crazy and getting out the door is a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself works great. I have used a number of different trimmers and have had bad experiences with pretty much all of them, from puling of the hair to not cutting as close as I would like.  I did not have this experience at all with the Fusion ProGlide, it was close and not painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that it is a very compact and does not take up a lot of counter space, which my wife also loves!  I can leave it out for quick use and iti s not an eye sore with all of the cords and attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccommed this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received my free proglide power trimmer via a program run by Gillette.Overall i like the trimmer,although i dont think it would be good for large areas of hair.For me though i just need to trim my mustache and goatee and keep the length just right,this trimmer worked great for me and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fushion ProGlide Styler for free via a program run by Gillette.  The styler is a solid tool to trim and shape-up my beard and mustache.  It&#x27;s nice to have a razor product to do the all-in-one shaving and styling at the same time.</li>
    <li> I was provided this shaver via a program Gillette ran. I was orignally thinking this shaver was going to be light with a cheap plastic design with a chepy motor,Boy was I was wrong! This shaver is very heavy duty in the hand,Very solidly built and the vibration moto/trimmer is amazing! It shaved through thick facial hair with easy and never snagged nor got caught up in all the hair. It is also very easy to clean,You just press a small button and the trimmer pops up and just run water to wash all the hair out. That easy. The best part is you can take it in the shower and not have to worry about getting it wet or ruining it. I have had friends notice how my sideburns are much cleaner cut now and they are now going out to purchase one for themselves.</li>
    <li> Although it was smaller than I was expecting it to be it had everything a guy needs&lt;br /&gt;to be kept well groomed. It outlived my expectations for what I had to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really see any negetive aspects of it yet.</li>
    <li> When I first received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer, I thought the styler was small, but to my surprise it is jam packed full of power. I was able to trim &amp; style my entire face in maybe ten minutes flat with no nicks,pulls or error. I have used many of the other trimmers on the market but most are dull and run on AAA batteries and have no power. This takes AA batteries and does not come off in the least bit weak. I really enjoy the style of it and the interchangeable pieces.I am sure I can not do some \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; that I normally wouldn&#x27;t even attempt with any other product of this kind. I am confident that this will become my new one &amp; only styling tool. Anyone who tries it will have to agree on the power, accuracy, comfort and the cut! Great job Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE* I have received this razor to test via a program ran by Gillette.</li>
    <li> It had all the attachments for anything I needed to shave. I would have given it a 5 had it been rechargeable.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer! It is definitely a great product! I got in on a deal that was provided via a program run by Gillette. The product didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like some products. It made my skin smooth and cut great. My wife loves a close shave and this product was perfect! I liked the trimmer as well that got the longer side burn hairs that get in the way or grow faster. It is easy to use and well worth having all your tools in one product. I&#x27;d recommend it to my buddies. Overall a great product that I&#x27;d wish had come out sooner!</li>
    <li> I got this razor free via a program run by Gillette, and it has to be one of the nicest razors i have ever used! I love how close that razor gets leaving a smooth feeling. I also like how the great the stylers work, it is very easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone, i love it!</li>
    <li> I recently received the Proglide Power Stlyler/Trimmer from Gillette and it does not disappoint. A great Trimmer with no irritation. Capable of producing nice clean lines and it&#x27;s so easy to handle it feels like a manual razor. With the multiple attachments that come included it&#x27;s a one stop grooming station. I highly recommend it, as a matter of fact I already have.</li>
    <li> I found this to be an average trimmer.  Nothing special.  I did not like the feel of the handle when shaving and I felt that I needed more choices of trimmer lengths.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I love that it came with an organizer and I didn&#x27;t have to purchase one. Keeps the wife from bugging and it actually fit perfect right next to my shaving cream. I also thought it was great that it has the interchangeable attachments. It allows me to shape up my mustache and then switch to shave the rest of my face with out having to buy a different product. All in All, I give it a 10.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this product for free through a program run by Gillette.  I have to say that I really used the trimmer/styler part of this product.  It was really good on grooming my chest.  Thanks Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette ProGlide Power Trimmer about a week ago and have been very happy. I have tried many other trimmers in the past this is by far and away the best. It also has a very cool design. Can trim your body and face equally well and it can even be used in the shower.I purchased these off Amazon rather than the store and saved some money. They razor blades work wonderful as well, I feel they are the best blades Gillette has ever made. Great product!</li>
    <li> It takes care of every need that you have for shaving. If you fully shave or need a trim its the perfect product. I would recommend you buy this product. It was free thru a program with Gillette so I couldn&#x27;t complain about the price.</li>
    <li> When I received the Proglide trimmer the first thing I loved was the slim and stylish appearance. I usually do not shave in the shower but I do like that it is waterproof. It is very easy to handle and good for everyday use. It doesn&#x27;t clog and so far has consitenly worked well. It does give a close trim and is also effective on my forehead, my eyebrows and the overall hairline. My wife also uses it for my neck and finds it much easier than with trimmers I have previously owned. The Gillette Proglide trimmer is a great product I would recommend to everybody. Only negative is the price.</li>
    <li> What a complete package. After receiving a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler via a program run by Gillette, I was a little worried about putting four blades while vibrating on my face, but was very impressed with the closest, smoothest shave I have had. Additionally, it is very easy to pop off the razor and cleaning up the tight grooming spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styling attachments are also useful, however they are plastic and just while opening the package one of the teeth broke off, which is the only reason it doesn&#x27;t get the full five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of the product is the overall unit. You are able to store everything together in one unit and it is cry compact, so it is easy to store out of site or keep out on the counter and not losing any space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, great design and most importantly it provides a great shave.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use my ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer after receiving one from a program run by Gillette. After a few uses, I realized the versatility that the trimmer had. It comes with 3 different clips to allow precision trimming of any length of facial hair. In addition, I found it useful when shaping up sideburns and trimming other unwanted body hair.  If you are in the market for a trimmer that takes care of the day to day maintenance of body hair without the pain of razor bumps or irritated skin, I highly recommend the ProGlide Styler.</li>
    <li> Recently I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer that I received free by a Gillette program. The Trimmer came with 1 ProGlide Power Cartridge, 3 comb, an organizer and even a battery so it&#x27;s not collecting dust while you try to remember to pick up a battery from the store! This is a great trimmer keep in mind it is to trim not do a full haircut. It is small enough to take on the go without hassle and it works great my wife uses it to line my hair up she says it&#x27;s much better than a regular razor! Although I received my trimmer for free it typically runs under $20 which is a good deal I will recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is a good tool for any man who is as rugged as I am. I grow a thick beard on my face and the ladies love it. But, let&#x27;s get to the facts. As far as the price point is concerned, it&#x27;s extremely fair as I&#x27;ve tried others out in the market. It does work a bit better than most trimmers at the same price point, so it&#x27;s great for the price. As far as the trimming I usually like to keep the designer stubble look or have a very low trimmed beard.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I came across was when I was cutting back on a thick beard, it took me multiple swipes in the same location to get it to the level I wanted. I was using the #1 and it was tiresome. It works a lot better on if you&#x27;re keeping up with your shaving and trimming needs on the daily.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the trimmer goes without any of the attachments, it is fantastic; unfortunately the attachments really drag down the score for me and left me a bit disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, and if you use it as I mentioned then you won&#x27;t need to spend any more money. It works, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Gillette had sent me this razor as part of a promotion they were running. I never would have purchased it or tried it on my own, and I&#x27;ve learned a valuable lesson. This is an excellent product. I was using multiple products for shaving and grooming I had burned through many grooming items due to poor craftsmanship and lost parts and such. I always hated oiling them too. This solves so many of my problems. The weight is excellent and it feels like a high quality item. Its small enough to tuck into a dobb kit for the gym or travel and small enough so it doesn&#x27;t take up all your counter space. The only - about the product is the placement of the on/off button. I&#x27;d prefer it to be on the top instead of the bottom. I guess its a problem for me because of the way I hold my razor, but it seems like it gets turned on and off too easily, especially when you are changing attachments and such.</li>
    <li> The trimmer part of the razor worked like a charm! I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like it, but I did. It&#x27;s a good tool to have for the everyday grooming of the beard, sideburns, eyebrows and other places that might need regular maintenance. It obviously won&#x27;t provide the same results as the professional barber, but it works great for the daily upkeep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: The product was provided to me via program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a free proglide styler from a program ran by Gillette! I regularly trim my beard and this is the utensil I will buy from now on! Even my wife noticed how quickly it took my to trim rather than the normal time it used to take. It is also, so easy to clean! I love that! It is very compact great to take on vacation with us! The blades on the Proglide Styler are super sharp and really makes a straight line with the trimmer. The blades are extraordinary! I will never buy an expensive styler again! You can get this for about $20.00 and it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I was provided this shaver via a program Gillette ran.  I&#x27;ve seen this mentioned in other reviews and I think it bears repeating:  if you are expecting a $20 shaver to be on a professional level, then you are setting yourself up for disappointment.  On the other hand, if you keep your expectations to a reasonable level, then I think you will be pleased.  I like the trimmer, I thought that it provided a nice straight edge and worked very well.  I liked the shaver itself as well.  I had probably let it go too long between shaves, which was my own fault, so it was a little difficult at first, but once I once I used the trimmer, the razor worked great.</li>
    <li> This tool is wonderful for me as I shave my head daily. It is wider than most shaving devices and seems to simply control the curves better on the head. The use of the vibrating feature adds to the smoothness of the shave for sure. Add in the trimmer and 3 clip options for hair length of the trimmer and it is a tool made from heaven!! I would highly recommend this shaver and trimmer to anyone but especially those who shave their heads on a regular basis. It has been wonderful.</li>
    <li> I was offered the chance to try this product out and offer reviews for Gillette. I was very pleased with the product, a great close shave with little to no effort needed! Also, I was done shaving in just minutes. No knicks or anything and left with a smooth clean shave! Unfortunately, $20 is not in my budget (according to my wife) to spend on a product like this! If the price was just a bit cheaper or we had some high value coupons I would buy this product again and again.&lt;br /&gt;Love that I can take this in the shower and it works great. Makes things quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Sooo where do I start? Let&#x27;s first get to the point; this is the best Styler/Trimmer that I have ever used, and I&#x27;m gonna tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me get out of the way the price. You can find a cheaper trimmer, but you will pay for what you get. I have tried the cheaper trimmers, and they are garbage. They don&#x27;t cut well, you have to go over areas multiple times, and quite frankly they feel cheaply made. Gillette&#x27;s new Styler hangs with the other top of the line trimmers, but for half the price (or more) WITH some bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coolest thing, because I like shaving in the shower, is it is WATERPROOF. Electric and waterproof? Awesome!! It&#x27;s grippy so you won&#x27;t drop it, it feels sturdy, runs off 1 AA Battery which is cost effective, vibrates while you shave, and uses disposable proglide cartridges for getting that close shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have never had a styler/trimmer that not only trimmed, but could also SHAVE. I no longer need a razor, AND a trimmer; I have them both in one here. That is too cool. Having a woman in the house, the bathroom space is scarce enough with all of her \\&quot;tools\\&quot; on it, so being able to get 1 less thing out of the way and this also being as compact as it is, is just too ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button lights up with a cool little LED, just for a little \\&quot;cool factor\\&quot;. Granted this trimmer comes with only 3 hair setting pieces (which all fit into the little base in the back), as opposed to 5 or more from other trimmers I have used, I find that most guys including myself only use 1 of the hair settings or maybe 2 at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing, is that it&#x27;s SUPER easy to clean!! The other ones I have used, I&#x27;d have to get a screwdriver, take off the plate, and then clean it with the brush, just meddlesome. Why should it be as complicated as that? It doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t have to bother with any screwdrivers with this one, which is very convenient. I don&#x27;t know how it handles with long hair, but I never have to goover an area twice on my face, it cuts easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer, ESPECIALLY for the price, can&#x27;t be topped. It was made with quality, convenience, style, and bargain in mind. And to top it off, I received this for free from Gillette just to give my feedback on it. Thank you Gillette!</li>
    <li> I was provided this razor by a program sponsored by Gillette. This razor makes grooming extremely easy, especially when I&#x27;m travelling on business. The attachments are easy to use and are all you need to make yourself look good. I highly recommend this product. Gillette has a winner with the Pro-glide.</li>
    <li> Parts are easy to swap out, trimmer works great for face or body hair. Probably only for dudes with serious beards though!</li>
    <li> Excellent works great absolutely fantastic price for what you get!</li>
    <li> Love the clipper. Razor blade feels weird during shaving. Might be slightly heavier than normal razors being the reason</li>
    <li> Works good, for the money this is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Good built quality. The plastic attachments are a bit flimsy and the smallest attachment doesn&#x27;t give you too close of a trim if thats what you&#x27;re looking for. The No.1 translates to No.3 on a regular metallic trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Broke after about 6 months. The trimmer part stopped working when closed....Yes, I did check the batteries!</li>
    <li> If you have a full man sized beard, this is not the trimmer for you.  The guards are good for light stubble at best.</li>
    <li> Excellent body groomer. I have tried many and they all tend to pull at hair and lack the silky smoothness they all claim. This one holds up to the claims and you can trim any spot with out apprehension. Any. If I had to complain it would be that it lacks more guides, and a wider blade so I can groom faster. Other than that, it is practically flawless.</li>
    <li> Just Perfect , what else I can say&#x27;</li>
    <li> this thing left cut marks like crazy!  i have never been cut so much or so badly or so deeply before!  i tried to use this thing for my pubes bad was not happy AT ALL!!  so after leaving a huge amount of hair on my down stairs i decided to go for the pits.  i actually got cut so bad u stated to bleed!  no matter how careful i was there was another cut.  i only got half of one finished!  i am so glad i don&#x27;t have to shave my face!</li>
    <li> The styler is as advertised. The storage system is great, it doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter and it fits all parts in one base. The razor and base unit are comfortable to grip and the trimmer is powerful. Haven&#x27;t cleaned it yet, but the directions show that it is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Coming from a family that opposes &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t quite tell them what this gift was for when I opened it on Christmas, but I freakin&#x27; love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love just having stubble so I mainly use the trimmer with no attachments, it looks nice and rugged when I&#x27;m through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ooooooooooonly thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the heads that go on it (the three blue ones) are supposedly different sizes; I feel like they&#x27;re all the exact same. The angle and width of them are different &#x27;looking&#x27; but... maybe I just don&#x27;t have the eye for whatever difference there was.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad and he loved it. My husband owns one as well and allows him to shave nicely.</li>
    <li> my second one, first one i had for a year, so many uses, i wish the blades weren&#x27;t so pricey tho. oh, i never once oiled the first one i owned, it very well could have lasted longer. also worth noting, i shave my head weekly with the trimmer, so i work it out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, i recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> Good product and price!</li>
    <li> This is actually a great little trimmer.  I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times now and each time it just works.  The single AA battery is still going strong after about 15 minutes of total use.  It is not rechargeable, but I got it for a steal so I can&#x27;t complain.  It comes with a razor attachment but it is a bit of a pain to get the razor blade off to replace it.  It does require a few passes to get everything trimmed but once again, it&#x27;s cheap.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts and I&#x27;ll update this post.  I think the trimmer blades will be the failure point, they are just thin pressed steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for $7.99 on a lightning deal I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Friends, I got a problem with my proglide after two times use: simply stopped works. I believe that I need to buy another type of shave machine. There any solution or &amp;#34;how to solve&amp;#34; available that I can following to get it solved?</li>
    <li> I bought the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor / trimmer combo styler about 5 months ago. I can literally say this is exactly, not almost, but exactly what I was looking for. I skipped around with disposables, low end brand razors, electric razors, you name I tried it. I came across this in Target (sorry Amazon, I&#x27;ll buy my refills here :) and have been using it without any issues ever since. It even came with me to Europe. It&#x27;s light, has a slim profile, the trimmer has 3 different sized attachments, and it comes with a unit to hold everything. I&#x27;m still using the same battery. And it&#x27;s waterproof...well, I&#x27;m not 100% sure but I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower and I haven&#x27;t gotten zapped yet. Anyway, I highly recommend this razor handle unit. I will say Gillette blades aren&#x27;t exactly cheap but they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even gave my dad mine when I went to visit. [[ASIN:B0062IWQVU Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack]]</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband and after (actually)during the FIRST use it broke. It just stop working for no reason. Thought it may have been the battery, we changed that; no use it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t dropped, it was brand new and worked for only 30 seconds and failed.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;Good idea but BAD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This Product is amazing!! If your looking for something fresh ,this is definetly a must. It is user friendly,easy to clean and just a really cool thing to have..I&#x27;ve looked for something like this for quite a while and this beats my expectations..All that money paid and trips to the barber will be something of the past,once ypu get your  hands on one of these. It shaves very efficiently and trims very well! This is a great product.</li>
    <li> It feels better in the hand because of the thicker grip. The trimmer works well for intended purposes. The blade on the back side is a good addition to shape locks.</li>
    <li> So I have finally come to the end of it.  2, 3, 4 and now 5 blades to get a shave that is no better than any before.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this due to many reviews raving about how great the 5 blade (vibrating) system is, and after having this razor for several months I can tell you, the hype is just that... HYPE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades dull just as fast as any other, and the trimmer attachment is junk.  Within just a couple months of trimming my stash... the cutting is done and I&#x27;m back to using my old electric trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The cost of these blades are insane.  Nearly $4 each (if you find a bargain).  The results are in and I&#x27;m going back to look at safety razors.  There is a major revolution happening in shaving and men are finding that 1 blade in a handle that your grandpa used, is still the best and only real way to get the shave you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass this one up gang, and read \\&quot;how to shave like your grandpa\\&quot; on the web.  I think you&#x27;ll be surprised at what you find.</li>
    <li> Has worked really good love to have my beard short so hasnt got down on me so far love it so whoever needs a razor this is the big deal men gentlemen buy it get it</li>
    <li> This is a great product but does have a limited life span.  I like that it can be used in water and that it has the different attachments.</li>
    <li> I bought it for under 10$ during a special offer. I must say that I am very impressed with the quality of the product and comfort to use. Its water resistant so you don&#x27;t have to worry about damaging it while use. Its very sleek and stylish and runs with battery.</li>
    <li> Helped shape and define my stache all November long.  Precision trimming with three different guards helped to clean up my mustache and give me confidence when soliciting Mo-vember donations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when December arrived and the stache was lost, I still go to this for normal shaving.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using Mach3 power and Fusion power for a few years now. This this is simply amazing. Out performs Fusion - proglide has a micro comb - gives a little closer shave. The powered Trimmer is just terrific for people with mustache. I would think it would be good for any one who wants to style. Uses the same proglide blades for refilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a little bulkier, but that&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Schick 3 and 5 for a couple of months, but never liked it. Their lack of the extra styling blade on the back makes it worthless, if you have a mustache (or want to grow one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Amazing. one piece you can have in the bath self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+++ Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;++ Micro comb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Somewhat bulky.</li>
    <li> I found it too bulky to use with normal shaving, don&#x27;t think the power feature gives me any better of a shave over manual, and the trimmer is mediocre.</li>
    <li> It works as intended makes trimming my goatee and sideburns much easier, can&#x27;t believe I did not have this sooner. It will take the regular razors so don&#x27;t have to buy the more expensive styler packs.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim after seeing a commercial on TV. I didn&#x27;t expect to use it much -- but then MO-vember happened (unfortunately for my wife). Now I use it to keep my beard trimmed and neat. It&#x27;s a decent trimmer, but when the trimming-gaurd is taken off for a closer trim/shave, it&#x27;s pretty awful, and you really do need to use the wet shaver for a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased Gillette razors for my husband in the past and I love that this one includes a trimmer. My husband loves it and it gives a very nice close shave and the trimmer is great too!</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t cut anything after like 4 uses :/</li>
    <li> Sleek and inexpensive. The only downside was all the of the guards were very short.</li>
    <li> When the package arrived, it seemed that the box had already been opened. There was a break in the white packing tape that was covered with clear tape. Inside the box the included battery was already placed in the shaver. There is no clear evidence of use, but the organizer/stand has bits of dust.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been able to keep my beard and mustache nicely groomed using this trimmer for quite a few months now since September 2014. At times, I thought I might want to use a larger trimmer just so that I can hurry up and finish in the morning. But lo and behold, this little guy trimmed my facial hair just as much as I wanted and as quick as I think a full clipper what do or would have done. At the same time with this same trimmer, I was able to style my goatee very precisely. The combs were able to keep me from cutting away too much. I still haven&#x27;t used the blade attachment.</li>
    <li> Trapped hair in the motor compartment has been an issue for me. I&#x27;ve owned three of these stylers. ALL stopped working after two or three beard trims, requiring opening/rinsing the motor compartment thoroughly to clear trapped bristles. Neither Gillette&#x27;s package instructions nor FAQs on Amazon&#x27;s product page address this problem. Beard trimmer works best with fresh alkaline batteries, regular cleaning/oiling and when beard isn&#x27;t too long. As batteries wear, the trimmer motor labors and stops often. Haven&#x27;t used so can&#x27;t comment on the Proglide&#x27;s shaving/edging functions but i do like its beard trimming capabilities when it&#x27;s working properly. As I write this, the Styler Special Pack, using the $3 Amazon discount coupon, costs $10.47, a good deal for users who can put up with its beard trimmer deficiencies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years, but recently had to buy a second one because the old one stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is sometimes the trimmer won&#x27;t go full speed unless i get it wet? It&#x27;s confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way I use this thing consistently to trim my beard and the vibration helps shaving become a smooth experience.</li>
    <li> so far no nics or razzor rash  even in very sensitive areas ... ... ... ... ..  very nice product</li>
    <li> PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED, WORKS GREAT, GOOD PRICE.</li>
    <li> Great all in one trimmer I even use it to buzz my head though it takes a fair amount of time</li>
    <li> Great buzzer. I don&#x27;t like a clean shave so this buzzer accommodates me perfectly. I recommend it if you want to trim facial or body hair. Used it on my chest, beware the post trim itch though! (not the buzzers fault)</li>
    <li> I barely shave. So within the last two months I&#x27;ve probably used it five times max, and the blade on the styler started to rotate out of place. This thing looks nice but sadly its garbage.</li>
    <li> I WAS AMAZED AT THIS LITTLE TRIMMER AND LAID ASIDE MY BULKY SHAVER THAT WEIGHS 4 TIMES AS MUCH. IT IS SO EASY TO USE AND THE BATTERY LASTS A LONG TIME. READING THE INSTRUCTIONS REALLY HELPS TO USE THIS TRIMMER THE WAY IT WAS MEANT. BEING WATERPROOF, AND EASY TO CLEAN, I CAN USE IT IN THE SHOWER.</li>
    <li> If you use the Gillette proglide razor then you can figure out how awesome this trimmer is. I use it everyday without any complaints. I have a few different beard trimmers but this is the best one I own now.</li>
    <li> Works great. Best for shaping and trimming but can also give a clean shave if need to. Easy to handle. Three sizes which is good enough. And best of all easy to a clean under running water. My opinion does just as good a job as one for Triple the price yet smaller and more portable.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler provided by a program run by Gillette a few days ago. I have been using Gillette products for years now and was very eager to give this one a try. A great razor that is conviently attached to a nice trimmer. It is always a hassle keeping both on the counter in my bathroom and this saves a lot of space. My wife really appreciates that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: It is Gillette so you know it is great quality and something you can depend on. What more needs to be said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: It runs on a battery so the trimmer is mainly targeted at small maintenance for your facial hair. If you wanted to trim your entire beard with this one you may be very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great buy! There are a lot of competitors entering the razor field and yet Gillette still is staying ahead of them all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the Gillette fusion proglide styler power trimmer, this was free to me through a program by Gillette. I received this in the mail early yesterday, and used it last night and i absolutely love this product! The power trimmer works perfectly, and it is made for the face and also any other part of the body that can use some \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;. It works with your body, and i feel confident that this could be the only grooming tool I&#x27;ll ever need. I suggest you purchase this product, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recieved this trimer free through a program sponsored by Gillet and I like the way I can trim around my sideburns without messing them up. I will definatly recomend to my friends. I probably wouldnt have ever bought this because of price but it did a great job.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works well</li>
    <li> This item seems to work fine, and the plastic stand to keep everything together is nice, but I was appalled at the grossly excessive amount of packaging.  This is a very small item, but came in a large box additional boxes inside with little cubbies for each small accessory.  The waste is appalling and Amazon should be ashamed!</li>
    <li> The Gillete Fusion Power Trimmer was provided to me by Gillette via a special program. I was really excited to try it out. When i finally did, it did not disappoint! It felt good in my hands and seemed to put together well. My big concern was how it would opperate in the shower, and it thrived in the water just as well. The only problem that I noticed personally noticed was that even without one of the three guards on it did not trim very close. But i kind of like the stubble look anyway. If you&#x27;re looking for a quality made trimmer, small, powerful, and versatile, then look no further, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Trimmer will be just right for you!</li>
    <li> I got mine free through a program offered by Gillette.  I was using the Shick hydro 5 but after using this product, I got a smooth shave and am making the switch.  I love that there are so many different things to use this for.  I also used it to trim some of my body hair as well.  I just love the trimmer with three different comb sizes.  Honestly it has reduced some of the time it takes for me to get ready in the morning and I look great.  Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I  got this product for free. As soon as I pulled it out of the box and put it on my face I liked it. it let me keep my scruff nice and neat so the wife is happy about that. I would buy one for a friend or relative as a gift. It comes with 3 size blades and a razor.</li>
    <li> I received mine through a free program run by Gillette.  Call me a changed man!  I tend to buy generic razors thinking they are the same... boy was I wrong.  Going off a whim after frustration of maintaining my body hair I was hoping this would make the possibility of maintenance a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried it when my hair was dry... not a single nick or scratch.  Although some places it hurts due to sensitivity, it plowed easily through everything I threw at it.  I then tried the shower as it claims it works.  CORRECT!  Just as good as dry right through the hair!  If you wish it has 3 different guides to keep a beard the length you wish although I did not use as my goal is no body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it come with a trimmer, but as well as a razor!  This razor allows you after done shaving to get the fine finish to become smooth and clean up any hairs that refuse to get rid of the stubble near the body.  GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I for sure will be continuing to use this and make great Christmas gifts for the friends and family!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the styler it works as well a products twice it&#x27;s price . it leave nice clean line with no irritation.</li>
    <li> I received the Proglide Styler thru a promotional campaign by Gillette. I was concerned at first with the possibility that the device would be underpowered or not be able to handle my beard but i was pleasantly surprised. even though the device is powered by a single double a battery it still delivered a great trim on my beard and for my scalp. I am a bit sorry i didnt know about this device sooner as i recently spent 70 dollars on a rechargable beard trimmer and if i knew this existed i would have saved my money.</li>
    <li> This product was receive from Gillette for free. The Gillette Fusion Proglide ,trimer atch is not really that functional if you have short facial head I keep my beard very short and the trimmer does not get close enough to touch it. My mustache is also to short for me to effectively use the trimmer attachment. Today I used the razor for the first time. while it did a good job the vibration motion felt add. The shave was close and smooth.  I do not know if I would by this package because of the trimmer aspect of it not being relevant to me.</li>
    <li> I have always had a difficult time find time to shave or if I do have the time, finding out that my trimmer hasn&#x27;t been charged and I cant use it.  I have little time in the mornings to do everything I need to get done and waiting for my trimmer to charge is not one of them.  With the power trimmer, I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to fully charge or recharge if I run out of juice.  The fact that it is battery powered makes shaving/trimming so much easier.  I dont have to worry about going into work with a half shaven face.  I am so glad I got this free styler from Gillette otherwise I would be waiting at home for my trimmer to charge.</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome. Well built and dependable. I have always liked Gillette products.I recommend this for anybody who needs a all around shaver</li>
    <li> this product is amazing now i dont have to fight with two different things to groom and shave my face i have a all in one device makes life so much easier. This styler was provided via a program run by Gillette! thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This is my hands down favorite shaver out there. My only request to Gillette would be to offer longer guards. I received one gratis! I&#x27;m lucky like that!</li>
    <li> I received the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler in the mail and was skeptical as to how much this little unit could do. I was surprised by the power and many things this unit can do. The shave and trim were very close and smooth. I have not used many Gillette products in the past but am sold to try them in the future.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the Gillette Fusion power Trimmer. So far is has been a great product. The blades are excellent as they perfectly cut ever hair folical on my face. I have not used it in the shower yet but will do soon. This is the best trimmer i have ever used. It was easy to use and its light weight.</li>
    <li> hi ther guys . just wanted to tell you guys that i have been using the proglide styler for the gillette. and whooo! it glide like skates on an ice skating rink. Oh by the way i have gotten this totally for free from Gillette company. this product for me worked in good use in many ways.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free via a program run by Gillette.  If it wasn&#x27;t free I would of bought one based on my experiences.  I have used it as both an everyday razor and also for trimming especially my sideburns.  What I like is having both functions in a compact easy to use product, no worrying about getting it wet and what I would consider a fair price if purchased.  It also provides a close clean shave even with multiple days of facial growth.  What I don&#x27;t like is that it is needs a small travel case not just the stand and it also needs a place to put additional blade heads on the stand.  Overall great product and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was given the chance to test out the new gillette fusion proglide power styler, thanks to a program offered by gillette. When I first opened the package I realized that there was no need to search for a battery because the battery was included and the trimmer was ready to go. It fits nicely in your hand, has plenty of power, and is very lightweight. I used the trimmer on my beard, while I was in the shower, since the trimmer is waterproof, and I was surprised at how close a shave it gave me. It worked well on the sideburns too.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a program run by Gillette and I love it. As soon as I got it I went right to the shower. I loved the ability to trim in the shower and the power trimmer has surprising power for being battery operated. It was easy to handle and had a nice grip to it. I loved the different attachments to the power trimmer. It came with a 1, a 2 and a 3 attachment. It was nice because this allowed you to do the whole beard and not just the edges.Overall I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best multi-use trimmers that doubles as a razor for a reasonable price. I used it for the first time after participating in a promotion by Gillette. I had been looking for a reasonably price electric razor that I could use to keep my sideburns trimmed but found that most were either too powerful or too expensive. The Proglide styler is small, easy to store and easy to use when traveling. It cuts close enough to clean up without leaving any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend and there are usually coupons available so you can get it for less than $20.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide Styler it makes manscaping so much less time consuming and makes me feel fresh and clean! I would recomend this product to anyone! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I got these product for free from a program run by Gillette. The blades in this razor were unbelievably amazing. They shaved on my face so smoothly and easily. Also I have very sensitive skin, I get irritated very easily with almost any razor but this one is a miracle. This is my very first Gillette razor and the blades were just amazing. So I recommend this razor to anyone with or without sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program run by Gillette. The next morning when it was time to shave, I used the product and I am completely happy with it.  The ProGlide name is appropriate because while I was shaving I was thinking of how it just glides across my face. Very smooth, and I felt no tugging of the hairs during the shave.  I used the trimmer to shape my sideburns up, and I was impressed how well it worked. No snagging, just complete smoothness while trimming. The product is also quiet. I was surprised because other trimmers I have used in the past were a bit noisy.  I highly recommend this product as it will not disappoint at all. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a huge Gillette fan. When I was chosen to receive this styler kit for free through a program run by Gillette I was pumped. I had looked at it in the store a few times but hadn&#x27;t bought it yet. I wanted a power trimmer kit to sculpt my side burns and other body hair. When I got it the first thing I noticed was what a great size it was. It&#x27;s small enough to travel. I&#x27;m in the military so it&#x27;s definitely good to have something like this to take with me on the go. The whole kit is great its everything you need. It&#x27;s perfect for manscaping and you can take it in the shower so it&#x27;s so convienient. I&#x27;ve never owned a power trimmer before. I&#x27;ll never buy another brand! For the price and quality this is an amazing deal.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to a few friends. I love it. Gillette doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my Gillette Fusion Styler that I recieved for free through a program ran by Gillette. I am most excited about the interchanging attachments. I like the fact you can go from razor to trimmer and guarded attachments with ease. The handle being waterproof is a big plus for me as well and has awesome grips so it isn&#x27;t slippery when it gets wet. As for size, It handles very easily and also very compact and great for a simple one pack travel item.</li>
    <li> I received the Power Trimmer as part of a program run by Gillette. I have been using my Remington Titanium Personal Groomer for year to maintain my goatee and sideburns, so I was interested in trying the ProGlide out.&lt;br /&gt;Using the ProGlide Power Trimmer, I was able to very easily trim my goatee to the right length with the included combs. Trimming the edges was also easy, as was trimming my sideburns. They have never looked so crisp.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fixed combs over the adjustable ones with that come with some other razors. Adjustable combs seem to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; while trimming, sometime forcing me to cut my goatee much shorter than planned.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be the use of a AA battery instead of a rechargeable battery. I would prefer a rechargeable system that allows it to recharge during the day. This is easily remedied by purchasing rechargeable AA batteries.</li>
    <li> I received the Power Trimmer to try for free by a program run through Gillette. Overall it is a great trimmer. It cuts quite well and it is very compact. You can do very precise trims with it and using it I have not nicked myself once. It glides easy and is very easy to handle. You can&#x27;t beat the price on it!!</li>
    <li> Was impressed at all the different things this trimmer can be used for! It comes at a great price compared to some other high brands and I believe it works just as good!</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer from Gillette and was thoroughly satisfied by its quality... And to find out that it&#x27;s under $20? It&#x27;s a definite investment and gift for friends this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides its great performance and sleek design, it&#x27;s also shower proof which makes shaving in the morning and the shower even more convenient.  It also comes with a few guards which makes the trimmer versatile.</li>
    <li> This product is well thought out and easy to use the trimmer is well weighted and grips to your hand with ease.  The design of the shaver attachment looks like it was an afterthought but works quite well! Will recommend to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> I tried this razor out due to a program that Gillette was running. I LOVED this razor. Face guys one of the first things that pops in our minds is to keep our ladies happy, and this little razor is great for manscaping. Quick and easy and my lady loved it afterward. For the price I strongly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> For the price, I haven&#x27;t used a better electric trimmer. Keep in mind, there are better ones out there, but nothing that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;+Works well. Not super powerful, but good enough to trim away a full beard.&lt;br /&gt;+Comes with 3 blade combs, which all work well.&lt;br /&gt;+The included base actually works great for storing the trimmer and all attachments, unlike many other trimmer kits I&#x27;ve bought, which the attachments just sit loosely in a tray. The blades store firmly in the back side of the stand and don&#x27;t fall out.&lt;br /&gt;+Easy to clean. The head can be \\&quot;unlocked\\&quot; to tap out hair clippings, but do not do what the instructions say and wash it in water! Even though the blades are \\&quot;stainless steel\\&quot;, they WILL corrode. Use a good trimmer lubricant to keep them clean, sharp, and rust-free.&lt;br /&gt;+Has a nice, solid feel to it. Doesn&#x27;t seem cheaply-made and has a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-Rather loud for it&#x27;s size. Use a good trimmer lubricant to cut down on the noise. Can&#x27;t use it in the early AM while the lady is still sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;-Wish it came with one extra blade comb that&#x27;s just a bit longer. The 3 included combs are pretty short.&lt;br /&gt;-Uses AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;-The shaving attachment is worthless. Do it right and just use a manual shaving razor. Trying to shave using the attachment is just cumbersome. Imagine trying to shave with a banana. The nice thing is that the shaving blade is the same as the Gillette Fusion series, so you can just pop the included blade on to your regular Fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;Even though I received this trimmer for free via a promotion run by Gillette, I would DEFINITELY buy one for the $20 MSRP. As soon as I used this trimmer for a few days, I threw out my old Wahl trimmer kit. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette 3-in-1 styler for free via a program run by Gillette.  I love it.  It&#x27;s the best one out there for the price. It doesn&#x27;t leave razor burn and it does the job real well.  I would recommend this to everybody.</li>
    <li> Is what it says it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does some light grooming, a few different lengths from almost shave close to a few mm&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor attachment is nifty I guess, real benefit of this product is the battery operated light groomer though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides are that the clips just sit in the back...I can&#x27;t really think of a much worse way to put them in the stand. The battery doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for about 2 weeks now. This razor was provided to me by a program&lt;br /&gt;run by Gillette to try. I was anxious to try it because I am a man that has a significant&lt;br /&gt;amount of body hair and I also have facial hair. The trimmer did a decent job overall,&lt;br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t anything special but it did the job like any comparable trimmer on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it when I was in the shower and find it did about the same as when it was dry.&lt;br /&gt;However, when you are using it in the shower it is easy to wash the hair away so I like&lt;br /&gt;that. Overall for the money it is a good trimmer, but don&#x27;t buy it expecting it to be the&lt;br /&gt;best trimmer you have ever used.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette. I  would highly recommend this product! Use in the shower and love the grip of the handle. Close smooth shave without nicks, razor burn or bumps. You can never go wrong with Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler as a free sample from Gillette and have been very impressed with how well it works. The size of the trimmer head is just right for following the contours of my face and getting a nice even trim. And the three guard sizes let me easily adjust the length of my beard to the cut and look I want. It would be nice if the Styler uses rechargeable batteries rather than standard AA, but so far it&#x27;s still running strong after a few uses. All in all, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Gillette ProGlide styler and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer,works as well as other leading brand name trimmers.i like the way the attachments snap on and the power shave attachment is also a plus.battery operated so no cords or charging stand needed. the stand has slots for each attachement where other brands do not.i have used this to trim my mustache.very easy to use and works very well.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer free from a promotional program Gillette is running.  I love this little guy.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is a perfect fit for my gym/work bag.  Love that it requires 1 AA battery so I don&#x27;t have to worry about finding an outlet when at the gym or in the lockerroom at work.  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t give you that nice smooth shave as the razor but it&#x27;s quite handy little tool when all you need a little trim.  Overall I would recommend Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have a good amount of facial hair that I keep maintained rather than going with a clean shave because my 5 oclock shadow will come in 15 minutes after I shave so rather than fight it, I maintain a mustache and beard.  I am really loving the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack.The razor that I received from a Gillette promotion works the best than so many other razors I have used. The Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack trimmer also works fine with the razor to help extend the visit to the barber. It contours to the shape of my face well. I am not a man-scaping type of guy but I imagine it would do well to help maintain that type of maintainence.  I would suggest this product to any guy who shaves and trims daily. You will be happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This was not only the best shave I ever had with no cuts on my face but to be able to trim up my facial hair with a 1 2 or 3 guard thats held in the nice holder was awesome.</li>
    <li> This free Gillette product is awesome! I consider myself a perfectionist and trimming is a must. The 3 trim guides made manscaping a breeze. The power razor gave me a close shave and made edging my goatee easy. The trimmer gave me clean straight lines which is what I look for in a trimmer. I really like the storage space on the back for the guides; keeps my bathroom nice and clean. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this for my father for Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> I used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Trimmer and I was very satisfied. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Trimmer for free from Gillette to try. The trimmer is great for detailed trimming around mustache, beard or goatee, which I currently have. You are able to get up close to cut defined lines because of its smaller size. The three combs that come with the trimmer allow you to trim at different lengths and are easily attached. The razor-blade attachment when attached to the trimmer made it a little long and bulky for me, although it did give me a very close and irritation free shave.</li>
    <li> Sleek design travel easier battery powered great design. Variety of clip sizes love that its small to travel with me.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product Free through a program run by gillette The product works great and is so easy to use . The trimmer is so easy to manage and handle, it fits perfectly in your hand.The trimmer makes everything so much easier. The blades conture to the design of your face and make trimming extemely easy and pain free, no pulled hair. .i would recommend this product to anyone who was looking for a great trimmer razor and styler in one!!!</li>
    <li> this product works great! I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times to trim my eyebrows and my beard. I&#x27;m glad they invented something like this that isn&#x27;t that expensive and easy to use! I got this product free by a program run by Gillette! Thank you for the opportunity and the product.</li>
    <li> I must admit, this product had me skeptical as I have always used a safety razor and had seen no possible way for my face to be smoother. This product was provided by Gillette as a free sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buzzing razor is a bit scary at first. Once you complete your first pass though the benefits are obvious. Using my normal shave butter the ProGlide effortlessly cut through 2 days worth of weekend stubble. When I tackle a stubble such as this with the safety razor it is a cringe worthy task. The ProGlide cut right through with nary a bit of snag or irritation. Very impressed so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trimmer/Groomer attachments are also very well made. I have used a norelco trimmer for the last several years and this works just as well if not better than the much pricier norelco. The motor is strong enough to tackle thick hair and it is sharp... so sharp it never snagged once. Very pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ProGlide is now a permanent part of my daily routine, the safety razor has been shunned to my travel bag for limited use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 vs 5 stars is the fact that this unit is not re-charchable. While changing batteries is only a minor inconvenience, I like the green factor of re-chargable devices.</li>
    <li> Tired of using my large electric beard trimmer, I was looking for a smaller battery powered trimmer to keep by beard and sideburns neat for work.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide does a great job.  It has a nice feel, easy to clean and easy to control.  The guides provided give a consistant length without a lot of effort.  It is compact so I throw it in my shaving bag when I travel.  I used to trim once a week because it was such a pain. Now I touch up my beard and sideburns a few times a week. I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> I used to use my electric shaver with popup trimmer for basic trimming. But the bulky shaver sometimes makes it hard to see where I&#x27;m trimming. So I switched to the  Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Trimmer. It&#x27;s smaller head makes it easier to see where I&#x27;m cutting. Besides sideburns, eyebrows &amp; mustache I&#x27;ll buzz around my ears to prolong the time between haircuts. I have used the regular Fusion Proglide and was happy with it but the Power Trimmer with the shave attachment definitely results in a smoother shave . I usually shave in the shower so it is easy to rinse as I use it. I can&#x27;t really say anything bad it works well for me.</li>
    <li> My husband got this razor as part of the BzzAgent program. He wears a goatee and used the razor and trimmer set to clean up his face and trim the hair of his goatee. It does a nice job. THe razor provided a close shave without causing any skin irriation or cuts. The trimmer offers several adjustable lengths to cut the hair at so he could cut it a little shorter or leave it longer if her wished. The interchargable trimmer/razor top is a great feature. It makes for less clutter in the bathroom cabinet! :) My husband said he would recommend thsi razor/trimmer system. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price, either!</li>
    <li> When I first saw this product, I was not expecting great results from a battery operated trimmer.  After using the ProGlide Styler for a few weeks, I have been pleasantly surprised.  I have come to the conclusion that the trimmer attachments work pretty well.  Unfortunately the razor attachment didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than other disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different size trimmers worked well in cleaning up facial hair to the length I wanted.  Was able to use just the handle to clean up the outline with good results.  The only draw back for the trimmer for me was on thicker areas of body hair.  I feel that it could use a tad more power, just seemed to take a little longer to clean those areas up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caddy that comes with the trimmer works really well in keeping it all organized and pieces together.  Also, makes it really convenient when I took it on a trip with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this trimmer if you are looking for a compact and portable trimmer with decent results.  Like I said before, the razor attachment is no better or worse than other disposables on the market.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!  I got this styler free from a program run by Gillette.  I was a little skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve never used a power razor before.  But what is great is that not only can I shave, I can trim and clean up my lines very conveniently.  I used it for manscaping and it worked great everywhere.  No snags at all.  I really like that it is as high quality as my plug in trimmer.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillete Fusion Proglide Styler for free via a program run by Gillete and I must say that it is without a doubt one of the lightest and most easy to use trimmers/stylers that I have ever used. Not only does is glide very smoothly on your skin, but it is also watertight, allowing you to use it in the shower and in other wet environments. Additionally, it also comes with it&#x27;s own storage compartment, making it look nice ontop of your bathroom sink. Overall a fantastic product that I would absolutely recommend for whatever you need to trim.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this to all, not only those that have beards, but to all who want to have a clean crisp shave and a well groomed appearance. a power trimmer built in you get the best of both worlds and you can keep yourself looking good.</li>
    <li> I needed a new danger zone weed whacker, this fit the bill so I got it with a coupon.  At first I was skeptical of a $20 motorized mass of blades getting anywhere near my balls; after a few weeks of regular use I can say your junk is in good hands and will look great.  The way the blades are curved down decreases concern of getting your flesh balloon caught in the razors.  The single blue guard it comes with is a great length for trimming the pube farm down to a respectable length while allowing for quick cleaning of the left over clippings via the quick release.  All in all about as good as you can get for a 20 something dollar razor.  Get two, one for your face one for your warrior. You&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> This styler was provided to my for free via a trial program run by Gillette. And while I was skeptical of this styler/trimmer at first it turned out to be top notch. I was skeptical because it is angled at 90 degrees rather than the typical 130 to 180 degree angle. However, this actually makes the trimmer more versatile as you can get a better angle to trim your mustache line above your lip, your soul patch, and even the stray nose/ear hair with little difficulty. I will alos say that the little thing is powerful compared to my Whal and Remmington trimmers that have a rechargeable internal battery. I also like the stand that accommodates the trimmer and all the attachments.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide through a program by Gillette. As someone who is more of a &#x27;trimmer,&#x27; rather than a &#x27;shaver,&#x27; it&#x27;s perfect for my use. The styler feature, allows me to trim back the beard/scruff while the razor attachment is perfect for cleaning up the jungle of unsightly hair on the neck. Being waterproof is an advantage as I can take care of all of this in the shower, where I prefer to. It&#x27;s pretty convenient to have all of these functions in one device.</li>
    <li> Only change I&#x27;d make is a larger/wider shaving head.  Or the ability to swap out different size heads. Works very well.</li>
    <li> I felt this was a great product for the price. It got through my stubles smoothly. It was also easy to get a good shave in the shower which I liked. I recieved this free from a program run by gillette. The trimmer gets hard to reach spots like under the nose and trims close enough how you want it. The razor blades are great for my sensitive skin but harsh hair, I did not get any razor burn and noticed my shave lasted longer than normal blades. I would recomend this to friends and family. The handle was also and I love the easy way to change an attatchment</li>
    <li> I got the razor free via a program provided by Gillette. This razor delivers a smooth shave and didn&#x27;t pull at my facial hair. I have a facial goatee that I trim down to stubble length a couple times a week and the trimmer feature easily does the job. Since this razor is water proof it&#x27;s very easy to clean. The trimmer stand/storage is very compact and looks good on the counter top.</li>
    <li> I recently received my power trimmer provided by gillette through a tryout program and right out of the box it worked great... I like the smallness of the trimmer and the fact that it runs on a single battery with lots of power and it keeps the power for a long while. the added attachments were a  plus. only drawback I can see if the bulky trimming kit holder. A++</li>
    <li> Clean, is the way I like it and this gave me the smoothest experience I had so far. Pretty handy with its shape and safe even after 5 blades, well packed and well balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was given to me for free under a program run by Gillette and there was no better way to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Received the ProGlide Fusion Power blades as part of a  free offer from Gillette. Have used an electric razor user for many years but was seeking a change in shaving equipment. The ProGlide Power blades exceeded my expectations for a blade shaver.  I intentionally waited an extra two days to shave to be sure I could test the Fusion ProGlide with additional days growth. Extremely smooth glide and close shave to all parts of the face and neck. No pulling at stubble, cuts or nicks. Very comfortable to use. The blades were easy to clean up and store.&lt;br /&gt;The compact storage device for trimmer and attachments is easy to use, convenient, and light weight. I plan to travel  with it in the next couple of weeks..</li>
    <li> I received this for free from Gillette. The style trimmer is really nice for a small trimmer. It comes with 3 different length clip settings, the lowest one trims your beard pretty close. If you want to use the trimmer without any length settings to style trim, do that first, because if you trim your beard for a while, the trimming blade tends to get hot. If you shave in the shower, this is a nice tool to get everything done at once with the ability to hook the Mach 4 with a straight razor to the top.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler through a program run by Gillette and probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it otherwise until speaking to friends on their opinion.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is easy to use and works great.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments since using it. Great product!</li>
    <li> The unit was not big and bulkie.  The unit is also very lightweight.  It had a tight water seal on it. If you dropped in water is contiued to worked.  I was able to get this for free through a program run through Gillette.  It did outstanding job keeping your mustache trimmed. The attachments that came with it was easy to use and helped to make it easy to trim.</li>
    <li> The ProGlide Styler is a great product. You have all the convenience of trimming, styling, and shaving in one simple product. The 3 trimmer comb attachments that come with it allow you to choose the length of your style and the Fusion blade attachment that comes with gives you that close smooth shave that you love along with those crisp lines when you use the single styler blade on the back. This is a must have for men who take pride in their grooming.</li>
    <li> When I opened the the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler blades I was given via a program run by Gillette I was immediately a bit skeptical of trying to shave with a beard trimmer of this size. Despite the awkward holding experience I did feel like the blades gave me a super smooth shave even though it was a bit difficult to learn to grip the handle. I absolutely felt as if the shave was better than my usual razor on my sensitive skin. The trimming function works pretty well - it&#x27;s no Wahl trimmer but it does the job.</li>
    <li> So, I received my fusion pro-glide styler and since I usually sport a little goatee I was excited and optimistic that this product would come in quite handy.  And I got it free from a program run by Gillette, so bonus.&lt;br /&gt;  When I first opened the package was impressed with the stand and the storage of the length combs, it makes for a nice little footprint on the bathroom counter.  When I first used the trimmer I was pretty impressed by the ergonomics.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to trim the lines of your face, that little divot on my chin and the laugh lines that form the mustache are no trouble.  As for the length combs, I didn&#x27;t really have much use for them personally, but I do like the way they clip on to the trimmer.  One HUGE plus and what sets the fusion pro-glide apart is how easy it is to clean.  The click open and wash out cleaning can&#x27;t get any better.  Such a big advantage that I haven&#x27;t seen from any other trimmer out there.  Next is the ability to attach the razor to this trimmer, another aspect that I haven&#x27;t seen, this makes the pro-glide styler the only product you need for your trimming shaving needs.  Now, I had never used a power razor before and I thought they were kind of a gimmick, but I have been proven incorrect.  With my sensitive skin the vibration helps glide the pro-glide across my toughest shaving spots and I am a convert to the power razor from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;  Ok now for the places that could be improved on,  I travel a good bit for work and it would be great if a small travel bag was included.  Put this in my suitcase and when I got to where I was going I had to search for the combs and razor head attachments.  To have a little bag to put this in would be great.&lt;br /&gt;Next, this is truly just a trimmer, do not try and cut a full on beard clean with this, I did and it just didn&#x27;t have the power to cut the thick hair without pulling and bogging down.  This is for facial, at home maintenance, not a hedge clipper for the big jobs.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as with all the razors you buy today really, would it kill you to include even one replacement cartage for the razor?  It takes a little time to get use to a new razor and you&#x27;re not giving us any replacements to keep us with your razor for any amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, a few minor annoyances but this is my new, all in one, grooming system.  Now I just need to go buy more razors for it.</li>
    <li> I received this styler for free via a program run by Gillette. As has been mentioned in other reviews, this is a pretty good \\&quot;styler\\&quot;. It failed to have enough juice to do some heavier lifting with thicker hair. If you&#x27;re in the market to have get an item that edges well and can trim lighter areas this would work well for you.</li>
    <li> I got the proglide trimmer from Gillete as a free product review. For free this trimmer is okay. It trims sideburns with ease and handles well.&lt;br /&gt;I checked the price on-line and I would pay that amount for a trimmer that is only slightly better than using my old razor to trim.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a free program run by Gillette. The Trimmer came in a very attractive package that included the Trimmer, 3 swappable guides, a standard Gillette Fusion blade attachment, and base that held all the contents in a functional manner. All of the attachments fit firmly on Styler and they did a good job of regulating the closeness of the cut. The trimmer did a consistent job of hair removal on my sensitive skin without causing any irritation. I was able to have it remove both facial and body hair in the shower without any issues. While the trimmer doesn&#x27;t quite hold up to the quality of more expensive trimmers, the overall experience is still pretty solid. I would recommend the product to anyone looking for a quality electric shaver at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> When you first pick this up you will notice how small it is but such a premium feel it has. One of the best features is that is can be used in the shower! This does it all and does it very well. If want something that you can use between trips to the barbershop and so forth, this is the way to go! You can&#x27;t go wrong. This thing gets really close without skin irritation and will having you look like a pro performed it! This only con is that it takes a AA battery so that you will have to change it depending on how often you use. I would say that it could lasts 2 weeks easy with regular use.</li>
    <li> First off I want to mention that the Power Trimmer I am reviewing was received free via a program run by Gillette.  Now for the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very pleased with the Power Trimmer - it makes it so much easier to trim and shape my beard than using the plug-in clippers I was using before.  Instead of trimming once every 10 days or so (or when the wife says it&#x27;s looking rather straggly) - I can just grab the trimmer from the included stand, go into the shower and start trimming my beard (along with other body hair).  Now before I shave, I can make sure my beard is trimmed properly - and quickly too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great how everything goes back into the stand - a place for everything - which means less clutter in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for this is the razor attachment - with it attached it just makes it too big for me - I&#x27;d rather use a separate razor to do the actual shaving - something that fits better in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give this 4 out of 5 stars - would have been 5 if the razor attachment didn&#x27;t make this so bulky - but the trimming portion is just perfect.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler from a program run by Gillette.  Without this free introduction, I don&#x27;t know that I would have went and bought this product, but I would have been missing out on one of the best shaves I have ever had in my life.  With the various attachments and convenient size, the Proglide is a wonderful tool that works on even the hardest face.  I was able to trim my rather thick beard with minimal effort.  The only downside I saw in the product is the packaging that the Styler is in.  The product is placed rather securely in the package making it difficult to get out.  It also is difficult to change heads at first, but these negatives are far outweighed by the positives such as the ease of trimming, the obvious way to tell if the blades need changed (the strip above the blades will turn to white as it is used up), and the smooth feeling left behind.  This product would be highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was selected by Gilette to participate in a program they were running to review new products, and received it in the mail a few weeks ago.  I was curious to see if the Fusion Proglide&#x27;s trimmer would beat the experience of using a typical beard-trimmer that I use for most of my &#x27;manscaping&#x27;.  After using it about a dozen times in various capacities, I have to state that the answer to this is an unequivocal \\&quot;yes!\\&quot; I&#x27;ll cover the ways I used it, and how it performed in each of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I like to keep the stubbled look on my face, and until now have used a beard-trimmer, without any guard over the teeth to knock back my stubble every few days.  This works, but it can pull at the longer whiskers pretty painfully, and you have to go pretty slow.  With the Fusion Proglide neither of these is an issue.  Without using any of the provided guards and just using the trimmer I was able to achieve the look I was going for, and after using it several times I am yet to have it cause a single pulled whisker, and can go at any speed I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it to edge my side-burns and keep them neatly trimmed as well.  Again in this regard the trimmer performs admirably.  The lines at the bottom are crisp and clean, and with the guards I can trim the hair a bit shorter if I would like. No complaints on the performance here either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as far as man-scaping goes, I like to keep things clean shaven, especially on my chest and stomach, but often go a couple weeks between trimmings.  I could use a razor right from the start, but if the hair has grown too long the razor ends up needing to be rinsed after every single stroke, and on top of that it&#x27;s not a very close shave with this method.  By using the pro-glide trimmer first on whatever area I&#x27;m shaving this problem is eliminated, and the shaving goes much faster and the result is much smoother.  The pro-glide trimmer can be used on pretty much any area you can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for howit performs in the shower or out of the shower, I was skeptical at first that the shower performance would be just as good as using it dry.  In the end though it performs literally just as well in both situations, I notice no drop-off in quality of trim when using it in the shower, and the wet stubble does not clog it up at all.  Cleaning is easy, the trimmer head pops up and can easily be cleaned out in about 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe, and it&#x27;s a small one, is that the trimmer gets somewhat hot if you use it for several minutes.  It&#x27;s not burning by any means, but can get a tad uncomfortable if you have it pressed to your skin for a few seconds for some reason, if it has been on for several minutes.  This is only an issue for maybe the final 5% of the time you&#x27;re trimming, and only if it&#x27;s been a particularly long session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion this product did everything I needed it to, did it well, and performed equally superb in both wet and dry conditions. GREAT product</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer from a free program run by Gillette. I was honestly hesitant to try it, because my skin is typically extremely sensitive to shaving or trimming to any kind. I am so glad I did, because it worked great! No razor burn or bumps left behind - only a great trim!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my job, I shave my face every day... so using the trimmer to get to hard to reach areas was easy for me. However when I tried  to trim other body hair, I had some instances where the styler actually pulled my hair - that is to be somewhat expected for such a small razor and long hair. For maintaining a trim or different style, I think that it is an amazing piece of equipment. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer for the price. Mine has been running strong for quite some time now. Recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband received this trimmer/razor free via a program from Gillette.  What he discovered first was how compact the trimmer was compared to the more professional trimmer he was currently using.  it is lightweight, and easy to hold on to, even in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes the versatility of the 3 different trim heads, this helps keep his beard and mustache looking great!  he has also discovered it is great for manscaping the chest and underarm areas too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says cleaning is a breeze, just snap the trimmer head open and rinse under water.  Once it is dry you add a drop of trimmer oil if needed.  He likes the convenience of not having to charge it with a cord every few days.  He has been using it daily for almost 3 weeks and it is still running strong on the original AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;The trim heads are made of a hard plastic and do look like they might break easily if dropped.  so he is extra careful with it, especially in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d this product to try as part of free trial run by a program put on by Gillette.  But my reviews are not swayed by that!  I really like this trimmer.  I like how accurate the lines are and how it trims evenly.  I really liked being a part of this free offer program run by Gillette; I use many of their products and this one stood up there with all of the others.  I don&#x27;t think I would ever use it in the shower, but it is a nice feature to have just in case.  I would have given it 5 stars if there was a cord option - I don&#x27;t think the batteries will last too long.  But overall, I really like this product!</li>
    <li> I rarely use a blade, so meeting this electric razor/trimmer was great. It&#x27;s small and powerful, much more useful than the larger electric trimmers I&#x27;ve used, which seem stuck between head-hair and beard-hair use. I love being able to use it in the shower and to make precise moves with it. Thank you for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was afraid the trimmer packed too big a punch for a small device--it surprised me how strong it was when I first used it--but after a couple uses I became accustomed to it. Kind of like driving a car with a sensitive gas pedal! The trimmer came to me through a Gillette-sponsored marketing program as part of a larger set. I mostly use the electric trimmer, and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I let me beard grow a bit before using the trimmer, and I needed to do some manscaping as well.  I tried the trimmer on my face over the sink, and found it to be a bit ineffective; I usually use a razor and scissors to keep things clean and trim.  The electric trimmer seemed to take a bit too much time compared to what I am used to.  It finally did the job, and didn&#x27;t botch anything up.  I tried the attachments, and they seemed to make fading a bit easier.&lt;br /&gt;I used the product on my chest hair, and once again it took a bit more time than I was hoping for.  The job was done right, though, and I didn&#x27;t have any surprises from the trimmer (which is a good thing when shaving your body).&lt;br /&gt;I manscaped with the thing in the shower... first time using an electric razor down there.  Worked out well, and handled in the water well.  This is where I found the device to really shine, and I will continue to use it there.</li>
    <li> I want to that Gillette for introducing me to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer for free through their program.  I usually use disposable Gillette razor which are fine.  However the introduction of a vibrating head has lowered the amount of time it takes me to get a great shave.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this is the trimmer. I had a trimmer that came with my hair clipper set but it stopped working after taking it got wet. With the Proglide, I was able to use it wet or dry for all my trimming needs!</li>
    <li> Styling my beard has never been easier than when using the Fusion ProGlide Styler. Making a straight line is always difficult, but the ProGlide could not have been easier. The easy to switch heads (trimmer, razor, edger) makes the level of &amp;#34;chore-dom&amp;#34; of manicuring a beard to a minimum. The razor works very well both with and against the grain. I have had no loss of power from the battery after using regularly for a month. The lubrication strip wears away before the blades dull, but the cartridge can be switched out with any fusion product. The bottom line is that the Fusion ProGlide Styler has made my mornings much easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different grooming trimmers in my years of shaving and trimming, and they all have their quirks. Whether they are rechargeable and don&#x27;t hold a charge anymore, or they aren&#x27;t waterproof to use in the shower or whatever the case may be, I&#x27;ve never been 100% impressed before. After using the  ProGlide Styler I received free from Gillette for a few weeks, I&#x27;m very happy with it! It takes a regular, easily replaceable battery, it&#x27;s waterproof, easy to clean, and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to trim my sideburns and around my man parts, and it is small enough to handle comfortably without the bulkiness of some of my past trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or nicks using it, and it trims as well as I could possibly expect, with clean lines and close trimming.&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning goes, it doesn&#x27;t get any easier. The trimming teeth flip up so you can flush out the hair from inside the unit.&lt;br /&gt;The storage stand is awesome too, it keeps it all together so it&#x27;s easy to find a guard (of razor blade attachment) without sorting through the bathroom drawers!&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer is easy to grip, easy to keep powered up, easy to use, easy to clean and easy to store!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get any easier, and it&#x27;s cheaper than any trimmer I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a program run by Gillette.  My grooming needs are minimal, having a short beard and doing no grooming below the neck, so I was skeptical if the Power Trimmer would provide any benefits over my current beard trimmer. After using the Power Trimmer for multiple beard trimmings, it is now my go-to beard styling device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the great feel of the handle. The weight was perfect and the size was not too bulky, as my other beard trimmers is.  The placement of the power button and attachment release was also superior, as no fingers were accidentally powering the Power Trimmer off or detaching the attachment, which has happened with other trimmers. Having used the trimmer five times to trim my beard, the battery is still as powerful as it was when I first turned it on.  I have a coarse beard so this battery life is good for a single AA. The angle of the Power Trimmer blade was different from the placement of my traditional beard trimmer, and that took some getting used to, but once I did, it turned out the angle was easier for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer to anyone that is in need of a compact full-feature styling tool.</li>
    <li> I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler through a free trial offer. That said, let&#x27;s get on with the review. This styler is perfect for light duty personal grooming. It won&#x27;t handle the large jobs and heavy beard growth but for edging and touch ups it is perfect. I use it to trim my beard and mustache and love how easy it is to do the detail stuff. My morning routine is simpler and faster than ever with this tool. The razor cartridge is not as easy for me to get used to. The trimmer doubles as a handle for the blades and this makes the razor longer than typical razors. Combine all this with the handy rack to store all the attachments and you have a tool that will make the morning routine much more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I Received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler for Free via a Program run by Gillette and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had several power trimmer&#x27;s over the years and this by far the best so far and great value.  I find that it is Slim, light weight has a comfort grip, and even has it&#x27;s own storage unit.  I really like the fact that it is compact and easy to store without losing the pieces. Works a lot better than other brands I have used in the past, no Nicks, razor bumps or Irration.  Great Product!!!!!</li>
    <li> written by my husband&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this trimmer from Gillette for free to test. Well, taking the razor out of the box the razor felt good holding in your hand. The handle has the perfect size. The razor is easy to operate and the trimmer parts are easy to attach, there are good slots for storage. I can recommend this shaver to everyone</li>
    <li> I received the Power Trimmer for free via a demo program from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Power Trimmer comes with three combs which provide a trim of different lengths.  I don&#x27;t have facial hair, so I used the Power Trimmer for some manscaping; it worked quite well.  It didn&#x27;t clog up like other, lesser quality trimmers that I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Power Trimmer also comes with a plastic stand that holds the trimmer and all accessories, which I really appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Power Trimmer gets the job done and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!  I received this razor free through a program run by gillette, let&#x27;s just say I feel like I don&#x27;t need to buy another razor ever again. This razor turned on with vibration, gave me one of the most closest shave I have ever gotten. I have very sensitive skin but this razor just glides through and leaves me no marks and leaves my skin feeling great. But that&#x27;s not it, the best part about this little device has to be the trimmer. This trimmer can buzz through any thick hair and I mean any. I use this as my body groomer now. What used to take me 30 mins in the shower now takes about 2 minutes. This thing is worth way more than it&#x27;s price and I am glad I decided to try it. I hope anyone looking for a trimmer and razor decides to go with this purchase you won&#x27;t be dissapointed. This is like a body groomer also, so you cannot lose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a decent trimmer that won&#x27;t fail in the shower.  I was lucky enough to be selected for a program by Gillette to try their Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler.  It&#x27;s a compact trimmer that is perfect for traveling.  Uses standard AAs for batteries. It is also designed to work in the shower.  For a thick beard you&#x27;d want to use a hefty trimmer, but for weekly maintenance, etc.  This is a great little tool.  I&#x27;ve had battery trimmers that just didn&#x27;t have enough juice to do much.  This seems to do a fine trick.  It&#x27;s very nice having the different attachments for shaving and styling.  Unlike a lot of the trimmers out there.  The price is within what I think reasonable.  Like I said, this is a great trimmer for keeping things from getting shaggy!</li>
    <li> When I received this thru a program run by Gilette, I had expectations that it would do what it said it would do.  But I can tell you that it exceeded whatever I thought it would do.  I love that it is multi-purpose.  Would recomend it to all and I will be using it in the future.</li>
    <li> Like some of the past reviews have said, this isnt a pro trimmer. I got this and decided to try my first stint at some Chest hair grooming. It took a little while to get cut, like I said not for a massive job. But when I was done I was very happy with the results. It was a nice close trim with he trimmers. The razor attachment made it even easier. Then when I got to my face, I could slip on the spacers and my goatee is at just the perfect length. VERY easy to clean. I usually have a problem with hair sticking in my trimmers, but this one was very easy to open and get it cleaned for the next use.</li>
    <li> First off, I received a free ProGlide Styler via a promotion from Gillette and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This thing does it all! It combines the high quality Fusion blades with three levels of trimming action that cover all my shaving needs. I travel all the time for work and hate having to lug around two separate razors. Now I can bring the ProGlide Styler with me for all shaving situations. I&#x27;ve used it many times so far and the battery hasn&#x27;t died. It&#x27;s also relatively quiet, which is always a good thing. The blades are sharp and I really like the shape and grip of the styler as well. The  only thing I&#x27;d change is I&#x27;d include (or sell separately) a longer attachment to use for those hard to reach places. But other than that, I have no other issues and don&#x27;t see myself changing from this any time soon.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer through a program run by Gillette and I am so glad I did. I am in the military so I have to shave on every work day, so when I get a long weekend or I take leave, I like to let my beard grow. This can make shaving hard when it comes time to go back to work so I need a good trimmer to trim my beard down before shaving. With the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-in-1 Styler I can accomplish both tasks with one tool. I got a close trim with very little effort and then I got a close shave with the razor cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a little bulky for shaving every day but it&#x27;s perfect for getting a good trim. It&#x27;s a perfect \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; tool. The combs give you a good variety so you can trim your whiskers a variety of lengths. It also works really well without the combs at all. This trimmer is really good for as little as it costs. Even if it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a more costly trimmer, I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was provided this shaver via a program Gillette ran. I initially thought that I wouldn&#x27;t use it much, but I was wrong.  The razor is powerful and quickly trims and cuts&lt;br /&gt;through hair without pulling.  It rinses out with water and stores well.  I like the variety of trimmer heads.  I have had to hide it from my 27 year old since he likes it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product with many uses.</li>
    <li> I received  a Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler as part of a program run by Gillette&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a loyal  customer of Gillette and have always enjoyed your products but now after trying for weeks the Gillete  Styler is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it leaves my skin very soft after shaving ,the 3-in1 Styler is such an easy tool to use . Love it is sleek and slim design, the package is very nice and easy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best system I have ever used , I like the fact I can get all my shaving needs and trimming done with one device.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend to all my friends and co-workers,  For the retail cost of the product I would say it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I received the razor and trimmer via a program run by Gillette. Overall I was disappointed with the product. While the shave experience was good, the handle with the attachment felt awkward to hold and use during the shaving. The razor provides a clean and close shave, and is easy to clean. However, the vibrating feature doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any benefit. The trimmer is ok, but underpowered for any medium or greater trimming. Overall, I would buy the razor but I think I would pass on the trimmer function.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor trimmer by Gillette and was not very impressed by the performance of the product. It was very hard to clean, I had to shave twice to get the shave I wanted and the trimmer did not cut as I thought it would I only gave the trimmer razor three out of five stars</li>
    <li> I received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler (a program run by Gillette) a couple of weeks ago and let me tell you it has been one of the best tools to have.  The Styler Power Trimmer feels solid and well built, comfortable to hold and easy to use. I like to keep my beard short and neat, the Fusion ProGlide Styler is the perfect tool for that. The handle grips are great; the trimmer doesn&#x27;t slip while shaving and it is easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer comes with four heads. Three of the heads are for trimming different lengths of facial hair, while the four head is a razor for shaving. I can easily switch from trimmer to razor in a snap for a closer shave. The best part about this trimmer is, its waterproof, which makes shaving/trimming a snap in the shower.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE how close the shave is with the blade attachment! It vibrates and has several blades to give you a really close shave. The razor blade attachment is appropriate for males or females, too. If you&#x27;re a guy who likes to \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; {keep a goatee or shape your beard around your jawline} this is a good tool to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love: It gives a close shave. It has attachments. It&#x27;s WATERPROOF! (you can shave in the shower). It&#x27;s not too clunky/heavy (great for travel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received this as part of a promotional campaign. I&#x27;d definitely buy this and/or buy one for a Christmas gift for someone~it&#x27;s useful.</li>
    <li> This Gillette Styler is really good but the only thing that i don&#x27;t like is that u need battery every 30 mins of use it gets slow after and needs an AA battery but while it last its VERY VERY GOOD</li>
    <li> I was really surprised with the power this little styler has. I figured for a battery operated trimmer it wouldn&#x27;t have lasting power and would suck up batteries but it worked really well. It&#x27;s perfect for hair trims between salon visits as well. I love all the attachments and it&#x27;s great to carry with you or set out at home. Great Great purchase for any man in your life.&lt;br /&gt;I received this Fusion Proglide Styler free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> This is a great combination pack, especially for guys with moustaches like me. The trimmer does a great job on my moustache and the razor provides me with a smooth shave on my sensitive skin. My only criticism is the cost of the replacement blades. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
    <li> For a while I had been thinking about picking up one of these, I was able to get one for free through a program run by Gilette and i truely thank them for it! I have some tattoos on my arms/ legs and want them to be visable through the hair on my arms/ legs, and not have to fully shave them.  Plus my wife said I looked like a wooly mammoth so hey, have to make her happy too right?  I got the razor and it comes with multiple attachments for differnt types of grooming.  Generally i use the attachment for longer trims and use it on my arms.  Sometimes when i need to shave, but dont want the baby face, i skip the attachments and use just the blade and get that scruffy look without looking too overgrown.&lt;br /&gt;  Lets be realistic though, this thing is battery run, its not going to give you a hair cut, its not going to take down a full ZZ top beard in a single battery, but for basic maintenance this thing rocks! especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other razors in the past even electric razors. Those razors could barely cut through my coarse hair. When I tried this electric fusion razor with the trimming guards it was a very clean shave and trim. Very organized looking. My wife loved the results a lot!  I especially like the razor attachment that when u turn on the razor it gets a closer smoother shave with less irritation. You only have 5 stars but I would rate it 100!</li>
    <li> Full disclaimer: I&#x27;m a hairy guy. I saw the ads and after receiving a ProGlide Styler via a Gillette promo, I was hopeful that it would help me rein in my mane. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t live up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;It feels solid, not overly bulky, and I never lost my grip when using the trimmer. It edges well, helping to keep sideburns even and a beard line straight. The heads swap out easily enough and it was relatively easily to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;The holder is a little weak. It comes across as flimsy and I find myself holding the holder to take out different guards and the trimmer itself; otherwise, it falls over when I attempt to quickly grab it. The battery also wears down when handling long trimming jobs. When attempting to shave, it was cumbersome; the complete opposite of when using it as a trimmer. I felt as though the handle and length of ProGlide Styler kept me from holding my face&#x27;s contours as well as my regular razor. The shave wasn&#x27;t as close and I actually ended up nicking myself on more than one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:&lt;br /&gt;It does a poor, poor job of handling longer hair. If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer to handle long beards, curly chest hair, or buzz longer hair, think again. This is not the product for you. Because of the small head on the trimmer, I found this tool to be very inefficient, requiring me to go over the same area multiple times in order to actually trim hair. It did not matter if the hair was dry or wet; same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product only if you need a trimmer for precision, i.e., a goatee, beard line, sideburns, etc. If you&#x27;re looking for anything more, or a total body trimmer, keep looking.</li>
    <li> After using the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power blade, it was recently sent to me by Gillette to try out, I have to say that I am quite impressed with the new design they have come out with. I have used Gillette razors for quite a few years, and I have tried just about every new model that comes out, I have always been quite impressed that they can make shaving easier and seem like less of a chore. Gillette has been the only razor I trust, the power cartage has thinner blades and the lubrication strips make for a smoother and irritation-free shave, and with my sensitive skin that is a must. The newer cartridges do a much better job at keeping the hair flowing through and out, and they don&#x27;t clogged up like the older models tend to do. I shave fairly quickly, so this is a definite bonus, I lead a very busy lifestyle so it&#x27;s nice to have a razor that can keep up with me. The trimming blade is a nice addition for shaving in those smaller spots that can be tricky to reach.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am quite pleased with the advances made, Gillette once again has a better razor that has made my shaving experience better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a number of different trimmers over the years. Most do the job. I received this trimmer free from Gillette as part of a trial program and it blows them all away. It gives a nice, close trim. And the RAZOR - amazing!! It&#x27;s the closest, cleanest shave. I have a number of different Gillette razors and will not be refilling them. I&#x27;ll replace them with this one. The refills are a little more expensive, but well worth it!! I also just found this exact product in a retail store on sale for more than double the price at Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for styling your facial hair. I use it to trim my beard, mustache, and clean up my sideburns. By no means should it be used trim or cut your actual head hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest buying it if you want to make shaving and cleaning up more of a convenience.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor in the mail from a program run by Gillette. This product is awesome and easy to use. I love how it takes a battery instead of having to charge like other trimmers I own. The razor shaves and trims everything with ease. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love using this 3-in-1 styler / razor. It has all the features of a beard and mustache trimmer, as well as a high quality razor, and it uses the same blades as my Gillette Fusion razor.</li>
    <li> this has to be one of the best razors&lt;br /&gt;i have ever tried so far and best of all&lt;br /&gt;it was provided free via a program by gillette!&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much for giving me the best shave ever!&lt;br /&gt;and not one nick or scratch! 5 stars indeed!</li>
    <li> I received an offer from Gillette to try out there 3-In-1 Styler and I was quite surprised at what an innovative product this was. I&#x27;ve always loved the Gillette razors but the fusion razor is awesome! It&#x27;s probably the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. My skin felt so smooth after using the Fusion razor.  The styler worked great on trimming my sideburns and goatee.  I felt that it was too small to actually trim chest hair and would probably never use it for that purpose.  I also loved the stand that it comes in. It&#x27;s not too bulky and fit nicely in my medicine cabinet.  The only complaint that I would have is that the handle was bigger than what most razor handles are so it seemed a bit awkward to use at first but I got used to it. All in all, I loved this product and plan to continue using it and telling my friends about it.</li>
    <li> Gillette actually sent me this to try for free and test out. I thought it was pretty awesome. I love the fact that it has three different attachments depending on where you&#x27;re trimming or how close you want. I found that it was easier in some places to trim with scissors first... but if the hair is short enough this buzz trimmer thing works great. And then a close shave. The blades are amazing. This product is definitely worth it. I love it.</li>
    <li> I got this product through a provided via a program run by Gillette and was excited to try it as I have had some good and some not so good trimming products. The trimmer worked very well when I needed to just shape up my beard when it was short, and was good on the cheek and neck, which is where I trim most often. But, when I tried to trim my whole beard a bit shorter (it was decently thick after about 3 weeks of no trim), it had some trouble going through it. It worked, but was slow and inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked it for some trimming, but I need another one for when my beard gets thicker.</li>
    <li> Great Razor set for the money -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle looks large but is comfortable, even for someone like me who is used to using regular / smaller handled razors. The 3 in 1 does an excellent job of maintaining, but I would not reach for this if I was going for a new look / style.  Only con is the lack of directions for switching heads/attachment.  Took me a bit to figure that part out...</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler via a program run by Gillette.  I&#x27;m always looking for a better razor so I was looking forward to trying this - even better, it&#x27;s a 3-in-1 that you can trim, shave, and edge with.  I&#x27;m in the Army and so keeping my neck and face clean shaven is very important.  I always have my wife shave the back of my neck and she always worried about \\&quot;ruining\\&quot; something.  But she said she was really comfortable with this.  I, obviously, used the shaving attachment myself and it worked great.  Smooth shave, no nicks or razor burn!</li>
    <li> This worked fantastic, and has even replaced my normal razor. I have generally only used the razor portion, but when needed the trimmer part has worked great too. The whole stand-up system with additional blades in the back of the stand is handy and can sit right on the counter for ease of use. I&#x27;ll continue to use &amp; buy replacement heads for this razor. This product was provided for free by a program run by Gilette.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette styler for free from a promotion. first the trimmer. I give the trimmer 3 out of 5 stars. I typically wear a full beard. I use the trimmer to trim my beard but the trimmer did not do a very effective job and I had to go over the same spot several times.but when using the trimmer on the back of my neck my wife said it did a nice job and she liked the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now on to the razor. This was my first experience with a power razor and I was extremely impressed. I used it to shave my neck and face above my beard and it was the most comfortable shave ever. But the best part of the RAZoR is the single edge blade which makes getting the fine lines in my beard easy.</li>
    <li> When this arrived in the mail, I immediate threw out my aging rechargeable trimmer thinking this was the replacement. I was wrong. I like the grip and the ease of getting the guards on and off, but I just didn&#x27;t care for the quality of the cut. With the guards off, the trim does get as close as you would want it (but that a general disadvantage to straight blade electric trimmers). Then, you throw on the razor head, and it stops making sense completely. I tried the other vibrating razor from Gillette, and I just don&#x27;t get the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not trying to be a hater. I wanted to like this. But I&#x27;m going to go out and buy a rechargeable replacement that I can use for another couple years.</li>
    <li> I received this from Gillette through a special trial program.  The trimmer works pretty good, I was pleased with it.  The razor, not too pleased with it.  It did okay on my first shave, but when I tried to shave with it a second time, I just ended up with lots of nicks and cuts.  Glad I didn&#x27;t shell out any money for this.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free trial from Gillette.  I was skeptical at first, but I must say I was impressed.  I shave at least four times a week and I shave my head, face, as well as personal grooming.  This razor is all you need to keep yourself groomed and looking good.  I used the one razor that came with the trial and it lasted for pretty much a month before it started to dull.  So whether you shave just your face or anything else this razor is definately something I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was given this Styler through a promotion from Gillette.  I was hesitant to buy it buy it as I know Gillette razor refills can seem expensive.  It was free this time, so I thought I would do my best to give it a fair shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it out of the packaging and was surprised by how compact it was to store in with the 3 different trimming combs and the attachable cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave took place and left my skin smooth and with no irritation.  I was able to shave up and down on my neck or cheeks with no issue.  I was able to use the trimming blade to straighten my shave and leave it clean looking with straight lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous about using the trimmer as I have had a beard for 8 years and love the length my &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; trimmer leaves it.  So, I started with the 3-guard (the longest guard) and found that it was too long.  I then trimmed with the 2 guard and it trimmed my beard about perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest part of this is the size and convenience.  I just traveled to Jamaica and it was easy to throw in my toiletry back, while taking up little space.  While in Jamaica as was able to stay clean shaven with a nicely groomed beard.  This was perfect as I was there with my wife for our 10-year anniversary vacation.</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;ll start with that I got this product free through a Gillette program. Second it&#x27;s a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial Impression:&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this little guy I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I&#x27;ve used everything from straight razors, safety razors, cordless, battery powered. You name it I&#x27;ve tried it. I&#x27;ve gone from clean shaven to bearded and back and overall I&#x27;ve been impressed with this Gillette Styler. Is it going to duplicate a full corded clipper set? No it won&#x27;t, but if you&#x27;re mainly doing some simple trimming it works great. Plus the size makes it great for traveling when I don&#x27;t want to worry about the batteries dying on a regular cordless razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice and Small&lt;br /&gt;3 different length options&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have enough power for truly thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little styler that can replace a full clipper if you don&#x27;t let it grow to long.&lt;br /&gt;9/10</li>
    <li> This shaver is badass! I&#x27;ve had a beard for a couple of decades now so I know my shavers...and have used MANY over the years. The problem I always ran into was that electric shavers would always miss two particular hairs when I was trying to create clean, crisp lines. This shaver...has finally achieved that goal! It also has a couple of attachments for consistent length, and a normal straight razor. The straight razor...I do not use...I never have, but it is totally worth the price regardless! Get it!</li>
    <li> I received this free sample razor from Gillette and oh man was i excited when i tried it out! I&#x27;m a dude with short hair and a long beard and haven&#x27;t been able to find something that can trim by beard so well. 0 tug, 0 slip ups , and 100% effective! I used this thing to shave my head.... yes my head! My ladiea never been so excited how well groomed I am with this bad boy! Highly Highly suggest this bad boy!</li>
    <li> This is a nice set for travel or to toss in your gym bag.  I prefer a more substantial trimmer for at home use but this is great for on the go and does a pretty good job.  Received this as a Gillette promo and was really happy to try it out.  I like it, simple and effective</li>
    <li> Well balanced smooth styling.The trimmer works nicely,but not so great if your mustache is a little wet.The blade is awesome doesn&#x27;t irritate.Very easy too use.I will continue using this product.I love it..</li>
    <li> Received this trimmer as a free promotional item from Gillette.  Although free I would pay the price. I would recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3 in one styler to men with or without facial hair. I was impressed&lt;br /&gt;how well the trimmer groomed my mustache and sideburns. This razor is battery powered and the larger handle took&lt;br /&gt;some time to get used to.  Handy to carry for those quick touch ups before your business meeting or meeting with clients.  Overall very nice trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Styler since I got it free as a part of a program run by Gillette and I love it. It has now replaced my usual electric razor/trimmer. My old trimmer used to tug and pull and it was a drag to use. The Styler is so smooth and easier to use. I use it every morning as part of my shower routine. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer and razor is a na awsome combo I use this more than any thing else smooth shave and nice trim.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler from Gillette for free to try out and review.  I really like the small compact but yet powerful design.  The exchangeable combs are a great length for beard trimming and shaping.  The combs are smooth without sharp edges so it doesn&#x27;t scratch your face like other beard trimmers i have owned.  The performance compares to my more expensive trimmer but i wish that it was rechargeable rather then a single use AA battery. For the price it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Well for starters I received this via a free program run by Gillette.I really wasn&#x27;t to amazed on how the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler worked on my face. I didn&#x27;t feel it trim as low as I&#x27;d like. I did indeed like the way it worked on my chest area. Another thing I disliked about it was that it wasn&#x27;t as powerful as other battery operated trimmers I have tried or used in the past. Being that everything is stored together( trimmer/clips), it does make it easier and convenient as a man&#x27;s travel tool.</li>
    <li> I heard about the Gillette Fusion Proglide not too long ago and was invited to try the product by receiving a free razor provided by a program run by Gillette.  At first glance, the packaging is great. It has an awesome little encasement inside that makes it easy to store away the buzzer and its accessories.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use another buzzer in the home when I&#x27;m too lazy to completely shave my beard. This groomer has replaced that buzzer. I like to have a little bit of stubble on my face instead of being completely smooth. Using the buzzer is a breeze. It&#x27;s easy, its ergonomic, and it&#x27;s very easy to manipulate to get straight lines when grooming your beard.&lt;br /&gt;When in use for a little over 2-3 minutes, the buzzer starts to warm up a little bit. This must be because of the small compact size and the constant motion of the blade on top.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are a cool feature but when I tried to shave with it, it felt weird. This may be because I&#x27;m used to using an electric razor but the attachment is a welcome addition. I like the option to not completely buzz the beard to small stubble by adding a comb to it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for $20 this buzzer is unmatched. It&#x27;s cheap, durable, and does what it claims. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a cheap groomer for on the go.</li>
    <li> I received a free razor through a Gillette Promotion.  First thanks Gillette, second a short review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this is a battery operated unit, so don&#x27;t expect to cut your grass with it.  I used the 3 in 1 to shave and got a comfortable Gillette shave (as expected).  I trimmed my mustache, and did a little triming, and got very good results using the easy to change trimmer blades.  I also trimmed using the built in trimmer with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY down side to this product might be the battery life.  It doesn&#x27;t last that long without replacement.  For the suggested retail price, I would recomend this product.</li>
    <li> (I am writing this review under my wife&#x27;s account-didn&#x27;t want confusion!) I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler by Gillette and like all the attachments that came with it. The styler worked great as a trimmer- noting I should be very careful when man-scaping. It does a great job and does not \\&quot;pull\\&quot; my hairs. Works well on my mustache, goatee and sideburns. It is easy to use and clean up is a breeze. I would recommend the ProGlide Styler-  not just for men- my wife uses it too!</li>
    <li> I have had some type of facial hair for over twenty years - beards, goatees, and even a short stint with a mustache (yet, too long from what my family tells me).  In that time I have had multiple beard trimmers and groomers to keep me looking my best.  I was lucky enough to get a free trimmer from Gillette and I have to say that I was really surprised at how much I liked the Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot to like.  The handle feels solid.  It has a great nonslip grip and it is the size is perfect.  Not too big, but not to small so that it takes too long to trim the beard.  I have always had trouble trimming the area between my upper lip and my nose.  Most beard trimmers and guards were bulky and wouldnt trim the hairs below the nose.  This groomer worked perfectly.  It&#x27;s also really easy to clean.  There are no minuscule screws to worry about.  It flips open and snaps shut.  But the best part is that I can use it in the shower - no more hairs flying all over the bathroom counter and floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to think of something that I didn&#x27;t like or that I would change in the product with no luck.  For the price, I think it is a steal.  I would absolutely buy another one of these trimmers should this one stop working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d had my eye on this product for a while and was thrilled to be selected by Gillette to receive it for free and to review it. First, I&#x27;ve always been an electric razor guy. I have light hair and sparse facial hair so an electric razor has always been easiest for me. As I&#x27;ve gotten older it has been tougher to keep up with the stubble. I figured it was worth trying the Fusion Proglide to see if it worked any better. Plus, the styler for a little manscaping was a necessary tool for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has been great, I have been really impressed. Is it more work than electric, sure it is. But my face is smoother and the vibration has cut down on razor burn which has always been a big problem for me. The shave is so close that I can very easily go two days between shaves. If it&#x27;s really necessary, I will just use the electric on the in-between days. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I tried it and will continue to use the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styler tool has also worked better than any alternatives. First, I can get at those hairs that grow on the outside of the ear. One buzz once and week and no more stragglers. Throw on the guards and I take care of those unwanted hairs in unmentionable places. It&#x27;s much easier, and must less nerve-wracking than scissors. And let&#x27;s just say the work was noticed and appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the product and would recommend highly.</li>
</ol>
