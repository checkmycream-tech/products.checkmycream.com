<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A doctor prescribed this along with some other medication when i experienced itching and burning.  There was a little burning when i first used it, i think it was normal due to the infection i already had. This helped stop the itching immediately. i was relieved and felt much better. I use this daily and don&#x27;t have any problems with itching and burning anymore. It really is a great product.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a specific product I had purchased in Europe and although this is a different name, it appears to have the same active ingredients in it. I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent feminine wash. Not sure why we don&#x27;t have it in the US. We have other Eucerin products like lotions. But not this feminine wash. I found it on a trip to Spain and had to buy feminine wash because I forgot to bring some. Loved it since and regretted not buying more than one I purchased out of necessity. This product is far more superior than other feminine washes in this country. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. The company that sells it is excellent. Delivery was fast and efficient. No problems. I was so happy. The previous company I dealt with here on amazon had me wait for over a month and it did not arrive. What&#x27;s worse the were not responsive&lt;br /&gt;about my refund. This new company which I am thankful I found is the opposite. They are responsive, fast and efficient! Very pleased! I think this is the only company that sells this product in the US.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it protects me and it is way better that using soap, it is really gentle and you feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I started using this in Colombia. I wouldn&#x27;t trade this for any other feminine wash on the US market. Very pleasant light smell and gentle.</li>
    <li> Seems to clean well, I have no irritation and no dryness.  Has a scent to it, wish it was unscented.  But so far so good.</li>
    <li> The thing with this produst is i dont know if it was doing its job because after using it i dont feel clean and not to mention the heavy perfume smell it has that is too strong for me i feel like its not worth the price its just regular perfumed soap water 😔.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It seems expensive but, it ships from Europe (Spain) I don&#x27;t know  why it isn&#x27;t in the U.S. and you don&#x27;t pay shipping  and I got it in a few days.  I tried a couple other feminine products and they were lousy by comparison.  You only need a small amount on a sponge or wash cloth so it last a while.  It has a soft lovely scent and is a very gentle product</li>
    <li> My woman had no complaints so I guess it works. No odors no dryness, everything is pretty balanced. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I am the type of person that uses special soaps, creams and shampoos for my body. I have used Eucerin Intimate Hygiene Wash for years and it is very gentle, and clean well the intimate areas.&lt;br /&gt;I love this products, it smells good as well.</li>
    <li> I have never seen this product on the shelves of the supermarket or drug store. Excellent Product.  Leaves you feeling and smelling clean and fresh all day. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with purchase. Wish it was offer here in the states. I feel very clean and refreshed. You only need a very small amount, and you get a lot of lather. There is no overpowering perfume scent. Feel clean down there!</li>
    <li> this is my sisters favorite fem wash she told me about it i love it.... so far its only avail online ... i havent found it around me in houston</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had to use this kind  product before, but after 3 recurrent bouts of yeast, bacterial, and bladder infections at the same time, I figured there had to be some type of imbalance and thus began my search for relief. Of all the products on the market, I chose this one because I use eucerin to keep my eczema under control. With eucerin my skin is rarely broken out and I barely have to use my Rx cream. Anyway, the fem wash is very gentle and so far, I think my balance has been restored. I was a little nervous about the fragrance it contains as eucerin is mostly fragrance free. However, I haven&#x27;t had any problems and I use it daily. I will be ordering this product again</li>
    <li> It took away itchiness for me if I had any and it seems to do a good job, careful though if you use more than once in a while it can really irritate your skin (or at least it did with me). I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re suppose to use it all of the time.</li>
    <li> Love the smell on my skin, it is so soft and leaves your skin feeling fresh and smooth. Would recommend it</li>
    <li> Love it.  Gentle and causes no irritation on my vwry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> is an excellent product, I am very happy with this item, my wife is very happy because it&#x27;s very nice</li>
    <li> Everything was on time and perfect</li>
    <li> nothing special, just like normal soap. too expensive for the soap. no english translation of ingredients.You can buy it, if you have extra money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not  like regular soap or like any other feminine hygeine product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many. Does not cause and helps relieve irritation. It&#x27;s silky. I Love the scent and so does my husband. I was surprised by the strength of the scent and a little concerned because I&#x27;m sensitive to most scents but this does not bother me. I&#x27;m glad that it doesn&#x27;t because I love the scent and this product. Wish it was sold in US. Very happy its available on Amazon. Do wish the price was lower.</li>
    <li> I use Eucerin as a lotion. My skin, as well as my lady parts are  very sensitive and it works well for me. I was surprised to find that they had a intimate wash also. It is not made in US. It works really well. I am looking to purchase more in the near future. It has a light pleasant scent and does not cause any irritation. I just love it.</li>
