      <li>enjoyed both of these lotions/solutions!</li>
      <li>It has a citrus-y scent that just smells better than the creams that I’ve used before!</li>
      <li>The scent of this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>I revceived this product complementary in return for my honest and unbaised opinion.</li>
      <li>However, the thing I REALLY liked about this product is the scent and the way my skin feels.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
      <li>All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>They just kind of blend into the skin</li>
      <li>Effective for stretch marks and bruises</li>

      <li>The packaging is cute, and the bottle makes it really easy to use and apply…just squeeze out, and rub into your skin!</li>
      <li>I was able to review 180 Cosmetics Stretch Mark Cream.</li>
      <li>The strech marks are still there, but to me it sees to look a bit better, even it&#x27;s not a mirackle worker and won&#x27;t make the strech marks dissapear in some number of weeks</li>
      <li>I don’t know if an exposed area would be better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even safe to use before, during and after pregnancy and everywhere in between.</li>
      <li>and I’ve lost and gained more weight than I care to remember.  </li>
      <li>It is very creamy and smells great.</li>
      <li>great product this really has helped me reduce those stubborn stretch marks on my stomach</li>

      <li>for most people, having them fade even some is a huge ego boost.</li>
      <li>and this must be true, because Dr. Oz said so!</li>
      <li>This might work best for less severe stretch marks.</li>
      <li>If you are pregnant, the manufacturer discloses that this is safe during pregnancy as well, as to avoid the stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>and I liked the large bottles they came</li>
      <li>Rubbing in circular motion is a huge part of regaining elasticity in your skin.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I used it a bit at a time because it wasn’t available here in the States, and OMG, did it do wonders.</li>
      <li>I think you’ll really enjoy this product.  </li>
      <li>I received this product for free for an unbiased review.</li>
      <li>Smelled really good and made my skin soft, but did not erase any stretch marks at all or made them any lighter in color.</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>I received the 180 Cosmetics Stretchmark Solution product and was excited to try it out.</li>
      <li>and i see a significant difference.</li>
      <li>It really keeps your skin smooth and moisturized better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>i gained weight fast and sat most of the day.</li>
      <li>and the marks reduced tremendously.</li>
      <li>Luckily the cream itself was not damaged but keep that in mind if you order this - I would almost recommend having it shipped</li>
      <li>, I’ve been pregnant, I’ve nursed a baby</li>
      <li>My first thought when I smelled the lotion was lemons, it’s light and dissipates quickly</li>
      <li>light citrus scent, which is pretty importain to me.</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on nicely and the stretch marks begin to fade after a short window of use.  </li>
      <li>I applied it in circular motion until it is fully absorbed.</li>
      <li>After my pregnancy I ended up with so many strech merks...on my stomach, my lower back and my thigts...</li>
      <li>While I may not have noticed immediate results at first, I have started to notice some improvements after a month of use.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how else to say it, I used it on my arms first to see if it works</li>
      <li>The tube is very soft and you can squeeze with just two fingers and get the right amount.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much, but my fianc&amp;eacute; said he noticed a bit of difference.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for two weeks straight</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and it does not take long to spread the lotion on the skin.</li>
      <li>this lotion didn&#x27;t eliminate them, but a significant improvement is definitely there.</li>
      <li>I prefer to apply after I get out of the bath when my skin is clean and pores are open.  </li>
      <li>I think the difference is mainly in the coloring.</li>
      <li>Doesn’t do much for the old confidence, I can tell you that much…)</li>
      <li>I got this AMAZING cream from a friend in Europe when I went to a gymnastics meet a few months back</li>
      <li>I gave this product 3 stars on Amazon, because of the creamy consistency, and light-scent, and I have used many 180 Cosmetics in the past, and have always had 5 star</li>
      <li>Yeah, I thought it was pretty obvious.  </li>
      <li>I am a sucker when it comes to lotion, I just love the stuff.</li>
      <li>, I do think this cream actually works, it does help your skin to get more firm and elastic...</li>
      <li>product seems to have some good ingredients in it, but I am hesitant to recomend it to anyone based off of the amount of fake reviews.</li>
      <li>i was still pregnant when i started using this product, but today my husband told me the stretch marks are a whole lot less red.</li>
      <li>The cream is thick and vasiline like, does not have any offensive oddor like some other ones that I&#x27;ve tried before, on the contarary it smells good:</li>
      <li>To be fair, I had a friend use it on her stretch-marks, for the past few weeks, she too, did not have any results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The formula&#x27;s unique combination of active ingredients not only repairs existing stretched tissues, but also prevents the formation of new stretch</li>
      <li>Stretch marks are always a major confidence killer</li>
      <li>and I have not seen any major difference yet</li>
      <li>I must say my belly feel so soft, but I do not see and different yet.</li>
      <li>and i barely notice them anymore in the mirror.</li>
      <li>They are a little less purple and more skin toned, just shinier.</li>
      <li>It repairs existing stretched tissues and also prevents new stretch</li>
      <li>lotion is rather thick, but I don’t find it greasy and it soaks in rather quickly.  </li>

<li> This is a thick white creamy gel texture lotion to help restore, repairs, and reduce the appearance of stretch marks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Recently I received two lotions to try and review from 180 Cosmetics. Two different kinds of lotions: 180 Cosmetics Body Shaping Solution and 180 Cosmetics Stretch Mark Solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed both of these lotions/solutions! I am a sucker when it comes to lotion, I just love the stuff. Both of these solutions were great and I liked the large bottles they came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body Shaping Solution was made to tighten and strengthen skin tissues. It also hydrates and detoxifies the skin.The Stretch Mark Solution is clinically proven to repair and firm skin tissues. It repairs existing stretched tissues and also prevents new stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This solution was especially nice for me to try postpartum!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and took a desk job a few years ago... i gained weight fast and sat most of the day. I have some stretch marks and am trying hard to find a product to help me out. Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to have some good ingredients in it, but I am hesitant to recomend it to anyone based off of the amount of fake reviews. Click on any one of the profiles of the 5 star reviewers and it becomes very obvious that they have some sort of relationship with the company as paid reviewers or employees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to eventually find a stretch mark cream that works for me and isn&#x27;t pushed to the market unethically. This wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I have been using 180 cosmetics Stretch Mark Solution for 2 weeks now. I must say my belly feel so soft, but I do not see and different yet. When I do use the Stretch Mark Solution  on my skin a few minters later it make your skin really itchy and I don&#x27;t like that at all. It is very creamy and smells great. I will keep use to see what will happen next.</li>
    <li> This one-of-a-kind formula is clinically proven to dramatically increase skin elasticity, repair and firm skin tissues, and boost tensile strength at the deepest levels. In addition, it accelerates collagen production and activates the skin&#x27;s self-repairing process. After my pregnancy I ended up with so many strech merks...on my stomach, my lower back and my thigts... well... I have been using 180 Cosmetics Body Shaping Solution day and night for the past few weeks. While I may not have noticed immediate results at first, I have started to notice some improvements after a month of use. My skin is starting to feel tighter and there is a little less sagging associated with my problem areas. The strech marks are still there, but to me it sees to look a bit better, even it&#x27;s not a mirackle worker and won&#x27;t make the strech marks dissapear in some number of weeks, I do think this cream actually works, it does help your skin to get more firm and elastic...hopefully over the time it will make those annoying strech maks to go away... The cream is thick and vasiline like, does not have any offensive oddor like some other ones that I&#x27;ve tried before, on the contarary it smells good: light citrus scent, which is pretty importain to me. I revceived this product complementary in return for my honest and unbaised opinion.</li>
    <li> Effective for stretch marks and bruises</li>
    <li> I have white stretch marks on both of my thighs. I’ve had them for the longest I can remember.  And I hate them, then again who likes stretch marks. The team at 180 Cosmetic sent me their Stretch Mark Solution for review.  I was skeptical about this product because a lot of products have big claims. I understand the effectiveness of the products varies from person to person but here is my experience on 180 Cosmetic Stretch Mark Solution.  This is a thick white creamy gel texture lotion to help restore, repairs, and reduce the appearance of stretch marks. The scent of this product is amazing. The tube is very soft and you can squeeze with just two fingers and get the right amount. There are no parabens, GMO, tricolsan, phthalates, color or dyes. I applied it in circular motion until it is fully absorbed. I applied it once daily and I notice the stretch marks had become lighter, then I started applying it twice daily and the marks reduced tremendously. However, when I skipped a day or two the marks would come back. I have only used it on one thigh to compare it to the other and see the difference and I do see the difference.  The lotion does have a sticky residue, I feel like my PJs stick to my thigh. I don’t know if an exposed area would be better.  I received this product for free for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I used this twice a day for a month and not change.</li>
    <li> So far so good but it has only been a few days so I can&#x27;t give a good review yet. Did get my package earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> OMG, I can’t believe I just found this on Amazon! Just ordered two tubes. I got this AMAZING cream from a friend in Europe when I went to a gymnastics meet a few months back (I’m a gymnast – imagine wearing a leotard knowing everyone in the arena can see the red stretch marks on your hips, behind your knees and on your arms!! Doesn’t do much for the old confidence, I can tell you that much…) Anyway, I used it a bit at a time because it wasn’t available here in the States, and OMG, did it do wonders. My stretchmarks are WAY less visible, both in that they’re not red or shiny anymore. They just kind of blend into the skin and i barely notice them anymore in the mirror. Which means other people can’t see them, thank God! Anyway, if you have stretch marks, I seriously recommend this wonder cream. Everyone should know about it!</li>
    <li> Had no effect for me after two daily applications over the last two months.</li>
    <li> I received the 180 Cosmetics Stretchmark Solution product and was excited to try it out. I used it once daily on the marks on my belly, thighs and boobs. After 30 days, I think there is minimal improvement. I didn&#x27;t really notice much, but my fianc&amp;eacute; said he noticed a bit of difference. I think the difference is mainly in the coloring. They are a little less purple and more skin toned, just shinier. However, the thing I REALLY liked about this product is the scent and the way my skin feels. It really keeps your skin smooth and moisturized better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried. Similar feeling to the after effects of coconut oil.</li>
    <li> great product this really has helped me reduce those stubborn stretch marks on my stomach</li>
    <li> Smelled really good and made my skin soft, but did not erase any stretch marks at all or made them any lighter in color. Definitely did not work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks straight and I have not seen any major difference yet but it&#x27;s very moisturizing. And I feel that this could work if I continue to use it everyday. This would probably last me a month or two with persistent use. It&#x27;s easy to apply and it does not take long to spread the lotion on the skin. This might work best for less severe stretch marks. I would recommend this product to future mommies.</li>
    <li> Stretch marks are always a major confidence killer no matter where you have them or how you got them. Of course you always see creams that claim to work and will help eliminate them. I was able to review 180 Cosmetics Stretch Mark Cream. It definitely works! I don&#x27;t know how else to say it, I used it on my arms first to see if it works and it did. It helped diminish the color of them and make them appear reduced. They are still there alittle but not as noticeable as they once were.&lt;br /&gt;And for most people, having them fade even some is a huge ego boost. With today&#x27;s society, we don&#x27;t need anymore negativity then we already see and why should our stretch marks be any different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was slightly disappointed with the way amazon shipped the product to be as I had ordered a few other products and they were heavier containers and when I got it, the box was all squashed, damaged, when I opened the box lid part of the top holding the bottle inside was broke in half. Luckily the cream itself was not damaged but keep that in mind if you order this - I would almost recommend having it shipped separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a full size tube for a great price. I didn&#x27;t notice a smell which is good for people who need things to be fragrance free. It&#x27;s even safe to use before, during and after pregnancy and everywhere in between.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try out 180 Cosmetics Stretch Mark Solution…I was excited! I’ll do anything to reduce the appearance of these stretch marks that run rampant all over my body!&lt;br /&gt;The company states that this one-of-a-kind formula is clinically proven to dramatically increase skin elasticity, repair and firm skin tissues, and boost tensile strength at the deepest levels. The formula&#x27;s unique combination of active ingredients not only repairs existing stretched tissues, but also prevents the formation of new stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it…mostly just because it smells really nice! It has a citrus-y scent that just smells better than the creams that I’ve used before! The packaging is cute, and the bottle makes it really easy to use and apply…just squeeze out, and rub into your skin! As with all stretch mark solutions that I’ve found, the directions state to rub a small layer into your skin using circular motions. THIS IS CRITICAL! Rubbing in circular motion is a huge part of regaining elasticity in your skin. It helps reduce the appearance of cellulite, stretch marks, and helps tighten up your skin….lol and this must be true, because Dr. Oz said so! ;)</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 stars on Amazon, because of the creamy consistency, and light-scent, and I have used many 180 Cosmetics in the past, and have always had 5 star results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with the stretch mark cream, I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference in my skin. To be fair, I had a friend use it on her stretch-marks, for the past few weeks, she too, did not have any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s a bad batch, our skin, or the product. Not sure, but I will continue to use the rest of the bottle, but probably on my feet as a cream, not as a stretch mark cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a savings price, or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. Yours may differ from mine.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;it do not work ;(</li>
    <li> Let’s just start with the obvious.  I’m female, I’ve been pregnant, I’ve nursed a baby and I’ve lost and gained more weight than I care to remember.  So now I ask you, do I have stretch marks?  Is the Pope Catholic?  Yeah, I thought it was pretty obvious.  Needless to say, the stretch marks are there, and until I found 180 Cosmetics Stretch Mark Removing Solution, I thought 61lC9IIksKL__SX522_they’d be there forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is rather thick, but I don’t find it greasy and it soaks in rather quickly.  My first thought when I smelled the lotion was lemons, it’s light and dissipates quickly so if you’re bothered by fragrance, this shouldn’t be an issue.  The lotion goes on nicely and the stretch marks begin to fade after a short window of use.  If you are pregnant, the manufacturer discloses that this is safe during pregnancy as well, as to avoid the stretch marks.  I just wish this was on the market when I had my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can apply it once or twice daily, depending on your schedule.  I prefer to apply after I get out of the bath when my skin is clean and pores are open.  I think you’ll really enjoy this product.  Please let me know your thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product in exchange for an honest review.  All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#StretchMarkRemover180Cosmetics</li>
    <li> i thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl despite the price. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months and i see a significant difference. i was still pregnant when i started using this product, but today my husband told me the stretch marks are a whole lot less red. this lotion didn&#x27;t eliminate them, but a significant improvement is definitely there. if you&#x27;re doubtful just give it a try, what have you got to lose, other than the brightness of those stretch marks?!</li>
