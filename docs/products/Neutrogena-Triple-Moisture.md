      <li>I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but this is exactly what MY hair needed to achieve perfect shine, body and softness.</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair and used to use the Aveda Elixer leave-in conditioning cream until it was discontinued</li>
      <li>well keeping my fine hair from snags and also from breakage.  </li>
      <li>Super product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice and light on the hair, yet it still moisturizes and makes my hair look pretty and smooth.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s light, not greasy and it comes in a generous 8.5oz size.</li>
      <li>By far, the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used to calm and de-frizz, while still defining natural curls.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product when I want to wear my hair curly.  It keeps my hair from looking dry or from getting frizzy.  I love this product and the price!!</li>
    <li> I love this one. I first used the triple defense and eventually it didn&#x27;t work like quite how I wanted it to. Now I switched to this and I was impressed. My hair was damaged because I colored it 3-4x in one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I put it on my dry hair and it looks awesome. Guaranteed to make your duck face more &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34;. Like a chickens ***.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the  weekly conditioner today,and it states on the bottle it can be used on dry hair, as well as damp hair. I put on a dime-sized dollop( I have a pixie cut),and Wow! My hair feels so much softer already.I may have put a touch too much on,but still,I am amazed at the results after one try.I will put smaller amounts in from here on out,as this seems to pack a punch.Hair that is color-treated,and \\&quot;winter-ized\\&quot; year after year sure does show.It looks lifeless...no lustre.This hopefully will \\&quot;cure\\&quot; my worn-out locks. I am very optimistic, and will try, and review the weekly mask asap.</li>
    <li> Dont buy from them they will sell you the wrong shampoo and then not give you a refund even though there store page says they do!!!! Order from CosmeticMall or somewhere else instead!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using a very expensive Blue Beard leave-in conditioner on my long beard until I discovered this product. Not only is it much, much less expensive, but it works better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a daily motorcycle rider (with an open-faced, half-helmet), my beard takes quite a beating from the wind and sun. But this cream leaves me beard soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> If you have dry, damaged, colored hair, this is the best product for you.  I started using it in Hawaii and have made it part of my daily routine.  Amazing, and at a reasonable price. I live in Washington State where the air is constantly trying to frizz my 64 year-old hair, and this product really discourages that process.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I use on my hair! Not too greasy or too light or heavy. It is perfect for my hair type and texture and I would highly recommend using this product on your ends to help moisturize your ends. Can be used alone or with an oil as a sealant.</li>
    <li> My local super centers quit carrying this product and it&#x27;s the only thing that works on my baby fine mixed race hair. I&#x27;ve used every sort of product and this one leaves my hair soft and not greasy. Some leave in conditioners actually make my hair more dry because they use cheap ingredients. This leave-in cream is the best thing I&#x27;ve purchased. I recommend it to anyone who has dry, brittle hair.</li>
    <li> I have African-American super fine, extremely dry, super kinky hair. I wear it natural so I have a difficulty finding products that will define my curls while moisturizing at the same time.  This product is a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t flake or leave any residue but it does nothing to define my natural curl pattern (that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five). I have however noticed a dramatic decline in brittleness and hair breakage so I will continue to use it. I use it everyday on wet or dry hair and it doesn&#x27;t build  up---just softens.    ****PRODUCT UPDATE**** Jan. 2010  Since writing this review I have found a truly awesome and wonderful product that I would give 6 stars if I could. It&#x27;s Giovanni Direct Leave-In Conditioner. A little goes a very long way. It&#x27;s light, not greasy and it comes in a generous 8.5oz size. It conditions better than Neutrogena, I use much less of it and it also defines my natural curl pattern!   My hair is beautiful and getting better all of the time. I still use the Triple moisture shampoo and conditioner but as far as my leave-in conditioner, I have left Neutrogena in the dust and have happily replaced it with Giovanni Direct Leave-In Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair and have always used leave in conditioners. I&#x27;ve tried a ton and this has the best value. With subscribe and save, each bottle is a little more than $5 which is awesome.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried most leave in conditioners available on the market.  We haven&#x27;t found one we like any better than this one.  It leaves your hair soft, easy to style and residue free.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and can&#x27;t find anything thing else economical and reliable. I have naturally curly, thick hair and this product is light on my hair. It does not width my hair down, nor does it leave a sticky, crunchy feel to my hair. The 3 pack is economical, since this product rarely goes on sale.</li>
    <li> I ordered this leave-in cream after reading a bunch of forums on African American hair. I have thick/coarse hair and after using this every night my hair has been super soft! Remember to seal your ends with an oil after you put this on to retain the moisture. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed if you order this!</li>
    <li> My hair is long and I die it blond, so it tends to be somewhat dry. This product did not work for me. My hair is easy to comb after I apply it but it looks rather dull, no miracle....</li>
    <li> for my hair it&#x27;s not as good as herbal essence long term relationship or the none of your frizzyness leave ins but it&#x27;s a really nice substitute.i absolutely love the shampoo and the conditioner to this product and i like this too would buy again</li>
    <li> Great price, great deal.</li>
    <li> This product is very light on your hair and provides great moisture. I definitely recommend this for anyone with dry hair issues.</li>
    <li> I was told about this product from a family member, and I loved it....I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now. I&#x27;m addicted; however, I want more than just 6oz. I wish that I could buy them from stores other than freakin Walgreens!!!! The Neutrogena website even said I could only buy this product from Walgreens and CVS from where I live. So not fair! I have mixed hair (black and white) plus its long down my back I need more than just 6 freaking ounces. Luckily enough...amazon sells pack of 3...good enough.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer for us natural girls,, I don&#x27;t like that it does not stay very long before I am back to being super dry but for  comb through detangling  of these kinky coils it works like magic!</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair and used to use the Aveda Elixer leave-in conditioning cream until it was discontinued so I switched to this since a cream leave in conditioner is hard to find and the price on this is very good.  It provides good moisturizing and frizz controll without weighing hair down or feeling like product.  It smells good and does a very good job but sadly not quite as good as the Aveda (but at half the price I think it comes a close second) but still a great product.</li>
    <li> With having relaxed hair i suffer from VERY VERY DRY hair and without taking care of the dryness if your relaxed your hair will break.  I use this every time i wash my hair (which is once a week) after shampooing i use neutrogena hair mask(which is also GREAT) wash that out after 10 minutes then I  part my hair into two sections and use  two dime sizes on each section, i roller set(which i perfer just think its better but you can blow dry) after its dry and i ran my fingers threw my hair, LITERALLY  feels like silk its sooooo soft.I put a half a dime size of serum after threw my whole hair just to give it shine.  All in all this product is AMAZING</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I thought because it&#x27;s so difficult to find in stores, it must be a big seller.&lt;br /&gt;After using it, my guess is, it&#x27;ll probably be taken off the market.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awful.&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair DRY and the ends brittle.&lt;br /&gt;But after looking at the ingredients on the bottle, I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol and SODIUM HYDROXIDE .. ?? LYE? To FRY my hair???&lt;br /&gt;Are you kidding.&lt;br /&gt;No more for me!!</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product after hearing so much about it and I love this stuff. It makes my hair shiney and smooth and a little goes a long way. I found in the past that other hair lotions I tried weighed my hair down, but not this. It works great!</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it  to give my hair a break from gels and mousses that contain alcohol or other harsh ingredients.  This makes my hair feel so soft and healthy.  I usually put it in after I shampoo and that&#x27;s that. (Sometimes I put it on my dry hair or dampen it with a warm towel first if I&#x27;m not shampooing.) Rubbing my hand across my hair during the day reminds me of how great the product is.  Smells great and makes hair smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I was thinking of maybe cutting my very dry hair. I use the product everyday and now I see a healthy and more manageable hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff really stops the frizz. And hair just drinks it up. Super product!</li>
    <li> Many leave ins and serums leave you hair oily and gross all day but I love that even when I but too much product in my hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I wish it made my hair a tad bit more conditioning though but I still like it.</li>
    <li> I tried this on dry hair and wet hair. After trying this on both dry and wet, it works better on wet hair, it leaves it smelling awesome silky and comb-able.</li>
    <li> By far, the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used to calm and de-frizz, while still defining natural curls. Smells wonderful too. Don&#x27;t spend your money on other expensive products, this stuff is great, and at a great price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from&lt;br /&gt;Germany and use it for 8 years now! Best for my fine hair!</li>
    <li> I use this on my short hair.  It keeps it from sticking up when I&#x27;ve recently gotten a cut.  Not stiff.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t like me. This cream has acted as a therapist, and has slowly but surely convinced my hair that I am not an evil person. I&#x27;m a male growing out my thick wavy hair for the first time, who considered hiring a samurai 6 months into the commitment to make may hair&#x27;s demise a painful one, until I found this product. On second thought, I am kind of evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other creams, that are now forming a new wall in my bathroom, but I keep coming back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that due to the thickness of my hair, I use a bit more than other people would, which leaves my hair slightly greasy, but I really mean just slightly. I just have to rinse my hands for a second after I mess with my hair for too long.</li>
    <li> This product works so well!  I just rub it into my wet hair after getting out the shower, I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner in the shower cuz this stuff makes my hair soft and tangle free!  I couldn&#x27;t keep long hair without this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is not horrible but cheaper products with identical ingredients are readily available. I would not repurchase either the shampoo or the leave-in. Poor price/quality ratio. Still searching for that holy grail and the &amp;#34;shampoo commercial&amp;#34; look&lt;br /&gt;Edit : Two years later have not found it. I think my expectations are simply too high and I have to accept my hair, and get it cut in a way that it is least bothersome. I am still using up this package of 3 bottles, but still would not repurchase</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner I have found. Just ordered more!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner and smells good</li>
    <li> I have dry hair that sucks up moisture from any source. This product is great. I use a small dab after shampoo and before styling.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It gives my hair the moisture that is needed and it is not oily which is important to me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It really helps keep my hair looking healthy especially through daily hair washes and blow drys. I mainly use it on tips and ends as it could make the hair near my scalp a bit greasy. However, I do have very thin hair. I don&#x27;t think people with thicker hair would have an issue.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that is thick and can get frizzy.  My curl pattern is loose curls, and this product has been amazing for my hair condition, plus styling.  It is all I need to get my curls under control and add some light definition, but not stiff or sticky at all.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive product on my hair and all I can think is &amp;#34;There goes $5&amp;#34; every time I use it.  This product is so great and at this price, you don&#x27;t need to worry about using as much as you want.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Works well keeping my fine hair from snags and also from breakage.  Hair feels thicker and keeps body.</li>
    <li> I used, for years , Nexxus Thickening Leave-In Volumizer ,about $19 for 13.5 oz. It was the best leave in conditioner on the market in my opinion . Went to buy a bottle about two months ago and was shocked to see it selling for about $75 a bottle and not listed on the Nexxus web site , seems they stopped making the stuff. In my search for a replacement I ran across Neutrogena Triple Moisture Leave-In Cream,had confidence in the manufacturer based on using other Neutrogena products in the past, so bought a bottle. After the first use I was sold, it is not only as good but better than , the discontinued Nexxus product, and at Amazons price for a pack of 3 almost an identical price. This stuff smooths out the snarls completely so you can brush/comb your hair after washing , replenishes moisture and lasts all day . Just follow the directions and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is wonderful when paired with a sealant (ie almond oil, jojoba oil, and coconut oil (even though it&#x27;s both a sealant and moisturizer)).&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally straight and thick and though I thin it out and refrain from using chemicals in my shampoo the summer sun took quite a toll on it. All the deep conditioning and hot oil treatments have done little for my ends (mostly beneficial to my roots). This product smells lovely, a soft flowery salon smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results use this when hair is damp paired with a sealant. Just rub a bit (a dime size or nickel size depending on your hair length) on your palms and into your hair focusing on the ends. Then when the product settles for a few minutes add a few drops of light oil to your palm, spread it around, and then apply to your hair once again focusing on your ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my ends smoother and soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Hair care tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Do not towel dry! Instead let your hair air dry completely or let your hair air dry until 70% dry then follow with a COLD blow-out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Add some avocado oil (not the one in the cooking isle!) to your conditioner for more slip and moisture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sleep with your hair in a loose pony-tail; sleeping with hair left out encourages frizziness and tangles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nix shampoos with sulfates; sulfates strip your hair of it&#x27;s natural oils it needs to stay polished and tamed</li>
    <li> Great for Africa America relaxed hair</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, and I blow dry my bangs straight. This is the only less-expensive product I have found that makes that job easier - if I wanted something better I would need to go to the $20 range, and why do that if I don&#x27;t have to?</li>
    <li> I permed my hair 3 months ago and never used any special products on it. The ends looked extremely frayed, bent, dry, and damaged. After using this product for less than a week, my hair felt smoother and softer. The ends of my hair looks normal and healthy now. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a drastic improvement, but I definitely noticed a surprisingly decent improvement in my hair quality.</li>
    <li> use it when I&#x27;m in the sun-- keep my hair from drying/ frying out.</li>
    <li> Was not really what I expected.  My fault!</li>
    <li> what can i say this leave in is my go to. no matter how many times i try to find a different leave in i always come back to this one, the reason why i try to find a new leave in is because of the price and quantity. i wish this stuff came in a larger size like a gallon or 33 oz.</li>
    <li> Good stuff lighter than VO-5.</li>
    <li> Love this product ~ works great on really long hair :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this in my long, fine hair for a number of years now.  It makes my hair smooth and shiny, and keeps it from being dry (static) in the winter.  I really like it but it is getting harder to find at times in stores.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> Adds shine and doesn&#x27;t dry out ends as some leave-ins do. Has a fresh scent, adds shine and body to my fine hair.</li>
    <li> If you have kinky kinky kinky hair, tired of wasting hundreds of dollars on leave in conditions that don&#x27;t work or leave your hair heavy then this is the product for us., you and me. I ve used almost everything from raw Shea butter, to water mixed with coconut oil to almost every so called natural product. This product is not natural but at the end of the day and morning, I just want beautiful healthy hair. My con is that I ve been using daily For two weeks and the bottle is nearly half empty. I paid 8bucks and would have liked for it to stretch longer. Ooh well this beauty doesn&#x27;t hurt but it will cost me. :)</li>
    <li> I have used this on my hair when natural &amp; relaxed &amp; this is the best of the best. My hair texture is course and can be very dry.  Thanks to a review on Youtube this product is now a staple.  Its been 4 years now and I swear by this moisturizer.  Its only one of two out of the many that I tried that works wonders for my hair (Elasta QP comes in 2nd.)  After trial and error I realized that my very dry hair only needs a tiny amount on a daily basis.  I seal the moisture in with either Chi Silk Infusion or JBCO in which both works wonders for dry, brittle, course hair.  I ONLY use this on dry hair.  When I tried it on wet it was a mess and appeared not to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I faithfully use the Triple Moisture Line.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and does a great job getting out the build up.  The daily conditioner is the best.  To my sisters: if you want \\&quot;slip\\&quot; from a conditioner look no further; my hair is always super soft &amp; light after conditioning.  I also use the deep conditioning treatment and add JBCO.  The only product from this line that I won&#x27;t buy again is the Split End Mender.  I find it unnecessary as the Silk Touch Leave-In works much better &amp; does everything my hair needs to stay moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years... recently tried other things.. just to save money... in the end..they couldn&#x27;t compare...and I am happily back to this product.  It gives my curly, very fine hair the texture it needs....  it can be a little hard to find at stores... Target and Walmart by me doesn&#x27;t have it... the Walgreen&#x27;s does... if they aren&#x27;t sold out.  Thankfully, I can get it online.  I love this conditioner. LJK</li>
    <li> Omg I just loved this so much! This worked great for my natural hair, my hair is like a 3c and it just gets my hair sooooooo moist. I am going to buy like ten more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is the smell it isn&#x27;t all that pleasent to me.</li>
    <li> My hair loves it. No more tangles.</li>
    <li> I bought this leave in cream thinking it would help my hair stay soft and smooth. I am biracial (black and white mix) so my hair is extremely curly and thick. I was very disappointed with this cream because it made my hair somewhat crunchy and felt oily. If I had of known this I would not have bought it. Not to mention the smell is not pleasant either. It may work for some people but I was not pleased and will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am also of mixed race and use this when wearing my coarse, natural, curly hair and before/after I blow dry for a straight style. Not just great for my hair, but great for my Caucasian friend too! I was amazed to see we use the same product on our hair. Leaves hair very soft with no build up. Like the fact that it has UV filters too.</li>
    <li> ive been using this for over a year. has worked miracles for my once dry hair. definitely is a must have if you are looking to add some moisture to your hair</li>
    <li> I have never thought of Neutrogena as a haircare product and it has exceded my expectations 100%&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for sending me this product...</li>
    <li> I love this.  It&#x27;s so nice and light on the hair, yet it still moisturizes and makes my hair look pretty and smooth.  My hair is so soft now, too.  The smell is absolutely wonderful.  This is now included with my other \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; items.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I like for my hair. I have curly, thick hair and the curls can sometimes get frizzy. I have been using it for about 8 years. It rarely goes on sale, so it&#x27;s most cost effective to order in the pack.</li>
    <li> I am African American with relaxed color treated hair.  I use this product to moisturize and seal my hair every night before bed.  This stuff smells great and does a great job of moisturizing my hair.  I have been using it for one year since starting my healthy hair journey, my hair likes it.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It really puts moisture back in there hair.  It was recommend in a hair book I read.  It turn out to be one of my best buys.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair. I give it 5 stars because it does exactly what the bottle describes it moisturizes the hair makes it soft to touch and last all day. I use the matching shampoo and conditioner as well.  It does not really help to make my hair curly like some people can just a lil moisturizer and go not me. The only con to this is that does not give your hair any shine to it u may have to use a little sheen spray or finishing spray after using it. But overall a good 5 star moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell and silky smooth effect. Great on my coarse, dry hair. The pricing is great on this combo too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and always come back here to buy it. I use a small amount on short hair.  it can be minimal glossy, so as it dries, I fluff hair and its matte and light weight.</li>
    <li> I have tried to replace this product with a cheaper product and I can&#x27;t find anything like it!! I have relaxed hair and I moisturize and seal with this twice a day. It leaves no build up and literally  melts into your hair! I love it. Great ingredients. I wanted a leave in that didn&#x27;t have protein because I condition with protein and too much protein can break your hair. This stuff just works.</li>
    <li> Really helps keep moisture in and it helps tremendously with breakage!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only one product that I use and I love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best leave in I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s light weight.Leaves my hair so soft, and tangle free. For best results use this after a shampoo, before styling. It works best when my hair is wet. A little goes a long way. I use a little more than a quarter size amount, work it through my hair focusing on my ends. It works best for me this way.</li>
    <li> This leave-in cream smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy. I use this on my damp hair (along with CHI Silk Infusion) and it helps detangle my hair but keeps it moisturized for air drying. I also use a dab of it to control flyaways or smooth my hairline for ponytails. Overall, a great moisturizing cream that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I found this a little watery for me, it make my flat ironed hair too damp it didn&#x27;t hold the style and when I used less it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough</li>
    <li> It works perfect for me. Great Product, softens up my hair and the curls are way more defined! You would only need a tiny bit of the product to work immediately.</li>
    <li> I love to put just a dab on my hair after my shower and it makes my hair feel better and it&#x27;s much more manageable.  I can&#x27;t stand my hair if I don&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but this is exactly what MY hair needed to achieve perfect shine, body and softness. When I get a chance I want to upload some pictures here so you can see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product liberally after I towel dry my hair, then I comb it through and let my hair air dry. I also use it on dry hair when I feel my hair could use that extra boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have trouble with my hair looking frizzy and dull, and I have trouble with fly away hairs. My hair is also on the thin side so I crave extra body. Neutrogena&#x27;s leave-in cream solves all these hair problems and gives me the hair I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much love and recommend this product (and I am NOT being paid by Neutrogena! haha)</li>
    <li> Works great on my flyaway hair.  Lots of static at work and it goes on well on dry hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling tacky. Gets me back to some semblance of a style. Works well as a de-tangler for my grandson who has super thick and curly hair.  He is not fond of the smell but it fades fast enough.  My co-workers have used it also (again, lots of static) and they are impressed.</li>
