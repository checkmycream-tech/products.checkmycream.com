    <li> Shipping was incredibly fast!! Great product! I will buy this again!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely hands down the WORST essential oils I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.  I only purchased these oils to use in my DIY homemade laundry soap and on my wool dryer balls, but these are so awful I can&#x27;t even use them for that!!!!!  Every single one of these &amp;#34;pure essential oils&amp;#34; is FILLED with a carrier oil - what kind of carrier oil, I don&#x27;t know!!  Maybe it&#x27;s vegetable oil??  ICK!  These oils won&#x27;t even absorb into my wool dryer balls!  They just sit on the top like a gross, slimy film!!!  I can&#x27;t even believe that this company markets them as &amp;#34;100% Pure&amp;#34;.  PURE BS is what that is!!!!!  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson - for homemade cleaning and laundry items where you need bulk essential oils but DON&#x27;T WANT CRAP, buy the NOW Foods brand.  Theirs might not be &amp;#34;therapeutic grade&amp;#34; and I would **never** use them to treat any physical or emotional ailment that my family members and I might have, but they are good quality EO&#x27;s for home cleaning use.  SUN ORGANIC&#x27;S ARE NOT!!!  These are AWFUL!!!</li>
    <li> I have a swamp cooler in my house and I hate the way that it makes it smell. I knew there had to be something safe, that also smelled good. When I saw this Spearmint Essential Oil by Sun Organic, I knew that I wanted my house to smell like that. When I got it, I decided that I wanted to put some on the swamp cooler pads. I added a few drops to each and within a minute my whole house smelled amazing. The scent made it seem cool and crisp in my house. I love the scent and it lingered in the house for days. Best essentials oils ever!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great product at a Great price!  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> ╔ ■ Price Point: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ■ Quality/Durability: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ■ Need: 4/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ■ Recommendation/Giftable Factor: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;╠ ☼ Overall: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;╠ ►Who needs this:  People who use oils topically or diffused via a vaporizer; mental peace, relaxation, and satisfaction, and helps relieve anxiety, anger, and stress&lt;br /&gt;╚ ►The bottom line:  This oil is STRONG. You cannot leave the bottle open for a long period without getting overwhelmed. If you are looking to make your entire house smell like this, than I recommend doing this. It does come with a bubble wrapped and with a dropper for a reason; to just use a little bit at a time. Once you use a little the product is great smelling. The bottle itself is huge and will last a long long time. I love that it is 100% organic and pure and that the company will stand behind their product with a 100% refund at any time. They have 100 smells to choose from and would love to try them all. I was lucky enough to receive a discount in exchange for my honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint oil is strong, too strong for some people. It may induce skin irritations and other side effects. If you’re looking for a safer mint oil, look to peppermint’s cousin: spearmint&lt;br /&gt;The uses of spearmint oil extend beyond the kitchen and the medicine cabinet. For instance, it can also be used to help the mind relax or to instill positive emotions. I have compiled a list of spearmint oil’s specific uses below:&lt;br /&gt;• Aromatherapy oil: Because of its menthol content, spearmint oil is often used in aromatherapy to help treat fatigue, headaches, migraines, nervousness, and even digestive problems.&lt;br /&gt;• Food ingredient – Oil of spearmint is sometimes added to baked goods, frozen dairy, meats, beverages, and chewing gum. Note, however, that you are better off consuming whole, raw foods than these processed ones.&lt;br /&gt;• Fragrance – This essential oil is added to certain types of perfume. It is commonly mixed with other herbs like jasmine, lavender, bergamot, and sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;• Ingredient in pharmaceutical products – It is often added to tooth powders, gargles, and toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;• Disinfectant – Spearmint oil can be used to treat internal and external infections, including scabies, dermatitis, syphilis, and other transmittable conditions.&lt;br /&gt;• Bath oil – When added to bath water, spearmint oil can induce relaxation and can cool you off by reducing your body temperature.&lt;br /&gt;• Massage oil – With its antispasmodic properties, spearmint oil can help relieve muscle pain and even abdominal pain due to menstruation.&lt;br /&gt;• Insecticide – This oil can ward off mosquitoes and other insects. It is often added to insect repellents, creams, mats, and fumigants.&lt;br /&gt;• Because spearmint oil has antiseptic properties (due to the presence of menthol, myrcene, and caryophyllene), it can protect wounds and ulcers from infection and even help them heal faster.&lt;br /&gt;• It can help treat sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as gonorrhea and syphilis.&lt;br /&gt;• It can help treat internal wounds and infections in the stomach and intestines.&lt;br /&gt;• Help relax nerves and muscle spasms due to its menthol content&lt;br /&gt;• Let excessive gas pass naturally from your stomach and intestines&lt;br /&gt;• Cure headaches and stress-related neural problems&lt;br /&gt;• Address menstrual problems, such as irregular periods, obstructed menses, and early menopause as it induces the secretion of the hormone estrogen&lt;br /&gt;• Stimulate nerves and brain function, as well as blood circulation&lt;br /&gt;• Treat common respiratory problems, such as colds, nasal congestion, asthma, and fluxed with other herbs like jasmine, lavender, bergamot, and sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;• Ingredient in pharmaceutical products – It is often added to tooth powders, gargles, and toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;• Disinfectant – Spearmint oil can be used to treat internal and external infections, including scabies, dermatitis, syphilis, and other transmittable conditions.&lt;br /&gt;• Bath oil – When added to bath water, spearmint oil can induce relaxation and can cool you off by reducing your body temperature.&lt;br /&gt;• Massage oil – With its antispasmodic properties, spearmint oil can help relieve muscle pain and even abdominal pain due to menstruation.&lt;br /&gt;• Insecticide – This oil can ward off mosquitoes and other insects.

    <li> I received an order, on promotion, of the Spearmint. This has a very authentic and wonderful smell. It is just what you think of when you open the bottle. I plan on using it in my homemade toothpaste. The packaging was well done and arrived quickly as it was sent priority mail which is always pleasing to know as it gets to me quickly and I believe safer than regular mail. It comes with a dispenser to easily put the oil in a oil ring or in a oil burner. Would buy again!!</li>
    <li> Great product and a very good price! I use it all the time. I will definitely be reordering!</li>
    <li> Once again, Sun Organic hits it out of the park, both in quality and quantity price. You simply can&#x27;t get a better deal on essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this brand of oil, and I must say, I am impressed.  Each bottle comes with a 1ml dropper with markings for each quarter ml.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil was an amazing surprise.  As soon as I removed the plastic seal (even before I opened the bottle), I could smell the oil!  The oil is very strong and sweet-smelling, but isn&#x27;t overpowering, an may I say, this oil does not disappoint!  I suffer from nausea frequently, and I put this oil in my burner, and it sure helps me feel better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a high-quality spearmint oil, I strongly suggest this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note: I was given this oil as part of a free trial.  I was not paid to write this review.**</li>
    <li> This spearmint fragrance is refreshing and long lasting.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent!  It smells exactyas I thought it would.  I would recommend this oil from Sun Essential Oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product to try for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product for price.  Would suggest better seal for bottle did leak some during shipping.  Still a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Smells like a bit of spearmint heaven, and is WONDERFUL in homemade lotions and such. I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> This is not a steam distilled essential oil, i guess its a solvent extraction or something based on the aroma, that is awful, yes i can perceive the spearmint far behind, but the top note its a solvent aroma.. i haven&#x27;t been able to use it.. its not oily, rather very liquid and has an alcohol feel... I buy a LOT of different EO&#x27;s from a lot of brands, (i am a cosmetic manufacturer) and this was the first time i tried sun organics and i am very dissapointed, i wouldnt buy from them again. Its almost unbelievable their oils are really organic and therapeutic grade at those prices.. i won&#x27;t be risking my money in their products again! As there a no regulations for EO&#x27;s and the information given is poor i wouldn&#x27;t trust them if i were you.</li>
    <li> There is no disclosure of what parts of the plant have been used or the source of the plants from which the essential oil has been derived. There is no indication that it has been tested or verified for purity, such as by gas chromatography or mass spectroscopy, as is the case with better products. Moreover, this oil has been diluted with undisclosed filler oils and it has a weak fragrance. If you&#x27;re looking for pure essential oils then look elsewhere. I purchased more than a dozen oils from this company, and all of them were similarly disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great product and the seller shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> oh my goodness!  this oil smells so good I want to eat it!  I added a small drop to a bowl of water and soaked a wash cloth with it and kept it with me all day to cool me down and refresh me! I just kept dipping in water and the smell is still there - a week later!!  Love this!</li>
    <li> Sun Organic has VERY low quality Essential Oils. They are NOT 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade essential oil by any means. Sun Organic is a waste of money. They are greasy and obviously mixed with a carrier.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this oil! This spearmint oil smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It is very refreshing to have in a diffuser, or mixed with some carrier oil in a roller bottle for perfume.&lt;br /&gt;It smells just as I would expect spearmint to smell!&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a 2oz dark amber glass bottle, with a crappy plastic lid. The lids will break and leak if you aren&#x27;t careful, but the oil is so amazing smelling, that it doesn&#x27;t deter me from giving it a great review. Just a warning :)&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this had a dropper lid, I am going to have to look into getting some!&lt;br /&gt;I love it and recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free for the purpose of an honest review. My opinion is my own!</li>
    <li> This essential oil reminds me of spearmint gum, a very pleasant minty smell. Spearmint is not as pungent as Peppermint oil, which is very strong. There are so many uses for Spearmint oil, in can be enjoyed just as aromatherapy, fragrance, food ingredient, disinfectant, bath oil, massage oil and as an insecticide. Because spearmint oil has antiseptic properties, it can protect wounds and ulcers from infection and even help them heal faster. You can blend and use in Add 2-3 drops per cup of water to use as mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;1 part clove&lt;br /&gt;2 parts peppermint&lt;br /&gt;2 parts spearmint&lt;br /&gt;1 part lemon&lt;br /&gt;I hate the mouthwashes on the market, due to an injury as a child, mouthwash that has alcohol in it tends to bite my tongue and brings tears to my eyes. So using the above oils blended works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Spearmint Essential Oil from Sun​ Organic and was not monetarily compensated for my review.</li>
    <li> spearmint and lemongrass combined helped my bees survive i am a new beekeeper, my husband and I were afraid that we were going to loose our bees found a web site that suggested using food grade oils and i am glad to say that it DID YEA</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and well packaged so that it wouldn&#x27;t get damaged in the shipping process. It is a good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> Smells...tainted. It doesn&#x27;t smell pure; perhaps from heat distillation?  I won&#x27;t be using it on my body. Possibly it will have use as household insect repellant. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I mix with peppermint EO and it does the trick for pest control.</li>
    <li> Oil seems great. I add several drops to my sugar water to feed my beehive in early spring. The bees love it.</li>
