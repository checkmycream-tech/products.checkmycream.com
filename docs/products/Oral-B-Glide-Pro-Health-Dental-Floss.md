<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite dental floss. It gets through tight spots, without snagging.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews I decided to order this product because several reviews indicated there had not been an experience of the floss shredding while in use and getting stuck in the teeth. After using the product for the past few months, I experienced so much shredding, and floss getting stuck in my teeth, it really puzzled me.  I opened the dispenser and was shocked to see the floss was shredding  in the dispenser before I could even use it!!! What good is this???!?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t experiment and made a clear conclusion, but to me, it seems thinner and weaker than the one I get one by one at the off line store. I&#x27;m not completely sure what it is, but I get that kind of feeling.</li>
    <li> It is the only floss I can ever use... great for sensitive gum</li>
    <li> I am so glad I went with this one, not only does it come with a few packs, but it also tastes wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is not the least expensive floss around, but it&#x27;s the only kind I will use.&lt;br /&gt;There is a gentle glide between teeth, with an easy glide up into the gum where flossing really is needed most.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; like some of the others.</li>
    <li> Best version so far. Doesn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;maker&amp;#34;.....whomever they are.....realize  it deserves better commercialization.  Never know who the owner of the product is.........</li>
    <li> THE BEST floss, period. Tastes good, doesn&#x27;t fall to pieces, and comes at a great price, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Everything was great!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything was great!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything was great!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Best dental floss around.  I like the fact that it is heavy gauge and does not break in your teeth like ordinary gauge dental floss.</li>
    <li> dentist recommended....excellent floss</li>
    <li> I like this Glide dental floss the most of all the dental floss that I have tried. It has some width it to it; but it also can be made to be thread thin by twisting it slightly. It works better than the thin line type that I sometimes have used; but I prefer the glide. It feels better on my gums than the thin wire like type I used before. Glide does not break when using it either; something that happened with other dental floss that I used.</li>
    <li> Either this dental floss is a 98 pound weakling, or I have really sharp teeth.  Or both.  But it breaks too often (not frays, totally splits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I suppose it works fine.  Reasonably comfortable.  Cleans okay.</li>
    <li> Great buy in this multi-pack! I use this glide pro-health floss twice a day. It&#x27;s very effective and easy to use. I have close contacts so this glide-type floss makes it easier to get inbetween the teeth. Most floss varieties shred due to my close contacts; however, not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used with a good paste, brush, and mouth wash, this dental floss helps to prevent gingivitis and it helps to reduce plaque and bad breath. I recommend this floss for the best mouth, teeth, and gum care!</li>
    <li> Dental floss should neither shred nor break.  This product does not shred but it snaps apart far too easily.</li>
    <li> Simply the best!  I once saw a 20 minute presentation of why Glide is the best floss anywhere, the presenter had nothing to do with Glide...just a lover.</li>
    <li> The shape (a thin stripe rather than a string) is great and comfortable, slightly stretchy. The minty flavor is a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve set this product for &amp;#34;subscribe &amp; save&amp;#34; because I never want to run out (in addition to arriving at your door, it also costs less).  Love the minty taste, the smooth glide, and that it never has shredded or gotten stuck between my teeth.  I keep one in several different spots (purse and car included) because using floss (that works) is the only way to appease the annoying pressure of food items wedged.  Maybe it&#x27;s silly to rave about dental floss, but I guess, if you&#x27;re reading this...you&#x27;re silly right along with me!  Thank you, Oral-B Glide Cool Mint!</li>
    <li> Great floss.  Gets between teeth easily, even if your teeth are very close together.  Doesn&#x27;t snap easily.  Tastes great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ease of which this goes between my teeth has made it easier for me to make a habit of flossing.  It&#x27;s comfortable and does a good job keeping things very clean.  If you&#x27;re looking to start (or just continue) this good habit, this is a good floss to do it with.</li>
    <li> Best floss ever.  Slides through tight spaces, and leaves a nice minty flavor in mouth.  For the first time ever I&#x27;m getting good reviews from the dentist at my cleaning appointments.</li>
    <li> I look for a few simple things in my floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I don&#x27;t want it to shred&lt;br /&gt;2) I don&#x27;t want it to be stuck between my teeth&lt;br /&gt;3) I want it to do the cleaning&lt;br /&gt;4) I don&#x27;t want the flavoring on the floss to be too noticeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of different floss, and keep coming back to Glide Floss simply because it works the best.  It feels good on my teeth and my fingers holding the floss. It never breaks when I use it.  It never shreds, it glides easily between my (tightly packed) teeth. You can do the cleaning in one pass, it digs out whatever happen to be stuck in there very well. With other floss I feel I need to make a second pass sometimes, but not with Glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flavor: Glide comes in two packaging. Photo attached. One has silver packaging and one has greenish packaging. The silver packaging has no mint flavor, the greenish package has mint flavor (not terribly strong but noticeable). The describe of the package for silver package mentioned \\&quot;deep protection\\&quot; and for green package mentions \\&quot;multi-protection\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t feel or see the difference between the two other than one has flavor and the other one does not. I did not notice the mint flavor mentioned on the package. I have a slight preference for no flavor, so if I knew I would have picked the silver package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In term of price Glide is a little pricier than other floss. To me it is worth it. The best price on this 6 packs I found at Costco, especially when they run a coupon in their flyer. Amazon price is is decent, but fluctuates. I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter \\&quot;price history alert\\&quot; in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool to be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidence or not? I noticed that when I use my Glide floss my hygienist compliments me on my flossing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia Review</li>
    <li> This dental tape does not snag or fray like all the others I&#x27;ve used, and leaves my teeth feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> Best floss ever. It fits between my tight teeth by being wide and flat. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve used for years now.</li>
    <li> Every one in a while it&#x27;ll break, but other than that, this floss makes you hate it when you have to make do with anything else. Seriously, it&#x27;s that comfortable and natural.</li>
    <li> Its Oral-B, Great as usual!</li>
    <li> They r extremely short. The whole order does not add up to a regular one full size</li>
    <li> Great for flossing my teeth and leaving a nice smell</li>
    <li> Many times I&#x27;ve tried to get in the habit of flossing every day, and I&#x27;ve always failed until I started using this floss.  It works well and makes the process much more bearable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and it&#x27;s awesome.  It is easy to use, comfortable, and effective.  Better than all the other flosses I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s our favorite, though we&#x27;ve kinda given up looking for the holy grail of floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty tear resistant, though on occasion it does&lt;br /&gt;Tastes nice&lt;br /&gt;Wide enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get a great scrub, doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive enough&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, even in bulk</li>
    <li> This floss feels so smooth and gentle on my teeth. I have no issues with shredding or breakage. If the floss breaks, you&#x27;re flossing too hard and aggressively. Normal floss (reach brand style) feels horrible on my teeth, like a wire brush. I floss 3 times a day and this gets the job done without being too harsh. It takes almost no effort to remove plaque. People typically don&#x27;t realize how easy it is to remove plaque and they brush too hard and floss too roughly. An ultra soft toothbrush and glide floss will keep your teeth spotless.</li>
    <li> I like to take good care of my teeth and there isn&#x27;t much more painful that cheap, low quality floss. You know, the kind that feels like putting barb wire in between your teeth. This stuff works great - it&#x27;s glides between the teethe very well and doesn&#x27;t break easily. While this floss is more expensive that most floss, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> My sister received oral-B Glide Pro Health Deep Cleaning Dental floss for Christmas. She loves it!  It&#x27;s the ONLY floss she&#x27;ll use!</li>
    <li> For me, this floss is the absolute best at getting between tight teeth. It also refreshes your mouth, as it leaves a hint of fresh mint taste.</li>
    <li> I miss the original glide. I do not need so much mint flavor, it was overpowering.</li>
    <li> Very high quality, strong, doesn&#x27;t slip so you don&#x27;t need extra length to wind around your fingers for grip.  Fits into tight spaces.  If you have mostly larger spaces between teeth, I would go with woven floss.  Glide does give the impression of &amp;#34;gliding&amp;#34; over your teeth rather than scrubbing it, like some reviewers complain.  But woven floss won&#x27;t fit into tight spaces</li>
    <li> Not sure what is going on with Crest.  The Crest name has always been synonymous with dental care for as long as I can remember but in recent years I&#x27;ve had bad experiences.  First there was the Crest Pro Health brown teeth incident, now my Crest Glide floss is not what I remember.  Glide used to be my favorite floss - it glided easily through my teeth and was my floss of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I&#x27;ve noticed that the most recent pack I purchased of Crest Glide Floss Deep Clean is a big hassle.  Every day when I spool a piece out to floss my teeth the strand breaks just about every time then forcing me to unspool a second strand.  What&#x27;s prompting me to write this review this morning is the fact that it took me four strands just to floss my teeth this morning.  Not sure what is going on - possible product formula mix to save money?  I know it&#x27;s not caused by my teeth because the other dental floss brands I am trying do not break on me (and that includes a cheap drug store generic floss).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floss shouldn&#x27;t break easily since that is Floss&#x27;s sole purpose in life, 1-star from me.  -Signed, The Angry Flosser</li>
    <li> Best floss ever.  Never shreds, never sticks, very smooth.</li>
    <li> my favorite brand because it is a little thicker than floss but not quite tape and slides easily between my tight spaces. Nice minty taste too</li>
    <li> l have tried a number of flossing tapes over the years. This tape is the best  I have come across. l floss at the end of the day. I am tired and I want to get the job done as quickly and efficiently as possible. Glide Pro-Health really does glide though the teeth. No ripping, shredding or hang-ups. I love it!</li>
    <li> This floss is the same price if not more expensive than the regular Glide dental floss, and it shreds so easily it&#x27;s ridiculous. Do not buy this floss, get the regular Glide floss in the white packaging instead.</li>
    <li> It is rather ridiculous how much this floss costs (over $3 per individual box!), but $18 on Amazon is the cheapest I could find. Despite the price, this stuff is worth it. However, I&#x27;ll caution you that you won&#x27;t be able to go back to any other brand after this one. If you handle using generic floss or the cheaper stuff, do it. Only if you&#x27;re a floss snob or have a hard time flossing with other brands should you get this, there is no going back once you feel the difference. The sibling product, Oral-B Glide Pro-Health (without the Deep Clean suffix), is pretty good but somewhat thinner in width than the Deep Clean. As a result I don&#x27;t think it grabs gunk as well and I definitely feel a difference in favor of the Deep Clean when sliding it between my teeth. The Cool Mint taste is great and very light.</li>
    <li> The only floss I&#x27;ll ever use. Never tears, or snags.</li>
    <li> I used to love this product but the mint flavor changed to a gross taste that makes me want to finish flossing as fast as possible to get it out of my mouth.  I would still buy it if it had no flavor because of its function and use of use.  I bet a man changed this product thinking that only cost (cheaper mint flavoring) and flavor are important rather than health and wellbeing as a woman would find important.  I may switch to another product.</li>
    <li> I like the mint flavor and the waxed floss makes it much easier to use on my teeth.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> One of our favorite flosses to use. Comes in a pack of 6 for us and we refill from time to time. Works as advertised and is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Great value for the Glide!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice type of floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No more see-sawing back and forth, just slides right in. Seems to get everything other floss does and has a nice minty flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s a little slippery to hold on to. I wrap it around my middle fingers and use my index and thumb to hold and guide it, and it takes more wrapping to get a firm grip, so I&#x27;m using a bit more than normal. Also the plastic container itself is fairly low quality. I&#x27;ve almost accidentally broken it open just by tugging the floss to cut it on the little metal bit. I haven&#x27;t however and I&#x27;m not sure if maybe it&#x27;s supposed to come open (for replacements?). Could be that I was just holding it too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bunch of old floss containers and I was curious if there were advancements since the last time I got floss and this seems to fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Best floss we&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a ribbon type that glides between the closest teeth. I was introduced to this product by my dentist&#x27;s office which gives out sample products after each visit. Regular floss makes my gums bleed, but this product is soft and effective.</li>
    <li> Perfect product good price !</li>
    <li> One star for getting in tight places and that&#x27;s it. Glide really does just glide past your plaque and does not work. Unfortunately I went to the dentist after flossing with Glide for six months in between my cleanings. My gum numbers had gotten deeper. I asked the hygienist how that could have been possible since I&#x27;ve been flossing much more daily. She asked me what floss I had been using and I told her Glide. She said, \\&quot;Yep that&#x27;s why. The Glide floss does not remove all of the plaque. I&#x27;ve even gone and talked to a Glide representative *who was handing out samples, at the grocery store about it. His response was, I know it doesn&#x27;t work.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve even tossed the rest of my glide floss in the garbage and bought reach instead.</li>
    <li> Its hard to find a strong, floss tape in the stores.  I am always breaking the string type(s) of floss between my teeth.  Then you have to fish-out the string left in the crevice of your teeth; not fun.  This stuff is strong but yet thin enough to sneak between the teeth and do its cleaning job.  Good Stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used oral b for years! But warning, I just got this from my dentist and there was a strong mint taste. After I flossed, the taste turned weird and chemical. I rinsed. I felt the inside of my bottom lip shriveling and thought &amp;#34;I have been poisoned&amp;#34;. So I rinsed and rinsed more, then I brushed my teeth again.&lt;br /&gt;At night I had a long tedious nightmare. And I don&#x27;t have nightmares normally.&lt;br /&gt;My regular oral b floss says &amp;#34;made in Ireland&amp;#34; and the  one I experienced this problem with I got from my dentist says &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It was the small silver oral b deep clean cool mint.</li>
    <li> very useful product . can clean any where in ur mouth - roll in ur hands &amp; insert among teeth . ensures sny food particles are dislodged . also leaves behind pleasant taste. ofcours for me . it works best by using this product with lighted magnifier mirror. like this can ensure a perfect job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a good quality product. this was my second purchase.</li>
    <li> My teeth are tight,this is the easiest floss i have ever used,i floss every day and this is the best!</li>
    <li> Closest to what the dentists use.</li>
    <li> Glide dental floss is thinner and more durable than nylon floss, so it&#x27;s less likely to break or hit a lot of resistance if your teeth are tightly spaced, and I personally find it to be more comfortable on my gums. 40 meter (43.7 yard) is the largest package size I&#x27;ve been able to find for the Oral-B Pro-Health brand, and the price for a 6 pack is significantly lower than I can find in local stores.</li>
    <li> This floss works great!  I have to say that I hate flossing, but this floss might change my mind. Worth it!</li>
    <li> fabulous! simply fabulous!!</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery. Floss works well.</li>
    <li> Favorite floss, and I floss every day so I&#x27;ve tried a few brands.</li>
    <li> Every morning, the floss snaps at least 5-7 times during my flossing session. Terribly disappointed in Oral-B. What happened to the Original Glide floss? As is typical of big corporations who buy out smaller ones, Oral-B slowly, over many years, watered down the original Glide floss into something that is 1) cheaper to produce and 2) far lower in quality. There is no &#x27;Glide&#x27; happening with this floss...should be renamed &#x27;Glitch&#x27;. I will never purchase this product again. I am now on the hunt for something else that mimics the prior version of Glide - a high quality product that actually worked.</li>
    <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve ever used - worth every penny!  Very comfortable, even when gums are sore.  Simply the best floss...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many other types of floss over the years. Mint, no mint, wax, no wax, dental appliance floss, thin floss, thick floss, dental tape, stringy flosses, plastic-y flosses, the green stuff, the stuff that comes on an actual spool, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is the best I&#x27;ve found -- that&#x27;s why I ordered the pack of 6.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wide enough to fish those big bits out from between your teeth, but thin, so it slides easily between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is subtle and pleasant, and doesn&#x27;t seem to go stale like other mint floss I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The floss is soft compared to many others, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums as much if snapped a little hard.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly durable -- occasionally gets shredded, but might happen only 2-3 times out of a whole spool with my teeth, and usually doesn&#x27;t go suddenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critical observation is that it seems to get thicker toward the end/inside of the spool (observed on 3 spools in a row, though it still could be coincidence).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dentist a month ago for the first time in about 5 years (fresh out of college and just got insurance -- don&#x27;t tell anyone). No cavities, healthy gums, hard enamel, clean x-rays, all raves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think flossing regularly (once a day before bed) was a big part of that, and this stuff makes it easy to do well.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this exclusively, Sure beats the stuff that breaks off in your mouth.  Good product.</li>
    <li> After quitting flossing many years ago because other floss would break easily because my teeth are so tight together,  glide finally did the trick.</li>
    <li> I am a regular use of this product and must use it because of the closeness of  my teeth.  Glide is for me</li>
    <li> Having worked in a dental office, I am quite discerning when it comes to dental floss.  We&#x27;ve tried them all...however, Glide&#x27;s Cool Mint remains tops in my book.  There are imposters...various store brands who have made earnest attempts to copy the real thing.  However, this one comes out ahead and does what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how some say this one breaks while cleaning their teeth (do they have fangs?!?) but I&#x27;ve never had this one break or shred, nor have our patients made mention of it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly love the fresh Cool Mint flavor which doesn&#x27;t leave a fake mint taste, and I keep one in my purse for those times when you need floss when you&#x27;re dining out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product.  One I won&#x27;t do without!</li>
    <li> When it is the correct thickness, it works very well, but there is very poor quality control on this product.  It breaks several times each time I use it and unfortunately I ordered several rolls.  It takes about 3 to 4 feet of floss to clean my teeth.  About a third of the floss is only a fraction of the thickness it should be.  I don&#x27;t understand why Oral B sells a product with this problem.</li>
    <li> You need to have this in your bathroom. I will judge you if you don&#x27;t. This is a staple of dental hygiene, a must have. Accept no substitute.</li>
    <li> Clean teeth and healthy gums. They are the future.</li>
    <li> This stuff breaks and is worthless.  Get Colgate for the best.</li>
    <li> my dentist recommended it. Good!</li>
    <li> It performed well but caused my tongue and mouth to burn after using.</li>
    <li> Great for tight contact teeth! I used to never floss till I found this brand and it made it so less painful and actually somewhat pleasant. This floss led me to become a daily flosser.</li>
    <li> Unlike the older version this shreds much too easily.</li>
    <li> FYI, burns your gums a bit. Thought it was the same product I bought before but didn&#x27;t have that problem before.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle and glides so easily between the teeth! Effectively removed plaque and things stuck between! Saves time and effort during flossing.</li>
    <li> I always liked Glide dental floss and being able to purchase it in a large quantity on line is great.</li>
    <li> Very sad how they have ruined what was the premiere floss . . . as other posters have said, often you can&#x27;t even get it out of the container without it &amp;#34;pre-shredding.&amp;#34; I can only get my teeth flossed without it breaking maybe 50% of the time now, and often it breaks a couple of times before I finish.</li>
    <li> Floss is floss. Right? Not exactly. Who would have thought that pieces of string that you pull between your teeth could be so different in so many ways? And yet, it&#x27;s true.  After six decades of using floss and always searching for that extra special waxed string, I finally found THE ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best floss I have ever used. It is strong and smooth and truly glides between my very tightly packed teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I love the refreshing Cool Mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This floss is slightly more expensive than several other name brands and quite a bit more than store brands, but it is worth the extra cost. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Once you use floss like this, you will be spoiled, and not want to use traditional string-type floss again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very slippery, and the flat ribbon-like shape makes it effective and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Best floss i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> We have very &amp;#34;tight contacts&amp;#34; (very little space between teeth) and are always breaking floss.  When Glide first came out, it was like a miracle.  But I think the quality has gone down and we were breaking Glide a lot, too.  Tried one roll of this Glide Pro-Health from tge store and almost no breakage.  So I was very disappointed when we bought this 6 pack and the floss keeps breaking again.  Two rolls in and still having breakage issues.  So it&#x27;s better than regular floss, but not as good as Glide used to be.</li>
    <li> Best floss for me. Have to choose what works for you and your dental structure. Long-time user.</li>
    <li> The pack of six is excellent.  I have used the Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Cool Mint for a long time.</li>
    <li> Have been using this floss for years after switching from the standard, generic type.  This floss is miles better than \\&quot;string\\&quot;.  This seems like it would be plumbers tape or something.  :P  As said in a previous review, this floss hardly, if ever, shreds, is not too flavorful, slides easily, and actually aids in cleaning.  Great item.  I paid $20.37 for this item shipped.  Great price!</li>
    <li> This is a fairly excellent and righteous floss. I can&#x27;t bring myself to give it five stars because, well, we&#x27;re talking about floss here. Dental floss. Stars (and I&#x27;m thinking of the nuclear-furnace-space stars, not the yoo-hoos in Hollywood) and floss just don&#x27;t seem to mix well. At any rate, this is a nice handling floss, smooth and crisp tasting with its cool mint flavor that lingers in the mouth even after you&#x27;ve swished and expectorated. More people should floss, obviously, judging from all the bad breath in this country, and this is floss they can trust in.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss I use. It removes all the crud in between the teeth without shredding.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy anything else!</li>
    <li> Ordered this and only received one floss, not 6.</li>
    <li> I really like the durability of the product. It doesn&#x27;t break and I like the minty taste to it!</li>
    <li> I always choose Oral B Proglide or Glide. This floss is strong and comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss for me. Doesn&#x27;t fray and is thicker and feels smooth. Love the mint flavor, feels fresh.</li>
    <li> works as expected, arrived promptly</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of floss for years.  By ordering the 6-pack, I save a lot of money compared to buying one at a time at the local drug store.  This product is exactly what I wanted.  It came perfectly packaged and very promptly delivered.</li>
    <li> My teeth are tight in my mouth.  Most of them I can floss with cheap, waxed floss, but not ALL of them.  I consistently break the floss on sharp tooth edges, or get floss stuck between my teeth, which is REALLY a pain in the you-know-what!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This floss works fine for me with tight teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems a bit &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; to me, so I have to use more of it just to have enough extra floss to wrap around my fingers.  I find if I wet the floss before wrapping it around my fingers, I can get a better &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it slides in between my tight teeth just fine.  It does break once in a while, but breaks cleanly, without multiple fibers getting stuck in between my teeth.  I&#x27;d prefer it had just a bit more breaking strength to it, but it&#x27;s a lot better than the cheap waxed floss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally turned into a daily flosser thanks to this floss. It works great. Easy to get between tight teeth, Great flavor. Only issue is that it does break occasionally. I&#x27;d say about 1 in 5 times that I floss, it will rip. Could blame me for being too aggressive, but that&#x27;s not the case. Either way, I&#x27;d still recommend at least trying this stuff out.</li>
    <li> This floss is thinner than the &amp;#34;Pro Health&amp;#34; brand from Oral B (in a turquoise colored dispenser), and breaks when it encounters a tight spot between my teeth.  I&#x27;m very sorry that I bought several packages of this.</li>
    <li> Great dental floss. My teeth are close, and gets in between them well.  Other flosses tear.</li>
    <li> The product came in on time, the right product, and in good condition.  I am personally a fan of this particular brand of dental floss so glad we could find here on amazon and schedule a subscription on it.</li>
    <li> By far the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used. Very easy glide.</li>
    <li> Always loved this floss, it&#x27;s the best. It doesn&#x27;t hurt the gums and it goes smoothly between the teeth. I recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> If you have issues with breaking/shredding floss, you might want to get the original version that&#x27;s in the white plastic container.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best in its class! Smells good, cleans well, doesn&#x27;t snag on my teeth no matter how slim the space between is.</li>
    <li> If you have crowded teeth like I do, chances are you are already using this floss.  Or you don&#x27;t floss at all.  Don&#x27;t be that guy.  You need to floss, believe me, the dentist doesn&#x27;t just make that s*** up, it&#x27;s for real.  This aptly-named floss can get between even the most crowded of my teeth, providing a deep, minty clean feeling and earning me big-time kudos from my oral hygienist.</li>
    <li> Shreds right out of the package. This is the second shipment I&#x27;ve had with the same problem. Switching to a competitor.</li>
    <li> Good value. Always have floss on hand.</li>
    <li> Glide is the only floss I use as all the others are not as strong or smooth. That being said, the quality seemed better (e.g. thicker strands) before P&amp;G bought the company. For this reason, the Deep Clean version is the much preferred choice.</li>
    <li> For the past decade, I&#x27;ve had a popcorn kernel stuck in my lower right canine. It sat there, taunting me, poking and prodding my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all began in 1999, when I was at the AMC theaters seeing Star Wars Episode 1. Amazingly, that movie was not the worst thing that happened to me that day. A lone kernel, acting alone, chose to lodge itself in my gums. It has dug deep, and held on ever since - I tried everything to get rid of it: Metal pick, toothbrush, jackhammer, dynamite, and lesser &amp;#34;flosses&amp;#34;. Nothing could get rid of that infernal piece of grain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Clean Cool Mint Flavor Floss came long. A mere 1.3 seconds of flossing with this beast of a floss, and that infernal kernel was gone! I swear this stuff must be made of a gold/iron/cadmium blend to be so strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, now I miss my old friend. I miss the constant bleeding, and it&#x27;s almost as if I&#x27;ve lost my best friend of the past 15 years. What have you done to me!!!</li>
    <li> This floss is wonderful. It is not fraying at all. It is the best floss I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Works well, even with crowns in your mouth.  Fiber floss does not, waxed or not.</li>
    <li> Great dental floss! The floss will not snap while using it, nor does it shred between your teeth. Very smooth to use and effective. This is a great buy on it, too.</li>
    <li> Trial and error for floss seems to be the case nowadays. This is certainly my favorite. I love the minty taste and this is one of the few flosses that gets under my gums without causing pain. I have never had it rip on me and I treat it quite hard, especially when trying to reach my back teeth. I have been using this for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Best floss there is. No breakage, tearing. Cleans well and has minty flavor.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss.  I do feel like my teeth are much cleaner when I use it.  Like the name says, it glides easily between my teeth, no sticking or shredding.  The plastic container is small, compact and attractive.  The minty flavor is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> First used the original Glide Floss years ago when we went on holiday to the US.  Asked relatives on holidays to the US to bring some back.  Used it sparingly &amp; when we moved house found some hidden away.  Oh Why did I wait SO long to buy this product??!!  I love it.  Have to floss LOTS with food stuck in my teeth &amp; it was such a chore.  Don&#x27;t even mind flossing now - nearly like it!!  Dentist said to use unwaxed floss for better results but HATED it.  Kept breaking &amp; getting stuck &amp; then I&#x27;d be in panic mode.</li>
    <li> I only use Glide floss because it is thicker than most floss but easy to get through the teeth.  Price on Amazon is cheaper than buying them in the store locally.</li>
    <li> It never shredded when I used, fits between my teeth perfectly, and got a lot of plaque out after every use. I&#x27;m happy to pay the premium on this floss.</li>
    <li> This particular floss is good for my teeth, because as I have aged, my teeth have gotten tighter and tighter together. The deep clean was recommended by my dentist because of my periodontal problems.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite floss to use. It really gets in between the teeth and just a great job cleaning everything. Only complaint is that it is pricier than other floss but you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Pretty good deal! Best floss!</li>
    <li> Ordered this floss because it is very hard to get in the stores.  I like the fact that it is easy to get between my teeth as opposed to other brands. Will likely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Used to be my favorite floss but the quality seems to be going downhill.  It breaks or tears in the dispenser far more often than it when i used to buy it a couple years ago.</li>
    <li> I floss every day. Despite this, my dentist told me my gums were not healthy, and he recommended this floss. The floss is slightly wider than what I was using previously, but most importantly, it also has a slight texture to it. This not only does a better job of getting particles out, but it also stimulates the gums more than other floss I&#x27;ve tried. Not only did my subsequent visit to the dentist go well, but my mouth now feels much better too.</li>
    <li> Good Product. My favorite. Price is consistent with Sam&#x27;s Club.</li>
    <li> This is my floss of choice.  I hate flossing in general, especially when I use other flosses because they end up tearing in my teeth because I have tight contacts (due to not removing my wisdom teeth sooner causing some crowding).  Most flosses just tear up on me and get stuck in my teeth, sometimes I have to force it down, and end up hurting my gums, but with this floss, for the most part it glides between my teeth very easily.  Also after many months of usage, this floss has never torn/split on me.</li>
    <li> I have two teeth that are very close together, I have to floss everytime I eat as food ALWAYS gets trapped between them... due to their close proximity I also tend to shred most floss, this floss holds up well and will only fray maybe 1 out of every 30 flossings or so which is far better than any competing brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of floss because I hate anything between my teeth. I really liked the woven floss, but that was either discontinued or difficult to find at a reasonable price. I then switched to this &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; floss. It breaks off between teeth on several occasions. Not very sturdy. I&#x27;ll look for another brand. So far I tried the Listerine brand and that works well... does not break apart like the glide-type.</li>
    <li> So much better than regular floss.  Never shreds in your teeth!</li>
    <li> Since I switched to the cool mint flavor, I find I&#x27;m flossing every day.  The fact that it leaves my mouth feeling fresher is a definite incentive to do such a tedious &amp;#34;chore&amp;#34;!  I keep one in the car as well in case I need it!</li>
    <li> Great floss.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great floss - and most fragile.  Consistently breaks e v e r y  t i m e.</li>
    <li> The glide floss is by far my most favorite dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;It smoothly slides in between my gums with a silky feel and does not leave a waxy residue or flake apart in my mouth&lt;br /&gt;It is also gentle on my finger tips when they are wrapped around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;None that I can find.</li>
    <li> This floss works well. I purchase it on a regular basis. I will continue to purchase it, as I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Thinnest and strongest floss I&#x27;ve found, the only kind I like to use.  Flavor is a subtle and pleasant mint.</li>
    <li> Good job and recommended by my dentist!</li>
    <li> My favorite floss, glides between teeth really easility so you don&#x27;t get the hard snap on gums trying to get floss in there. This is about the only floss I ever use since I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
    <li> I love this dental floss.  It is superior to others I have used.</li>
    <li> The floss cleans between the teeth very well. It can be easily slide into the space between the gum and the teeth. Would recommend for others.</li>
    <li> This dental floss is worthless.  It shreds and breaks almost instantly upon contact with teeth!  I have thrown away gobs of this stuff, as I try to floss, and my piece breaks in two, then I try to continue with half the piece I started with, and it breaks too, and so forth!  Soooo frustrating.  While this floss does slip between easily, it is just not sturdy enough to come back out; the floss itself is a weak, stringy, plasticy substance -- you can pull it in two quite easily with your hands, in fact.  I will stay far away from this brand.</li>
    <li> I have problems with regular floss breaking on me and shredding to the point I quit flossing then my&lt;br /&gt;dentist recomended Glide floss and it works great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand having anything in my teeth for any length of time so I like to carry around some floss with me wherever I go. I&#x27;ve tried many products out there but Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean is the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> Snaps way too easily.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT. The best we all in ever used in  our life. We recommend it to anyone that likes a great product..</li>
    <li> This glide dental floss is the very best there is on the market. It glides between the teeth so easily and doesn&#x27;t get hung up and split like some of the other makes do. Thank you Amazon for having these wonderful losses.</li>
    <li> Best floss ever, they are thick and strong.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand we are using now - it&#x27;s hard to go back to any other types once you get spoiled with the good quality!</li>
    <li> BY FAR OUR FAVORITE FLOSS AND LOVE THAT THEY ARE A SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE ITEM!</li>
    <li> This is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.  My son told me about it and I tried it for myself it glides through your teeth and no more getting stuck in hard to get in places.  It&#x27;s a little prices but Amazon has a good deal!</li>
    <li> I used to think flossing had to be painful and just not enjoyable but this changed it for me. Seriously, this stuff is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I have just two things to say about this floss:  1) I can&#x27;t believe I only just now discovered it.  2) I will never go back to using regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ask why, it&#x27;s that this is simply a superior product to regular dental floss.  It is kind of like a thin ribbon, rather than a string.  As such, it is much easier to use, and seems to be much more effective at picking up the gunk between and under your teeth.</li>
    <li> The ONLY dental floss.</li>
    <li> Best floss ever. I would never let anything else grace the sides of my teeth ever again. This is heaven compared to other flosses - goes in smoothly, comes out smoothly. I love it so much I had to buy this 6 pack off Amazon.</li>
    <li> Compared to standard glide this floss breaks much more easily.</li>
    <li> This GLIDE &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; floss is the best of the GLIDE line-up of floss products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; variety has a very slight texture that grabs that unspeakable gunk and pulls it out from between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ran out of this, and I had to use another variety of GLIDE floss that was not the &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; type... and it was very disappointing and far less effective.  I immediately purchased a bulk pack of this &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; variety.</li>
    <li> This is a smooth, silky yet firm floss that can move easily between even the tightest spaces.  The light mint taste is lovely. Even if you don&#x27;t like flossing, this is a gentle tape that might make you willing to do it regularly.  I consider it by far the best brand on the market.</li>
    <li> These floss are the best.  They fit well between my teeth.  I don&#x27;t need to use these since my teeth are not straightened but for those who&#x27;s teeth aren&#x27;t, these should make it easier to floss.</li>
    <li> I have very tight teeth and this is the only floss that will work on my teeth.  My mouth feels amazing when I&#x27;m done</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of flossing.  Oh, I do it, but I always hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, I actually don&#x27;t mind flossing, which will be better for me in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the name states, the floss glides easily over and between your teeth, but it is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate gums, if you are prone to bleeding.  Additionally, it does not cut into your fingers the way a traditional string floss will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall result is that you may be more willing to floss, as the negative effects and pain of ordinary floss are significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging claims that the surface of the floss acts to \\&quot;grip\\&quot; particles of food and remove them better, and I can&#x27;t say if this is true, but as a person who doesn&#x27;t enjoy flossing, I can honestly say this makes me more willing to floss more frequently.</li>
