      <li>Felt great going on, but I could never get a smooth application.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use your own moisturizers plus this.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the best coverage, and isn&#x27;t great as a concealer, but overall, I like it</li>
      <li>The color is good for the winter, but now in summer - it&#x27;s too light</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and filled with antioxidants that leave your skin feeling gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I do not think I will use it again after paying a great deal for the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing yet doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the fine lines of your face (if you have them!)</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this!!!!!!</li>
      <li>The cream is whipped and very light when on, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, which makes up for the price you pay.  </li>
      <li>This is the best foundation out of many that I have tried over the years including Origins, and other good products.  </li>
      <li>Smells okay,</li>
      <li>One of my favorite skincare products.</li>
      <li>I used before the gym, light coverage, but nice color and texture.</li>
      <li>Going organic then this line is for you. :)</li>
      <li>I love the Eminence line.</li>
      <li>Love that it protects my face from sun damage.</li>
      <li>so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rated a 6 on a scale of 0-10 (0 safe, 10 Toxic).</li>
      <li>but I love that this is a lighter version of foundation for the summer.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite tinted moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It has a naturally healthy, dewy glow.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; doesn&#x27;t break your skin out!</li>
      <li>I have used many products with sunscreen and my face will break out every time.</li>
      <li>What could be better?</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>This tinted moisturizer covers so well that I use it as foundation and just add powder on top.</li>
      <li>my favorite face covering.  </li>
      <li>Love the Eminence product line, didn&#x27;t like this product.  </li>
      <li>It seems that ingredient is found in most all cosmetics and hair color products even though it can cause adverse health problems: &amp;#34;endocrine disruptor that mimics estrogen and can disrupt thyroid function&amp;#34;, so says The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics on their website.  </li>
      <li>My skin is amazing and it looks great bare.</li>
      <li>love the coverage and how easy it goes on.  </li>
      <li>i would have more control mixing it right there with my own.</li>
      <li>the eminence line is a good clean consistent product and i am glad that  i can find it on amazon</li>
      <li>I love the product it offers good coverage and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>
      <li>Provides some coverage, but great when paired with bare minerals!</li>
      <li>and I feel like it&#x27;s taking very good care of my skin for the long term.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that it looks best when applied lightly with a foundation brush, blot lightly with a tissue if needed, then follow with a light dusting of Jane Iredale loose powder.</li>
      <li>I like the product, but the color is too light for my skin, which is medium toned</li>
      <li>The Vanilla Latte Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 25 is a great daily moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It blends on the skin with light to medium coverage with no &amp;#34;jaw line&amp;#34; for others to notice.  </li>
      <li>too light and no coverage at all</li>
      <li>I think $20-$25 would be a more fair price in comparison to how long the bottle lasts if you use it every day.  </li>
      <li>This product is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t mind the weird substance, this tinted moisturizer smells lovely and provides light, flawless coverage.</li>
      <li>and I loved the color (I have Irish completion) and the feel of the product on my face.  </li>
      <li>I can understand how easily they made the jump from toiletries to cosmetics seeing first hand how brand loyal women are with these two markets, but I hope they focus on skincare.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to find Eminence products on Amazon for a reasonable price (compared to day spa prices where I initially purchased this brand).  </li>
      <li>This product I tried during the transition and doesn&#x27;t have great coverage and felt slightly greasy on my face.</li>
      <li>Looks very natural and smells lovely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of greasy, and a heavier coverage than i want in a moisturizer - I think it would be better if it was a little lighter consistency.</li>
      <li>The entire eminence line is fabulous, but this is one of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Perfect tinted moisturizer and actually provides some coverage compared to other tinted moisturizers on the market.  </li>
      <li>According to the EWG, there is \\&quot;strong evidence\\&quot; that this ingredient is a human endocrine disruptor and easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and has made my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>Very gentle &amp; covers flaws very well!</li>
      <li>something about the combo makes it feel more generic.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
      <li>My first time with this product</li>
      <li>This is one of the only tinted moisturizers I have been able to use with out breaking out.</li>
      <li>My new regular makeup: smooth, light, covers well, and no scary ingredients.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is sweet and natural smelling not like a chemical.</li>
      <li>, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the crap that most cosmetics products have, it smells nice, and the sunscreen is effective.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of my favorite skincare products. This is my go to on the weekends when I just want a little coverage. Gives my skin a  youthful look but doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy. I usually drive over an hour to a spa to buy it...so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have used many products with sunscreen and my face will break out every time. This product is the complete opposite, my skin looks and feels healthier. The fragrance is sweet and natural smelling not like a chemical. The tint blends perfectly. I only wish it came in a bigger size. I use it with the mineral powder which is also a great product.</li>
    <li> love the coverage and how easy it goes on.  I use it under my foundation powder and its perfect for no make up days!  the spf is an added bonus!!</li>
    <li> Great sun protection and quality. Only tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ll use! Provides some coverage, but great when paired with bare minerals!</li>
    <li> Been using it for several years. Love it</li>
    <li> Love the feel and all over coverage - no more than a pea size serving for the face!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have always like Eminence products but was very disappointed with this one. It was very dry and felt chalky on my skin. Unfortunately, I do not think I will use it again after paying a great deal for the product.</li>
    <li> I like the coverage and the overall dewy effect it has on my skin, but the smell  is too strong for me and I&#x27;m not usually sensitive to smells.</li>
    <li> too light and no coverage at all</li>
    <li> This is the perfect color for me.  It is a tinted moisturizer but it covers well and lasts all day.  I love the Eminence line.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Perfect tinted moisturizer and actually provides some coverage compared to other tinted moisturizers on the market.  Every time I wear it people say that my skin looks radiant!!  I do find that I still have to wear moisturizer underneath it for it to blend well but I love that this is a lighter version of foundation for the summer.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Works really great on my dry/sensitive skin.  Smells really great too.  The color is perfect and blends right in.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer, leaves skin beautiful and smells amazing. I used before the gym, light coverage, but nice color and texture.Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Really thick and hard to use.  I had to add face lotion to this in order to actually use it.  Ended up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> Another fabulous Eminence product, this one was recommended by the person who did my facial.  I wanted a foundation that was non-toxic, SPF, moisturizer and provided some coverage.  It blends on the skin with light to medium coverage with no &amp;#34;jaw line&amp;#34; for others to notice.  This is the best foundation out of many that I have tried over the years including Origins, and other good products.  You can order sample sizes from other sites.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels like it seals your pores up completely -- or like you have a gross film over your skin. I&#x27;m used to much lighter tinted moisturizers -  that&#x27;s why I use them instead of foundation makeup -- because they&#x27;re lighter. This isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s really thick and has a terribly strong scent that I didn&#x27;t enjoy either. My skin started breaking out almost immediately after using. I hate to spend so much money on something and then not use it -- but it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Love the Eminence product line, didn&#x27;t like this product.  Very disappointed.  It smells great.  Felt great going on, but I could never get a smooth application.  I have very light skin (fair, red hair and freckles) and this shade was too dark with yellow undertones for my skin.  I still keep it in my drawer with the hopes that I can figure out a way to make it work for my skin.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price per ounce, but this is a great product.  I&#x27;m happy to find Eminence products on Amazon for a reasonable price (compared to day spa prices where I initially purchased this brand).  The Vanilla Latte Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 25 is a great daily moisturizer.  The cream is whipped and very light when on, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, which makes up for the price you pay.  The color is not heavy, so it will not looked caked on, but helps to blend uneven skin tones and helps to hide trouble spots.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tinted moisturizer.  I wish it was cheaper, because I use it every day.  It smoothens out my skin, adds a little color and a dewy glow to my skin, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  I wear it alone or under my loose cover up powder.  It evens out my skin and no one can tell I have anything on.  Love it!  I just wish it weren&#x27;t overpriced, but after wearing this I can&#x27;t go back.  I use it in areas that react from shaving  and it helps to soothe my skin. I think $20-$25 would be a more fair price in comparison to how long the bottle lasts if you use it every day.  I usually get 1 1/2 - 2 months use out of it.</li>
    <li> Best makeup! Looks very natural and smells lovely.</li>
    <li> I love the healing quality of this tinted moisturizer!  It&#x27;s really helped calm a mild dermatitis recently. I&#x27;ve found that it looks best when applied lightly with a foundation brush, blot lightly with a tissue if needed, then follow with a light dusting of Jane Iredale loose powder. The scent is very nice too.</li>
    <li> my favorite face covering.  neutral color, smells good and is a concealer as well as having SPF.  the eminence line is a good clean consistent product and i am glad that  i can find it on amazon</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation on the market! It&#x27;s light &amp; doesn&#x27;t break your skin out! Very gentle &amp; covers flaws very well! It even has SPF built in! Love this product!</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, for my skin tone, broke me out!</li>
    <li> If you want to look made up fast this is the product for you. It lasts and it looks good!</li>
    <li> Really covers dark circles</li>
    <li> My new regular makeup: smooth, light, covers well, and no scary ingredients.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and has made my skin so soft. Love that it protects my face from sun damage.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s moisturizing yet doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the fine lines of your face (if you have them!)</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is the one tinted moisturizer that actually evens out my rosacea- prone skin.  BUT, I am really bummed to lean that it contains Octinoxate.  It seems that ingredient is found in most all cosmetics and hair color products even though it can cause adverse health problems: &amp;#34;endocrine disruptor that mimics estrogen and can disrupt thyroid function&amp;#34;, so says The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics on their website.  Eminence: is there some other SAFE ingredient that can be used for UV protection??</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to order a tinted SPF because all previous ones I&#x27;ve purchased at drug stores have been terrible.. They  made my skin oily, and face appear cakey with any make-up... However, being a fan of all eminence products I&#x27;ve tried, I decided to give it a shot. Being 33 I&#x27;m at the age where heavy make-up settles into fine lines.. This product is light and absorbs quickly. No problem applying powder over, and I wear another moisturizer under it.. So I&#x27;m replacing my foundation with this. It blends great with my pale white skin, and adds just a hint of needed color.</li>
    <li> Buying it second time. Live it! Works as a moisturizer, toner and SPF! Doesn&#x27;t cause irritation And skin inflammation! Would recommend</li>
    <li> The only other foundation I like lately is the Naked line by Urban Decay. This tinted moisturizer covers so well that I use it as foundation and just add powder on top. My skin is so soft and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams and this product is above and beyond any of them. It has very nice coverage and is also a sunscreen. What could be better? I put two pumps on the back of my hand and blend it in with a brush. I used to get dry and flaky with other foundations. I don&#x27;t at all with this one. Yay! A miracle!</li>
    <li> Since first ordering eminence products about two years ago, my completion has improved so much that I went from caked on foundations applied multiple times a day, to this vanilla tinted moisturizer, to just mineral powders. My skin is amazing and it looks great bare. This product I tried during the transition and doesn&#x27;t have great coverage and felt slightly greasy on my face. Don&#x27;t use your own moisturizers plus this. Honestly I didn&#x27;t care much for this product, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect from a tinted moisturizer with spf, i kinda was left with the same feelings i have with shampoo and conditioner in one,  I wouldn&#x27;t spend 30 bucks on a shampoo + conditioner, something about the combo makes it feel more generic. Because it&#x27;s really all about the ritual of our morning routines that make us feel ready for the day. We spend so much on these eminence products if i really need to cut my foundations thinner i would have more control mixing it right there with my own. I can understand how easily they made the jump from toiletries to cosmetics seeing first hand how brand loyal women are with these two markets, but I hope they focus on skincare.</li>
    <li> My first time with this product and I loved the color (I have Irish completion) and the feel of the product on my face.  It leaves a natural look.  I don&#x27;t usually spend this amount on my foundation so I&#x27;ll have to figure if it fits in my budget but I&#x27;d definitely buy it again if I can.  Will see how long  a bottle lasts me before I decide. K</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! The smell is great and it&#x27;s not oily at all! Have replaced my powder foundation with this!</li>
    <li> Would be an excellent product if it wasn&#x27;t for the very strong smell.  Great ingredients, color, and coverage.</li>
    <li> I like this tinted moisturizer a lot. It doesn&#x27;t get clumpy after a long day, and it looks very natural. It doesn&#x27;t have the best coverage, and isn&#x27;t great as a concealer, but overall, I like it, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the crap that most cosmetics products have, it smells nice, and the sunscreen is effective. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Update: I couldn&#x27;t change my rating from 5 stars to 1 this time around. I&#x27;ve been researching the ingredients in this tinted moisturizer and it has \\&quot;Octinoxate\\&quot;. According to the EWG, there is \\&quot;strong evidence\\&quot; that this ingredient is a human endocrine disruptor and easily absorbs into the skin. It&#x27;s rated a 6 on a scale of 0-10 (0 safe, 10 Toxic). What is up with that Eminence? Makes me sad I have to start doing my homework on the ingredients in my beloved Eminence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the weird substance, this tinted moisturizer smells lovely and provides light, flawless coverage.</li>
    <li> Smells okay, texture is fine, a little dark for me for winter. Maybe better for the summer times if you are as pale as me.</li>
    <li> I am 45, very active outdoors in all weather, and have never worn foundation--and seldom wear sunblock. After admiring a friend&#x27;s complexion the last several years and discovering she uses the Eminence line, I decided to give it a try. I can&#x27;t believe how good my skin looks! It has a naturally healthy, dewy glow. It doesn&#x27;t look heavily made up and more importantly to me, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavily made up. Using organic products in everything I do is critical to me, so this line meets that need and gives me everything I want in one product. And their customer service is outstanding! I queried them to find out what to use and how to apply it and they actually got back to me right away with questions to understand my specific skin care better. It&#x27;s good stuff and I feel like it&#x27;s taking very good care of my skin for the long term.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of greasy, and a heavier coverage than i want in a moisturizer - I think it would be better if it was a little lighter consistency. The color is good for the winter, but now in summer - it&#x27;s too light so i mix it with a little powdered bronzer. Not at all what I expected from Eminence.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but the color is too light for my skin, which is medium toned</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light and filled with antioxidants that leave your skin feeling gorgeous. It is well worth the purchase for glowing skin that lasts even after the product is washed off with the other products in the line. After only a month of use Eminence delivered clearer skin than I have ever had with other products. Going organic then this line is for you. :)</li>
    <li> This is one of the only tinted moisturizers I have been able to use with out breaking out. The entire eminence line is fabulous, but this is one of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, good price</li>
    <li> I love the product it offers good coverage and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out. It also smells amazing! The only downfall is it is expensive!</li>
