<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this for the auto shut off feature alone.  I have this paranoid fear that I&#x27;ll leave it on and burn down my house or worse, my kitty.  I bought this because it has a 30 minute auto shut off and that feature was more important to me than anything else.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it&#x27;s also a great flat iron!  I own a Chi and a T3 and never use either one.  The straightening power is great and the temperature control let&#x27;s me use just as much heat as necessary.  When I went into my salon a few days ago, they had coincidentally switched over to the Croc as well!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this product to me after my old flat iron took it&#x27;s last breath.  When this one dies, I will by another Croc.  I had this super fast.</li>
    <li> Heat&#x27;s up quick, Delivers a Nice Press in good tim, Functional as for Hand/Wrist Manipulation, Over all great Product. Used in Salon and on and Off all day Long. Delivers On the Performance.  I love mine!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my gal uses on my hair at the salon and I got it a a fraction of the price on Amazon.  It really is an amazing iron, and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Great flat iron..its small but does the trick.. spend the extra money it is worth it..will only buy croc from now on.</li>
    <li> I bought this Croc 3/4&amp;#34; flat iron to curl my hair. I have thick and frizzy hair and it does exactly what I hoped it would do. It&#x27;s easy of use and I like the different setting of temps and also the auto shut off. I have tendency to rush in the morning and to forget to turn my flat iron off. This gives me peace of mind. I love it!</li>
    <li> Sleek design, love the green color&lt;br /&gt;Went from 1&amp;#34; to 3/4&amp;#34;, love the smaller size&lt;br /&gt;Auto-off&lt;br /&gt;Temp change&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> The auto-shutoff isn&#x27;t exactly the type I was looking for, but it is fail-safe  in the end.  The best kind of auto-shutoff is the one that gives you options of 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes worth of ironing time...My old one was like that...  The styling you can accomplish with the Croc is fantastic, however...it leaves your hair silky...and as someone with naturally curly hair, I have to say this one is perfect for getting your hair almost like cornsilk.</li>
    <li> Great for straightening hair, but after one year of light use (about once a week)  the plates become loose and hang off the iron. Dangerous and frustrating.  This is the second one that has done the same thing in almost exactly one year</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 2.5 years and while I do not use it every day, it is still going strong!  it really seals my hair when i do flat iron to keep out the moisture... i have naturally curly hair and this somewhat course... i do use styling products (S factor line) that gives an added &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; if you will. .</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. My favorite feature is that you can set your temperature according to your hair&#x27;s needs. The irons are super smooth and glide easily through hair. I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for two years and if something were to happen to it-I&#x27;d buy the same exact one again!</li>
    <li> This blast iron is the best one around. I am a busy hair dresser and I do several keratin trearmentsnwhich I need a professional flat iron for, so I it obviously gets a lot of use. The size makes it very easy to manipulate, and it have a variety of temperature settings. Worth the $.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who leaves flat irons on and then goes out.  So to avoid fires I thought this would be great.  She likes it very much!</li>
    <li> Works great and i love it! Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to! Will recommend it to a friend for sure.</li>
    <li> I needed a straightener that was not too big (I was using a 1&amp;#34; flat iron and it was too wide) as I have short hair.  I decided on the 3/4&amp;#34; size and was very glad I did.  I really love this flat iron; I like the temperature control feature and it&#x27;s easy to use.  It was reasonably priced and works better than a popular brand I had been using.  I would definitely recommend this product to others, they won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the Auto Off feature, but am very pleased with the total product.  I really like the ability to adjust the temp setting.  It shows you the actual temp, not just an approximation on a dial.  Works great! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron.  Recommended by my hair stylist as it is the one the shop uses.  The price on Amazon was significantly cheaper than the price the shop is selling it for.  It is very easy to handle and heats quickly.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this flat iron, I absolutely LOVED it! I have very long, very thick, frizzy, thick hair with an awful &#x27;80s-type half-wave, half-curl. This straightens hair well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it makes my hair sometimes very static-y so that it&#x27;s extremely annoying. It does the same with my daughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when it SEEMS to be heated up, if I start doing my hair (straightening or curling it with this flat iron), I notice that the 2nd half of my hair that I do gets done and holds the straightness/curl much faster -- it seems that it keeps heating up slightly as I go and that&#x27;s why this happens. This isn&#x27;t a big deal though, I just wait a few more minutes after it SEEMS to be at the right heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 2 years and it still works well. I hope that I can find one that helps my hair not get so static-y though!</li>
    <li> First of all, this straightener is awesome. This is the one my hairdresses uses it, and she sells it too (for more money than I bought it for here).&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I am the type of person that constantly forgets to turn off my straightener (and constantly wonder if I&#x27;ve done it). Since this straightener turns itself off after awhile, I never have to worry.</li>
    <li> Croc makes wonderful products.  It heats up fast and is easy to use. Has high temperature and auto turn off.</li>
    <li> This Flat iorn was an upgrade from my pervious Croc Iorn that was broken.&lt;br /&gt;OMG!!! This iron is amazing!!!! Heats up Fast!!! I love the temp. control and the auto shutoff is so awesome!!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> i swear by croc irons  in my salon. I lpve the floating plates and titanium finish  makes  smoothing  and straightening hair a breeze</li>
