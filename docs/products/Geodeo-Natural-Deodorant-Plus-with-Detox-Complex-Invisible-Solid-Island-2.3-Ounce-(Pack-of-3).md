### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but I am very happy with this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I liked it!!</li>
      <li>smells great, but does not work well.  </li>
      <li>great candy like smell</li>
      <li>Great scent for ladies and girls</li>
      <li>Great scent but</li>
      <li>The Ocean scent was too manly, but the Island was nice!</li>
      <li>( so yes it smells good for maybe twenty minutes then comes on the sweat and stink.</li>
      <li>They keep the bacteria that cause the B.O. smell from growing, and work surprisingly well for just being a chunk of salt.</li>
      <li>This smells good</li>
      <li>The best thing, totally worth it to be saving your body and mind (think Alzheimer&#x27;s) from aluminum.</li>
      <li>I received this for free and I loved it!  </li>
      <li>Wanted to love this product!</li>
      <li>Love the scent, too!</li>
      <li>Some people say that geodeo doesn&#x27;t work as well for them when they exercise or sweat profusely on really hot days, but it works perfect for me!</li>
      <li>I love the smell!</li>
      <li>you will be pleased with the results!</li>
      <li>A worthwhile purchase!</li>
      <li>This one smells amazing, doesn’t irritate my skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;goopy or wet&amp;#34; after applying.</li>
      <li>What a huge difference!  </li>
      <li>(I use a bit of powder over the top as I&#x27;m used to paste deodorant not gel).</li>
      <li>NOPE, not any better, so time to try something else.</li>
      <li>But for 8 hours of a regular day, it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Why is it that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant products leave you smelling au naturel?</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about a month now and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I was glad I could find it online.</li>
      <li>so I can be sure to have it around.</li>
      <li>So I decided to try this one, which at the time I read pretty good reviews.</li>
      <li>When I first started using it, for probably a couple of months, I would have given it close to a 5 star, as I didn&#x27;t seem to smell like I did with the others and it has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>smell of this is a light, sweet fruit punchy that I love.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fine.</li>
      <li>Natural enzymes eat away at order causing germs, the smell of the product is light a pleasant.</li>
      <li>The smell is awesome and love how it doesn&#x27;t leave deaoderant behind on the skin.</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s works far better than this did for me!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find deodorant without aluminum and junk in it and this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Such a shame since it smells so good</li>
      <li>This deodorant is gentle on my skin and keeps me smelling great all day long.</li>
      <li>This is the first one that lasted for 12 hours and didn&#x27;t cause underarm irritation!  </li>
      <li>My hubby is not crazy about it</li>
      <li>Lovely smell, good natural ingredients, decent price, did not last.</li>
      <li>In the morning if you aren&#x27;t jumping right in the shower, reapply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing, keeps you fresh and dry</li>
      <li>I was really excited because the first day it worked really well, no smell.</li>
      <li>It goes on clear and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Glad to have my daughter starting out on the right foot with this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and then when I end my day with a hot yoga class</li>
      <li>Even on hot, hot days it works.</li>
      <li>Definitely works and will buy more.</li>
      <li>maybe I just needed a new one to be fresh or something.</li>
      <li>but didn&#x27;t seem to work all that well at keeping odor completely away and were \\&quot;wet\\&quot; when applying anyway, which I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often do intense exercise, I just maybe swim or do yoga.</li>
      <li>so I picked one up at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>I live in Central Florida where its hot and humid for many months, but this natural product works better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>so I thought if I bought a second container (original almost out)</li>
      <li>I prefer natural products when I can get them, but generally from both personal experience and the experiences of friends and family, most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants just don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product to anyone looking to reduce their exposure to harmful chemicals.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect it to keep me from sweating, as that is a natural way for the body to remove toxins, but I just want something non toxic to keep us from stinking!!</li>
      <li>Skeptic, at first, as to how well a non-anti-perspirant deodorant could actually work.</li>
      <li>I liked the idea behind this deodorant and it had decent reviews</li>
      <li>In summary--This deodorant really works and it feels just like regular deodorant (not slimy or sticky).  </li>
      <li>Over the years I keep moving to natural products and finding a natural deodorant was part of that.  </li>
      <li>but I tried it for a week and no matter how much I put on it was the same thing.</li>
      <li>I have been using natural deodorants for years.  </li>
      <li>So far I like this product....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not cheap but worth it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular brand for several months and just bought a 3-pack</li>
      <li>I had used 2 other natural deodorants, Thai Crystal spray and Naturally Fresh roll on (after trying several others that didn&#x27;t work at all) and they were o.k.</li>
      <li>I saw this product on a review site and they said the all natural product actually works, but if you sweat a lot, it does not work .</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re set on a natural product that actually works, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
      <li>I ordered a bunch of natural deodorants, the only one that worked for me is the Lavanila Coconut/ vanilla scented.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used expensive products and other natural ones never got results this good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s slightly sticky feeling at first, and I found that I have to apply it twice a day on &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; days.  </li>
      <li>This one leaves a slight wetness when you first put it on but found it works on my odor.  </li>
      <li>The only natural deodorant product I&#x27;ve used that has ever worked for me are those salt crystal ones sold under various names and brands.</li>
      <li>It also lasts longer than I thought--almost two days--so you&#x27;re not in trouble if you don&#x27;t put it on first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>I tested it the usual way-put it on right after showering before bed, woke up in the morning, and checked for B.O.</li>
      <li>But I decided to give it another shot after reading again about how bad deodorants with chemicals are for you and after seeing good reviews for this product.  </li>

<li> I feel the trade out of applying it twice a day versus not having all the artificial chemicals in it makes it well worth it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a loyal customer for life.  </li>

<li> I was skeptical about the ability if these natural deodorants to work.  </li>
<li> After awhile, we both started having trouble going through each day without getting that BO smell.</li>
<li> Some days seem to be worse than others, but still having trouble even if not doing anything outside and sweating a lot.</li>
<li> But then the second day it failed half way through my Shift.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried countless natural deodorants and this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or made me smell terrible!</li>
<li> All the little bumps that I hadve from the clogging effects of the antiperspirant were gone!  </li>
<li> Threw away my secret, my dove and all other deodorants.  </li>
<li> I never need to reapply unless I&#x27;ve been going hard at the gym or something, in which case I&#x27;m probably showering again as well.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for a month and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> smells great, but does not work well.  I saw this product on a review site and they said the all natural product actually works, but if you sweat a lot, it does not work .</li>
    <li> does not work at all, I might as well not use deodorant, not a pleasant smell either. I ordered a bunch of natural deodorants, the only one that worked for me is the Lavanila Coconut/ vanilla scented. It&#x27;s not cheap but worth it!</li>
    <li> I liked the idea behind this deodorant and it had decent reviews so I picked one up at Whole Foods. The Ocean scent was too manly, but the Island was nice! Unfortunately, this is the worst natural deodorant I have ever tried. It lasted maybe an hour and I could smell myself! I was at work and kept my arms down because I hadn&#x27;t brought backup- big mistake! Tom&#x27;s works far better than this did for me! Bottom line: Lovely smell, good natural ingredients, decent price, did not last.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this product! Great scent but only worked for a few hours. By the end of the day I could hardly stand myself! I smell less using no deodorant! :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and absolutely love it. I have tried probably close to 10 other brands and have always gone back to other conventional deodorants. This one smells amazing, doesn’t irritate my skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;goopy or wet&amp;#34; after applying. It is not a 100% comparable to traditional antiperspirants, but I have found applying it AM&amp;PM has solved any residual body odor issues. I feel the trade out of applying it twice a day versus not having all the artificial chemicals in it makes it well worth it.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product....it is working....sometimes in the summer, you are going to sweat no matter what you do, and when it is like that you just don&#x27;t want to smell. This product seems to be helping meet that goal!</li>
    <li> Skeptic, at first, as to how well a non-anti-perspirant deodorant could actually work. It&#x27;s amazing, keeps you fresh and dry (I use a bit of powder over the top as I&#x27;m used to paste deodorant not gel). The best thing, totally worth it to be saving your body and mind (think Alzheimer&#x27;s) from aluminum.</li>
    <li> Great scent for ladies and girls and it works well.  I have been using this for a long time. My hubby is not crazy about it but it works for me.</li>
    <li> I love the smell! I was really excited because the first day it worked really well, no smell. But then the second day it failed half way through my Shift. I realized that it worked so well the first day because I hardly sweated at all due to no physical activity. If you sweat a lot then don&#x27;t bother with this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I can put it on it the morning before I go to work and then when I end my day with a hot yoga class still no odor I&#x27;ve used expensive products and other natural ones never got results this good. My husband now uses it and has the same results after working outside all day-awesome product</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome and love how it doesn&#x27;t leave deaoderant behind on the skin. Definitely works and will buy more.</li>
    <li> great candy like smell and it does what it says! no irritation either given how sensitive i am too ingredients usually</li>
    <li> I bought this at Meijer before they stopped selling it. I was glad I could find it online. Some people say that geodeo doesn&#x27;t work as well for them when they exercise or sweat profusely on really hot days, but it works perfect for me! I don&#x27;t often do intense exercise, I just maybe swim or do yoga. Even on hot, hot days it works. Maybe I don&#x27;t sweat much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this is a light, sweet fruit punchy that I love. I wish the fruit smell lasted longer, but as long as it keeps me from stinking I&#x27;m fine. It goes on clear and is easy to use. It&#x27;s hard to find deodorant without aluminum and junk in it and this is perfect. I will definitely keep buying it</li>
    <li> I had used 2 other natural deodorants, Thai Crystal spray and Naturally Fresh roll on (after trying several others that didn&#x27;t work at all) and they were o.k. but didn&#x27;t seem to work all that well at keeping odor completely away and were \\&quot;wet\\&quot; when applying anyway, which I&#x27;m not crazy about. So I decided to try this one, which at the time I read pretty good reviews. When I first started using it, for probably a couple of months, I would have given it close to a 5 star, as I didn&#x27;t seem to smell like I did with the others and it has a nice scent. I bought this scent for me and the ocean for my son who was 12 at the time. After awhile, we both started having trouble going through each day without getting that BO smell. Some days seem to be worse than others, but still having trouble even if not doing anything outside and sweating a lot. (summertime was worse). I can no longer use this without usually applying at least twice/day even after I apply it liberally after my shower! I don&#x27;t expect it to keep me from sweating, as that is a natural way for the body to remove toxins, but I just want something non toxic to keep us from stinking!! Sometimes I feel like I can smell BO only after an hour of using it. Even my husband recently made a comment to me telling me he didn&#x27;t want to hurt my feelings but he didn&#x27;t think my deodorant was working. So initially this seemed to work so I thought if I bought a second container (original almost out) maybe I just needed a new one to be fresh or something. NOPE, not any better, so time to try something else.</li>
    <li> This smells good I liked it!! My friend raved about it it and all it&#x27;s benefits , so of course I bought a three pack /:( so yes it smells good for maybe twenty minutes then comes on the sweat and stink. Ugh!!! I just wish it lasted longer, or if you use this should I keep it on me at all times to reapply all day??!</li>
    <li> And that lasts for about 10 - 20 minutes then you stink.  Such a shame since it smells so good but I tried it for a week and no matter how much I put on it was the same thing.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the ability if these natural deodorants to work.  I had tried a few in the past that I bought at Whole Foods and other like-minded stores.  But I decided to give it another shot after reading again about how bad deodorants with chemicals are for you and after seeing good reviews for this product.  In summary--This deodorant really works and it feels just like regular deodorant (not slimy or sticky).  It also lasts longer than I thought--almost two days--so you&#x27;re not in trouble if you don&#x27;t put it on first thing in the morning.</li>
    <li> Why is it that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant products leave you smelling au naturel? I prefer natural products when I can get them, but generally from both personal experience and the experiences of friends and family, most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants just don&#x27;t work. Still, I bought this product on a whim, because I wanted to see if the &amp;#34;odor neutralizing enzymes&amp;#34; in it truly worked. I tested it the usual way-put it on right after showering before bed, woke up in the morning, and checked for B.O. It didn&#x27;t work at all! In fact, the slight smell of the deodorant, which smells quite nice in the stick, mixes with the smell of the B.O. to combine into an even worse smell! I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant before too, same problem, not only did it not prevent the B.O., it added to it! The only natural deodorant product I&#x27;ve used that has ever worked for me are those salt crystal ones sold under various names and brands. They keep the bacteria that cause the B.O. smell from growing, and work surprisingly well for just being a chunk of salt. I can&#x27;t imagine how Geodeo is supposed to be a deodorant for running around during the day when it can&#x27;t even inhibit bacteria growth at night, when you&#x27;re not even sweating. If you&#x27;re set on a natural product that actually works, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> (wife of account holder writing) - This is the first natural deodorant that actually works) and doesn&#x27;t give me a terrible rash after a few days of using it. I will say that after the gym, reapply. After 8 hours, reapply. In the morning if you aren&#x27;t jumping right in the shower, reapply. But for 8 hours of a regular day, it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless natural deodorants and this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or made me smell terrible! This deodorant is gentle on my skin and keeps me smelling great all day long. I never need to reapply unless I&#x27;ve been going hard at the gym or something, in which case I&#x27;m probably showering again as well. I&#x27;ve been using this particular brand for several months and just bought a 3-pack so I can be sure to have it around. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Glad to have my daughter starting out on the right foot with this stuff.  Natural enzymes eat away at order causing germs, the smell of the product is light a pleasant.</li>
    <li> After realizing that my armpits were literally coated and caked from my antiperspirant, I decided that all those chemicals weren&#x27;t doing me any favors.  I was at a friends house, and noticed Geodeo on the counter in the bathroom.  Being nosy, I read the info on the container, and decided that I should try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product takes some getting used to if you have only used an antiperspirant.  It&#x27;s slightly sticky feeling at first, and I found that I have to apply it twice a day on &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; days.  That being said, after about a week I noticed a definite improvement in the appearance of my underarms.  All the little bumps that I hadve from the clogging effects of the antiperspirant were gone!  What a huge difference!  I also believe that my body has adapted to it, since i only have to apply it once during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to reduce their exposure to harmful chemicals.  Allow yourself that 1 - 2 weeks adjustment period...you will be pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I have been using natural deodorants for years.  This is the first one that lasted for 12 hours and didn&#x27;t cause underarm irritation!  Thank you!  Love the scent, too!</li>
    <li> I received this for free and I loved it!  Threw away my secret, my dove and all other deodorants.  I&#x27;m not a loyal customer for life.  I&#x27;ve also mentioned this to family and friends.  A worthwhile purchase!</li>
    <li> Over the years I keep moving to natural products and finding a natural deodorant was part of that.  I was skeptical it wouldn&#x27;t work well but I am very happy with this deodorant.  I live in Central Florida where its hot and humid for many months, but this natural product works better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get away from using antiperspirants.So I have tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant and found they were sticky and didn&#x27;t help with body odor.  This one leaves a slight wetness when you first put it on but found it works on my odor.  The only time I have noticed smelling is after working out at the gym.  Definitely will stay using this item.</li>
