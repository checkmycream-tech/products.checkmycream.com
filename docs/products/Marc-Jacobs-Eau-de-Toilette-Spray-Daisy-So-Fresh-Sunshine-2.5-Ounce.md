    <li> First Marc Jacobs perfume, but definately not my last!!  Smells great, love the bottle!  Great purchase.  Came right on time, exactly as it was described.</li>
    <li> This perfume is the most fresh scent I have ever had from a product. This is great for an all year smell. If you can get your hands on a bottle. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This has got to be one of my new favorite perfumes. Light, fresh and long lasting, but not overpowering.I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVE THIS PERFUME, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE IT AGAIN, IS HARD TO FIND IT.  THANK YOU.  I CAN GIVE IT 10 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My package just arrived today for my wife and she loved it the smell was perfect not to heavy not to weak It had a good balance it was a very good purchase and seeing the shock in her eyes was even better</li>
    <li> This is same thing I saw at a couple department stores but it cost about $30 less.  I loved this fragrance but I could not bring myself to spend so much for it!</li>
    <li> Jar full of sweet honey and nectar...this has become my favorite perfume scent!!! It&#x27;s in a lovely bottle, I only wish I could find a purse size roll on of this one.  Love love love, you wont regret getting this product if you like a light sweet scent.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this scent. Very clean scent not overbearing. The bottle is completely gorgeous. Priced at lesser value then in-store makes it a steal.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  I had some on at work one day and couldn&#x27;t really smell it, but one of my co-workers complimented this fragrance.  I like this much better than the Eau So Fresh Delight.  I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores, but glad that Amazon seems to have a steady supply.</li>
    <li> By far one of my favorite perfumes. It&#x27;s a nice mix of fruity and flowery that would probably compliment almost any young woman, I&#x27;d say. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from men and women while wearing this perfume. I really like fruity perfumes, and if you don&#x27;t, I&#x27;d say go for the regular Daisy perfume. The regular Daisy, to me, smells awful; very old-ladyish. But that&#x27;s probably because of my skin chemistry; that perfume didn&#x27;t combine well on my skin. The regular Daisy is very musky and floral-y, but the combination just doesn&#x27;t smell good to me. Daisy Eau So Fresh Sunshine is perfect for me. Perfect blend of fruity and floral for a young woman in her 20&#x27;s. If you are unsure of it this perfume is for you, but a small size of it, like 1oz or less. The 2.5oz bottle is pretty big.</li>
    <li> The item came competely sealed and in brand-new condition. This perfume has been discontinued, and I feel lucky to have found it for such a great price.</li>
    <li> My fiance&#x27; loved it.  She&#x27;s a big fan of the Daisy line of fragrances&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Perfect and long lasting... all of Marc Jacobs frangrances last a long time which I love!</li>
    <li> Sweet and clean scent. And the bottle is absolutely adorable!</li>
    <li> Ladies, this scent is awesome for the spring and summer. Flowery and sweet but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;My perfume came in no time after ordering. The perfume came packaged appropriate as it should.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase :-)</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents would highly recommend. Last all day without smelling to strong and I get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Fake. That&#x27;s all I have to say. They did not let me return it. DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
