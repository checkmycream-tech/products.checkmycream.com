      <li>I would buy this again for sure</li>
      <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t like keeping it on, but its better than getting water in her face and having her flip because she thinks she is drowning :)</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>some try&#x27;s are better then others</li>
      <li>Glad I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>so it makes it even better.  </li>
      <li>my granddauthers love it.</li>
      <li>It covers their eyes and ears and makes a bath really enjoyable experience.</li>
      <li>I love this item.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of it</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Works great as a in-house fashion accessory for a 2 year old toddler :)</li>
      <li>The adjustable strap in the back makes it fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>Glad it was cheap.</li>
      <li>This cap is ridiculously cheap made.</li>
      <li>never stays in place, ridiculously cheap made.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit the baby&#x27;s head</li>
      <li>Its cheap</li>
      <li>This thing is cheaply made and appears to ship from over seas.  </li>
      <li>Overall this shower cap is a great idea.</li>
      <li>It is very useful for bathing babies in the tub</li>
      <li>I am excited to use it.</li>
      <li>It was still worth a shot since it was so inexpensive!</li>
      <li>I will try to use it for the child I am currently pregnant with once I have him.</li>
      <li>better functionality than Baby Shower Cap, Shampoo Visor, Bath Visor, but by quality then latter is better, instead I&#x27;ll choose this</li>
      <li>took long but works good</li>
      <li>Should have a different kind of size adjuster.</li>
      <li>the price and quality was worth it.</li>
      <li>It does take a bit of time to get the hang of it and find the proper size for your child, but it is surprisingly effective.</li>
      <li>not even worth one buck.</li>
      <li>I think I could have used some old Styrofoam around the house and made a better quality product that this &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>As soon as I put it on her she rips it right off.</li>
      <li>It is very flimsy, not stiff like I expected,but it does mostly work.</li>
      <li>I bought two more for future baby gifts.</li>
      <li>It is just flimsy enough to make sure I get it over their ears but under their hair lines.</li>
      <li>I ordered a BLUE cap that snapped to fit children&#x27;s heads.</li>
      <li>Thanks. . .</li>
      <li>Kept it though as it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>My son really likes washing his hair now, which really is a miracle</li>
      <li>The cap makes shampooing the baby&#x27;s hair so much easier.</li>
      <li>Took almost a month to arrive and it is so big and made of cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>also thought for an older child since opening was large.</li>
      <li>The snaps also make the visor a poor fit most of the time.  </li>
      <li>on the pic looked much better, very soft and not realible, we could not use it as child didnt like it, not that much practical and like a cap to ware, besides i ordered with fasteners and it was round, no pins on it.</li>
      <li>It works well, but will only just barely fit her for maybe the next couple of months.</li>
      <li>It works but not as easily as I expected I feel like I spend more time adjusting it then actually washing my kids hair and being done with it</li>
      <li>I c ame back and bought more for other babies that were born.</li>
      <li>small for 50 sm baby head , i had to stretch it ,to wear a hat :)</li>
      <li>But is much better than others I have bought in the past.</li>
      <li>this product would be great for a small infant but did not fit my 1 1/2 year olds head.</li>
      <li>The material is super thin and flimsy and it has a really strong smell that you don&#x27;t want you baby anywhere near this thing.</li>
      <li>This completely protects his eyes and face even if I quickly rinse quarts and quarts of water, just pours right down the back of it.</li>
      <li>My 2-yr old has a big head of curly hair and absolutely dreads getting it washed and rinsed.</li>
      <li>My cousins six month old baby boy looks like a girl</li>
      <li>it works really well and even though I had to wait a really long time to receive it</li>
      <li>, I use it everyday on my little man, and it still looks like new &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Seems a little flimsy....not sure since it did not fit on my son&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>We have dealt with our now 3 year old hating water in her face ever since she was a tiny tiny baby.</li>
      <li>Seriously guys, go for the decent ones which might cost more but at least you can actually use them.</li>
      <li>good expectations, bad reality.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend you to donate your dollar. ^^</li>

<li> I was super doubtful purchasing this but with the incredibly cheap price I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
<li> He doesn&#x27;t like wearing it, so it&#x27;s on just long enough to rinse.</li>
<li> came in pink instead of blue that i ordered.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had it for a really long time now</li>
<li> The color and everything came as advertised and didn&#x27;t take too long to receive from China.</li>
<li> Complete joke and waste of money</li>
<li> I also requested a blue one for my baby boy and they sent me a pink one.</li>
<li> Also got a pink one instead of the blue I ordered.</li>
<li> I payed for the blue and got a pink.</li>
<li> It was shipped from China and they sent pink instead of blue.</li>
<li> It took soo long to get my order.</li>
<li> I received a pink instead of the blue one I ordered</li>
<li> I got this for my almost 2 year old son and it does not fit at all.</li>
<li> I ordered two blue caps but received two pink one.</li>
<li> However, I ordered blue &amp; got pink.</li>
<li> On top of everything they sent me a pink cap instead of the blue that is shown and returns with this company are difficult even though it was their mistake!</li>
<li> However, after awhile, it becomes loose.</li>
<li> I am a bit afraid that it will rip easily but haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
<li> and it came in PINK</li>
<li> However, what I received was a PINK cap that is not adjustable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We have dealt with our now 3 year old hating water in her face ever since she was a tiny tiny baby. This product works, I was skeptical, but bath time is much much easier now!</li>
    <li> They sent the wrong color...thank goodness my son loves pink! He thought I got it for him on purpose. It is very flimsy, not stiff like I expected,but it does mostly work. He doesn&#x27;t like wearing it, so it&#x27;s on just long enough to rinse.</li>
    <li> Took almost a month to arrive and it is so big and made of cheap plastic. Does not fit the baby and did not use it even once. Cannot complain for a dollar.</li>
    <li> my granddauthers love it.</li>
    <li> Could not find a gift for someone who has it all and can afford everything.&lt;br /&gt;I Bet they don&#x27;t have this!&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and uses it on 2 kids.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I received a pink instead of the blue one I ordered but I wasn&#x27;t to upset with it. my toddler is now 2yrs and is still wearing it. it works really well and even though I had to wait a really long time to receive it the price and quality was worth it.</li>
    <li> Of course the quality is not the best of this world... But is much better than others I have bought in the past. I&#x27;ve had it for a really long time now, I use it everyday on my little man, and it still looks like new &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of this but my grand-daughter doesn&#x27;t. If she could only understand what it is for…ugh! As soon as I put it on her she rips it right off. I will keep trying because it think one of these days if I get her to wear it, it will work great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product. It&#x27;s a little flimsy it took for ever to get. However. It works really nicely and I would recommend one to everyone.</li>
    <li> took long but works good</li>
    <li> I am a bit afraid that it will rip easily but haven&#x27;t used it yet. If it works then it will be awesome!</li>
    <li> No water gets in the babies eyes when shampooing her hair. The adjustable strap in the back makes it fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> does what it suppose to do. but a little flimsy tho. came in pink instead of blue that i ordered.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get to stay on a baby&#x27;s head. I also requested a blue one for my baby boy and they sent me a pink one.</li>
    <li> my youngest chil is 25  why would i order a baby shower cap  theres no grandkids yet  product ordered was witha stolen credit card they still want their money and contest the order with my bank i never saw the order either  so it was never shipped to me</li>
    <li> Thought it was plastic. Does not work well. It is some sort of foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also thought for an older child since opening was large.</li>
    <li> better functionality than Baby Shower Cap, Shampoo Visor, Bath Visor, but by quality then latter is better, instead I&#x27;ll choose this</li>
    <li> It took soo long to get my order. I ordered two blue caps but received two pink one. How can I give them to my sons?!</li>
    <li> on the pic looked much better, very soft and not realible, we could not use it as child didnt like it, not that much practical and like a cap to ware, besides i ordered with fasteners and it was round, no pins on it. bad, very bad</li>
    <li> never stays in place, ridiculously cheap made. not even worth one buck. good expectations, bad reality.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend you to donate your dollar. ^^</li>
    <li> Desigined to work like umbrella, we are able to shower our baby without fear..&lt;br /&gt;I am happy! Thanks. . .</li>
    <li> wont&#x27; stay on head.  can&#x27;t wash all hair.  Glad it was cheap.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend  this product if you have a little baby or toddler. It covers their eyes and ears and makes a bath really enjoyable experience.</li>
    <li> this product would be great for a small infant but did not fit my 1 1/2 year olds head. Seems a little flimsy....not sure since it did not fit on my son&#x27;s head. It was still worth a shot since it was so inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d be real mad if I paid more for it - so the cheapness is what it has going for it. Granted, it&#x27;s hard to make something that fits everyone...but it would not stay on our baby, so it&#x27;s a one-and-done purchase. We&#x27;re going to try the visor types...</li>
    <li> It works but not as easily as I expected I feel like I spend more time adjusting it then actually washing my kids hair and being done with it some try&#x27;s are better then others</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it was adjustable so it makes it even better.  I am excited to use it.</li>
    <li> This thing is cheaply made and appears to ship from over seas.  Was not worth the time.. through it away.</li>
    <li> I ordered a BLUE cap that snapped to fit children&#x27;s heads. However, what I received was a PINK cap that is not adjustable. I cannot use it now because it is too big and does not adjust.</li>
    <li> too bad quality like a paper.this product is  made of very very poor quality material.not even used once.I have to throw it out and i got another good quality from toys r us.i will never opt for a cheap product again.</li>
    <li> Great product! My son really likes washing his hair now, which really is a miracle lol. I would buy this again for sure</li>
    <li> This is made of foam not rubber and has no shape to it. It was shipped from China and they sent pink instead of blue. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I payed for the blue and got a pink. My cousins six month old baby boy looks like a girl</li>
    <li> Very cheap foam. Was folded in quarters so it has a terrible seam. Also got a pink one instead of the blue I ordered.</li>
    <li> This cap came in handy though my 7 month no longer allows me to put anything on his head nit even hats. The material is a tad flimsy so needs to be kept away from baby because it is not a toy as toys are durable. Overall this shower cap is a great idea. I bought two more for future baby gifts.</li>
    <li> I got this for my almost 2 year old son and it does not fit at all. I will try to use it for the child I am currently pregnant with once I have him.</li>
    <li> too small !!! small for 50 sm baby head , i had to stretch it ,to wear a hat :)</li>
    <li> Love it. But wish we could have an option on the color and that it wasn&#x27;t folded in half. thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, who is 4. It works well, but will only just barely fit her for maybe the next couple of months. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, though--I wish I had found it sooner, and saved the last 4 years of her hating having her  hair washed!</li>
    <li> Its cheap but I found it pretty useless.  Its not really big enough to wrap around the forehead and the nape of the neck of anything but an infant and frankly you don&#x27;t need this for an infant.  The snaps also make the visor a poor fit most of the time.  It needs a locking strap or velcro or something.</li>
    <li> I love this and so do my kids. No more being afraid of getting soap in our eyes.  It is just flimsy enough to make sure I get it over their ears but under their hair lines. The size is adjustable so I can use it on my youngest and my oldest with out any problems. I received it a lot faster than I expected as well. Glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I recommend, works like a dream! Kept water out of ears and eyes. I c ame back and bought more for other babies that were born. Great baby gift.</li>
    <li> I love this item. It is very useful for bathing babies in the tub and it does the job by preventing water from going into his eyes. However, after awhile, it becomes loose. My son&#x27;s head used the smallest adjustment and I had to try and purchase another one from a different vendor.</li>
    <li> I was super doubtful purchasing this but with the incredibly cheap price I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. My 2-yr old has a big head of curly hair and absolutely dreads getting it washed and rinsed. This completely protects his eyes and face even if I quickly rinse quarts and quarts of water, just pours right down the back of it. It does take a bit of time to get the hang of it and find the proper size for your child, but it is surprisingly effective. The color and everything came as advertised and didn&#x27;t take too long to receive from China.</li>
    <li> My son LOVES when I pour water over his head now, and laughs as he watches the water fall off the front of the hat like a waterfall.  Beats his screaming any day!</li>
    <li> The cap makes shampooing the baby&#x27;s hair so much easier. Truly no tears. However, I ordered blue &amp; got pink. Kept it though as it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered a blue one and it came in PINK i have a boy but he still uses it.</li>
    <li> This cap is ridiculously cheap made. The material is super thin and flimsy and it has a really strong smell that you don&#x27;t want you baby anywhere near this thing. We bought one in China just from a random shop on vacation which worked like heaven and cost me one buck as well. But I left it in the hotel room! I ordered this assuming they will be the same, boy I was so wrong! Seriously guys, go for the decent ones which might cost more but at least you can actually use them. This one is, I  sorry to say, a serious piece of junk!</li>
    <li> Complete joke and waste of money</li>
    <li> Very cheap and I shouldn&#x27;t have bothered.  It didn&#x27;t work for even one bath.  The snaps are very tight (difficult to snap and unsnap) and it didn&#x27;t adjust small enough to fit my toddler&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> Using it for over one year now. Still working, still looking in good shape. Works great as a in-house fashion accessory for a 2 year old toddler :) My point: is being manipulated a lit and still functional.</li>
    <li> I dnt like it at all..delivered wrong color not useful</li>
    <li> Son hated wearing this, but it did keep shampoo out of his face.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of it but it doesn&#x27;t fit the baby&#x27;s head its too small. Should have a different kind of size adjuster.</li>
    <li> Cheap enough to try, my son hated it</li>
    <li> I think I could have used some old Styrofoam around the house and made a better quality product that this &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34;. It is incredibly poorly constructed and did not actually keep the water away from the baby&#x27;s face. On top of everything they sent me a pink cap instead of the blue that is shown and returns with this company are difficult even though it was their mistake!</li>
    <li> My grandson loves that he gets no more water in his eyes.  Do not need to pay a lot of money this was perfect.</li>
    <li> Hat works well to keep water/soap out of babies eyes and ears. Instructions are a joke if u didn&#x27;t already know how to use product. Company shipped wrong color but it was way to much trouble to ship incorrect items back to CHINA for one of correct color.</li>
    <li> Works well. Does what it is supposed to. My daughter doesn&#x27;t like keeping it on, but its better than getting water in her face and having her flip because she thinks she is drowning :)</li>
