      <li>tried so many others</li>
      <li>I would suggest that you don&#x27;t purchase this top coat.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cracks in top coat appeared after 5 days.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I think it seals the color better.</li>
      <li>Better than OPI and cheaper too.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It protects my nail polish and I take it to my salon when I&#x27;m having my manicure so that it can be used instead of their &amp;#34;professional top coat&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It dries real quick - awesome for last minute people.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>I was looking for the seche vite top coat but couldn&#x27;t find any, so I picked this one instead.</li>
      <li>This top does everything it says it does.</li>
      <li>I use basecoat and then 1-2 layers of nail polish and then the top coat.</li>
      <li>Love this. ..</li>
      <li>eventually I discovered Rock Top Coat and switched to that.</li>
      <li>I love it love</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use this top coat on any nails that have decorations.</li>
      <li>I used to go to sleep with my fingers on top of the comforter.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve seemingly been through every top coat you can find (including Seche Vite) without finding one you&#x27;re actually satisfied with, give this one a try.</li>
      <li>I love how its free shipping with Prime, and it got here in one day!</li>
      <li>you use your fingernails as tools, you can scratch this top coat -</li>
      <li>So if you are eating finger food, it might feel like your top coat got into your mouth sometimes, not always.</li>
      <li>I have found the perfect top coat for the cheap nail polishes I own (they take forever to dry).</li>
      <li>However it does have a very strong smell, and still gives a light smell after a day or two.</li>
      <li>I do my nails every week and this really dries quickly and has a beautiful glossy finish...</li>
      <li>Works great and having a 6 year old who can&#x27;t stay still</li>
      <li>Revlon&#x27;s top coat seems to have a thinner consistency and applies smoothly.</li>
      <li>Arrived in perfect condition, as expected.</li>
      <li>, they practically reflected light after I used this top coat.</li>
      <li>I love this top coat, it really dries in 30 seconds and leaves a really nice finish on the nails.</li>
      <li>Instead, I just change out the colors when I get ready for a change and move on to another - and use this as the topcoat for that new color, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply a great product!</li>
      <li>Gus us the best quick dry top coat I have used.</li>
      <li>Best fast dry top coat ever!</li>
      <li>It is TRUE to its description!</li>
      <li>It says it because it is 100% true!</li>
      <li>Honestly, this is my new favorite top coat.</li>
      <li>These cracks happen really easily on my nails</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to spread.</li>
      <li>great top coat, not like others that u have to use the same brand on polish or</li>
      <li>I always pair this with cheap polishes and then just use this as the top coat-with this top coat, my manicure will still be in good shape a week later!</li>
      <li>And works fine.</li>
      <li>This top coat dries quick and is lustrous, however it does chip within a day or two.</li>
      <li>It has helped me be able to quickly do a manicure and not have to worry about ruining my just-polished nails.  </li>
      <li>Top coat provides good coverage, It goes on smoothly and dries pretty fast.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This works very well! After I put this stuff on and give a few minutes to dry, I can go about and do the normal things I would do and not worry about messing up my nails. Great price too! I am very happy with this product and would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do my nails without it.  Quick delivery and good price.  I used to go to sleep with my fingers on top of the comforter.  When I get up, you can see scratches.  HOWEVER, since using this, I never have the same problem.  It really sets the polish in -- give it at least 20-mins. before going to bed just in case though.</li>
    <li> Good topcoat. The consistency doesn&#x27;t get thick and gooey after a few uses like some other brands do. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Best fast dry top coat ever! I let me friend use this and she called the next week asking what it was as she loved it, and said her nail polish had not chipped after a full week. It dries super-fast as well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have a nail polish fetish. I polish my nails 1 or 2 times every week. This top does everything it says it does. The shine is fantastic. Never lets me down and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> As expected arrived in a box that could fit 10 of these.  Hope it works as I am waiting for the rest of the shipments</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It is truly quick drying, and whenever I pain my nails, I include this as the final layer. Not only does it dry quickly, I find that it also helps prevents my nail polish from chipping away, which is a problem have encountered with other polishes before. Regardless of the polish you wear under this, the top layer will protect it for a long time (depending on how hard  you are on your hands, work you do, if you bite your nails or not, etc)... but I have never had to redo a nail that has this as a topcoat. Instead, I just change out the colors when I get ready for a change and move on to another - and use this as the topcoat for that new color, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply a great product!</li>
    <li> This makes doing my nails every three to four days a BREEZE! It is TRUE to its description! I do my nails before I go to bed or right before I jam out of the door in the morning and with this applies as my top coat, i do it all with no mess! This is my second order!!!!</li>
    <li> Love Revlon products!</li>
    <li> I bought the OPI rapid dry first, and it chipped and peeled right away.  After two tries with the OPI, I bought this Revlon product.  It works great!  No chipping, no peeling, and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I received the Top Coat in a large cardboard box with some filling, and it was loose in the box with no additional packaging around the bottle. When I took the Top Coat out of the box it was half full!! The writing on the bottle was crooked, leading me to believe it was not authentic but a rip off. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t speak for the product itself as I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> I was using a very high end top coat, which I was about to reorder.  I happened to come upon this product by accident, and was surprised to see a product like this for under $3.  I figured, what the heck...might as well try it.  Besides, my other product was really peeling off my nails too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived very fast, and is am now a convert.  It gies on very smoothly, and it looks great.  The best part is it stayed on almost a couple weeks!  This product is a winner and I plan on reordering.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite top coat of all, beats OPI any day! It is super smooth and has a gel like finish. I do nail art for a lot of my friends and family and they all agree that this top coat seals in your polish and lasts longer than all the other top brands that I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this topcoat that is supposed to help dry your nails quickly. I&#x27;ve tried it a few times but I can&#x27;t get past the awful smell and ---the smell lasts forever......find another!  This one really does stink!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more like a bast coat, NOT A TOP COAT...</li>
    <li> Works well and dries flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Perfect! When I have a tacky nail polish that wont dry, this stuff works like magic I swear!</li>
    <li> I have to be honest. I didn&#x27;t really think this was going to dry as quick as it did. I put on the top coat over my painted nails, then closed the bottle and opened the first one for my other hand, and out of curiosity I checked one of my fingers that I put the top coat on. It was already dry, so I checked them all. It was amazing. No more worry about messing up my nails because they take forever to dry!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried from one of the reviews that claimed this left a discolored hue on their polish, but thankfully it didn&#x27;t happen with me. The drying time was fairly quick.  But the best thing about it was that it left a gorgeous lacquered appearance to my nails, they practically reflected light after I used this top coat. And it lasted a few days before the luster started to fade.</li>
    <li> It does dry very quickly, and stays on for a long time.  Sometimes, I use it by itself to give my nails a little shine.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best topcoat for the money out there!!! Very long wearing, stays shiny!!!</li>
    <li> Top coat provides good coverage, It goes on smoothly and dries pretty fast. My nail polish stays on for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best top coat around. I always pair this with cheap polishes and then just use this as the top coat-with this top coat, my manicure will still be in good shape a week later! It also leaves a really nice, shiny finish that doesn&#x27;t get bubbly or streaky. It dries fairly quickly, but it&#x27;s a little thick and goes on best if it&#x27;s thick in it&#x27;s application, so it still needs a little while to dry if you want a perfect manicure/pedicure (I usually leave at least 30 minutes after I finish the top coat if the under layers were at least close to fully dry-but I&#x27;m a perfectionist in my manicures) It&#x27;s definitely comparable to some of the much more expensive top coats, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper/more affordable!</li>
    <li> A very decent clear topcoat, dries quickly as promised. Minus points for the very narrow brush, several applications are needed just to cover one nail.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this is my new favorite top coat. It went on smoothly (the formula is neither incredibly thick nor super thin) and it was dry in minutes. I always wait about 20-30 minutes before I start touching anything with my hands because I had to worry about bubbles or smudges/fingerprints, but this top coat eliminated that wait time completely. I&#x27;m officially 5 days into my manicure and the polish is still shiny and there is neither a chip nor bubble in sight!</li>
    <li> Really does dry fast and protect as long as the bottom color coat is mostly dry.  Feels rock hard as advertised.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It really does dry quickly.  Nice to be able to get this at a reduced price as an add-on item.  I have used this in the past and will continue using it.  I have long acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my Revlon top coat. I purchase it all the time.  It works perfectly, and I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine from Amazon, I got mine from the shop. I was looking for the seche vite top coat but couldn&#x27;t find any, so I picked this one instead. The top oat is the best I have ever used. It dries very fast and leaves your nail polish with a beautiful glossy and smooth finish. I have found the perfect top coat for the cheap nail polishes I own (they take forever to dry). I highly recommend this. I&#x27;m thinking of trying other colors from this brand.</li>
    <li> I really like this thing! I do my nails every week and this really dries quickly and has a beautiful glossy finish... I own a lot of revlon polishes wich are very mate but when you add this top coat boom! glossy pretty nails :)</li>
    <li> ONE OF THE BEST POLISH COVERS ON THE MARKET!!!! OR YOU CAN WEAR ALONE .GREAT NAIL COVERAGE.WIL PURCHASE AGAIN.THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I previously felt I could only apply nail polish right before going to sleep.  Otherwise, I feared I would smear it.  I apply the Quick Dry almost immediately after applying polish and I haven&#x27;t had problems with smearing and smudging.  I try to wait a couple of minutes after I apply it to assure I will not smudge.  I certainly don&#x27;t have to wait a long time for normal wear.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition, as expected.</li>
    <li> Dried to soft finish after a couple minutes, only ruined a couple nails after I hit them against something hard. Make sure your color is completely dry before applying clearcoat otherwise you&#x27;ll get streaks</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this top coat on any nails that have decorations. It takes the paint off as it goes on. Very annoying. Also as it&#x27;s taking the nail polish off it stains the brush.  I would suggest that you don&#x27;t purchase this top coat. The base coat is great though and the company was very quick.</li>
    <li> Name is a little misleading.  It was not what I wanted. This might be OK for a top coat, but I wanted something to dry my nails quickly that&#x27;s not a top coat.</li>
    <li> Pretty average.  Haven&#x27;t noticed anything special.  Doesn&#x27;t dry especially fast and doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping in any way.</li>
    <li> This definitely seals nail varnish better than nothing, but it has a tendency to smear the color, regardless of how long they&#x27;ve been dry. I had nails I&#x27;d painted the night before suddenly smear all over when I applied this top coat. If you&#x27;re quick and careful, it&#x27;s not that noticable, but still annoying for patterns you&#x27;ve spent a long time on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t affect all polishes, but I haven&#x27;t figured out which ones yet. It&#x27;s not even cheaper ones as it devastatingly smeared an OPI I used but left another revlon alone (hmm..)</li>
    <li> This is an amazingly fast drying top coat and very reasonably priced.  It protects my nail polish and I take it to my salon when I&#x27;m having my manicure so that it can be used instead of their &amp;#34;professional top coat&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Does not leave my nails very shiny. On the thinner side. Does not seem very protective.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Does not shrink polish. Gives a hard, glossy topcoat and generally helps it dry very quickly. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple other brands in top coats to finish my manicure.  In comparison to the others I&#x27;ve tried--OPI, Sally Hansen, Essie . . . This polish by Revlon ranks right at the top. It truly does dry in record time setting my color beautifully.  I&#x27;ve noticed my nails have been stronger and less prone to breakage as well.  It&#x27;s also been nice to have my color last up to 10 days without looking shabby. I will definitely be a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> I have tried every quick dry top coat, from very expensive to much less expensive. Some of them were too sticky, Some would not dry well, and some just didn&#x27;t work, the nail polish smudged and chipped within a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon quick dry top coat goes on smoothly, dries quickly and will last up to two weeks. I always use a base coat, then two layers of nail polish and finally the top coat. Revlon is perfect for any type of polish. I find my nails are always dry and do. It smudge within a few minutes. I do not have to polish any nails over the week. Gus us the best quick dry top coat I have used. It he price is right, and I would recommend it go anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 11-17-13</li>
    <li> Better than OPI and cheaper too. Dries very shiny and I think it seals the color better.</li>
    <li> I found a review for this product on another website and really liked it and its priced fairly, so I bought it. I love this top coat, it really dries in 30 seconds and leaves a really nice finish on the nails. I used mine 4 days ago and still no chips! This is also very high shine and slick feeling. The consistency is really nice as well bc its thin and easy to spread unlike the like goopy top coats. Also shipped very fast! Go for it!</li>
    <li> Love it. It really dries up fast and makes the polish shiny.</li>
    <li> Works great and having a 6 year old who can&#x27;t stay still it thankfully dries super fast!</li>
    <li> I agree with the review down below me.  This top coat is the best!!  I&#x27;ve tried many, many, other ones and this one goes on thin and works very well.  It has helped me be able to quickly do a manicure and not have to worry about ruining my just-polished nails.  It still isn&#x27;t completely accident proof, but much more so than any other quick drying top coat that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Notas good as any other cheaper product.  A little shinier is all.  It flakes as soon as it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat you can get with this price. It claims to dry within 30 seconds and it really does, it also does a good job preventing nails from chipping. I always paint my nails when I&#x27;m doing my hw lol, so taking like 30 mins until my nail polish finally hardens is not a good idea. This top coat does the trick-no chip, dries fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product, dries up quickly and has a thin formula. I used to buy Seche Vite, but it would get too thick halfway thru the bottle. This is also cheaper, which is nice!</li>
    <li> This top coat is absolutely amazing!!</li>
    <li> Dried out pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Dries quick to a hard, shiny finish, and it seems to keep chipping at bay. But it makes a weird affect over some of my nail polishes making them turn a different color.</li>
    <li> I used nyx nailpolish before but this is the best one.  its dries under 2 mins and has avery nice sheen to it.  I just love it. ANd will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this since it can out.&lt;br /&gt;Have tried so many others n always come back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Shines the best.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t crack.&lt;br /&gt;Dries fast.</li>
    <li> Helps your nail polish dry faster and stay on longer. I love doing fancy designs on my nails, tips, and other manicure creations, so I don&#x27;t want them flaking off right away. With 1-2 coats of this nail polish, these manicures will last for 2 weeks or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever even see the polish coming off, I&#x27;ll just apply another quick coat and I&#x27;m set for another 2 weeks. For me, my nails will grow out before the polish comes off. Also, there isn&#x27;t the globby, slow drying process you have with other top coats. It keeps your nails really shiny, and typically doesn&#x27;t make the colored polish streak/bleed when you coat over it. (Note: don&#x27;t do it immediately after you apply coats of color, or it will.)</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve had yet! I love how its free shipping with Prime, and it got here in one day!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas because she loves to do her nails.  She says that her nails dry almost instantly and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Great topcoat! The one thing is that it is hard for me to use all the product - after a couple months (and maybe I&#x27;ve had it for too long), the product got thicker, so it wasn&#x27;t as easy to put on or the brush to reach the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smooth application and drying, quick drying, smooths out unevenness in nail polish application, good amount of product, works with different brands of nail polish&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Average lasting time (1-2 weeks), consistency becomes thicker after a couple of months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great topcoat. I use basecoat and then 1-2 layers of nail polish and then the top coat. This makes any nail polish look professionally done, and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different top coats in the past, but this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used by far. Application is easy, the formula isn&#x27;t thick so it&#x27;s easy to spread. There is no shrinkage and it dries smooth and glossy. It also protects very well from chips - and this is coming from someone who is pretty hard on her hands. While it may be a little over-ambitious in it&#x27;s claim to dry solid in 30 seconds, it definitely dries quickly. It&#x27;s dry to the touch within a minute and completely dry within 3-5 minutes, which is plenty fast for me. My only complaint is that once you get about 2/3 of the way through the bottle, it starts to get thick. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve run into this problem with most fast drying top coats I&#x27;ve used. If you&#x27;ve seemingly been through every top coat you can find (including Seche Vite) without finding one you&#x27;re actually satisfied with, give this one a try.</li>
    <li> VERY happy with this product- will continue to purchase-- best top coat I&#x27;ve tried-- I&#x27;d say it needs 10-15 minutes of settling though rather than 5 so if you have that time to spare, definitely get it-- my nails usually stay chip free for maybe 3-4 days and I&#x27;m not an active dishwasher.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful top coat - dries very quickly. It will bubble if you forget to &amp;#34;shake it&amp;#34; - so be sure to do that! Otherwise, no problems.</li>
    <li> I applied this to my nails one night and the very next morning it was already peeled off half of my nail.</li>
    <li> Wonderful top coat. In fact the best one I ever used. It doesn&#x27;t just say Quick Dry because every top coat drys quick. It says it because it is 100% true! Wow…..I polished my nails and then went to my couch to watch tv because normally my top coats take one show to completely dry through. I sat down picked my show and started watching. Literally seconds later it was completely done drying. Oh my god! An amazing product. My nails were dry in less than a minute.</li>
    <li> This is my second top coat after Sally Hansen (which by the way I dint like at all, it peels off). I don&#x27;t have much frame of reference, but this does protect my nail art. My nails feel stronger. It does dry faster than the nail polish. It gives a good and rich shine to my nails. However it does have a very strong smell, and still gives a light smell after a day or two. So if you are eating finger food, it might feel like your top coat got into your mouth sometimes, not always. Other than the smell, I think it&#x27;s alright. And works fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve went through a lot of different types of dry top coats and this one by far is the BEST I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve actually been using this nail polish for over 2 years now. I&#x27;m always amazed at how quick it dries, along with how it doesn&#x27;t get gooey after several uses. I usually don&#x27;t have to worry about running my finger nails into objects and getting them scratched since the polish dries quick enough!!</li>
    <li> This top coat dries quick and is lustrous, however it does chip within a day or two. Though I do admit to being rough on my hands being in dish water a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this top coat! Worth buying. It&#x27;s definitely a quick dry top coat. For a long time, I ended up frustrated using diffirent top coats but this product WOW!!! its really WORTH IT! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Using the clear coat along with the false nails and beautiful vibrant red for my husband to wear around the house. It appears to be really helping the colors last and shine.</li>
    <li> IT DOES NOT WORK!&lt;br /&gt;It peeled my manicure right off in the shower. Sucks, I had high hopes. Barnacles drums!</li>
    <li> I was a faithful Seche Vite user, used their quick dry top coat for years, but I found the solution to goop up after a few months because of how thick their stuff is. Revlon&#x27;s top coat seems to have a thinner consistency and applies smoothly. Definitely give it a try if you&#x27;re looking for a new top coat!</li>
    <li> It dries real quick - awesome for last minute people. Gives a good &#x27;finished&#x27; look and does not chip away easily.</li>
    <li> Product itself works great. High shine, dries quickly. However my bristles were frayed when I opened the bottle up, so now I have to be mindful to use one side of the brush. I have never had this problem with a bottle of nail polish before. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the seller or manufacturer. Hope this doesn&#x27;t happen again next time.</li>
    <li> Basically purchased this in order to qualify for free shipping on another purchase.  I used it for the first time a couple of nights ago and absolutely love it.  I&#x27;ve never used a quick dry nail polish that actually works like it&#x27;s supposed. to before.  I&#x27;ve had it on for 2 days now and there&#x27;s no chipping or cracking.  Best I&#x27;ve come across and really cheap too!</li>
    <li> I love that it dries so fast and keeps my polish from smudges. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love it love it love it!!! great top coat, not like others that u have to use the same brand on polish or it mess up with your design.... great product, but not the packing... unfortunately it didn&#x27;t come with a adequate wrapping and 1 of the bottles broke :( because of that I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> This stuff really dries polish FAST!!!!! I will buy it again to make sure I get the right stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It dries your nails all the way through.  And the shine is BRILLIANT!!!  It is a must have.</li>
    <li> Love this. ..doesn&#x27;t get to thick. ..really works</li>
    <li> Updated March 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Dries very fast. The first time I used it, I actually forgot which nails I&#x27;d put top coat on because they dried so fast.&lt;br /&gt;Allows dark-colored manicure to look good, and very shiny, for 3-5 days without issue (depending on my nail length and shape - shorter rounder nails wear longer on me before cracking or chipping).&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cracks in top coat appeared after 5 days. This is a bigger problem when wearing light colors underneath, since then you can see the dirt/oils that can get trapped in the cracks. These cracks happen really easily on my nails (areas on the tips where my nails bend and flex slightly throughout the day) but not everyone has this problem.&lt;br /&gt;If you use your fingernails as tools, you can scratch this top coat - however if you avoid using your nails this way, this doesn&#x27;t happen very often unless you do manual labor with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;On me, this top coat gradually yellows when I wear light colors, becoming very noticeable with white on day 3. It happens regardless of whether I avoid anything that could possibly stain, or how much sunlight I&#x27;m exposed to. This yellowing doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone (I have a friend who has never had this happen). However, I have yet to find a glossy top coat that doesn&#x27;t yellow after a few days when on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this top coat is widely available and good to have around and there&#x27;s definitely nothing wrong with it, but eventually I discovered Rock Top Coat and switched to that. Rock Top Coat is harder, cracks more slowly, and is just as shiny. It also feels a little nicer in the bottle than Revlon and is a comparable price.</li>
