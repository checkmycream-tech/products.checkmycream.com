    <li> I&#x27;ve began using this soap to help with my skin brightening routine so my skin tone on my body would be even and less splotchy. While the results after one use aren&#x27;t apparent, it definitely cleaned my skin and made it smooth. I feel that this soap should be diligently and continuously used in order to actually see the whitening benefits. I will be patient. I rated it 5 stars because it is a lovely smelling soap!&lt;br /&gt;******UPDATE 5/01/2915*******&lt;br /&gt;This soap actually works on fading discolorations like scars and hyper pigmentation of the skin. I have a scar on my knee and since I&#x27;ve been using this soap every day for taking a shower, the scar has lightened significantly. It also improved the texture of my skin on my legs. I&#x27;ve purchased my 2nd bar with the hopes of continuing with lightening and evening out my skin tone and texture overall. The price tag is worth it!</li>
    <li> I really love this soap. Even though it did not lighten my skin as it described, surprisingly it does great job on pore shrinking. It also makes my skin feel really smooth after using it. Love the fresh smell of rose!</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but it&#x27;s not too strong, which makes me very happy, as I am sensitive to smells. It seems to make my skin very smooth and soft. The one drawback is that it&#x27;s a bit drying on my skin, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, as I prefer to feel a bit dry instead of &#x27;moist&#x27;. I&#x27;m not sure if it whitens skin or not, but I&#x27;ll keep a picture log to be sure.</li>
    <li> The product smells so nice and makes my skin smooth after use. It is famous for its whitening effect and I hope it can work well on myself~</li>
    <li> It worksreally wellfor my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and my skin has been smooth and people have noticed that my skin lightned. I lovethe smell too. Big plus, I got my orders sooner than expected!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so relieved that what I bought is really authentic. Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;I tested its authenticity by scraping some of the soap and placing it on a apple cider vinegar. If it is fake, the soap will melt but in what I did, it didn&#x27;t melt at all. I love this soap. I&#x27;ll buy again! :)</li>
    <li> excellent! i&#x27;ve been using their porduct before, and it is very convenient for me to get thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> it works for sensitive skin, i like it, but I am not sure it actually works to make my skin more white or not</li>
    <li> Yes, this soap cleans you well and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a little confused about why it writes &amp;#34;Rosy white&amp;#34;.... huh? You can apparently use this on your face to get a rosy white look, lol. But yeah, I use it for my privates and I don&#x27;t leave it on for three minutes like they suggest (it stings a little), so I just use it like ordinary soap and it is fine and everything smells rosy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft on my skin, even my husband notice it. I also like it to alternate with lose soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tokyo love soap premium for 2 weeks now and my skin looks glowing everyday and my cheeks became pinkish. I am really satisfied with the results, and it is worth the price. Love it!! I&#x27;m using tokyo love soap premium together with Uguisu Poo, it works wonders with my face and body as well. I was happy because of the Fast shipping, from Singapore to USA,my package came after 10 days. ☺️ #satisfiedcustomer</li>

    <li> Its truly an amazing soap! I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of days now, and I can see a difference on my skin. My skin feels softer and is much cleaner than when I first used it.

I reccommend~</li>
