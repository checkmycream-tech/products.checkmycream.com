      <li>I decided to try it out, and am so glad I did!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going on my Holy Grail list of hair products for sure!</li>
      <li>In the 60&#x27;s I purchased a product called Life by Nutritonics for my hair and it was amazing</li>
      <li>A nice product.</li>
      <li>fragrance is nice while not being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it smells good, and fresh and leaves my hair in good condition.  </li>
      <li>the price was excellent and the product arrived early.</li>
      <li>My hair is smooth, smells good and is tangle free with no build up of any kind.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Moroccan oil, and while life drops is ok, it&#x27;ll never replace Moroccan oil.</li>
      <li>Love these drops for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to my frinds for sure.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if your hair takes a lot of damaging product and you need something light and easy to add moisture!!</li>
      <li>But with this stuff there was really a huge improvement in both the appearance and the texture of my hair...</li>
      <li>Feels smooth and silky, not greasy.</li>
      <li>The product is a light conditioner and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel sticky.  </li>
      <li>packaging is good for travel since it is more leakproof than most other types of containers.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for any kind of hair that you want to care for.</li>
      <li>I like this stuff, and it has a sweet cocoa smell that&#x27;s to die for, but I don&#x27;t know if it works as well as I need it to.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I may increase the amount to make sure I really get all my hair covered.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great everyday leave-in that gives fine hair the protein it needs.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>This leave-in, even with a straight perm, curls my hair up quick fast and easy with no work at all, and keeps it the softest EVER!  </li>
      <li>The ends had become so damaged from product and sun that they turned blonde (I&#x27;m a brunette), but now after using just a tiny bit of this every day my hair looks completely healthy!!  </li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t do a lot for damaged or curly hair, but a good product for healthy, straight hair in need of a little extra help.</li>
      <li>I have very fine curly hair that is frizzy &amp; dry</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It did not do much to help.  </li>
      <li>I use Life Drops as a detangler and very lightweight leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>I prefer this to highly perfumed products I have tried!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s getting more and more difficult to find.</li>
      <li>The smell is very clean, &amp; does not weigh my hair down a bit.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product, but it didn&#x27;t seem to improve the texture of my hair at all.</li>
      <li>I take reasonably good care of my hair and it is not super dry.</li>
      <li>reviewers on other websites had mentioned that the smell of this could be off-putting, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be too strong or odorous at all.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and this product really helps keep the frizz</li>
      <li>After using it just once, my waves (which had been looking rather straight) curled right up, and it left my hair feeling really soft and</li>
      <li>THe new formula iis a bit smelly; smells like eggs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and it leaves my hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>THe company that sold it was professional and prompt.</li>
      <li>It makes my damaged, lifeless hair soft as silk and doesn&#x27;t strip color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really watery so 15 minutes after putting it on, my hair was so dry.  </li>
      <li>I tried this product and didn&#x27;t like it all, it was a very watery, and didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING or change my hair at all, so I sent it back, got a refund, and left a review of what I thought of this product, the customer service manager from Newvo Beauty contacted me and asked me to remove my negative review in exchange for a replacement FREE OF CHARGE, so I agreed and removed it.</li>
      <li>The product makes a big difference in the areas of my hair that are VERY fried &amp; frizzy from another product I tried as a means to protect my hair when using my flat iron.  </li>
      <li>: I used this with the daily conditioner &amp; the combination of the two products left my hair incredibly soft!</li>
      <li>Typically, I wear my hair very short and straight....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A must for color treated hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Life Drops for over 5 years, applying each time I wash and towel dry my hair before blow drying. My otherwise dry, damaged hair wouldn&#x27;t survive without this stuff. I highly recommend it for any kind of hair that you want to care for.</li>
    <li> The only product I&#x27;ve ever raved about... A hair stylist used this on me during a photoshoot &#x27;cause my ends were so dry. I mean it really looked like hay. But with this stuff there was really a huge improvement in both the appearance and the texture of my hair... The ends had become so damaged from product and sun that they turned blonde (I&#x27;m a brunette), but now after using just a tiny bit of this every day my hair looks completely healthy!!  I highly recommend it if your hair takes a lot of damaging product and you need something light and easy to add moisture!!</li>
    <li> THE BOTTLE CAME OPENED AND SPILLED ALL OVER MY SUEDE COUCH! I SUBMITTED THE CLAIM AND AFFIDAVIT OVER A STUPID $14 ITEM AND THEY CLAIM I DIDNT AND PRETEND TO KNOW NOTHING OF IT! I WOULDNT KNOW ABOUT THE PRODUCT BECAUSE IT WAS USELESS BUT THE COMPANY IS A LIER AND DOESNT RESPECT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND DONT BOTHER CONTACTING THEM THEY PRETEND THEY KNOW NOTHING OF IT AFTER TELLING YOU ALL THE MULTIPLE STEPS IN ORDER TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!! DISGUSTED BEYOND BELIEF!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it leaves my hair so soft and manageable.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if your hair is damaged or not..it still makes it look great!</li>
    <li> Typically, I wear my hair very short and straight.... This leave-in, even with a straight perm, curls my hair up quick fast and easy with no work at all, and keeps it the softest EVER!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> i have used this terax product off and on for ten years.  it smells good, and fresh and leaves my hair in good condition.  i have relaxed hair and it needs all the help it can get.  the price was excellent and the product arrived early. thank you. i will order from you again.</li>
    <li> I had read about this on a hair care forum, where it was recommended for fine-haired wavy and curly gals who need extra protein.  I decided to try it out, and am so glad I did!  After using it just once, my waves (which had been looking rather straight) curled right up, and it left my hair feeling really soft and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviewers on other websites had mentioned that the smell of this could be off-putting, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be too strong or odorous at all.  Once applied in my hair, I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how this plays well with other hair products.  I&#x27;ve been experimenting by layering various brands of curl cremes and gels over it, and it doesn&#x27;t flake up or act strangely at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the amount to use, I&#x27;ve been using two dime-sized amounts on my shoulder-length hair.  I may increase the amount to make sure I really get all my hair covered.  I&#x27;ve also just been raking it through my hair with my fingers, but I might try a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re following the Curly Girl method of no silicone or sulfates (see [[ASIN:B004NH5D9O {CURLY GIRL BY Massey, Lorraine(Author)}Curly Girl: The Handbook [With DVD] (Expanded)[paperback]Workman Publishing(Publisher)]], this product is also Curly-Girl-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great everyday leave-in that gives fine hair the protein it needs.  It&#x27;s going on my Holy Grail list of hair products for sure!</li>
    <li> Product was received on time and in great condition.  The lid of the bottle was tapped shut to avoid leakage.  The product is a light conditioner and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel sticky.  I would buy this product again from this seller.</li>
    <li> great product. I would recommend this product to my frinds for sure. I have very fine curly hair that is frizzy &amp; dry</li>
    <li> I tried this product and didn&#x27;t like it all, it was a very watery, and didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING or change my hair at all, so I sent it back, got a refund, and left a review of what I thought of this product, the customer service manager from Newvo Beauty contacted me and asked me to remove my negative review in exchange for a replacement FREE OF CHARGE, so I agreed and removed it. I waited 3 weeks, NEVER got my replacement as promised, contacted Newvo Beauty a couple times with no reply. Newvo Beauty is a scam and rip off.</li>
    <li> Great product. Quick delivery. Photo is deceiving--but I prefer spray leave in conditioners anyway, so for me, all around great experience.</li>
    <li> Product that was sent to me was in a pump bottle and not the liquid as seen in advertised illustration.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my damaged, lifeless hair soft as silk and doesn&#x27;t strip color. Other leave-ins have dimethicone or other ingredients that leave my thin, fine hair limp and greasy looking. Even the smallest amount would leave me greasy. Not Life Drops! I rub a nickel-sized amount into the ends and let my hair air dry. Feels smooth and silky, not greasy. I hope it never gets discontinued. It&#x27;s getting more and more difficult to find.</li>
    <li> NOTHING like it to make your hair smell so good!</li>
    <li> THis product has been reformulated and repackaged. THe new formula iis a bit smelly; smells like eggs. It is still helping my hair soften after washing with very hard water here in the south where the water comes from reservoirs. I will try finding a replacement. THe company that sold it was professional and prompt.</li>
    <li> Love these drops for my hair.  Can feel the nutrients soaking in when I apply them. The smell is very clean, &amp; does not weigh my hair down a bit.</li>
    <li> I read so many great reviews about this product, I just had to give it a try.  Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t for me.  It&#x27;s really watery so 15 minutes after putting it on, my hair was so dry.  After an hour, my hair was a big puff ball.  I have thick, curly hair and this product did nothing for it.  Reading the reviews, it seems to work on some people, but not everyone.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it didn&#x27;t seem to improve the texture of my hair at all. I guess I was expecting my hair to be smoother, or shinier, or healthier looking. None of that happened. I will keep using my Nexxus Headress Leave-in.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product really helps keep the frizz away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice while not being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is good for travel since it is more leakproof than most other types of containers.</li>
    <li> It did not do much to help.  In the 60&#x27;s I purchased a product called Life by Nutritonics for my hair and it was amazing, I was hoping this would be the same product since they went out of business.  This was no better than normal conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is really great stuff. I wash my hair, towel dry and put this on. My hair is smooth, smells good and is tangle free with no build up of any kind. It will actually improve the strength and shine of your hair and the stops the effect of humidity. A nice product. I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I take reasonably good care of my hair and it is not super dry. I use Life Drops as a detangler and very lightweight leave-in conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel gummy or oily and makes it noticeably silkier. I find that a bottle lasts a very long time, since you only need a small amount. Probably won&#x27;t do a lot for damaged or curly hair, but a good product for healthy, straight hair in need of a little extra help.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product , it felt no difference in my hair .  I would not purchase again because it dose not work for me.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product! It came promptly and was in good condition. In reviews I read there were complaints about the product leaking but the lid was taped shut so there were no leaks.  The product makes a big difference in the areas of my hair that are VERY fried &amp; frizzy from another product I tried as a means to protect my hair when using my flat iron.  This product works well and the only draw back is the smell-kind of industrial smelling.  I prefer this to highly perfumed products I have tried!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure this stuff does what it claims to do. I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Moroccan oil, and while life drops is ok, it&#x27;ll never replace Moroccan oil. It didn&#x27;t repair my hair, but it didn&#x27;t cause any problems either. I like this stuff, and it has a sweet cocoa smell that&#x27;s to die for, but I don&#x27;t know if it works as well as I need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** update: I used this with the daily conditioner &amp; the combination of the two products left my hair incredibly soft! I guess this line is meant to be used together. Either way, this is now part of my weekend hair treatment. Try the shampoo, conditioner and life drops - your hair will look, smell and feel amazing! ***</li>
