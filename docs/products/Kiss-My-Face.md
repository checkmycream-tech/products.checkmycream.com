      <li>But this stuff is really that damn good.</li>
      <li>too.also easy to spread</li>
      <li>I wish the ingredients were slightly more natural, but otherwise a good product.</li>
      <li>Something strong.</li>
      <li>It smells fine -- not too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easy with a light coat.</li>
      <li>It applies easily to the face and provides a smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>I was a huge fan of the Vanilla Shave.</li>
      <li>Feels smooth afterwards.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light which I prefer.</li>
      <li>so much I changed my rating to 5 stars, and the scent is kind of growing on me....</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a fantastic shave you need to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>Does a good job, I get less nicks, and it&#x27;s better ingredients than most out on the market.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m not knocking Cade, Cade is great, expensive, but great)</li>
      <li>It gives a smooth clean shave, moisturizes and leaves your face feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry-out your face and rinses cleanly and quickly ....</li>
      <li>This shaving cream washes off the blade pretty easily between swipes.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your face as conditioned as the top two performers but does a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell of this shave cream is what I would want on my face every morning - A light clean fresh smell like from a high end spa.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll give Gillette credit, ever since they gave me that free Mach 3 razor in high school</li>
      <li>The Dead Sea Minerals shaving gel I tried is better -- it washes off easier and leaves my skin feeling better -- but it costs like three times the price.  </li>
      <li>First, just as a heads up, the 3.4 oz container does not come in the pump as the picture shows, it comes in a tube.</li>
      <li>Even after shaving the same spot 3-4 times to get those most stubborn whiskers.</li>
      <li>First, the price.</li>
      <li>It tells you exactly whats in it.</li>
      <li>My most recent purchases have seemed to be of lower quality than before the Palmolive take over</li>
      <li>After applying a dab of this stuff and working it into a slight lather, you will get the most comfortable shave ever, and will not get the slightest razor burn.</li>
      <li>Great ( light) scent, soft texture and non- irritating.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who needs a strong potion to (un)tangle and conquer that facial hair that is running your life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> First, just as a heads up, the 3.4 oz container does not come in the pump as the picture shows, it comes in a tube. Just so you know....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was searching for a shave cream for sensitive areas that didnt have ingredients that would dry out my skin, or be too scented, or have a bunch of synthetics in it. Sensitive areas are the LAST place you need any of that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creams, in my opinion, work much better than gels. I think they do a better job at lifting the hairs to get you a closer shave. I have tried many of these with varying results. L&#x27;occitane Cade shave cream, which is made for men, is great. I would say, however that it (along with most others I have tried, BTW: I&#x27;m not knocking Cade, Cade is great, expensive, but great) is a definite runner up to Kiss My Face&#x27;s Moisture Shave Green Tea &amp; Bamboo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It (and others)is (are) a runner up for several reasons. First, the price. Kiss My Face was a bargain compaired to Cade, and most other brands, unless you are considering the stuff that comes in a can that foams out, which is ok as long as you arent using it on sensitive areas and dont read the ingredients...Second, the scent, Kiss My Face Green Tea and Bamboo smells great. It is not overpowering or artificial smelling. It just smells, good, clean. Third, I have not noticed any irritatation using it on sensitive areas. It actually leaves the skin feeling moisturized. Finally, take a look at the ingredients. Go to kiss my face&#x27;s website and look up this Shave Cream. It tells you exactly whats in it. Plenty of good for you, skin soothing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a hint...after I wet my skin I later on this shave cream--not on dry skin--a little goes a suprisingly long way. I like to let it sit for a minute before shaving because I think it lifts the hairs and moisturizes the skin better that way...IDK it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also finding that the area stay smoother a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay Kiss My Face! I love it!</li>
    <li> I was a huge fan of the Vanilla Shave. This is the only shave product I will use. Great shave, no irritation.</li>
    <li> Just tried it today and love it. Would give it 5 stars but not crazy about the smell, lot stronger than I expected. Will get a different scent, or unscented, next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Love this stuff so much I changed my rating to 5 stars, and the scent is kind of growing on me....</li>
    <li> If you like Norelco rotary razor, you know it sometimes feels like you are shaving with a lawnmower. After applying a dab of this stuff and working it into a slight lather, you will get the most comfortable shave ever, and will not get the slightest razor burn. Even after shaving the same spot 3-4 times to get those most stubborn whiskers. Allows you to get as close a shave as the straight blade razor, but you will never say &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t touch my face honey, I just got done shaving.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ashamed it took me about 12 years of shaving to figure out there might be a way to do it without the nicks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give Gillette credit, ever since they gave me that free Mach 3 razor in high school they&#x27;ve been my go-to company for shaving products.  For a decade or so I&#x27;ve been buying their razors, shaving cream, shave gel, and after shave.  It never really occurred to me to try other products and compare the results.  So, for a decade or so I&#x27;ve tolerated nicks, overpriced razor cartridges, and often a disappointing shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully Amazon&#x27;s Woot.com expanded my mind.  It&#x27;s a deal-a-day website that sells discounted products and is built around a community of shoppers sharing experiences and snarky comments.  One day about a year ago Woot sold the &amp;#34;King of Shaves&amp;#34; razor with many refills for about $8.  That is many times cheaper than the equivalent I&#x27;d get from Gillette.  The razor itself is a bit funky the first few times you use it, but the razor alone cut down on the nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s where the Kiss My Face shave lotion comes in.  I was about ready to give up on the King of Shaves razor because it clogs up with whiskers and becomes nearly useless after one a week or two of shaving...when using &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shaving cream or gel.  So I referred to the comments section on Woot to see what other buyers thought of the razor.  Many suggested using shave lotion for a better shave.  And the most commonly suggested lotion: Kiss My Face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased some and I am very pleased.  It smells great, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and it works!  I get an incredibly close shave, I almost never nick myself, and I can use my cheap Woot razor blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to expanding one&#x27;s mind and getting a better shave!</li>
    <li> Travel acceptable (I think) size of an excellent shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Great, fresh smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  A pea-size dab in your hand, rubbed until it lathers, goes a long way. I&#x27;m sad I didn&#x27;t discover this sooner!</li>
    <li> I like it, girlfriend likes it. What more could I want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and it&#x27;s cheap considering how long a small tube lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if only Kiss My Face could make some razor cartridges...</li>
    <li> Gets a great lather and provides excellent lubrication even without using a brush.  I am not fond of the scent but thats minor</li>
    <li> I think this shave cream is good for the price.  The Dead Sea Minerals shaving gel I tried is better -- it washes off easier and leaves my skin feeling better -- but it costs like three times the price.  This shaving cream washes off the blade pretty easily between swipes.  It smells fine -- not too strong for me.  It&#x27;s natural, and it does leave your face feeling more moisturized, but also my skin felt a little more irritated when I put on my aftershave compared to when I use the Dead Sea Minerals gel or Cremo shave cream instead.</li>
    <li> The smell is decent and the cream is certainly convenient, but it did not &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; the way I&#x27;m used to with other brands such as Proraso. I took it out of regular rotation and plan to use it for various away trips or in between other brands.</li>
    <li> The best on the market.  you will love this stuff</li>
    <li> I love this brand. and this scent is great!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I use it for shaving my legs in the shower. Does not leave a residue but does not moisturize either.  W I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
    <li> If you are not getting enough hormone system disrupting chemicals in your diet this is not the product for you. It gives a smooth clean shave, moisturizes and leaves your face feeling fresh. Its unbelievable that parabens in all their varied forms are still in 90% of the soaps, cosmetics and shaving creams sold in America. Tell corporate America where to put their chemicals and switch to Kiss My Face.</li>
    <li> I have been an Art of the Shave user for many years.  I buy both on line and at their stores.  My most recent purchases have seemed to be of lower quality than before the Palmolive take over (maybe just my imagination).&lt;br /&gt;But, I do know that after trying &amp;#34;Kiss My Face&amp;#34; shave cream I find it to be at least as good, maybe better, and the cost is less than 1/3 of the cost of the Art of the Shave, and Art of the Shave charges shipping while Kiss My Face does not, making it even less expensive.</li>
    <li> Forget the gel and foam brands typical of men&#x27;s shaving products.  This KMF is a joy to shave with.  This is true of ALL the others I bought including the fragrance-free and peaceful patchouli.  If it does contain a fragrance, it is so subtle you hardly catch a whiff of any scent.  Doesn&#x27;t dry-out your face and rinses cleanly and quickly .... no sticky after touch.  Great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this so for me that is a five.  He likes the scent, I love it.  Husband says it foams nicely.  He likes to use a lot of cream so am not sure how long it will last. Works better than either of us expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on reading numerous blogs on wet shaving with a safety razor and expected more.  The smell is pleasant and has decent lubricity, but no lathercould be generated by my badger brush.  I am extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this shaving cream, in this scent and this  packaging. He is particular about scents so now that I have found one he likes, it is great.</li>
    <li> It takes a few times to get used to as how much to apply and it dries fast... BUT, once you do, its an Amazing Product. I love it.</li>
    <li> This shave cream smells wonderful! It&#x27;s not over bearing and actually is calming. My husband uses it all the time, and has mixed course hair and this cream helps soften the hair and his skin! We will buy again especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Works great. I use a shaving brush to apply. The fragrance is light which I prefer. KMF works so well you don&#x27;t really need an aftershave.</li>
    <li> This is some of the most versatile shaving cream out there. It works best with a shaving brush, but it also works better &amp;#34;brushless&amp;#34; than any other cream I&#x27;ve tried. Great smell, creamy goodness to protect your skin while shaving. They offer several scents but the Green Tea &amp; Bamboo is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I wish the ingredients were slightly more natural, but otherwise a good product. Does a good job, I get less nicks, and it&#x27;s better ingredients than most out on the market.</li>
    <li> The smell of this shave cream is what I would want on my face every morning - A light clean fresh smell like from a high end spa.  As a shave cream it&#x27;s performance was just average which means a few other products give a closer shave on a man&#x27;s tough facial hair.  I won&#x27;t be re-ordering but the smell makes me sort of regret that.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample at a trade show and will never use anything else. Very smooth, doesn&#x27;t irritate. Smells great. Lots of scents to choose from. Love \\&quot;Kiss My Face\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Great ( light) scent, soft texture and non- irritating. I have really sensitive skin but am able to use this product everywhere . I have noticed less razor bumps and have no stinging  sensation after shaving.</li>
    <li> There I was, body deep in a shower, when I realized the reason I couldn&#x27;t feel water on my face was because my facial hair had attacked without mercy. I knew I had to take things into my control. I needed something that could let me shave my hairy face. Something strong. Something with moisture. Something that even Chuck Norris&#x27; beard would fear. I found this product nestled in the golden encrusted clouds. It moisturized. It weakened my facial hair just enough that I could lop off my massive face hedge. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a strong potion to (un)tangle and conquer that facial hair that is running your life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a stand! Moisturize and slay(shave) that furry creature off your face!!&lt;br /&gt;Viva la Face!!</li>
    <li> All of my clients have said it&#x27;s the smoothest shave they&#x27;ve ever had with this lotion.easy to see through so you don&#x27;t go over the same spot too much too.also easy to spread so it lasts a while even ina small size</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  It applies easily to the face and provides a smooth shave.  The scent is also pleasant and sufficiently subtle so as not to be distracting.</li>
    <li> Smells good and prevents razor burn</li>
    <li> I just recently picked three new shave creams/gels to compare against The Art of Shaving. Art of Shaving being the undisputed champion. Gillette Foamy Regular being the baseline of just acceptable. Here is the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing is the tool. I have tried the 4 blade Schick and the Mach3 and Fusion. I always return to my trusty Gillette Sensor3 Conditioning[green] disposable. Post shave I use Art of Shaving aftershave [Lemon or Sandalwood]. It runs about $30 a bottle which may seem high but I have been using the same two bottles for over two years. Two pumps is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The Art of Shaving is by far the best. It also costs the most. For the money spent it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It goes on easy with a light coat. It shaves very well and leaves your face feeling soft and nourished from all the conditioners/essential oils it contains. Normally I would scoff at paying $25 for a six month tub of shaving cream [I shave about 3x a week]. But this stuff is really that damn good. It exceeds expectations and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Alba Very Emollient Shave Cream Coconut Lime - This is the next best thing to Art of Shaving. Excellent shave. Very good skin conditioners. The scent is really nice. Finish it off with Art of Shaving Lemon aftershave. And at a price that is 1/4 of Art of Shaving. This one is definitely worth a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Nivea For Men delivers a nice shave. Feels smooth afterwards. It lathers a good amount which is good if you like that. I am now a low foam or no foam fan. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face as conditioned as the top two performers but does a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Bamboo Green Tea - This shave cream is not that much better than Gillette Foamy. Certainly not enough to justify the difference in cost. If you are looking for a fantastic shave you need to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - If you want Ferrarri performance you have to pay top dollar. Here is my car/shave cream analogy:&lt;br /&gt;Ferrarri - Art of Shaving&lt;br /&gt;BMW/Audi - Very Emollient&lt;br /&gt;Honda - Nivea&lt;br /&gt;Chevrolet - Kiss My Face&lt;br /&gt;Pontiac - Gillette Foamyient  Honda - Nivea  Chevrolet - Kiss My Face  Pontiac - Gillette Foamy</li>
    <li> I started using this lotion about 2 yrs ago and have been using it since. The lotion is great for sensitive skin. There are a bunch of different types from Kiss My Face, I&#x27;ve used most of them... I&#x27;ll continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Favorite shaving cream ever</li>
    <li> Really great shave cream.  Not overly scented and works like a dream!  Definitely recommend.... Also try the unscented.  Equally as good.</li>
    <li> this was a Christmas present for my son</li>
