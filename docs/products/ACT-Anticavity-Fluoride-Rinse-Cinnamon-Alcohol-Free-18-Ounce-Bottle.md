      <li>My teeth are nice and this stuff sure in the hell</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all the flavors and I&#x27;ve found that cinnamon is the best for my already sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great, quick, easy way to prevent cavities.</li>
      <li>(I think the makers want you to use it up sooner so that more can be bought)</li>
      <li>- I like the cinnamon flavor better than the mints.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by mt dentist and was glad to find that this came in cinnamon since I prefer it to the others.</li>
      <li>I wish the cinnamon was more pronounced though.</li>
      <li>I have tried a couple of brands and this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It has a convenient top that measures out the correct amount for you.  </li>
      <li>I love cinnamon though, but it felt I was eating another candy rather than mouth wash</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m allergic to it, I&#x27;m sure there will be others.</li>
      <li>This stuff tastes way better than the mint version.</li>
      <li>I love the cinnamon flavor.</li>
      <li>I love ACT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Brush your teeth with your favorite toothpaste and follow up with Act Mouthwash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Act Anti-cavity Mouthwash for many years.  </li>
      <li>Science has shown that Fl exposure to the teeth makes enamel more acid resistant.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it at my favorite grocery stores.  </li>
      <li>I love this flavor and can&#x27;t find it in stores around here.</li>
      <li>Tastes so much better than the mint flavor.</li>
      <li>It just \\&quot;feels\\&quot; like it&#x27;s doing a better job.</li>
      <li>Glad you asked I pull out my Cinnamon mouth wash and stamp out that offensive order.</li>
      <li>My favorite mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Some foods can leave a more strong after taste causing the breath to be offensive.</li>
      <li>Nice mild cinnamon flavor.</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t enjoy going the gym afterwards with the smell of onions, and garlic on my breath.</li>
      <li>Since they don&#x27;t seem to stock it here anymore, it was worth the price just to get my favorite , tolerable flavor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightly cinnamon</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s so smooth with no burn.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this cinnamon alcohol free product in any store in my area</li>
      <li>That said, the Amazon pricing, particularly as an add-on item (2X going price), is definitely not the best.  </li>
      <li>I love the new measuring tool on the top of the bottle as well.</li>
      <li>This product is extremely easy to use,  the Cinnamon flavor tastes great and has other attributes.</li>
      <li>The included cup is fun and easy to use</li>
      <li>So smooth, clean, white, breath smells good too....</li>
      <li>I also get the bubble gum flavor, but it&#x27;s nice to shake it up with different flavors. :)</li>
      <li>I use this rinse every night and it makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
      <li>What if I run into a special lady I want to go on a bike ride with?</li>
      <li>Love the taste and it works really well.</li>
      <li>The method of delivery, squeezing the bottle to deliver a recommend amount into the top portion, controls how much you get each time and ensures that what remains in the bottle is still good for the next time.</li>
      <li>It is super convenient.</li>
      <li>I use a mouthful and a toothbrush for a quick refresh.</li>
      <li>Go with Cinnamon, the natural color of your gums and enjoy a refreshing fluoride experience.</li>
      <li>I go through it quickly</li>
      <li>I particularly like the Cinnamon taste, in that you don&#x27;t get the sensation that you need to spit it back out quickly that you get from the mostly-mint taste competition like Crest, and thus it&#x27;s more effective.  </li>
      <li>Perfect amount of cinnamon flavor, not too dull, not too much.</li>
      <li>Not any mediciny kind of taste like mouthwash and some other anti cavity rinses typically have, and great for your teeth.</li>
      <li>That being said, I love that it has the little squeeze-fill top, like my son&#x27;s bubble gum.</li>
      <li>The cinnamon flavor is not too strong and I like it better than the other choices.  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly, unlike the shockingly strong mint, it is actually quite tame and allows for a full 60-second rinse.</li>
      <li>Mint does not agree with me so I have been happy lately that I can find cinnamon for both my toothpaste and mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>I love Mexican food.</li>
      <li>I actually like the alcohol based better.</li>
      <li>My mother is a dentist and will only use / recommend ACT with no alcohol in order to keep teeth, gums and mouth healthy.</li>
      <li>This flouride rinse does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - coat your teeth in a protective sheath that shrugs off even the most offensive cavity-causing tiny things.</li>
      <li>I am fine around it most of the time, but occasionally, it causes a sudden migraine.  </li>
      <li>It works great when I was using whitening stripes; no more sensitive tooth.</li>
      <li>so I was willing to pay the high price to get this.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer the cinnamon flavor of this ACT over any minty mouthwash.</li>
      <li>&amp; I really like it.</li>
      <li>helps make em that much nicer.</li>
      <li>I like the taste and I particularly like that it premeasures.</li>
      <li>Searched every store locally without success.  </li>
      <li>While I am glad I can actually stand to keep it in my mouth for however long I need, and that my eyes do not water, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is working as well as the stuff that burns.</li>
      <li>Love the little feeder cup that&#x27;s built on the top of the bottle that measures out the right amount of mouthwash (a little goes a long way) and</li>
      <li>We can&#x27;t get either one in stores here where we live.</li>
      <li>if it&#x27;s going to be one of those new, scammy \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; item (I have Prime &amp; got it</li>
      <li>However, it could be a little less sweet, and a little more burn-your-mouth refreshing.</li>
      <li>This has the higher fluoride content of the different formulas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Did you know that some folks are (negatively) sensitive to cinnamon?</li>
      <li>I bought this because I&#x27;m not a huge Mint fan, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find the citrus flavor recently.  </li>
      <li>and it is fun to find it in flavors other than mint.</li>
      <li>I started to use ACT Fluoride Rinse years ago at the recommendation of my dentist (due to the higher fluoride content).  </li>
      <li>The mint left me with such a strong burning sensation, I was never able to complete the recommended rinse time.</li>
      <li>And I just generally like that it&#x27;s alcohol</li>
      <li>Whenever I miss a daily rinse, it&#x27;s nearly intolerable to drink anything that isn&#x27;t room temperature.</li>
      <li>This product does not have the same &amp;#34;kick&amp;#34; that other mouthwash has, but it is extremely gentle all around</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it tastes great!&lt;br /&gt;freshens my breath, does everything it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I have extremely weak enamel so regular flouride rinses are simply a MUST for me. ACT is the only product that takes the throbbing edge off my front teeth. Whenever I miss a daily rinse, it&#x27;s nearly intolerable to drink anything that isn&#x27;t room temperature. I love ACT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all the flavors and I&#x27;ve found that cinnamon is the best for my already sensitive teeth. Surprisingly, unlike the shockingly strong mint, it is actually quite tame and allows for a full 60-second rinse. The mint left me with such a strong burning sensation, I was never able to complete the recommended rinse time.</li>
    <li> Small tube runs down the bottle so you can squeeze it and dispense the proper amount.  Nice feature.</li>
    <li> I started using this after having cavities at my last couple dental checkups.  It has a convenient top that measures out the correct amount for you.  This is the stronger version so it says you only need to use it once a day.  The cinnamon flavor is not too strong and I like it better than the other choices.  You&#x27;re not supposed to eat or drink for 30mins after you use it.</li>
    <li> I started to use ACT Fluoride Rinse years ago at the recommendation of my dentist (due to the higher fluoride content).  I particularly like the Cinnamon taste, in that you don&#x27;t get the sensation that you need to spit it back out quickly that you get from the mostly-mint taste competition like Crest, and thus it&#x27;s more effective.  And Act doesn&#x27;t turn your teeth brown, a problem with some of the competition.  So overall the best of the best.  That said, the Amazon pricing, particularly as an add-on item (2X going price), is definitely not the best.  Unfortunate, usually Amazon pricing is quite competitive, but not in this instance.</li>
    <li> I hate mint flavored so the cinnamon is great. The included cup is fun and easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t burn in my mouth like other mouthwashes</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m not a huge Mint fan, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find the citrus flavor recently.  I will say that I DO like the flavor.  However, this product made me break out into very painful canker sores!  I had to stop using it after a week. :(  I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t buy this.  I&#x27;m just saying BEWARE!  If I&#x27;m allergic to it, I&#x27;m sure there will be others.</li>
    <li> This product works well and is recommended by my dentist.  I personally wish it did not have the coloring and excess flavor.</li>
    <li> Somehow the cinnamon taste doesn&#x27;t leave the sense of freshness after using it. I love cinnamon though, but it felt I was eating another candy rather than mouth wash</li>
    <li> Searched every store locally without success.  Though perhaps they didn&#x27;t make it anymore.  Amazon to the rescue.  Have always hated the mint flavoring in tooth care products.  Needed a good fluoride rinse and have always liked ACT.  Nice mild cinnamon flavor.</li>
    <li> As a dentist myself, I can only applaud the use of this preventive product. Science has shown that Fl exposure to the teeth makes enamel more acid resistant. Thus fewer cavities. This product is extremely easy to use,  the Cinnamon flavor tastes great and has other attributes. I even use it in the reservoir in my AirFloss!</li>
    <li> It works great when I was using whitening stripes; no more sensitive tooth.</li>
    <li> My mother is a dentist and will only use / recommend ACT with no alcohol in order to keep teeth, gums and mouth healthy. This product does not have the same &amp;#34;kick&amp;#34; that other mouthwash has, but it is extremely gentle all around and it is fun to find it in flavors other than mint. I love the new measuring tool on the top of the bottle as well.</li>
    <li> Recommended by mt dentist and was glad to find that this came in cinnamon since I prefer it to the others. I wish the cinnamon was more pronounced though. The method of delivery, squeezing the bottle to deliver a recommend amount into the top portion, controls how much you get each time and ensures that what remains in the bottle is still good for the next time. Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Since they don&#x27;t seem to stock it here anymore, it was worth the price just to get my favorite , tolerable flavor.</li>
    <li> Great flavor, cool dispensing bottle, product works great and have not had a cavities since using the ACT Anticavity Florida Rinse.</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes way better than the mint version. I love the cinnamon flavor. I use this rinse every night and it makes my teeth feel clean. It&#x27;s a great, quick, easy way to prevent cavities. Beats going to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  I don&#x27;t fill the tip fully (I think the makers want you to use it up sooner so that more can be bought) and I feel like my teeth are getting the benefits, just the same.  No alcohol and tastes great.</li>
    <li> I love this flavor and can&#x27;t find it in stores around here.</li>
    <li> Mint is my enemy.  I am fine around it most of the time, but occasionally, it causes a sudden migraine.  (I have fibromyalgia.)  This means it is nigh impossible to track down dental products that are cinnamon.  This is about it!  I can&#x27;t answer for the scientific side of the effects, but the taste is pleasant!</li>
    <li> My favorite mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Did you know that some folks are (negatively) sensitive to cinnamon? Well, turns out I am, so sad. I like the taste.</li>
    <li> Why would anyone want a fluoride rinse that was colored green or blue.  Go with Cinnamon, the natural color of your gums and enjoy a refreshing fluoride experience.</li>
    <li> Best damn mouthwash I have used to date. Taste is excellent with a nice flavor of cinnamon that&#x27;s so smooth with no burn. Love the little feeder cup that&#x27;s built on the top of the bottle that measures out the right amount of mouthwash (a little goes a long way) and the product seems to last awhile even with daily use. Brush your teeth with your favorite toothpaste and follow up with Act Mouthwash. You should actually brush your teeth with the Mouthwash in your mouth then spit out and don&#x27;t rinse with water. That&#x27;s how you get things done Son. My teeth are nice and this stuff sure in the hell helps make em that much nicer. So smooth, clean, white, breath smells good too.... Oh Yeah Baby!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> At my dentist&#x27;s suggestion, I purchased ACT because I needed a fluoride rinse to use with my non-fluoride toothpaste.  The cinnamon tastes great, and there&#x27;s no sting at all because it&#x27;s alcohol free.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again as soon as this runs out.</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of cinnamon flavor, not too dull, not too much. Not any mediciny kind of taste like mouthwash and some other anti cavity rinses typically have, and great for your teeth.</li>
    <li> I much prefer the cinnamon flavor of this ACT over any minty mouthwash. However, it could be a little less sweet, and a little more burn-your-mouth refreshing. While I am glad I can actually stand to keep it in my mouth for however long I need, and that my eyes do not water, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is working as well as the stuff that burns. I would like to have seen this somewhere between the two extremes. That being said, I love that it has the little squeeze-fill top, like my son&#x27;s bubble gum. It is super convenient. I just hope it is doing what it claims, as I still have my tastebuds, so I cannot vouch for effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Tastes so much better than the mint flavor. My dentist requested me to use ACT</li>
    <li> This  cinnamon-flavored fluoride rinse is greatly preferred because of its &amp;#34;non-mint&amp;#34; flavor. I have used this type of product for several years on the advice of my dentist but dislike the usual mint flavors.</li>
    <li> Not available in stores, so had to get this on Amazon. Love the taste and it works really well. I use it as part of the Dr. Ellie&#x27;s teeth whitening program. I also get the bubble gum flavor, but it&#x27;s nice to shake it up with different flavors. :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I can&#x27;t find it at my favorite grocery stores.  So, thank you Amazon!  I like the measuring cap.  I use a mouthful and a toothbrush for a quick refresh.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this product from Amazon. However, like one of the other reviewers, this product made me break out in canker sores all over my mouth. apparently it is not a common reaction but it is very painful when it occurs.</li>
    <li> I ordered this bc it says &amp;#34;no alcohol&amp;#34; but it does have alcohol!!!</li>
    <li> Our family uses this after brushing and flossing before Listerine.  Our dentist feels we have excellent dental hygiene and feel we enjoy the products we use.</li>
    <li> This flouride rinse does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - coat your teeth in a protective sheath that shrugs off even the most offensive cavity-causing tiny things. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all, which is a bit disappointing, because with that alcohol burn you know NOTHING SURVIVED, but it works well and tastes good nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Great stuff ... always use this.  I hate that I have to write a required amount of words on these damn review.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> good Cinnamon flavor, as I remembered.  This flavor and size generally not available in local stores.  Stores stock up on giant bottles in minty flavors.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this cinnamon alcohol free product in any store in my area so I was willing to pay the high price to get this.  I simply can&#x27;t use the mint flavors</li>
    <li> Some foods can leave a more strong after taste causing the breath to be offensive. For example a chimichanga or garlic. The after taste from coffee smells like lake water from a neighborhood park. I remember this onetime at church during the meet and great it smelled like coffee everywhere. I soon realized a solution to the area of opportunity. ACT Anti cavity Fluoride Rinse, Cinnamon. This invigorating Cinnamon Mouth Wash will IMMEDIATELY remove all the offensive smells.  I love Mexican food. And I don&#x27;t enjoy going the gym afterwards with the smell of onions, and garlic on my breath. What if I run into a special lady I want to go on a bike ride with? So what do I do? Glad you asked I pull out my Cinnamon mouth wash and stamp out that offensive order. It taste wonderful but trust me from experience please do not drink it.  Your mouth will thank you for giving it the experience of a lifetime. Cinnamon Mouthwash recommend by the American Dental Association.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like mint, so this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> Mint does not agree with me so I have been happy lately that I can find cinnamon for both my toothpaste and mouthwash.  I have tried a couple of brands and this is my favorite.  I go through it quickly so my only knock on this is that I cannot find a bigger version.  At least Prime keeps me from paying shipping charges so it doesn&#x27;t cost me anything but inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Act Anti-cavity Mouthwash for many years.  Recommended to me by my dentist office and have had only one cavity in all these years.  I prefer the Cinnamon flavor but they&#x27;re all effective.  Try it!!!  They also have a kids kind too.</li>
    <li> The cinnamon mouthwash we had before was alcohol based. This was not, Therefore we didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I actually like the alcohol based better. It just \\&quot;feels\\&quot; like it&#x27;s doing a better job. We can&#x27;t get either one in stores here where we live.</li>
    <li> weak cinnamon flavor,double the local store price?</li>
    <li> Great taste....the protection against cavities is a plus.</li>
    <li> I like the taste and I particularly like that it premeasures.</li>
    <li> This has the higher fluoride content of the different formulas.&lt;br /&gt;I get this at the grocery store but thought maybe I could get it here instead - I like the cinnamon flavor better than the mints.  And I just generally like that it&#x27;s alcohol free.&lt;br /&gt;But if it&#x27;s going to be one of those new, scammy \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; item (I have Prime &amp; got it so I&#x27;d get shipping on *anything* which they have now reneged on), then it shouldn&#x27;t be double the cost of the grocery store price!!</li>
    <li> This rinse does not burn my mouth like the green one does.  It&#x27;s lightly cinnamon &amp; I really like it.</li>
