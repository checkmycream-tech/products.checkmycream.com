      <li>My hair does look and feel better.</li>
      <li>I do switch the nozzle out because this manufacturer likes a stream better than a spray, and I prefer it going evenly in my hair.</li>
      <li>product is just ok.  </li>

      <li>if I&#x27;m happy enough with it to order it again.  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with this product right from the get-go.</li>
      <li>I have been using the 15 in 1 hair treatment since it first hit the market  and love the results.  </li>
      <li>Great product, just as I expected.  </li>
      <li>and I have a FULL head of hair.</li>
      <li>Way too artificially sweet, reminds me of a cotton candy scented kid&#x27;s body spray</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this isn&#x27;t the real product.</li>
      <li>A little expensive,but it works great.</li>
      <li>The amazing scene lasts all day and it helps keep my hairstyle looking the way it is intended to look without the use of too many harsh chemicals or sprays.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I really get all 15 benefits listed on the bottle, but the benefits I do get makes it well worth it!</li>
      <li>I have colored my fine hair for many years and it is dry</li>
      <li>Luckily I just landed myself a new job and the first thing I did was sprint over to Amazon and look for this product and what luck that it was on sale for $10!</li>
      <li>ends are super dry and frizzy while the top of the head is greazy like I haven&#x27;t been to shower for a week.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair-especially the ends, feels so soft and looks so smooth</li>
      <li>I was willing to give it a go.</li>
      <li>It really does everything they say it does for my hair...and the shine!!It IS worth the price....</li>
      <li>some of the reviews people have said they had thin or fine hair and they loved it</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure it probably does better for them as opposed to thick, colored hair.</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair and this makes my hair feel silky smooth without weighing it down - works as a nice detangler, too :)</li>
      <li>I certainly do.</li>
      <li>The benefits seemed promising</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to those that need help taming their hair!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much this had to do with it.</li>
      <li>It really reduces frizz and makes my hair shine.</li>
      <li>I was really amazed at this product.  </li>
      <li>so much hair&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I had never heard of it, so I tried it and it REALLY WORKS.</li>
      <li>With no income coming in and student loans looming, I had to give up several expenditures including this great (but a little pricey!)</li>
      <li>Just like too many other products on the market.</li>
      <li>There are other products are in grocery stores that are better than this.</li>
      <li>But if your ends are all askew or frizzy, I find the new L&#x27;Oreal products work much better.</li>
      <li>It was full of volume and extra shiny.</li>
      <li>Really love the Black products for my hair.</li>
      <li>I really love Miracle Hair Treatment Black 15 in 1.  </li>
      <li>My ends also look a lot more moisturized and less raggedy.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve got a few more days to use it before I can really tell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a whole host of different products to try to mitigate this mess on top of my head, but could never find anything that could really give me the results I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Live at beach &amp; this helps with humidity, plus manageability, shine, frizz.</li>
      <li>but I would love to use it more but afraid it would be counterproductive.</li>
      <li>Gets rid of frizzies, helps color last much longer, and I even noticed new hair growth at temples!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, especially to those whose hair tangle easily after being wet.</li>
      <li>and I was about to reorder when I saw several reviews for the \\&quot;Black 15 in 1 Miracle!\\&quot; and decided to try it to see if it was better than what I had been using ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>This is not the original black.</li>
      <li>It also allows my hair to manageable and non-frizzy, but gives it volume instead of other products that leave your hair super soft...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a redhead with a lot of natural highlights.  </li>
      <li>, I just don&#x27;t like the initial spray because it&#x27;s too much.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of natural wave in my hair that can be come frizzy in damp weather.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Makes my hair super shiny and healthy looking</li>
    <li> This hair treatment is really good it does all the things it says but one thing i realllyyyyy don&#x27;t like is i don&#x27;t like the smell it irratates me to know im using something that smells bad... :( otherwise i love but i will use it tho....</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Amazon.com after using it as a gift from my niece who is an excellent stylist. She, her clients and her friends all have BEAUTIFUL hair. She told me that she uses \\&quot;Black\\&quot;. I had never heard of it, so I tried it and it REALLY WORKS. All the tangles relax immediately as it is applied. No pulling or tugging, it allows you to easily comb through the hair. I highly recommend it, especially to those whose hair tangle easily after being wet. I don&#x27;t think&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ll regret it. I give it a 5!</li>
    <li> I have colored my fine hair for many years and it is dry but most conditioners leave it&lt;br /&gt;On the limp side.  This product works wonders.  I have found that less works more.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it. gives great shine and body. You must try it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Not easy to get locally.</li>
    <li> this is a waste of  money. I used it and it did nothing for my hair .My hair remained frizzy and unruly</li>
    <li> Great product my hair feels much softer from using this product! Would recommend to anyone with dry or damaged hair</li>
    <li> I have very long-not far from waist length, thick, colored, naturally wavy hair that I blow dry and flat iron almost daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Pequi Oil before I tried this and I had just run out and I was about to reorder when I saw several reviews for the \\&quot;Black 15 in 1 Miracle!\\&quot; and decided to try it to see if it was better than what I had been using ([[ASIN:B004P2JGW2 Couture Colour Pequi Oil Treatment 2 oz]] is a little pricey).  Nope!  I&#x27;ve already made another order for my Pequi Oil treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is just ok.  It isn&#x27;t amazing and it kind of makes my hair want to tangle later in the day.  It does help detangle after washing but that&#x27;s not impressive to me. My hair isn&#x27;t anymore shiny or manageable than it was, in fact, maybe a little less so than before and it definitely does not help with frizz control as much as other products I&#x27;ve used.  I will probably end up using this as a detangler for my dog when I run out of hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On some of the reviews people have said they had thin or fine hair and they loved it so I&#x27;m sure it probably does better for them as opposed to thick, colored hair.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I hoped tho n I don&#x27;t feel it protects my hair from hear like it claims</li>
    <li> I was really amazed at this product.  It really does everything they say it does for my hair...and the shine!!It IS worth the price....</li>
    <li> Does all it says it will do. Use it before styling, after styling and sometimes in afternoon for a touch up. Live at beach &amp; this helps with humidity, plus manageability, shine, frizz. Best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Really love the Black products for my hair.</li>
    <li> I really love Miracle Hair Treatment Black 15 in 1.  I color, highlight, blow dry and flat iron my hair.  I needed something to strengthen my hair and this works amazingly.  The bottle is small ~ but you just need a little.  I highly recommend this for people like me that are hard on their hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It really reduces frizz and makes my hair shine. It does all it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I have been using the 15 in 1 hair treatment since it first hit the market  and love the results.  I color, blow dry and use a curling iron on my hair but this keeps it looking and feeling great.  Less is best though.  A few spritzes and work it through the hair works best.  You can&#x27;t beat the price at amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product; light weight styling product and nice detangler smooth frizzies</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair and this makes my hair feel silky smooth without weighing it down - works as a nice detangler, too :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for someone else as a gift/stocking stuffer, so I have not personally used it my self. But, the comment I received from this person was that it made her hair feel &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is not the original black. I have been buying this from my hair salon for years and then decided to buy it online. It smells like a horrible chemical and it made my scalp itchy. I have no clue what is in the bottle!</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s not a miracle. My hair does look and feel better. I&#x27;ve only used it twice. I think I need to have more time to use the product.</li>
    <li> The product does nothing as promised- the hair is not moisturized or shiny. In fact, after using this product it became dry as hay!!&lt;br /&gt;The ends are super dry and frizzy while the top of the head is greazy like I haven&#x27;t been to shower for a week.&lt;br /&gt;A rip off.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be better of without it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Of course, Amazon is, as well! Quick delivery and good prices, as always!</li>
    <li> I have hip-length, (naturally) dark layered hair that gets very oily at the roots. I will admit I&#x27;m not a hair person at all, I&#x27;ve tried a handful of products like this one but I generally just let my hair be because too much product and my freshly-washed hair is a puddle of grease within a day and a half. Lately my hair has been looking rough at the ends because I&#x27;ve gone too long without a hair cut. I&#x27;ve also had volume issues because it&#x27;s pretty heavy due to the length. I bought this after reading a few reviews around the web, for around $15 I was willing to give it a go. I&#x27;m now on my second bottle of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;After washing and wringing my hair out, I spray this product on my damp hair and comb it through with a Tangle Teezer (the ONLY brush I use on wet hair--HIGHLY recommend that brush [http://www.amazon.com/Tangle-Teezer-Brush-Original-Professional/dp/B001S261Q6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1358796236&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;tangle+teezer]). I give it a few minutes to sit, then I blow dry my hair with a huge round brush. Besides Shampoo and Conditioner, this is the only product I use on my hair and I&#x27;ve been loving the difference it&#x27;s made since incorporating it into my routine.&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product is extremely lightweight. I concentrate it mostly from the middle of my hair length to the ends and just give my roots a few squirts and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. I can&#x27;t speak for the volumizing aspect this product provides, because while my hair has been more volumized lately I also switched my hair brush and blow drying technique, so I don&#x27;t know how much this had to do with it. But more than anything, I like how it makes my hair look and feel. It imparts a lot of shine and makes my hair feel SO soft (which is a biggie for me). My ends also look a lot more moisturized and less raggedy. It&#x27;s not the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; hair product it claims to be, but if you looked at my hair Before and After, you&#x27;d notice a difference. I certainly do. For going on five months without a hair cut this product has definitely improved my hair&#x27;s look and overall health.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not much I don&#x27;t like about this product except for the smell. Ugh. Way too artificially sweet, reminds me of a cotton candy scented kid&#x27;s body spray I wore way back when. It goes away quickly enough and doesn&#x27;t linger, I just don&#x27;t like the initial spray because it&#x27;s too much. I also have to use a lot of this product, I went through the first bottle in a little under two months at 2-3 uses a week. It&#x27;s not really a con, and that&#x27;s a decent amount of time for something to last I suppose. Just something to note.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product!  It is amazing. It keeps my hair healthy and frizz free. I have never had a bad hair day when using this product. I am close to throwing away all the other products I have for my hair and using this one 100% of the time.</li>
    <li> This stuff really helps tame the frizzies!</li>
    <li> Just like too many other products on the market. It leaves my hair dull, not shiny.  I have never colored my hair so I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference.  I&#x27;m a redhead with a lot of natural highlights.  My hair has a lot of shine to it naturally, but it is beginning to become dry and dull with age.  I have a lot of natural wave in my hair that can be come frizzy in damp weather.  I bought this product to help tame the frizz and help with the dryness.  It makes my hair darker and with a lot less shine.</li>
    <li> Im still not 100% sure what this stuff is, but it really is amazing. My hair-especially the ends, feels so soft and looks so smooth and yet it doesnt make my hair go flat. Love it! And the price is great. I was actually hesitant bc i am used to the really good stuff being so pricey..But all I can say is: it works!</li>
    <li> There are other products are in grocery stores that are better than this. If you hair needs only a little smoothing, this would work. But if your ends are all askew or frizzy, I find the new L&#x27;Oreal products work much better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way that this product makes my hair smells. It also allows my hair to manageable and non-frizzy, but gives it volume instead of other products that leave your hair super soft...yet flat and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have &amp;#34;Asian&amp;#34; hair but instead of having my hair smooth and &amp;#34;not so much hair&amp;#34; I have the type of Asian hair with somewhat thin strands and I have a FULL head of hair. The amazing scene lasts all day and it helps keep my hairstyle looking the way it is intended to look without the use of too many harsh chemicals or sprays.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommends this to hold my color. And it works.</li>
    <li> A little expensive,but it works great. Wish it came in larger size. So get two when you order. One for home and one for travel.</li>
    <li> I have been cursed my whole life with dry, tangled hair. I&#x27;ve tried a whole host of different products to try to mitigate this mess on top of my head, but could never find anything that could really give me the results I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first heard about Black 15 in 1 before they even started selling the product. The benefits seemed promising and I kept my eye on the product until they finally started selling it on their website. Once I got it, I couldn&#x27;t go without it! It keeps my hair hydrated, soft, and shiny. I don&#x27;t know if I really get all 15 benefits listed on the bottle, but the benefits I do get makes it well worth it! If I can resist the urge to straighten my hair, the benefits are even more unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 6 months ago I graduated college and had to quit my job. With no income coming in and student loans looming, I had to give up several expenditures including this great (but a little pricey!) product. Luckily I just landed myself a new job and the first thing I did was sprint over to Amazon and look for this product and what luck that it was on sale for $10! I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but already my hair has gotten significantly softer and more managable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have pretty short hair and put this on my wet hair after every shower. The bottle is tiny but lasts me about a month. If you have longer hair, it might become a bit too pricey to use it all the time. But I think even once or twice a week will give noticeable effects.</li>
    <li> Wow, it&#x27;s no wonder you read about this product in beauty blogs. It works! Just a few sprays on damp hair before I blow dry does the trick. Very impressed....</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have ever found that detangles my hair after my daily washing.  I have well water, and have spent hundreds of dollars on VERY expensive conditioners, etc., but this is by far the best!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this isn&#x27;t the real product. It smells, feels, and acts very differently than the product I&#x27;ve purchased direct from my salon. I should have known the price was too good to be true. Even the packaging is completely different - it has a fake-ish look to it.</li>
    <li> I have fine,limp hair. I used all 3 products as directed and my hair looked great. It was full of volume and extra shiny. I wash my hair daily but didn&#x27;t need to after using these products. It is only recommended to use twice a week but I would love to use it more but afraid it would be counterproductive.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of frizzies, helps color last much longer, and I even noticed new hair growth at temples! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, just as I expected.  I had tried the trial size and loved it.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> This product works amazing. I mainly use it as a protectant before I blow dry and straighten my hair but often I&#x27;ll use it when I wear my hair curly too. Works great!</li>
    <li> I have went through almost the entire bottle in just a few weeks. I sorry to say that there were absolutely no improvements to my hair. I have dry and curly hair that frizzes. I thought this would help with all of that. I will not be purchasing any more of this.</li>
    <li> I tried this after my stylist raved about it and i really was not impressed.  I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product right from the get-go. I have yet to find a salon by me that carries it so I order from Amazon. The closest thing to it that I can find is It&#x27;s a 10 and those products still aren&#x27;t as good. I do switch the nozzle out because this manufacturer likes a stream better than a spray, and I prefer it going evenly in my hair. It&#x27;s the only thing I use for my fine, thin, wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or turn it to frizz. I just wish the manufacturer would make a bigger size.</li>
    <li> My daughter has colored and bleached and colored and bleached this product really reduces frizz and makes her hair look so much better!</li>
    <li> The seller shipped on time and I didn&#x27;t have a need to contact them.  I am still trying out the product - I&#x27;m not quite sure yet if I&#x27;m happy enough with it to order it again.  The instructions said it might take several applications before you see a real difference so I&#x27;ve got a few more days to use it before I can really tell.</li>
    <li> Great hair smoother, adds shine and gets rid of all the frizziness in my hair. I highly recommend to those that need help taming their hair! Worked well for me. Recommended it to family .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in the texture of my hair after using this treatment. Definitely softer and gives a great shine!</li>
