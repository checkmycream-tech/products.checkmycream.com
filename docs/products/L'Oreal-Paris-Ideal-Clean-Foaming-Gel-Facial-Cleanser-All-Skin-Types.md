<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have been looking for this product for years, unable to find in stores. Love, love this face wash!</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin and this product really works well. It cleanses your skin and even removes dirt from your pores. It does&#x27;nt leave your skin dry at all. It is better than L&#x27;oreal 360. Another thing it also remove makeup very effectively (not water proof makeup). I really love this product and use it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Good product and cleanses face without drying it our</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it at all...to thin and runny.</li>
    <li> Use this consistently. Does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> Dries out skin, doesn&#x27;t foam much.</li>
    <li> I love it this product, it is practical and useful, perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It makes my face feel so soft and smooth after using this.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great!  I enjoy the &#x27;ideal&#x27; clean of this product.  Though I don&#x27;t use this everyday, I do use it 3 - 4 times a week.  I like the way it smells and how my face feels after cleansing.  I have had no ill results and I&#x27;m prone to allergic reactions to products.  I like having this as a part of my weekly face cleansing regime.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash.  As an aging person it is difficult to find a product that does not dry out my skin. I could not find the item in the store and was extremely happy that Amazon carried the product and at a lower price with free shipping on auto delivery.  I have recommended this product to friends and my 20 year old daughter likes it also.</li>
    <li> This is just a basic gel cleanser that is very reasonably priced and is perfect for my combination/oily skin. I know some people have commented on not loving the fragrance but for me it was actually one of the reasons I bought the cleanser. Great price too!</li>
    <li> This was bought for James P.&#x27;s wife: The skin on my face is extremely sensitive.  This is the only over the counter cleanser I have been able to use without breaking out.  It makes my face feel clean and not dry.  I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin. This is the only face I can find that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  I can never find it in the stores, so every once in a while when I run out I try using something else, and I can see a difference in my skin within a week.  I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for about three years.</li>
    <li> Very good product meets all the expectations I had therefore recommend</li>
    <li> This has a very strong fragrance, and burns my eyes when I wash my face with it.  It also doesn&#x27;t really seem to get all of my makeup off.  Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, gentle daily cleanser.  The fresh scent is invigorating without being overpowering.  Plus, a little dab&#x27;ll do ya, so it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I always have loved Loreal products this is good cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love it!Found it in a local store but when I went to buy it again couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.Glad to know I can buy it on amazon.I have sensitive skin so can&#x27;t use just anything on my face but this worked great, face felt really clean with no irritation or reddness after cleaning.I&#x27;m 53 if that helps, because I like when I read reviews that give age so I can get a better idea of how the product would work for me.</li>
    <li> It is good for me.I like it.</li>
    <li> makes my face feel clean and fresh</li>
    <li> good product does what it says but is very gentle</li>
    <li> I have to use a lot of product, and rub it between my hands for a while before it truly begins to foam up as promised. It performs average for a cleanser so its not worth the extra work to foam. I don&#x27;t hate it and finished using it, but I&#x27;m not going to repurchase as it didn&#x27;t do anything amazing and I have to use a lot of product.</li>
    <li> This cleans my face and leaves it feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I am a woman in my 60&#x27;s , and have been looking for a gentle , non-drying , reasonably priced face wash ! Just happen to come across&amp;#34; Ideal Clean&amp;#34; and Wow , what a light and refreshing cleanser !! And , unlike some reviewers , I love the scent !! Plus , a little goes a long way . Some of us ladies are not interested in those harsh exfoliating cleansers , on our faces ! So please , continue to make this wonderful gel !! Thank you , L&#x27;Oreal !</li>
    <li> The best facial cleanser ever! I ordered it here because I could no longer find it at my stores. I will I could have gotten a better deal then when I buy in stores, but at least I didn&#x27;t have to spend more! Although I would have because I love it!</li>
    <li> A+ made my skin feel really good.</li>
    <li> I like the L&#x27;Oreal products. My skin is sensitive and this is just perfect. Nice foamy cleanser that makes my face feel great.</li>
    <li> I gave this face wash 5 stars due to its price and the fact that it does not leave your skin dry.  I have tried numerous high end cleansers and this cleanser worked just as well maybe even better.  I could not find anything i did&#x27;nt like about the product.  The packaging was perfect.  Since it does not have a pump, you get to pretty much use all of the product.  Very little waste. I recommend this product for people who have combination skin.</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Skin Genesis Gel Cleanser and was very disappointed when it was discontinued. I picked this up because I just finished up my last bottle and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Youth Code just did not work the same on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and not dried out.  I think I may have found my new go to cleanser!</li>
    <li> I usually love L&#x27;oreal products, but this is terrible! It won&#x27;t remove most of my makeup, and it makes my skin dry. Won&#x27;t buy this again!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Skin feel clean and fresh! very light and not heavy! recommended!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and use it every single day. It&#x27;s a very gently way to keep mild blemishes away. I have sensitive skin that can dry out very easily. This product does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It is lightly scented with a clean fragrance.  It bubbles a bit, but not too much.  I don&#x27;t like a lot of lather and this product is just right for me.  It is light-feeling but leaves your skin feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> Ideal cleanse works very well for me. I have combination skin &amp; it don&#x27;t leave my skin dry but clean very well in removing my makeup. I use twice a day morning &amp; night.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this face wash. I was skeptical about it since years back I used other face washes by L&#x27;Oreal and they did absolutely nothing for my skin; the cheap price tag is what made me change my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and was surprised by how well my face loves this! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but still washes away extra oil. I was going to take away one star because sometimes I have to wash my face twice to remove every trace of makeup but since most face washes I have used didn&#x27;t remove everything on the first wash, I&#x27;ll keep it at five stars. This cleanser has a good amount of foam without over doing it and a little dab is all I need so it lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this new bottle is done I will not try another cleanser but will repurchase this one again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little runny for a cleanser, and has quite a perfumey smell.  So if you are sensitive to it beware.</li>
    <li> Nice gentle foaming facial cleanser.Removes makeup well and very nice affordable price.</li>
    <li> Excellent my wife loves</li>
    <li> Meh.  It&#x27;s basically a gentle soap, almost too gentle for my liking.  My girlfriend loves it though, and I dutifully order it on Subscribe &amp; Save every month for her washing pleasure.  The price is right, too, typically around $3 on S&amp;S.  In local big box stores it is nearly double that.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is one of the best face cleaner. It is light and effective.</li>
