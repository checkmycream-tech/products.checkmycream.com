      <li>best buy on the internet</li>
      <li>Freaking amazing!!!</li>
      <li>I purchased this around 4 years ago and it&#x27;s been awesome.  </li>
      <li>great trimmer and great price</li>
      <li>Good price</li>
      <li>the product at first seemed wonderful, good size nice feel to it</li>
      <li>Im a hairstylist and have used many oster trimmers before and loved them.</li>
      <li>a handy travel pal.</li>
      <li>Gave it 3 stars because it feels very cheap.</li>
      <li>Looks very cheap.</li>
      <li>I thought buying a plug-in would be better than all the rechargeable trimmers</li>
      <li>Love this clipper.</li>
      <li>Nice and light and manuverable.  </li>
      <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
      <li>I purchased this mostly by the brand&#x27;s history which I&#x27;ve had good success with and the price I felt was acceptable.</li>
      <li>I have had many trimmers and Oster</li>
      <li>Good, powerful, noisy.</li>
      <li>I have had my fair share of trimmers and clippers over the years and have come to know the Oster brand pretty well.</li>
      <li>I love this trimmer, and it works great in a busy salon.</li>
      <li>Even better it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy in your hands or have a cheap plastic build that wears out over time like battery powered clippers.</li>
      <li>The T-blade makes it easy to trim around the ears.</li>
      <li>I liked that first one</li>
      <li>On the good side, it does break into a wonderful assortment of smaller parts when thrown against the wall, which you will likely be driven to do if you buy this item.</li>
      <li>But works fine.</li>
      <li>Always smooth.  </li>
      <li>It works great &amp; is hightly recommended in my extensive research.</li>
      <li>Again worth every penny!</li>
      <li>But then it kept getting stuck in my beard, it understand your hair have to be CLEAN before you trim which they were since i showered before hand.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>For the few times I used it, it worked splendidly.</li>
      <li>Just needed another because is cheap and very well built.</li>
      <li>I bought this item from another vendor a month ago and it performed poorly right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>I paid about $50 for that first one but lost it when our house was destroyed by fire.  </li>
      <li>but once i started trimming my beard it was good for the first few strokes.</li>
      <li>The combs of the TEQie fit the old clipper also.</li>
      <li>I should have been aware it wouldn&#x27;t work there.</li>
      <li>this little handy trimmer is a real necessity if you travel  </li>
      <li>It woks very well for neck and sideburns with the added blade covers.</li>
      <li>When I turn it on, it sounds like the motor is ready to go out.</li>
      <li>This baby gives you barber quality and it cuts really close.</li>
      <li>The reason I bought this item was for the T-blade, which is handy for shaping and fine details, but due to the fact that it doesnt cut well, theres really no reason to have the t-blade because you wont get precision.</li>
      <li>The light weight and small size make it easy to handle and maneuver.  </li>
      <li>As long as you keep it clean and well oiled when using, it will never fail you.</li>
      <li>it packs away nice and small.  </li>
      <li>From the first day it was dull, and it takes many strokes to trim everything.</li>
      <li>I normally cut my head bald.</li>
      <li>This new clipper seems to cut just as well.  </li>
      <li>The motor heats up relatively fast, to the point that you have to turn it off and wait for it to cool down.</li>
      <li>It appears that the motor is not strong enough to effectively spin this arm when the head is secured, but if you take the head off you can hear how the speed picks up.</li>
      <li>Oster has these exact clippers under 3 different product names.  </li>
      <li>My first clipper was on its second set of blades when I lost it.</li>
      <li>This is my second one because I took the first one to Europe and the Austrian power fried it.</li>
      <li>I had another tiny Oster clipper that looked exactly like the TEQie.  </li>
      <li>I have brought tons of cheap trimmers from Walmart over the years (usually Remington brand) and this is the real deal.</li>
      <li>This particular clipper is small and easy to manipulate.</li>
      <li>The quality seems lacking with these and they constantly get scratchy for my clients no matter how much i oil them.</li>
      <li>As far as going for a 0 or 00 shave, forget it, it&#x27;ll never happen.</li>
      <li>, they are quiet and VERY lightweight.</li>
      <li>I am a hair professional</li>
      <li>Eeh they didn&#x27;t seem to be professional grade.</li>
      <li>This is far from a professional product.</li>
      <li>If you remove the head of the trimmer, you&#x27;ll find a rotating arm, which basically controlls the blade action.</li>
      <li>Major Thumbs Up.</li>
      <li>This thing barely cuts hair.  </li>
      <li>It barely trims the hair on the neck.</li>
      <li>After an occasional shake and gentle tap on the sink, the motor will sometimes start back up again and other times not     </li>
      <li>This is my second pair in 8 years as a professional stylist, and my old pair are actually still working just a little louder than I like since they are elderly now.</li>

<li> All three of them were the pink ones (</li>
<li> Colored Pink  for for Breast Cancer month and sales percentage going to research)</li>
<li> The blade wasn&#x27;t sharp.</li>
<li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other clipper.</li>
<li> so it does not leave sharply cut lines.  </li>
<li> so we just slide it down the cord out of the way.  </li>
<li> It is not a true 0 trimmer</li>
<li> I used this once every week and a half for an approximate total of 11 times.</li>
<li> The blade didn&#x27;t seem very sharp and I felt I had to press hard to get it to cut.</li>
<li> before in the past and never had a problem with any of them.</li>
<li> This is a small electric corded trimmer.</li>
<li> I have owned three of the TEQie trimmers in the past.</li>
<li> The motor shuts off when the clippers are held at various angles making it very frustrating to use.  </li>
<li> TEQie&#x27;s stand up to my 8-15 short hair haircuts per day, as well as me pulling them out of the cubby by the base of the cord on a regular basis.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hardly has any power.</li>
<li> I wouldnt even recommend it for longer hair or beard trimming, it&#x27;s just too dull.</li>
<li> I am wondering if this one is refurbished or a return and the seller possibly didn&#x27;t know some of the TEQie trimmers are bad.</li>
<li> The TEQie sounds like the motor is weak and dying.</li>
<li> Cutting down on the time I take to line up my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
<li> Another annoying part was the comb set that comes with it, they are VERY tight to put on and one already broke in the first use, so disappointed a bit.</li>
<li> but it is probably worse.</li>
<li> but the build quality is not impressive.</li>
<li> Motor is very weak!</li>
<li> However, I was disappointed in the cutting element.</li>
<li> Very unhappy with my purchase.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in the Oster Teqie Trimmer.</li>

<li> doesnt cut the hair.. horrible</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good, powerful, noisy.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Good price</li>
    <li> I purchased this around 4 years ago and it&#x27;s been awesome.  I use it strictly to shave my head.  Once a week, I shave my head and this clipper/trimmer has never missed a beat.  Hair is even.  Always smooth.  And it&#x27;s never clogged or stopped working.  As long as you keep it clean and well oiled when using, it will never fail you.</li>
    <li> great trimmer and great price</li>
    <li> I was afraid that the noise of any clippers I buy would scare my cat for sure... Not these, they are quiet and VERY lightweight.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. I am a hair professional and I was replacing my last Oster corded trimmer because my husband wanted it back! I have had many trimmers and Oster is the only brand that has not broken within a few months. I love this trimmer, and it works great in a busy salon.</li>
    <li> this little handy trimmer is a real necessity if you travel  it packs away nice and small.  a handy travel pal.</li>
    <li> Gave it 3 stars because it feels very cheap. Looks very cheap. But works fine. Time will tell how it holds up but the build quality is not impressive.</li>
    <li> I bought this item from another vendor a month ago and it performed poorly right out of the box.  The motor shuts off when the clippers are held at various angles making it very frustrating to use.  After an occasional shake and gentle tap on the sink, the motor will sometimes start back up again and other times not     On the good side, it does break into a wonderful assortment of smaller parts when thrown against the wall, which you will likely be driven to do if you buy this item.</li>
    <li> I had another tiny Oster clipper that looked exactly like the TEQie.  Same rotary motor, cutter head and size, etc.  I don&#x27;t think it went by that name though.  I paid about $50 for that first one but lost it when our house was destroyed by fire.  I liked that first one so I bought another.  My first clipper was on its second set of blades when I lost it. It cut even the heaviest of my sons&#x27; hair.  Just take your time, don&#x27;t force it and it will cut.  This new clipper seems to cut just as well.  We don&#x27;t use the pinkie loop, it just gets in the way so we just slide it down the cord out of the way.  The light weight and small size make it easy to handle and maneuver.  The T-blade makes it easy to trim around the ears.</li>
    <li> I had purchased one of those several years ago, and still works today. Just needed another because is cheap and very well built. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Oster has these exact clippers under 3 different product names.  I found this one to be the cheapest!  It works great &amp; is hightly recommended in my extensive research.</li>
    <li> My barber uses this same trimmer to trim my beard. Hence the reason I ordered one for my home use. I used this once every week and a half for an approximate total of 11 times. On the 11th use sparks flew from the unit and it burned up. The return policy is 30 days. I guess now I know why. For the few times I used it, it worked splendidly. But I want something that will last. My recommendation is DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ITEM.</li>
    <li> This is my second pair in 8 years as a professional stylist, and my old pair are actually still working just a little louder than I like since they are elderly now. TEQie&#x27;s stand up to my 8-15 short hair haircuts per day, as well as me pulling them out of the cubby by the base of the cord on a regular basis. (I know, I know.) Major Thumbs Up.</li>
    <li> This thing barely cuts hair.  I bought it for trimmer around the ears and the back of the neck.  It is not a true 0 trimmer so it does not leave sharply cut lines.  I thought buying a plug-in would be better than all the rechargeable trimmers but it is probably worse.</li>
    <li> This particular clipper is small and easy to manipulate. Cutting down on the time I take to line up my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Nice and light and manuverable.  This is my second one because I took the first one to Europe and the Austrian power fried it. I should have been aware it wouldn&#x27;t work there.</li>
    <li> Eeh they didn&#x27;t seem to be professional grade. Im a hairstylist and have used many oster trimmers before and loved them. The quality seems lacking with these and they constantly get scratchy for my clients no matter how much i oil them.</li>
    <li> I have had my fair share of trimmers and clippers over the years and have come to know the Oster brand pretty well. I purchased this mostly by the brand&#x27;s history which I&#x27;ve had good success with and the price I felt was acceptable. However, I was disappointed in the cutting element. Although they are only for trimming, I felt the clippers didn&#x27;t cut with precision. The blade didn&#x27;t seem very sharp and I felt I had to press hard to get it to cut. I&#x27;ll keep looking until I find what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! Need to look into returning this item. Motor is very weak!</li>
    <li> best buy on the internet A+</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the Oster Teqie Trimmer. I tried it out and it&#x27;s hardly has any power. When I turn it on, it sounds like the motor is ready to go out. The TEQie sounds like the motor is weak and dying. It barely trims the hair on the neck. I had to go over the same spot several times and it still looked like there was some hair left. The location was on the back of a neck of a woman. There was not a lot of hair to remove from her neck. Very unhappy with my purchase. I have owned three of the TEQie trimmers in the past. All three of them were the pink ones (Colored Pink  for for Breast Cancer month and sales percentage going to research) before in the past and never had a problem with any of them. I am wondering if this one is refurbished or a return and the seller possibly didn&#x27;t know some of the TEQie trimmers are bad. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product doesnt work well at all. From the first day it was dull, and it takes many strokes to trim everything. As far as going for a 0 or 00 shave, forget it, it&#x27;ll never happen. The motor heats up relatively fast, to the point that you have to turn it off and wait for it to cool down. The reason I bought this item was for the T-blade, which is handy for shaping and fine details, but due to the fact that it doesnt cut well, theres really no reason to have the t-blade because you wont get precision. This is far from a professional product. I wouldnt even recommend it for longer hair or beard trimming, it&#x27;s just too dull. If you remove the head of the trimmer, you&#x27;ll find a rotating arm, which basically controlls the blade action. If you&#x27;ve ever had a beard trimmer you&#x27;ll know what im talking about. It appears that the motor is not strong enough to effectively spin this arm when the head is secured, but if you take the head off you can hear how the speed picks up. Bottom line.... avoid this product.</li>
    <li> This is a small electric corded trimmer. It woks very well for neck and sideburns with the added blade covers. I recommend this trimmer!</li>
    <li> It did not performed the way it was supposed to.  The blade wasn&#x27;t sharp. It did not trim the side burns.</li>
    <li> the product at first seemed wonderful, good size nice feel to it but once i started trimming my beard it was good for the first few strokes. But then it kept getting stuck in my beard, it understand your hair have to be CLEAN before you trim which they were since i showered before hand. Another annoying part was the comb set that comes with it, they are VERY tight to put on and one already broke in the first use, so disappointed a bit.</li>
    <li> Freaking amazing!!! I have brought tons of cheap trimmers from Walmart over the years (usually Remington brand) and this is the real deal. I normally cut my head bald. This baby gives you barber quality and it cuts really close. Even better it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy in your hands or have a cheap plastic build that wears out over time like battery powered clippers. Finally the blades are interchangeable. So when the day comes instead of ditching the clippers I can just replace the $12.00 blade. Again worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Love this clipper. It is the replacement of the Oster V T2 that I used for 10 years but I lost the combs. The combs of the TEQie fit the old clipper also. Wouldn&#x27;t use any other clipper.</li>
    <li> doesnt cut the hair.. horrible</li>
