    <li> I ordered the 3.8 bottle by its self as shown in the picture and received the 3 piece set with the bath gel and lotion. I didn&#x27;t want the bath gel and lotion because I&#x27;m allergic to most of these type of things. I was wondering why the cologne cost so much, I didn&#x27;t remember paying 45.00 for it before. Don&#x27;t want to have to pay to ship it back. Not sure if I will ever do this again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  In my area it is very difficult to find at a department store.  My only problem was that I was sent 2 bottles when I ordered only one.  This seems to be a problem.  In the past I have been sent the wrong items.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon. I have worn this perfume for years and was having trouble finding it. Not only do you carry it you have it at half the price.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent to work every day for at least twenty years!  It&#x27;s a clean fresh scent that stays all day.  My co-workers, male and female compliment me quite often.  In recent years, it has been hard to find, even in the Liz Claiborne outlet.  I am praying that it&#x27;s never discontinued!  I haven&#x27;t found anything that&#x27;s comparable!</li>
    <li> I threw away the boxes so I cannot send it back. I assumed it would be Liz Sport which I have been using for 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;It must be a knockoff. It smells nothing like Liz Sport. And rather than getting what I ordered I received 3 boxes with additional items (cream and bath soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very unhappy and wish I could return these. I will not use them and have to purchase somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Just the right touch of freshness. Not sweet or heavy.</li>
    <li> I should have realized that this was not the real Liz Sport when the 5 bottles were delivered to me, none of them in the Liz Sport boxes.  All individually wrapped in paper or cardboard.  Though the bottles looked like Liz Sport, they smelled horrible.  A musty sweet sour smell.  I threw all 5 bottles away. Do NOT purchase.</li>
    <li> Smell very good.  Sweet odor.  I use this one for a long time ago. And it&#x27;s the best on for me.  Everybody tell me: you smell so good!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Not overwhelming or floral, it has a very clean, crisp smell.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this for daytime.  You can layer with a nightime perfume easily but it is great for a work day or spruce up. Not in stores, great to have it online!!</li>
    <li> I gave it a four but I could have given it a five but it was not here before Christmas</li>
    <li> Been using this since I was 16, over 10 years...Get lots of compliments..hope its never discontinued...don&#x27;t know what I would do...Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for many many years , there isn&#x27;t a day goes by that I don&#x27;t hear &amp;#34;You smell so good, what are you wearing&amp;#34;? I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s a clean smell . I don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling it in the department stores ? It is hard to find sometimes ... Thank you for such a great product !!!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> This is my favorite . It is very hard to find anymore. Glad that you have it .</li>
    <li> This is a great classic scent that has endured the overblown turned coagulated perfume market. The perfume towers over other perfumes flooding the current market.

    <li> One of my favorites! I&#x27;m allergic to quite a few fragrances but this has never once bothered me. I&#x27;ve worn it for many years and the scent has never gotten old. It&#x27;s light and easy on the nose. My teenage daughter even started using it when she smelled it on me. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and I love my wife!  For whatever reason, this has become increasing more difficult to find in the department stores.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much.  Great product for a good price.  I was not able to find this in any store.  I was so thankful I finally found it here on line.  It arrived when they said it would and made a wonderful Christmas Gift.  She was very surprised because she had been looking all over for this product.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
    <li> We thought it wasn&#x27;t made anymore, same great scent and great delivery</li>
    <li> Cuz I got my perfumes  finally thankyou !!!next time I&#x27;m try again !!! I&#x27;m happy hope new thinks like purses</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume bar none.  I get many compliments on this every time I wear it.  It is not sold in stores, so I have to hunt for it now.</li>
    <li> I Love using this perfume and hope she don&#x27;t stop making it, this one will always be in my collection.</li>
    <li> I have had this product in the past and have had trouble locating it until now.  This has a clean, light fragrance and I consistently get compliments when wearing it.  I would recommend it to anyone wishing for that type of fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t have the same fragrance as my last bottle.  (I kept the other bottle and compared)</li>
