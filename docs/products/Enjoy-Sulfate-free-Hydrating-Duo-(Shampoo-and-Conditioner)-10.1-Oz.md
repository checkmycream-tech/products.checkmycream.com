      <li>I prefer the Luxury shampoo and Conditioner in the same brand but still best brand out there!!!</li>
      <li>these are my favorite hair products.</li>
      <li>I examined the bottle myself just to make sure she wasn&#x27;t exaggerating.</li>
      <li>So many people ask where i got it.</li>
      <li>I even got the hair mask with it, which was okay, but even with the mask, it ruined my hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks I&#x27;m happy with purchase.</li>
      <li>Now it has been over a month and my hair has never looked better.</li>
      <li>I bought this after using the Enjoy Luxury shampoo and conditioner, which I really liked.</li>
      <li>Decided to order from Amazon to save some money, compared to buying this product for more from a saloon, HUGE MISTAKE!</li>

      <li>I LOVE the product though,</li>
      <li>I love almost everything from the Enjoy line, and am so glad I discovered this.  </li>
      <li>but then after seeing the positive reviews, I had to give you a fair review of this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free which is better for your hair and</li>

      <li>Recieved my order promptley, but it was not the original Enjoy products!</li>

      <li>I have fine hair</li>

      <li>but I think that would be the case with any sulfate free shampoo.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used sulfate free shampoo before</li>
      <li>I sent this to my mother because she used mine on vacation and liked it so much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this shampoo and it was recommended to me by my hair dresser when i went to the salon. I have normal to dry hair and this has work wonders for me. I find that my hair is smooth and no longer feels like dry hay and my tangles are not as bad ( i have long hair) a little goes a long way and that is good thing for sure.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Used this product for 8 years and the ones I revieved were watered down and had a weird smell!</li>
    <li> I prefer the Luxury shampoo and Conditioner in the same brand but still best brand out there!!!</li>
    <li> Watery and terrible for the shampoo. The hole in the cap to pour the shampoo out has about a half inch diameter, and yet the shampoo is no thicker than water. I almost poured out a quarter of the bottle by accident, I turned it upside down to squeeze the shampoo out and it all just poured out. This is not at all like my other Enjoy shampoo, which is rich and creamy and actually difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Not as good a the luxurious shampoo but still very good. Needs to be used with the conditioner otherwise the shampoo seems to tangle the hair badly.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have used in a very long time!!  Gone are the frizzies that I used to have!!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I have ordered this several times and have never found any watered down as others have posted. I appreciate being offered this product at the awesome price.</li>
    <li> The Enjoy products have been very hard to find locally and I am so thrilled to have been able to order it.  The shampoo and conditioner are gentle for color treated hair and smells better than any other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Some of the WORST shampoo I have ever used.  I had to cut off four inches of my hair because this &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; shampoo dried it out so bad!  I even got the hair mask with it, which was okay, but even with the mask, it ruined my hair.</li>
    <li> I would recomend this product to anyone. I realy like it. It just works good for me, my hair is dry and startting to go gray.</li>
    <li> I hate these products!  Shampoo is runny.  Conditioner left my hair not soft at all and with tangles.  The cheapest shampoo on the planet does not leave tangles!!  These went into the trash!  Any brand is better than these products.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest price I found.  I love the hydrating shampoo and conditioner as it is sulfate-free which makes my color last longer.  Love the scent and hydrates my hair.  Big fan of Enjoy products.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this conditioner and shampoo, however they were not met.  I use the hair oil which is fabulous, however the shampoo and conditioner are only OK.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Especially love the conditioner because it leaves hair silky smooth and smells great.</li>
    <li> USED AND SWITCHED TO SOMETHING ELSE. I AM BACK AND WON&#x27;T BE CHANGING TO ANYTHING ELSE.</li>
    <li> While doing some research online about the causes of hair fall out and thinning, I came across a website by a chemist who believed that shampoos with sulfates were one of the contributing factors.  I immediately went out and bought another brand of sulfate free shampoo at a health store and noticed a difference right away.  But I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with it, so I began to look for another brand.  I am not even half way through my first bottle of Enjoy shampoo and conditioner and I love it.  My hair is healthier and fuller and there is no where near as much hair in my comb after I shampoo.  Just what you would consider normal.  The only drawback is that your hair does get dirty a little sooner but I think that would be the case with any sulfate free shampoo.  Its worth it to have healthier hair.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Leaves my hair feeling absolutely lovely! (and is much cheaper on Amazon than in stores!)</li>
    <li> This product is not the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;I figure this out quickly because I had an Enjoy Keratin Smoothing Treatment and it just wasn&#x27;t lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I narrowed this down to this shampoo and conditioner being fake and imitation Enjoy shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different shampoo and conditioners for my hair.  Ihave thick curly hair and use a lot of heat on it to straighten.  I am always looking for ways to do damage control and repair my hair.  After having this used at a salon, my hair looked amazing!  I thought, &amp;#34;it is just salon hair.&amp;#34;  Now it has been over a month and my hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I bought this after using the Enjoy Luxury shampoo and conditioner, which I really liked. I switched because either the shampoo or conditioner was drying out my hair. There is no comparison to the two. This does not lather well. The shampoo and conditioner ar both thinner, but I wouldn&#x27;t say watered down. The Luxury left my hair feeling silky and this does not. It does keep the hair tangle free and my hair isn&#x27;t drying out but I hope I can find something better.</li>
    <li> Shampoo was so runny - I buy from Salons and it is not the same consistency.  I have ordered before and same issue.  Will buy from salons moving forward.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand from my salon and loved it!  I was so excited to find it on amazon for a lower price, but the product I received was not the same quality as the bottles I purchased from my salon. These bottles were extremely watered down&lt;br /&gt;  I will not order this product again.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo on the advice of my hairdresser and now I&#x27;m hooked. It makes my hair soft, shiny, and doesn&#x27;t leave any buildup.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell wonderful. I wanted a hair product that was sulfate free. I think it gets the job done but I wanted something more natural and organic. Although I enjoyed using these products I probably won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought Enjoy shampoos many times in the past and have never had it be runny. The bottle is standard with a wide hole for the thick shampoo but this just pours out fast and is not the thick, rich stuff I&#x27;ve always gotten in the past. It doesn&#x27;t perform like I&#x27;m used to either. I&#x27;ll never buy this here again!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist, who is very particular about hair and scalp health.  I had never used a sulfate-free shampoo &amp; conditioner, and have color treated hair so need a moisturizing product.  Enjoy hydrating shampoo and conditioner have completely eliminated the dry, itchy scalp I used to have, even using top-brand items from salons and beauty specialty stores costing the same or more.  My hair is so healthy you would never guess it has been color treated regularly for years.  Additionally, I have found that just because other products say \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; on the label, it does not mean they work like Enjoy products - we bought a drug store brand that was being touted as \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; to save some money, and my hair was like a pile of straw after a couple washes.  Stick with this one - highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My shampoo is not only watered down but actually had little bubbles in the top that seemed to portray water may have been added as well. I did some research &amp; found a distributor for Enjoy and she told me there should never be bubbles in the bottled product. She also stated that Enjoy NEVER sells to re-sellers, they ONLY sell to salons. We have been schmooked.</li>
    <li> I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner it keeps my hair soft anf not frizzy. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the product in general. The only downfall is that the shampoo is so thin in literally runs out like water and the conditioner is the polar opposite: Thick as butter. It makes washing hair a little frustrating.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Enjoy&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner are great products.  I like the way my hair feels after using them and I believe it is not causing the color to fade.</li>
    <li> I have used Enjoy products before and absolutly loved them! Decided to order from Amazon to save some money, compared to buying this product for more from a saloon, HUGE MISTAKE! Recieved my order promptley, but it was not the original Enjoy products! The shampoo has consistency of water, obvious it has been deluted with water, aside from the shampoo&#x27;s consistency you can tell its not the original product because the scent is not as strong and thats one of the things i love about Enjoy is the way it leaves your hair smelling, whatever this product is that i got in the Enjoy bottles (probably some store bought shampoo and conditioner that got put in the bottles) is not the original product. This is my first and last time using this seller and probably even amazon, just for the fact that they will let anyone sell anything on their site. TRUST ME STAY AWAY FROM BUYING THEIR PRODUCTS! JUST READ ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS, GET PAST ALL THE PHONEY GOOD ONES AND LOOK AT THE TRUTH!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have fine, thin hair and color treat it.  I have tried so many brands to find a shampoo that will not weigh my hair down so I still have volume but will not dry out the ends.  This does the trick.  My hair still has volume and is smooth and stays in good condition.  I recommend the enjoy line and especially the hydrating duo.</li>
    <li> I did not enjoy this shampoo and conditioner at all. The shampoo was runny and it felt like it made my scalp itchy. I&#x27;ve used sulfate free shampoo before and I can instantly tell the improvements/difference after. Not with this. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have used enjoy products for a couple years now, and I absolutely love it!!! I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> either the formulation has changed or this is not the same shampoo I used to use three years ago. One of the annoying things about sulfate-free shampoos is that they don&#x27;t lather well. Enjoy used to be the exception. Now the shampoo seems runny and doesn&#x27;t lather well, even on the second wash. It still smells great and the conditioner is the same, but the shampoo is disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have dry-ish gray hair (colored, of course), and this shampoo and conditioner makes it feel soft and very manageable.  I love almost everything from the Enjoy line, and am so glad I discovered this.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if your hair is in need of moisture and shine.  Be prepared for a luxurious experience!</li>
    <li> Best product out there for me. I wanted shampoo without sulfates for obvious reasons but they were all overpriced or did not work. I ordered this and immideatly could feel the results. Clean hydrated hair. You really can feel the difference. I sent this to my mother because she used mine on vacation and liked it so much.</li>
    <li> Works well on fine hair and hair that has been color treated.  Does not weigh hair down or leave it feeling oily.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed that these were watered down.  I had read this happening to other buyers, but my first purchase was just like the Enjoy purchased at my salon.  This was definitely not the super thick, &#x27;have to shake the bottle to get the shampoo out&#x27; consistency I am use to.  Bummer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and usually love it.  The shampoo I just received is very thin, it seems watered down, it was actually leaking into the ziplock bag that it was sent in.  It still lathers up well, but pours out of the bottle like water.  The conditioner is good.  It seems like the shampoo has been watered down.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner is great. Leaves my hair soft and silky smooth!! As for the review stating its watered down is wrong mine was not a runny sulfate free shampoo is normal every sulfate free shampoo I&#x27;ve used have been runny with no lathering. Shipping was fast too! Thanks I&#x27;m happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Enjoy for a while and loved it.  This however is not the same shampoo or conditioner.  Enjoy products are incredibly thick and almost difficult to get out of the bottle, this stuff is watery and diluted that I had to use double the amount of shampoo to get a good lather.  Worse yet the conditioner which typically leaves my hair feeling soft and easy to comb through left my hair feeling stripped and dry after one use.  The conditioner was also incredibly watery which is not how Enjoy products are.  I don&#x27;t know who to hold responsible for this, the seller or the manufacture if this is truly an Enjoy product but I can tell you I won&#x27;t be using it on my hair again and that is after only one wash!</li>
    <li> This shampoo was either not the product at all or a totally watered down product.  It spilled out of the bottle and clearly showed it had been watered down.  I recently bought the shampoo from a reputable salon and it was Much thicker, as it should be.  I have used it many times in the past, and this was the first time purchasing through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on this seller and of Amazon for carrying them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the shampoo was the real stuff. It was a bit watery, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the way it is. The conditioner was awesome. Left my hair so soft the second I apply it. I&#x27;m going to stick with the luxury Enjoy instead.</li>
    <li> I used this a long time ago because the salon I went to sold it. They quit selling it a year ago and I went to purology.  When I ran out of my purology I decieded to go back to Enjoy! It&#x27;s just as good as purology if not better and WAY cheaper. It&#x27;s smells so good as well! Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I finally finished my salon-purchased shampoo yesterday and opened the shampoo I purchased from this vendor.  I&#x27;m sorry to say that this is definitely watered down.  I went to pour it out into my hand and about a third of the bottle poured out.  It truly had the consistency of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be absolutely certain it wasn&#x27;t my imagination, I compared the shampoo I purchased here with a sample bottle of the same product from the salon and it is indisputable that this shampoo is much more watery.  The authentic Enjoy shampoo has a much thicker consistency and texture that is missing from this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t know if the vendor poured some of the shampoo out of the bottle and added water or what they did but this is a rip-off.  They should credit my money back for this purchase.  Furthermore, I would definitely caution anyone considering purchasing this product from this vendor to think twice.  I truly wish unscrupulous vendors like this who scam buyers would be banned from selling on this site.</li>
    <li> My fave shampoo n conditioner! I have a Brazilian blowout and I have been using this shampoo n conditioner for years! Excellent Product.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo and conditioner  leaves hair nice, helps with frizz and moisturizing</li>
    <li> Keeps my blonde looking great!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo is so easy on your hair and helps keep the color from fading.  It isn&#x27;t harsh.  The conditioner makes your hair very soft.  Totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This will dry your hair out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love the smell &amp; makes my fine hair look fuller - love both shampoo and conditioner! A little pricey but a nice treat.</li>
    <li> I Love this Shampoo....or at least I used to.  I have used it exclusively for the last 3 years.  However I will now have to find another shampoo since this one has been watered down so much that about 1/3 to 1/2 the bottle pours out like water when you try to get some into your hand.  It is too expensive to be this poor of quality.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product line from my hair dresser and hooked. Less preservatives and sulfate free. The entire line of products are great.</li>
    <li> A little pricey for the shampoo and conditioner and left my hair hard to comb</li>
    <li> My favorite part about this shampoo/conditioner is the smell.  I have long hair so I had to get used to getting it to distribute since there is very little lather with sulfate free shampoos.  However, my hair always feels clean and it doesn&#x27;t leave residue behind.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating shampoo and conditioner. Perfect for warm sunny climates all year long especially for So Cali.</li>
    <li> Love it! This is the only shampoo my hairdresser uses.</li>
    <li> After purchasing this product and using, I found my hair to be less manageable than when I used my salon purchase of Enjoy? Is this product diverted??</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner unfortunately I have bought this product twice and both times the shampoo and conditioner bottles have spilled during shipping and by the time I get the product the bottles are half empty. The first time I thought it was just an accident but when it happened again the second time, I was frustrated. I was reambursed for the items but I hope by now they have figured out a better way to package and ship the product without loosing half of the shampoo and conditioner. It was just a mess. Other than that the actual product is great and I continue to use this product but I now buy it from a store rather than deal with the mess of it being delievered.</li>
    <li> The Shampoo is very runny and has the consistency of water. Seems like it either got too hot or had been sitting somewhere too long. Will never purcharse from here again!!! Buy from a professional beauty store.</li>
    <li> Not so good for very fine hair.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as I remember when purchasing it from a local salon.</li>
    <li> I love this product and great price compared to my local beauty supply stores.  Enjoy hair product really hydrates the hair making it feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Great price.. Fast shipping and great product! It&#x27;s sulfate free which is better for your hair and if you have color treated hair it makes the color last longer. I like the hydrating shampoo and conditioner because my hair tends to be more on the dryer side</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I prefer the Luxury one for my curly hair, that tends to get dry.  Might be great for other types of hair, since it&#x27;s not a heavy conditioner.  I tried this one and appreciate that the fragrance is nice (the luxury one is quite overpowering in fragrance), but will go back to the Luxury one.</li>
    <li> The sulfate free really helps keep your color last longer.  My friend who happens to do hair turned me on to the Enjoy products and I have to say I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Thank you, It was just what I was looking for. So many people ask where i got it. Thanks again</li>
    <li> I received these items several days earlier than expected, which is always nice. These items are much cheaper than purchasing through my salon.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo and Conditioner for keeping the color lasting allot longer then usual. This product is like gold to my hair as it transforms your hair into  being soft and more managable. The mask is the most amazing conditioner I have ever tied!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s fine and this product gives me such fullness and it&#x27;s so smooth and shiny. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> Great value!  Exactly the products I purchase at my salon at half the price</li>
    <li> I would have given the PRODUCT 5-stars, but the SHIPPING METHOD was TERRIBLE!  They did attempt to tape the bottles (with the stickiest worst tape ever, but whoever did it taped the bottles so loosely that as they went through the mail system the lids came unscrewed a little spilling product all in the envelope. Yes, I did say ENVELOPE...they put them in bubbled envelopes to ship instead of a box so there was less protection for the bottles.  (I took pictures, but can&#x27;t see where to add them.) I LOVE the product though, so when I ORDER AGAIN, I will order from a DIFFERENT SELLER.  The Enjoy sulfate-free hydrating shampoo and hydrating conditioner works AWESOME. I love the smell too!  I have thick, naturally wavy hair that tends to be on the dry side resulting in some frizz. This product line has worked wonders for my hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  When I ran out of it, I was in a panic because I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with my hair.  When I went to purchase it my beauty salon no longer carried it but I was lucky enough to get it online.  THANK YOU, AMAZON!  You saved my life!  This is the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> Awesome and  on time!!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Enjoy by my longtime stylist.. I love it! I was a little skeptical purchasing a name brand on Amazon, but the product lives up to the Enjoy I know and love. The conditioner is a little heavy, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.!!!!</li>
    <li> I color my hair and this is one of the best shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners I have used to help maintain the color.  It is think and luxurious.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to review this shampoo and conditioner but then after seeing the positive reviews, I had to give you a fair review of this product. Let me just say that I am product junkie and use salon priced shampoos always. My fav is the Pureology line but I wanted something different to try. This set was such a disappointment especially with the price tag. Both the shampoo and conditioner are awful- honestly, my hair felt like straw afterwords and I have healthy, shiny locks that I pamper so it&#x27;s not my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money or just put it toward the best sulfate-free line available: Pureology.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these products! Love them!</li>
    <li> My hair is in pretty bad shape (dry, brittle, breaking) so a girl at this salon i went to told me to get this. ive been using it for 3 weeks and it has helped a little! Not as much as i thought though. I think its a little more moisturized. I LOVE the was it smells and using the instant reconstructor spray and the enjoy oil makes your hair pretty amazing XD</li>
    <li> Shampoo is very watery...</li>
    <li> This is the worst most expensive shampoo and conditioner do not waste money or time.  My hair feels like straw and never has.  Stick to the good well known products.  The bottles were not even sealed~!!!!!1</li>
    <li> I have fine hair so this shampoo is perfect. It keeps my hair hydrated and doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp. It feels a lot softer</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo &amp; conditioner from Salon Direct after a co-worker bought it at a local salon and raved about it.  Her hair looked Great!  I was SO DISAPPOINTED because the shampoo was watered down &amp; not at ALL as described.  My friend told me her shampoo was thick, not runny, so I knew something was wrong with the shampoo I received.  I noticed in previous reviews that other buyers have experienced this same problem.  I&#x27;m guessing it must be either a knock-off product or a watered-down version. I definitely won&#x27;t buy from this seller again or recommend them.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hairstylist.  If you have color treated or highlighted hair you need to use a sulfate-free shampoo.  It smells good, sometimes it is harder to get a real good lather with harder water.  I recommend it.  Amazon has a good price.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Enjoy Luxury Shampoo but I wasn&#x27;t able to find the smaller bottles so I orderd the hydrating version instead.  Huge mistake!!!  As other reviewers have mentioned, it makes my hair feel like straw as well.  This is expensive to put down the drain but just using it a couple of times has made my hair extremely dry.</li>
    <li> Although this is a hydrating duo, my hair actually felt more dry after using just the shampoo.  The shampoo was also somewhat runny, making it difficult to use.  I did like the conditioner, but think I will spend my money on the mask next time, which I love!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get fooled by the low price....I used this and I have used the real version and its nothing comparable!! I bleach my hair so I need something good and this product ruined my hair! I had to cut my hair short and now it&#x27;s a mess!!</li>
    <li> This prduct is not salon quality. I absolutely love this product when you buy it at the salon, but do not buy it here.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised on how cheap this was thought I came up. Bought it because initially there were all good reviews. Until I checked every one that reviewed it and it seems like majority of the reviews this was the only product they reviewed.  seems like scam to me..someone bought reviews.  One you can feel the difference in the shampoo.. does not feel the same and it feels like your hair was getting stripped clean, but I kept on thinking maybe it was just me. after 2 weeks of using this product my dandruff came back and and i had dry scalp. I haven&#x27;t seen dandruff on me in a LONG TIME.  So I didn&#x27;t bother finishing the bottle.  lesson learned. tossed the fake and bout the real in BULK.  SCALP and HAIR are thanking me TONS! don&#x27;t make the same mistake I DID.</li>
    <li> My hair felt like straw every time I used this! I had high hopes from the reviews I read, but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I&#x27;m back to searching for new hair products that don&#x27;t destroy my hair.</li>
    <li> It seemed very watered down. Did not like it but thought it was the product- then bought the same product from enjoy. MUCH BETTER! Don&#x27;t buy from this seller</li>
    <li> I got this package as a gift for my sister.... she reported that the shampoo is basically 50% watered down! I examined the bottle myself just to make sure she wasn&#x27;t exaggerating. Turns out, she was right! This product is so watered down that you can&#x27;t open the bottle at even a slight angle because the contents just comes pouring out in a very thin liquid form. Sure it lathers, but only if you use half the bottle! I&#x27;m very upset with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Excellent product very pleased . Will order again .</li>
    <li> Received order on time, product as expected. Love Enjoy Hair Care products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I would have liked these however I got the wrong item but ended up keeping the Luxury version because I love that too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fake! Very watered down. I&#x27;m so disappointed  bc these are my favorite hair products.</li>
    <li> enjoy products are the best!</li>
    <li> For years my hairdresser has been using this product and it really is the best and most recommended for a reason! I have dirty blonde color on top with a darker brown underneath and I know any product with sulfates in it will strip out the dark in my hair immediately, giving it an ugly red/brown color that I hate! This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who colors, bleach, etc. I don&#x27;t have to go in as much because my hair doesn&#x27;t fade so fast. I will say get this product, the Enjoy straightener 10oz, and It&#x27;s a 10 leave in product spray with keratin; I swear by it to keep my hair color in, as well as my hair being soft and not frizzy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an organic, sulfate-free shampoos for over 20 years, and wouldn&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;thought of switching, but since I&#x27;ve started coloring my hair I noticed that they&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t keep the color very well.&lt;br /&gt;My haircutter uses this shampoo, and I loved the smell, and it was sulfate-free&lt;br /&gt;so I gave it a try. It seemed a little pricey, but it lasts a long time and it really&lt;br /&gt;keeps the color well. My hair also seems less dry and more shiny.</li>
