<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Switched to using soapberries to wash clothes almost a year ago and not looking back. The soapberries leave your clothes smelling and looking clean. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I tried these and they seem to work good - for a lesser price. I also ordered a different brand from Amazon that was more costly and I do seem to prefer them. However the cost of this brand outweighs my preference.</li>
    <li> I found many uses for these soapnuts. I will definitely purchase them again. I still have some left even after a year.</li>
    <li> I was told about the ( soap nuts ) by a coworker and very excited to try them. This supplier was great though. They delivered in good time. My wife had a rust stain on her shirt from rubbing again something and threw in the wash with the soap nuts. She even pretreated the stain. Did come out. She then used our regular detergent and the stain came out fine.</li>
    <li> I love that soapberries have been able to replace all commercial cleaners in my home.  I use them in dishwasher and laundry.  I love them in laundry with the use of powdered hydrogen peroxide for stains.  Previously I was making my own powdered detergent with Fels Naptha, Borax, Washing soda and Baking Soda.  But I wanted something biodegradable and easier to use.  I am not in love with them for dishwasher use.  I have tried grinding them to powder as well as whole berries in bag placed in the dishwasher.  I add Baking soda, Salt, vinegar and citric acid and the dishes are cloudy with food residue.  WIll go back to using the commercial detergent.  I will start making liquid for use as household cleaner in the future.</li>
    <li> Soapberry is also called Sapindus, which is used as herbal medicine in ancient China. And now it is widely used for personal care in modern China. People who are prone to original life style apply it to kitchen and bathroom replacing chemical dish washing liquid and shampoo. When I came to America, I have thought I could not get soapberry here. But my friend told me we can buy it from amazon, I was exciting so much! Now I have ordered twice. They are really working. I love them. Thanks the seller for offering these good items to us.</li>
    <li> These work! (so far)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m a mom of 4 kids. A 5 year old artist, a potty training 2 year old, and cloth diapered twins. I fell in love with the idea of &amp;#34;soap nuts&#x27;&#x27;, but I was kind of scared that they wouldn&#x27;t work for us. I went ahead and ordered some anyways, figured I had nothing to loose.&lt;br /&gt;  My package arrived in a timely manner, and in minimal packaging. No box. Just a paper-ish, USPS large envelope...thing. Awesome! Completely hassle-free, and recyclable. Inside, where the loose Soap nuts, and two baggies, along with an instruction booklet. I was super excited, and right away make some liquid soap with them, according to the included instructions.&lt;br /&gt;  I used the liquid soap right away, as my son had just had an &#x27;&#x27;accident&amp;#34;. I was really happy with how well it got rid of the smell, and stains. I later used it to hand wash some cloth diapers, and again, I was really happy with the outcome! These things actually work! How exciting was that?! I have yet to use them in a washing machine, however, so I can&#x27;t really say how they will work there, but I have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note. I also tried the liquid soap to pre-treat a spot on the carpet, where our puppy had had an accident. Worked great there to get rid of the smell, although, I think it might have either caused a slight discoloration on the carpet, or really lifted the dirt out of that one spot :) Either way, it&#x27;s hardly visible, and all I really cared about was getting the smell out.</li>
    <li> I really really want these to work. I like them. They&#x27;re pretty. They&#x27;re supposedly organic. And they look nice in a basket in my laundry area. However, my clothes are just not getting clean with their presence in my washing machine. I am not a particular person when it comes to laundry. I don&#x27;t care if whites stay bleach-looking white. I&#x27;m used to making my own laundry detergent and it not keeping all our clothes stain free or new looking. So really I&#x27;m not a person of high expectations. We are active home schoolers, avid outdoorsy folks, and my husband does lawn care, so maybe we get our clothes more dirty than other people do. When I pull clothes from the washing machine to put in the dryer though, they do not appear to be any cleaner that they were when I first put them in. I&#x27;m going to try using more nuts and only using them for two loads to see if that helps as I do not want to waste them, but using as directed does not for us work thus far.</li>
    <li> Most of the soap nuts I have purchased come in a zipper bag in a printed box or a professional looking outer sack. These arrived in an USPS mailer inside an Amazon shipping box. There is no way to keep the bag closed or preserve the product for later use. This is important to me, as I expect the quantity I received will last 6 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is fine. I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot that really differentiates different soap nut brands from one another anyway. I&#x27;ve been using them for years and I am very happy with the results overall.</li>
    <li> These soap berries from Greenwill are the only ones I will use. I have tried some other company&#x27;s berries or soap nuts and they don&#x27;t compare in quality. Greenwill soap berries make so much more soap than any of the others, and they are seedless. Some companies give you a hardened berry with the seed which makes it harder to use and yields less of the good stuff. I love to boil them and put the liquid into a bath &amp; body works foaming soap container. The soap berry solution FOAMS up just like the chemical laden bath &amp; body works stuff and works even better, leaving my skin soft and fresh and clean!!! I also only use the soap berries for my shampoo now, if you haven&#x27;t tried it please do (you will love the results).</li>
    <li> We are using soap nuts for last two years. We are very satisfied with the quality of wash and it is very environment friendly.</li>
    <li> I love these soap nuts.  They came in a box with two sacks as promised.  I have made doap nut liquid and use the nuts in the laundry.</li>
    <li> Good source for soap nuts.  They are clean and brown and thick just like the photo.  Came with a little extra in the bag, I weighed it.  Thanks!!  The bags are very useful for laundry as well as washing, like a sponge.  Soap nuts are a MIRACLE!  Good source for these.</li>
    <li> Almost everyone in my family has allergies. I hoped the soapberries would be a good alternative to regular laundry detergent. Pieces of the berries always escaped from the cloth bags creating one more step in the laundry process.</li>
    <li> Been using soap nuts for several years and have tried several “brands”. I usually avoid products from China but based on the price, the promise of higher soap content and that they were Certified Organic in China, my son talked me into trying Greenwill.  I am very disappointed. I told him &amp;#34;mother knows best!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Greenwill wash bags are sewn with a loose single stitch.&lt;br /&gt;I have found no information anywhere to validate Chinese certification. I sent email to Chinese certification website. I was told company should have a certificate and number, thought this would be included with order, it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I tested a Greenwill berry against another company’s berry (one&#x27;s I was previously ordering). I used equal size berries. I used identical jars, each containing 1 cup of water. I let the berries soak for a while then shook the jars equally. The other brand berry made over twice as much suds, see picture.  I’d do a video for everyone but I don’t know how!! I have never seen berries this black. Like coal. My experience is a disappointment and does not reflect what is stated in the product description.</li>
    <li> Not \\&quot;Certified Organic\\&quot; as described. Have verified the lack of certification (the official oversight) through the National Organic Program (NOP). It&#x27;s easy to check any company via the Agricultural Marketing Services, USDA NOP. IMO VERY HIGH priced for non-organic - and FROM CHINA! Also, the \\&quot;SALE\\&quot; price here is the same as the \\&quot;REGULAR\\&quot; price on their website!!!</li>
    <li> Great for workout clothes. The spandex seems tighter after using soap nuts. 4 stars BC they can&#x27;t handle really greasy dirty clothes. Super for fine washables. I have kids with sensitive skin and feel confident washing their clothes, undergarments and sheets with soap nuts.&lt;br /&gt;*I start with small wash warm setting and soap nuts. I let it agitate just a little then switch to med or large, change to cold water and then add clothes.</li>
    <li> Berries work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> What a great product and a wonderful information insert. I&#x27;ve been making a liquid &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; by boiling 4 cups of water and adding 10 soap nuts and letting it sit. My laundry has never been cleaner. Everyone in my household notices the difference. It cleans everything, shower walls, bath tub, toilet, caked on dirt around faucets, i even tried it on my hair and teeth. No tangles when you use it on your hair, but not as clean as i like. This is the greatest thing for an all organic all purpose cleaner. Great for people and the environment! And very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I think they do as well as regular detergent.  Looking to see how we handle outside soil stain issues like gardening.</li>
    <li> These are the only soap nuts that I have used, and I like them.I ordered them twice and the first batch was better then the second. But hey I just started to use a little more nuts per a batch. Here is a quick tip on how to make a soap nut body wash.  In short. Mix  a tsp of guru gum into a cup of soapnut tea.  Explained. Start by making a soapnut tea. One should simmer 2 soapnuts to a little over a cup of hot water for 15-20 min, then let sit over night. If one is in a hurry, they can stir the soapnuts every twenty minutes for an hour or two, and get a quick version. The darker the tea, the stronger it is. Then take one tsp of guru gum per a cup of liquid, and mix. one can add more guru gum if they want it thicker, less for a thinner soap. it doesn&#x27;t have to be guru gum. one can use a thickener of choice. guru gum just makes a nice slippery soap, similar to the feel of lye soap. I find that it&#x27;s best to leave the soap plain. But if one wants they can add 5-16 drops of essential oil of choice. Let it sit for a few minutes to finish thickening. I would recommend to sift the guru gum through a strainer while mixing to avoid clumping.    When the soapnuts loose all there color, they are done. Until then they can be reused. I use the soapnuts about two times. I use about double the amount of soapnuts for the second batch, and dry the nuts between batches. The tea does spoil if left too long. Refrigerate if worried. I find that storing it for up to a week in the bathroom is fine.    To make dish soap. One can add about a half a cup of backing soda to the 6oz of body wash. It has to be mixed before each use, and it doesn&#x27;t foam. but it does degrees and cleans the dishes well. (although I went back to dish soap, because it&#x27;s more convenient)    for laundry i tried just using the soap nuts in the included bag. after a few washes my clothes started to smell funny. I then started to use the tea with added backing soda, and my clothes are nice and clean. One can also do a vinegar rinse, by adding some vinegar to a downy ball. Personally I stopped using this for laundry and switched to grating up ivory soap mixed with baking soda, just because i like too always have a detergent available. Hey good luck on a lye free soap search, and there are \\&quot;supper wash balls\\&quot; that some claim too work too. If one doesn&#x27;t trust the wash ball on it&#x27;s own, they can add it in addition to the rest. That&#x27;s what i do, and my clothes come out cleaner then commercial detergents used to get them.</li>
    <li> I embarked on my journey to find a green economical cleaner or soap.  I found it in these soap berries or nuts.  I use 4 -6 in the bag in the washer and the clothes come out clean.  There is no chemical smell, just freshly washed.  I was amazed.  It is also so easy.  No mixing.  I will be trying the boiling method for liquid soap.  I love trying something new.</li>
    <li> Works really well. The get our household of 4 close very clean using warm water. There is at least 2 years worth of soap nuts because you can use them easily for more than one load. No dyes or funny smells. Added benefit: my husband uses them for his hunting gear because there isn&#x27;t any odor.</li>
    <li> These soap nuts are great laundry boosters. I make my own detergent and love tossing a bag of these in each load because they add the best scent to our laundry. I&#x27;m not sure if they make that much difference in cleaning but the smell is worth the cost to me. Plus you get so many that we will be set for years!</li>
    <li> These soap nuts work great! I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> great product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> These work fine. Make sure they stay in the bag or they can stain your clothes. They seem to be good for 5-8 washes, sometimes more. Don&#x27;t count, though, get them wet and squeeze. If the drippings are slippery, they&#x27;re still good.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I got over my fear of switching to these soap nuts...they are amazing. I just put 4 or 5 berries and a few drops of 100% clove essential oil in the small bag that came with them and toss in the wash...it does 5 loads and my clothes are SO clean and fresh smelling!!! I will never go back to laundry soap again!!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy again. They don&#x27;t clean very well.</li>
    <li> I got these to try as a laundry detergent. My husband likes these better than my homemade laundry powder. It came with two muslin bags. I used it on my HE washer. The poorly written directions were clear enough that you simply place 4-6 nuts in a bag and soak in a small container with water for about 10 min before dumping it all in the washer. Apparently one set of 4-6 nuts does about 4 loads of laundry. I would recommend double knotting the strings so the bag doesn&#x27;t open in the wash. I don&#x27;t usually have the patience to wait 10 min before dumping the bag in, so I started to store the bag in a small beaker of water so it&#x27;s ready to go. I think this might lessen the 4 load capacity of the nuts. The tricky part is fishing the bag out when you transfer to the dryer. If they run through the dryer you can just rehydrate them in water for 10 min. I tried the suggested directions for making the liquid and even tried it on my hair and on the dishes. I think they work best on laundry but not too bad elsewhere. It&#x27;s too watery as a dish soap, I&#x27;ve considered boiling more water out. Anyways, this turned lengthy. At about 1/2 oz or less for 4 loads, the bag should last you about 450 loads. If you do one load a day, that&#x27;s like 15 months. Amazing for the price!</li>
    <li> These things were gross!! They were like slimy. I was so dissapointes because ive heard such good things from others about soap nuts. I tried a different brand and they were awesome! So I googled greenwill and find out they are Chinese soapberries and there is no way they can organic.... I also googled some of the credentials they claim to have. This whole paragraph from there description &amp;#34;Chemical Free and Safe --- Greenwill is the only soapberry brand exported to western countries from China and owns CNAS organic approval per Chinese organic standard. Greenwill soapberry is completely natural, where no pesticides, insecticides, chemical additive, or any artificial mediums have ever been used. Greenwill soapberry has been tested by independent testing labs/centers in many countries including China, USA, Japan, Australia, and France. All testing results show our soapberries are safe and not toxic or infectious. The authorities in USA tested Greenwill soapberries and approved they are safe include Agriculture Quarantine (CBP-AQI) and Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ)&amp;#34;IS BOGUS there is no such thing as the &amp;#34;cbp-aqi&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;ppq&amp;#34; and Chinese organic is a bunch of bull!!! They are scamming people and the soap nuts could very well have been grown on toxic land!</li>
    <li> I have used soap berries before, so I am accustomed to the product. My previous experiences with soap berries have been with the type from India. I didn&#x27;t even know there was more than one kind until I looked to see if I could purchase my soap berries through Amazon. These soap berries from China are darker than my previous ones and feel a bit (just a little) stickier, which indicates to me that they might have more soap in them than the others. However, I can&#x27;t verify this. They work every bit as good as the ones I was used to, at least. They don&#x27;t smell bad at all; they have the normal soap berry smell that all soap berries have. If you&#x27;ve never smelled it before, it isn&#x27;t a nice smell. A bit stringent, and I can see how people might say it smells like chemicals. But ALL soap berries smell like this! The good thing is that no smell remains on the clothing after washing. The clothes come out fresh and clean, with no scent either of soap berries or of anything else (like yucky, unhealthy perfumes).&lt;br /&gt;Soap berries are fantastic for normal soil levels and even cloth diapers, but really tough dirt like engine grease won&#x27;t come out with soap berries alone.&lt;br /&gt;I love soap berries for my sheets especially. I have really sensitive skin, and lying on sheets washed in detergent made my skin itchy. Even dye and perfume free detergents made me itch. Soap berries get my sheets clean without any itch! AHHHH, finally, a comfortable night&#x27;s sleep!&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is this: These are a good brand of soap berry. They work great, they were in more whole berries and fewer broken pieces than the other brand I tried, and the bags were indeed larger, which I like. I can recommend this brand to anyone who is interested in a natural, hypoallergenic way of getting clothes really clean. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price of soap berries! I can get two years&#x27; worth of laundry done for what six months of liquid detergent normally costs.</li>
    <li> MADE in China is bad enough already.  GROWN and HARVESTED in China is downright scary!  NO THANKS!  There&#x27;s so much sales jargon about this and that in the description, it&#x27;s easy to miss what I think is really most important... They are from CHINA!  No thank you!&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to bet these are not USDA certified organic either, all soap nut suppliers I have purchased from have made it clear who certified them with a logo or seal....  But I can find nothing like this with this supplier.  So they might be a great price, but at what expense?  Since China has virtually NO environmental regulation enforcement... anything, including mercury, can be dumped into the rivers then used to irrigate crops...  EVEN plantation grown crops.  YIKES.  Do your research before buying from this company.</li>
    <li> I have never used Soap Berries or Soap Nuts before, and&lt;br /&gt;was extremely curious.  I have had allergies this year&lt;br /&gt;and thought it was just live oak, as I live in Florida,&lt;br /&gt;but after using the soap berries on my clothes, underwear and sheets&lt;br /&gt;was surprised to find I no longer burst out in rashes.&lt;br /&gt;I used to soak them first in hot water, if I washed in cold water,&lt;br /&gt;but don&#x27;t even bother to do that now.  I place about 8-10 berries&lt;br /&gt;in the bag, and do several washes, depending on the size of the wash.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that for the price, I can under use them because of&lt;br /&gt;the allergies.  My only complaint is that they love to escape,&lt;br /&gt;and I am going to buy a bigger bag, with a better kind of tie, or&lt;br /&gt;make one myself.  The one provided was not really adequate.&lt;br /&gt;However, this was a test amount for me, and I will gladly buy a greater amount.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lovely glass jar with a lid, and I have them next to my potpourri&lt;br /&gt;as they are quite attractive.  I compost them afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I only use commercial wash powder now, if I have a really heavy wash&lt;br /&gt;after someone&#x27;s illness, and then rewash in soap buds.</li>
    <li> I am not a soapnuts connoisseur, but these little guys seem to be very good if you&#x27;re trying to live frugally and go the all natural route.  In addition there are so many recipes you can find online to use them - seems to be endless.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are currently building a home in the country are were looking for eco friendly choices for washing clothes since we will be using a grey water system.  So he did some researching and found that Soap nuts are very eco friendly and there are many good cleaning uses for them. So we went to Amazon...found them through GreenWill. Now we have seen some websites that tell you to be careful when purchasing the soap nuts because some sellers (this is said through an internet site not our comment) that some soap nuts are being sold that have a strong petroleum smell or are slimy. We received our soapberries from GreenWill in perfect condition. They were packaged well and did not have a petroleum smell at all and were not slimy. I am very happy with our purchase and will continue to order our soap nuts through GreenWill in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using soap nuts for about three years now and they work fantastically. And a pound lasts for about a year at our house, so they just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I love these Soapberries! Although I have a soft water system, my clothes are even softer. So easy to use and a huge savings on my pocketbook &amp; the environment.</li>
    <li> Love my Soap nuts! I sue them for laundry and washing my hair sometimes and they are great! Highly recommend trying these!</li>
    <li> I was going to return this product due to negative comments on this and other sites (they are grown in China); glad I tried them first.  They were dry, not slimy.  They have no odor, very slight scent, leave laundry clean and soft.  I put the bag of berries in a cup of boiling water to soften for first use, use 4-5 times.  Also, I put a bag in dishwater and squeeze several times; works well on greasy dishes.  I use gloves as it is drying to my skin.</li>
    <li> Greenwill&#x27;s soap nuts are the nicest soap nuts I&#x27;ve purchased since I started using soap nuts years ago. They are thick, quality nuts. My wife likes to boil them down into a concentrate that we pour into the wash. Easy-peasy. Also, that price! Wow, what a great price for the quantity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap nuts will clean your laundry just as well as store detergents. It may not smell like &amp;#34;Spring Meadow&amp;#34; TM or &amp;#34;Lavender Dreams&amp;#34; TM, but it also doesn&#x27;t have all of the chemicals those products might have. We started using Soap Nuts because my son has very sensitive skin that would break out when we used commercial detergents. He does not have that problem with Soap Nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Soap Nuts arrived from Greenwill in record time and the packaging was superb. The nuts themselves had been wrapped in a packaging material that I believe would have kept out excessive moisture, had the package gotten wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed with this product and this company.</li>
    <li> The soap berries work to clean your clothes just as well as store bought detergent.  We have been using a homemade detergent recipe for about 6 months now and then purchased the soapberries.  Both are just as effective.  It is just good to know that there is an option to cleaning clothes that is all natural, effective and fragrance free.  Wish I had found this all natural stuff years ago!</li>
    <li> Love these! I have shared them with my daughter. I have a HE front loader, these do not leave an Oder or any residue in my washer. Clothes come out nice and clean. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Just got these a couple days ago and ran them in a load of my toddlers sheets! Great quality and even BETTER price!</li>
    <li> When I received it I can tell without any doubt: yes it is really a good one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some sellers to sell soapberries online here in the US,so it is a bit challenge for me to choose which one is the really good one... my mom&#x27;s family used to sue this soapnuts for cleaning many years ago in China, so she knows this soapnuts very well, she said this is what I am talking about...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I strongly recommend this one to give a try, I am sure you will love it! it is super good for yourself and your family&#x27;s cleaning!100% eco-friendly! your skin will love it!</li>
    <li> These are great soap berries, rich with saponin - more so than other brands.  They worked out great and are of better quality than other berries sold on amazon.  -highly recommend</li>
    <li> When I received the soap nuts I put them through the dog bed test. Nothing I have ever used has removed the funk from them. After laundering with the soap nuts there was no smell! I&#x27;m amazed. We haven&#x27;t come across any stains to challenge them with yet but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
    <li> I was excited to be able to find these! The name brand soap nuts (eco nuts) cost about twice as much per pound, so when I found these, I was thrilled to know I would be getting a MUCH better deal! Here are some key points as to the high rating I gave:&lt;br /&gt;1. The soap nuts worked great. They got rid of the musky smell that some of my clothes had acquired (from some previous accidental over-the-night stays in the washing machine).&lt;br /&gt;2. The packaging was minimal, so not only was I able to use environmentally friendly soap nuts, but I&#x27;ll be able to recycle the box that they arrived in, with no plastic to worry about!&lt;br /&gt;3. They included a little cloth bag to keep the nuts in during washing, just like the name brand soap nuts.&lt;br /&gt;I love them, love them, love them! Thank you so much for offering this product!</li>
