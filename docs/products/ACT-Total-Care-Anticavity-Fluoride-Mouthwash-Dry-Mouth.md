### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>This is a very good product recommended by my dentist.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your mouth tasting good and helps keep it moist.</li>
      <li>Price wise</li>
      <li>moderately good mouth moisturizing properties.</li>
      <li>more consumer-friendly.</li>
      <li>u need that I love it</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I like the taste better.</li>
      <li>Product needs a more rigid bottle.</li>
      <li>4 stars with better bottle.</li>
      <li>The taste is fine.</li>
      <li>free thus</li>
      <li>first mouthwash I don&#x27;t have to dilute with water to use!  </li>
      <li>It has a very slick feel and lacks any kind of gripping ridges or indentations.</li>
      <li>Still, giving a five-star rating because I believe Act is a premium product that does exactly what is written on the bottle.</li>
      <li>It would be an easy fix that would be much appreciated by those who use this product for dry mouth, a demographic that tends to be older folks who don&#x27;t need more struggles with packaging.</li>
      <li>the anti-cavity benefits of Fluoride unlike other popular moisturizing rinses like Biotene which don&#x27;t have flouride.&lt;br /&gt;-Alcohol</li>
      <li>But a plea to the company to make the packaging for the large size (33.8 ounces)</li>
      <li>very fresh.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to end the drymouth a whole lot.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The large bottles of ACT (&amp;#62;32oz) actually have the same amount of fluoride as the smaller bottles, so it is more dilute.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s excellent for keeping your mouth wet dry due to medications for chronic dry mouth.</li>
      <li>For some reason it&#x27;s flouride content is lower than original Act Anti-Cavity, so I use one in the morning and the other at night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works good, but found this to be rather expensive.</li>
      <li>I got this product on sale at the local chain of a national drugstore for $3.99 (normally $7.99), and it really helps, and seems to have lasting effects!</li>
      <li>When you first open the bottle grip it on the sides not the front and back.</li>
      <li>This mouth rinse is very soothing and seems to help with dry mouth.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product for dry mouth.</li>

    <li> WARNING!  When you first open the bottle grip it on the sides not the front and back. If you grip it from front to back the bottle partially collapses and there will be an eruption of product on to the surface that holds the bottle. I know this by experience!  Product needs a more rigid bottle. 4 stars with better bottle.</li>
    <li> first mouthwash I don&#x27;t have to dilute with water to use!  Doesn&#x27;t seem to end the drymouth a whole lot.</li>
    <li> bougth 2x becausea along with the siegle whitening system this wash also takes away dry mouth if on meds u need that I love it</li>
    <li> Ordered Biotene mouthwash and received Act as a substitute.  Paid over $10.00 dollars for Biotene.  Price on Act bottle plainly marked at seven dollars and some odd cents.  Still, giving a five-star rating because I believe Act is a premium product that does exactly what is written on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-Has moderately good mouth moisturizing properties. When I use it before bed I have less issue with dry mouth during the night.&lt;br /&gt;-Has the anti-cavity benefits of Fluoride unlike other popular moisturizing rinses like Biotene which don&#x27;t have flouride.&lt;br /&gt;-Alcohol free thus no burn.&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves mouth feeling very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-VERY EXPENSIVE. Especially for me because I often use it several times a day and will go through bottles in record time.</li>
    <li> This mouth rinse is very soothing and seems to help with dry mouth. The taste is fine. But a plea to the company to make the packaging for the large size (33.8 ounces) more consumer-friendly. It has a very slick feel and lacks any kind of gripping ridges or indentations. I have had it slip out of my hands, and I have had trouble with spilling some of it as well. It would be an easy fix that would be much appreciated by those who use this product for dry mouth, a demographic that tends to be older folks who don&#x27;t need more struggles with packaging.</li>
    <li> I just heard a dentist say that fluoride is regulated by quantity. The large bottles of ACT (&amp;#62;32oz) actually have the same amount of fluoride as the smaller bottles, so it is more dilute. Buy the small bottles.</li>
    <li> Having been using this for years. I like the fact i don&#x27;t have to buy another product to treat my dry mouth problem.</li>
    <li> used this before i like this product. use it dauly.</li>
    <li> I have a dry mouth due to medications; I had used Biotin, and although Biotin does help, ACT seems to do a better job, is less expensive and I like the taste better.</li>

    <li> This is a very good product recommended by my dentist.  I love it. Price wise it was not a real bargain.  Ordered it because I did not feel like going to the store.  With tax, shipping and price it saves you from going out to the store.</li>
