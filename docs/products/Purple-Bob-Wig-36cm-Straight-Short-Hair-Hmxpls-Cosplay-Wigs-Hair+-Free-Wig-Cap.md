      <li>I&#x27;m using it for Halloween. :)</li>

      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more faded.</li>
      <li>I wore it for my Ariel Costume and recieved so many compliments on it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It took a month to ship or else it would get more stars</li>
      <li>I look forward to getting more</li>
      <li>definitely the best quality wig for the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a salmon colour</li>
      <li>But I love it though.</li>
      <li>I love it,</li>
      <li>I LOVE this wig.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it looks on.</li>
      <li>Keep looking, there are a lot more out there</li>
      <li>I loved it, the color wasnt exactly like the picture</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really cool costume wig!</li>
      <li>Such a good price for my costume!</li>
      <li>The wig tangled so easily.</li>
      <li>Ordered it, received it quickly!</li>
      <li>Love it, it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
      <li>The wig was fantastic and complimented my little mermaid costume perfectly.</li>
      <li>The hair feels cheap, and looks oily.</li>

      <li>Overall, for the price its a great wig.</li>
      <li>this cheap.</li>
      <li>The color is very close to the image, a rich burgundy and perfect for an Ariel cosplay instead of the bright crimson that is common.</li>
      <li>The color is a beautiful red, a bit brighter than the photo but gorgeous and not so fire-engine red that it looks gaudy.  </li>
      <li>So all my life I have loved having bright red hair, until this job I most recently acquired wouldn&#x27;t allow it.</li>
      <li>Looks more real this way.</li>
      <li>so you can see how it fits and goes with my cosplay bt be forewarned that the lighting in the photo was off and the wig infortunately appears much more fire-engine-y than it really is.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad deal for the price.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you, I&#x27;ve got a huge head and this fits pretty well.</li>
      <li>Even after being combed through the curls remained very pretty.</li>
      <li>And the wig didn&#x27;t stay on very good.got tangled and ratty cery easily.</li>
      <li>I am a seasoned wig owner, I love being able to change my hair color daily without the penalties to my hair.</li>
      <li>Also, since its a long wig, it tangles real easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The color was nothing like pictured. Pink is much more fitting, definitely nowhere near &amp;#34;wine red&amp;#34;, and the hairstyle is completely different than pictured also. Very very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig to go with my Ariel costume.  It&#x27;s a wonderful quality wig, but the color was not as it looks in the picture. I was going for the really bright red as in the picture and as Ariel the little mermaid would have, and the color of the wig seemed to be a little more subtle than bright red.  But for the price, the quality is great, so I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is an Awesome wig! I wore it for my Ariel Costume and recieved so many compliments on it!&lt;br /&gt;It really looks like it could be your real hair! Very Good Quality cosplay wig!</li>
    <li> This wig looks nothing like the picture. I twas longer than what is shown, the red was brighter, not as realistic looking, the bangs was super long and there were hardly any curls. The wig tangled so easily. I bought a wig detangler; however, that barely worked. I still used it, as I had nothing else to use. But it is ruined after wearing it just the one time. I wish it would have been what was shown in the picture. It would have been perfect.</li>
    <li> The wig itself is beautiful. But be aware it is coming from China---it my be shipped in 4-5 days but it will take 3 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Great quality wig! Slightly darker than in the picture, but it actually makes it look more natural. I have used this for a Miss Fortune from League of Legends cosplay, and let someone borrow it for a Poison Ivy cosplay and it stay styled all day long without much tangles. Although when you store it be VERY careful because if it DOES get tangled, it is really difficult to untangle.</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive but very cute</li>
    <li> Color wasn&#x27;t the exact color on the computer screen but maybe it was just my monitor. Overall, for the price its a great wig. Its actually very soft. I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with wigs, but I&#x27;ve had a few for Halloween costumes and none have even come close to the softness of this one.</li>
    <li> Not a bad deal for the price. The fibers are soft, wonderful color, and can&#x27;t beat prime shipping. Only thing is it&#x27;s VERY thin. Do not plan on using this to style. It needs to stay is a completely down style or you see the crappy cap netting underneath. Again, for the price not expecting super high quality, which is why I gave 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Bought for a halloween costume and loved it! Such a good price for my costume!</li>
    <li> The edges and the part didn&#x27;t look good. Didn&#x27;t use for Halloween costume as planned. Donated to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> Too small for my head and they wouldn&#x27;t take it back just refunded half.</li>
    <li> The hair was beautiful. It took a month to ship or else it would get more stars</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig for the price. I bought two wigs each 25$ and they looked so cheap. I love it, my only complaint that if you aren&#x27;t careful it tangles and knots very easily, but even so well worth it.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t even red. Like a horrible not quite ripe tomato orange. The hair was too sparse to ever look good. It was also very itchy and hard to keep on.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about purchasing this wig because I wasn&#x27;t sure of the quality because the price is so low but it was great! The bangs were a little long for me but I clipped them back. It was perfect for my mermaid Halloween costume! I would definitely buy a wig from them again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really cool costume wig! the bangs are a little awkward though. Since the bangs are cut in the front you lose a little bit of the length in the front obviously. I&#x27;m not sure if I would actually wear it. My sister who is less picky than me wore it with her poison ivy costume and like it a lot!</li>
    <li> color was completely different and couldnt return to sender because the shipping prices were too high! dont buy!</li>
    <li> Love it! Ordered it, received it quickly! The quality was awesome! Feels soft and smooth like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful handling it, after I took it out of the black netting, a little bit of hair fell out of it.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect wig!</li>
    <li> Hair is not falling out, Looks nice this WIG, fits well on the head. Just like in the picture. Color is the same too. Nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> perfect for my costume!</li>
    <li> Ok. So all my life I have loved having bright red hair, until this job I most recently acquired wouldn&#x27;t allow it. So back to mute brown I went. I am a seasoned wig owner, I love being able to change my hair color daily without the penalties to my hair. So I thought why not buy a red wig?! Great idea. Except I made the mistake of ordering this crappy wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took forever to get here. I&#x27;m all for a long wait when it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The hair was so shiny and stringy it looked like it was coated in grease and wouldn&#x27;t even take a picture.&lt;br /&gt;The curls were held together with glue.&lt;br /&gt;The wig cap is meant for a child&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS WIG! Keep looking, there are a lot more out there that are better quality for the same price.</li>
    <li> This product arrived early and in time for my Halloween party- please note it takes a few weeks to a month to arrive. So plan accordingly. The wig was fantastic and complimented my little mermaid costume perfectly. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product is a little lighter than the picture and some of the hair came out when combing it to style the wig but other then that I love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this. I know this is synthetic, but you can straighten it! Well, only if you have the right kind of hair straightener. You need the kind that allows you to lower the heat to whatever number you want. I straightened it with my straightener on 2 out of like 300. You need a low heat. I didnt attempt to try it with a higher heat, but it really didnt look like it would melt. It looks gorgeous straightened</li>
    <li> Though I recieved the wrong color. This wig was still nice for cosplay and for another outfit I needed the pink one for. Nicely made.</li>
    <li> I love this wig!! I bought it to use for a poison ivy cosplay and I&#x27;m tempted to just wear it around everywhere! It is a bit thin so if you aren&#x27;t careful, the netting will show but thats to be expected from a wig this cheap. Also, since its a long wig, it tangles real easily. I just keep a wig comb nearby so I can fix the tangles.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase. I bought this wig in red for a costume and it worked so well. I love the way it looks on. i would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> One of the best wigs I have ever bought! It is really soft and definintly worth buying!</li>
    <li> The hair feels cheap, and looks oily. Also, the curls thin out at the bottom. Also, the tan cap shows with movement through the red hair. I will not be wearing it.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig that I used for Halloween. The red wasn&#x27;t as dark as it is in the picture but it was still nice. I also received this before the expected delivery date.</li>
    <li> Was not pleased. Color was dull and the wig was a mess</li>
    <li> Very nice  perfectly with the littler mermaid costume.</li>
    <li> Excellent costume wig. Color same as photo.</li>
    <li> I loved it, the color wasnt exactly like the picture but it did look natural. I took away a star because it was a bit tangled at the front, but nothing a little combing couldnt fix, i also took one star away because it wasnt like the pic showed. All in all it was very beautiful and soft. I will order another wig from here soon, hopefully.</li>
    <li> Really nice wig. Bangs were very long and did not  sweep to the side. I pinned them back.</li>
    <li> Did not like the bangs wayyy wayyy to long. And the wig didn&#x27;t stay on very good.got tangled and ratty cery easily. But was the exact color as in the pic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but it&#x27;s not anything like the picture. It&#x27;s more of a salmon colour and it came pre-tangled.</li>
    <li> Did come a lot quicker than the shipping estimate that they told me. I ordered on November 21st and it was received on December 9th.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a lot brighter than the pictures. The curls are not darker or tight. I opened it and put it on right away. Wore it for about an hour and took it off. Cute</li>
    <li> Nothing like picture when it arrived it was a very ugly pink colour not very happy</li>
    <li> the hair was very realistic and hair was vey full</li>
    <li> Hair shedded horribly, curls fell out as soon as I took it out the package. Color was a little more orange-red as well.</li>
    <li> Nice !, It looks exactly as the picture.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Good length, great color. My only problem is with how much it sheds. I can run my hands through it and make a new wig out of everything that comes off! I can&#x27;t complain too much though, I mean it was only $12. Let me tell you, I&#x27;ve got a huge head and this fits pretty well. All in all, a great purchase.</li>
    <li> i just got this red wig today and wore it around and i love it !!!  everyone who sees it loves it  this one is alot fuller than the purple one i purchased i wish i had enough to buy three but i only got two my next one will be the silver :)thank you</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s very pretty. It&#x27;s not as red as the photo. It&#x27;s more faded. But I love it though. Looks more real this way. And just so pretty. Great buy for a good price!</li>
    <li> definitely the best quality wig for the price. And the seller was very prompt in both replies and in shipping. extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> Best wig ever. Especially for the low cost Was very surprised at how soft it is, not that doll hair feel.and how thick the hair is.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig.  The color is a beautiful red, a bit brighter than the photo but gorgeous and not so fire-engine red that it looks gaudy.  I&#x27;m using it for a Black Widow cosplay.  I&#x27;m sharing a picture so you can see how it fits and goes with my cosplay bt be forewarned that the lighting in the photo was off and the wig infortunately appears much more fire-engine-y than it really is.  I lvoe the color so much I&#x27;m going to take it with me to my hairstylist after my wedding and have them dye my hair this color.</li>
    <li> 1. I got it really soon (in 4 days) not in a month as expected.&lt;br /&gt;2.very long and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did got the wrong color, I got a light pink and not red, but its still a nice color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its great for a costume , it does look to shiny and the curls don&#x27;t stay for long , but its still a really good wig, full of hair and not to thin or long on the bangs.</li>
    <li> cant complain at all! the quality for the price is amazing! the shipping was a little long, but not as long as projected. but what do you expect really from something being shipped from china. it&#x27;s nice and thick and true to the color pictured.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig for the price, arrived WEEKS ahead of time! Beautiful color, full wig.  4 stars because after 2 (long) nights out its pretty trashed, not great if you plan to reuse often but fun for a night or two</li>
    <li> Great quality, color was just like in picture when you order it. Really soft, and it looks so real! Can&#x27;t wait to get my other wig!</li>
    <li> It is a good wig for the price  but it is very thin and tangles pretty easily</li>
    <li> a beautiful wig the curls are intact and the color is fantastic my only complaint would be the shedding and how quickly it tangles but overall for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> This is a very soft and beautiful wig, though the hair is very thin, so don&#x27;t expect to style it to add more fullness.  The price was right for what I wanted it for.</li>
    <li> PROS: Wonderful wig, especially for the price! The color is very close to the image, a rich burgundy and perfect for an Ariel cosplay instead of the bright crimson that is common. The texture is smooth and soft but still has some bounce in the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The wefts are loose and very thin. The wig cap/base is black and surprisingly small. This causes quite an issue when attempting to style it into Ariel bangs, as I had to use a hair clip to cover the part that very obviously exposed the black base of the wig. Worn as you receive it, it&#x27;s wonderful, but be cautious if you&#x27;re buying this to style in any way!</li>
    <li> Really awesome quality for the price i paid. Was not expecting that. I look forward to getting more colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* note- order well in advance as mine took a while to get here. And also let air out for a few days before use.*</li>
    <li> super cute and loved it</li>
    <li> The color wasn&#x27;t exactly like the picture but it was a good quality wig!</li>
    <li> I love this wig! I performed my first Burlesque showcase ever and this wig was beautiful and helped me get lost in my stage persona CeCe Hartz! The move.ends were beautiful, it stayed put and was easy to maintain. i intend my character to have several looks and intend on using this brand of wig for each look.</li>
    <li> Great wig for my mermaid costume.  I had to cut the bangs though.</li>
    <li> Great wig! Recommended</li>
    <li> The wig is amazing!! I&#x27;m using it for Halloween. :)</li>
    <li> This wig was a HIT at our Halloween party.  Very nice quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great wig for $10, but it would also be a great wig for $30. I was blown away by the quality. It does have an artificial shine to it, but that could easily be dulled with baby powder or dry shampoo. It is as soft as everyone says and the curls hold! I&#x27;m impressed and about to order another.</li>
    <li> Despite its length (which is somewhere between shoulder and mid-back), this wig doesn&#x27;t tangle easily at all! Beautiful red picture like in the picture, satisfactory thickness, and little shedding. Possibly a bit lose depending on the size of your head, but the straps in the back make up for any problems there. Even after being combed through the curls remained very pretty. My friend plans on wearing this for a Homestuck (Aradiasprite) cosplay and is very happy with it.</li>
