      <li>so I was thrilled to find it online.</li>
      <li>Warm spicy comforting with a edge.  </li>
      <li>The thing that I liked the most was the pricing, which has now gotten unreasonable.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and have loved it from the very first time I used it.</li>
      <li>My husband and I love this scent.</li>
      <li>&quot; more is</li>
      <li>my husbands favorite aftershave - mine too.  </li>
      <li>I get many compliments on this cologne.</li>
      <li>glad to have found it again.</li>
      <li>Have worn this cologne for around 10-15 years now and it&#x27;s my favorite - get</li>
      <li>many, many compliments on</li>
      <li>And the feedback I got is that the smell is okay</li>
      <li>And that is a lovely perfume.</li>
      <li>the box that it came in looked used and the top of bottle looked like it had been used..</li>
      <li>Oh well, used to be my favorite.</li>
      <li>Fast service good price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked wearing it and have always received very favorable compliments.</li>
      <li>Sweet smell and</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s clean, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>But only Amazon had it, not the local stores, and at a great price!  </li>
      <li>like the smell and like that it does not disappear quickly.</li>
      <li>a person may be able to buy a better cologne for a lot more money, but Casual by PS is the best that i have ever used, including the regular PS which is offered for sale practically everywhere.</li>
      <li>It came quickly and was undamaged.  </li>
      <li>Love this cologne so far and we will be ordering more in the future once we are running out again!</li>
      <li>the casual cologne was great ,need some more</li>
      <li>Have always used it since it first came out.</li>
      <li>I hope they get more back in stock.</li>
      <li>I used to buy in retail stores, but better than I have bought in retail stores recently.</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find the Casual- for Men and ordered 2 for my family.</li>
      <li>the fragrance is always appealing and wears for a long time without being offensive.</li>
      <li>There are so many counterfeited brands now that it&#x27;s possible that this is not the real product and that would make me VERY</li>
      <li>My favorite for a long time!</li>
      <li>It also seems that there are knock-offs being sold with shorter lasting scent and not exactly the original scent that it became so popular for.</li>
      <li>Shipped and recieved in a decent time frame!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>I really like it.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always telling him  WOW!!!</li>
      <li>I am truly disappointed that the original manufacturer/distributor has not been able to maintain it&#x27;s product&#x27;s standard of quality and reasonable pricing that I have thoroughly enjoyed for many years.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly what I wanted to purchase for a birthday present.</li>
      <li>I love it and half the cost of the department store for same size bottle!</li>
      <li>I have not used this order enough yet to determine if it is the real stuff.</li>
      <li>Think its old.</li>
      <li>A big thanks.</li>
      <li>See whats so good about casual is the smell lasts for days if not weeks, but not for this bottle I have just purchased.</li>
      <li>The cologne is light and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I still have the old bottle and will find out if it is a quality control problem or a knockoff, but whatever the case its not the same.</li>
      <li>Honestly it&#x27;s the only thing I wear casual or night out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fast service good price.</li>
    <li> I been using the cologne for over 7 years and I think it is the Best. Before I used to buy the cologne for 70$ dolloars a bottle but then I found for 15$ here so I was happy about that.</li>
    <li> The Men&#x27;s perfume - Casual was just average.    It was disappointing because I have been using the Casual for women over a long time now. And that is a lovely perfume. Sweet smell and it stays. I really like it.    I was very happy to find the Casual- for Men and ordered 2 for my family. And the feedback I got is that the smell is okay but it does not stay.    This makes it an average perfume.</li>
    <li> I love it and half the cost of the department store for same size bottle! Shipped and recieved in a decent time frame!</li>
    <li> my husbands loves this fragrance and so do I.  I can only purchase this item from you.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this cologne for years and this was one of the few items he requested for Christmas.  Being that hard to get something type of fellow, I immediately set out to get it.  But only Amazon had it, not the local stores, and at a great price!  Arrived in time for Xmas too!</li>
    <li> Perhaps its the fact that I don&#x27;t wear cologne often but I have been complemented wearing this.  I think it&#x27;s one of a few fragrances that really pop.  Warm spicy comforting with a edge.  Honestly it&#x27;s the only thing I wear casual or night out.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I wanted to purchase for a birthday present. The price was very good and it arrived on time. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find .... good price !!!</li>
    <li> I recieved the cologne is a timley manner and it was a good price. I would reccommend this seller. The cologne is light and not overwhelming. My husband thinks\\&quot; more is better\\&quot; so with this cologne I don&#x27;t have to worry.</li>
    <li> my husbands favorite aftershave - mine too.  like the smell and like that it does not disappear quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and everyone around me likes it...glad to have found it again. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cologne. My husband adores it, and it has become difficult to find. A great scent for a great value!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I wear.  Everyone I know likes it.  Only 4 stars because the bottle is so big.  I&#x27;d like them to make refillable bottles.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and have loved it from the very first time I used it. The ladies love it also! Problem is the difficult time finding it, and the price has gone up a lot each time I order. I have not used this order enough yet to determine if it is the real stuff. There are so many counterfeited brands now that it&#x27;s possible that this is not the real product and that would make me VERY unhappy!&lt;br /&gt;Jim Naylor</li>
    <li> the casual cologne was great ,need some more</li>
    <li> a non-offending scent that works well with the majority of people I use it for workplace with no complaints. exceptional</li>
    <li> a person may be able to buy a better cologne for a lot more money, but Casual by PS is the best that i have ever used, including the regular PS which is offered for sale practically everywhere. the fragrance is always appealing and wears for a long time without being offensive. i wish it were easier to obtain.</li>
    <li> Smell only lasted an hour. Think its old. Oh well, used to be my favorite.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this scent. But we have an awful time finding it.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love it when my husband sprays it on!!!  I&#x27;m always telling him  WOW!!! honey you smell awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite for a long time! I get many compliments on this cologne. Unfortunately it&#x27;s getting hard to find.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as Paul Sebastian I used to buy in retail stores, but better than I have bought in retail stores recently.</li>
    <li> I have been using casual for men for years, I finally ran out and bought from this seller. This is either a knockoff or the worst batch of cologne they ever made. See whats so good about casual is the smell lasts for days if not weeks, but not for this bottle I have just purchased. After about 2 hours the smell was almost gone. I still have the old bottle and will find out if it is a quality control problem or a knockoff, but whatever the case its not the same.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne so far and we will be ordering more in the future once we are running out again!</li>
    <li> Was not very strong ..I have used this for several years and I could tell it was nothing like what I had purchased in department stores ....very disappointed ..the box that it came in looked used and the top of bottle looked like it had been used..</li>
    <li> Have always used it since it first came out.</li>
    <li> This one by Paul Sebastian is probably one of their best yet besides V.S.O.P. and both have been discontinued, so if you use this get now.</li>
    <li> This cologne has been around for quite some time. I&#x27;ve always liked wearing it and have always received very favorable compliments. The thing that I liked the most was the pricing, which has now gotten unreasonable. It also seems that there are knock-offs being sold with shorter lasting scent and not exactly the original scent that it became so popular for. I am truly disappointed that the original manufacturer/distributor has not been able to maintain it&#x27;s product&#x27;s standard of quality and reasonable pricing that I have thoroughly enjoyed for many years.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne. I just wished it was not sold out so often.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite colognes and i was very sad to see it discontinued. I spent a long time searching for it and finally found it here. I am definitely going to buy another bottle soon before they all disappear.</li>
    <li> Discontinued but my gentleman friend loves it so I was thrilled to find it online. A big thanks. Will order again</li>
    <li> Have worn this cologne for around 10-15 years now and it&#x27;s my favorite - get many, many compliments on it&#x27;s clean, fresh scent.  Have women stop me on the street and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing for a scent because they want to buy some for their husbands.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased.  I have been looking a long time for this product.  I hope they get more back in stock.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cologne and was very happy with the price.  It came quickly and was undamaged.  Great for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I get lot&#x27;s of compliments when wearing this cologne.  I know women who have noticed the scent and asked me what I have on and have purchased for their husbands.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Good quality and on time</li>
    <li> I was shipped the wrong cologne, but decided to keep it since I like the fragrance and have purchased it in the past.  I was sent &amp;#34;Design&amp;#34; for men by Paul Sebastian instead of Casual.</li>
    <li> it was a little different</li>
