      <li>The bristles on the brush don&#x27;t easily go through my hair.  </li>

      <li>Easy to carry in purse or pocket.  </li>
      <li>Definitely a huge hit with him.</li>
      <li>These look cheap</li>
      <li>When I found them I was so happy I bought several.</li>
      <li>Very useful as a purse sized brush/comb.</li>
      <li>A practical, simple and good product.</li>

      <li>I love the way these brushes easily fit in any pocket and provide quick touch ups when necessary.  </li>
      <li>These are great little tools to carry in your purse or to keep close by.  </li>
      <li>While still having the functionality of the original ones and the compact fit in a man&#x27;s slacks pocket, it it clearly made of cheaper products that I had experienced in the past, but the ones I used and desired were no longer found anywhere.  </li>
      <li>It was a very timely and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>These are very handy in a small purse or backpack.</li>

      <li>This brush is good for a quick fix but pulls your hair if you try to do any serious brushing.</li>
      <li>They are not high quality construction, but the appropriate for the price.</li>
      <li>Great little essential beauty tool!</li>
      <li>Thank you very.</li>
      <li>Much</li>
      <li>They are not for really tangled hair, though.  </li>
      <li>Fits very wwell in travel bag without causing problems and being plastic doesnot cause problems at airport secrurity.</li>
      <li>These combs are very versatile.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended purchase.</li>
      <li>They are strong yet small enough to fit in a side pocket and very durable too-</li>
      <li>I love these little brush/comb items.</li>
      <li>So I bought two more - we&#x27;ll see how long they will last.</li>
      <li>But this seems to be the only item of it&#x27;s type available which is why it gets a 4-star rating; it does the job, just not as efficiency, and it seems to be the only ones made and sold anywhere anymore.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s about 15 years old.  </li>
      <li>my old one</li>
      <li>these ones are ok quality, the bristles do seem to splay out faster than other brands, but given that they are prone to getting lost easier than normal brushes thats not a huge problem, you just replace it.</li>
      <li>carried one for 20 years, the new one should last another 20</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s size and portability makes it easier to lose but very easy to use anywhere.</li>
      <li>This little comb and brush set was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I have very long hair and use mine frequently.</li>
      <li>He uses it to come his beard as much as what little hair he still has on his head.</li>

    <li> The teeth on the comb are too sharp! Pokes holes in your scalp.</li>
    <li> This little comb and brush set was exactly what I was looking for. It fits perfecting down in the side of my purse. It took me a while to find a really small brush for my purse. Since this is a two pack, I gave one to my neighbor.</li>
    <li> This brush is simple and compact enough for my father to carry in his pocket. He uses it to come his beard as much as what little hair he still has on his head. He has carried this style brush for over thirty years and loves it.</li>
    <li> it does the job - not as sturdy as others I&#x27;ve had but it works well and is a good value</li>
    <li> Not a styling brush or comb but great for a touch up.  Fits well into the tiny compartments of my bag.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these many years ago and have looked for this product in every store I go in and every catalog I get in the mail.  These are great for the car, shaving kits when traveling, purses, pockets - everywhere.  I ordered multiples and will give as stockiong stuffers at Christmas.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling, and also great for use at home. Buying two allows me to make sure I have one for each venue.</li>
    <li> It was a very timely and quick delivery. These items are great and compact for  my purse and desk at work.</li>
    <li> carried one for 20 years, the new one should last another 20</li>
    <li> Received these brushes very fast and they&#x27;re perfect!  Just what I was trying to find for weeks but none of the popular drug stores carry them anymore.  I love the way these brushes easily fit in any pocket and provide quick touch ups when necessary.  And nothing beats the price!</li>
    <li> the brush part is useless, and I have very short straight hair.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of these travel brush/combs. One of the combs would not even fold into itself as it should and the overall quality of the plastic and brush bristles was a disappointment.  I picked this brand because of the colors (Grandkids love these folding brush combs) but I will definitely go back to the Goody product that I purchased before. And the cost of the Goody product was less than this one.  The only thing with Goody is that you do not get a color choice, but I will opt for the better quality over color.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve relied on this compact, hard to find grooming tool. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s size and portability makes it easier to lose but very easy to use anywhere. To guard against future loss, I now stock several.</li>
    <li> I use this every day to comb my hair,  I keep it folded in my pocket, it is very easy to clean</li>
    <li> Stiff sharp bristles scratch scalp.  Comb is useless and makes brush hard to hold.  Looking for a mini boar bristle brush!</li>
    <li> They felt a bit light and cheap, but they work great! No problems and no complaints.</li>
    <li> Got these to carry and use in a hurry...bought several so when one wears out, another can be used.&lt;br /&gt;Best to carry in shirt pocket, no in jeans or slacks for the brush tends to fragment, i.e. go in different directions.</li>
    <li> Normally a 5, this item has been around for a couple of decades, at the least.  While still having the functionality of the original ones and the compact fit in a man&#x27;s slacks pocket, it it clearly made of cheaper products that I had experienced in the past, but the ones I used and desired were no longer found anywhere.  The hinge is weaker and the bristles on the brush are rougher and not soft and do not control the hair as well as those I had always used. But this seems to be the only item of it&#x27;s type available which is why it gets a 4-star rating; it does the job, just not as efficiency, and it seems to be the only ones made and sold anywhere anymore.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my purse.</li>
    <li> these ones are ok quality, the bristles do seem to splay out faster than other brands, but given that they are prone to getting lost easier than normal brushes thats not a huge problem, you just replace it. Great little essential beauty tool!</li>
    <li> Bought for my uncle for Christmas because they don&#x27;t sell them in the stores anymore. Definitely a huge hit with him. He loved em.</li>
    <li> Nifty little device. A must-have for all bald headed guys like me.</li>
    <li> These combs are very versatile. I have one and I bought my husband one. You can use them anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Fast service.</li>
    <li> Glad I found these.  Very handy.</li>
    <li> They are the perfect woman&#x27;s emergency tool.  They fit just about anywhere, take a fair amount of abuse, and get the job done.  They are not for the full coiffure, mind you.  But if hair repair to the point of presentable is the mission at hand, then voila!</li>
    <li> I bought  these a few years ago.  Easy to carry in purse or pocket.  Gave to my grandchildren to carry to school.</li>
    <li> This brush is good for a quick fix but pulls your hair if you try to do any serious brushing. That said, it fits in your purse and works in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I love these little brush/comb items. They fold up so well &amp; are easy to put in your purse. Highly recommended purchase.</li>
    <li> These are great for fravel, car, purse, backpack.</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brush don&#x27;t easily go through my hair.  I like the Goody one much better, with the rubberized bristles.</li>
    <li> these are great have comb and brush in one very handy when traveling</li>
    <li> I keep these in the car for an emergency for when you need a come or brush quick. They store easy and cheep so you can throw them away if you need to.</li>
    <li> great comb brush for travel. Fits very wwell in travel bag without causing problems and being plastic doesnot cause problems at airport secrurity.</li>
    <li> Been looking for one of these for some time locally. Value was great.</li>
    <li> I ve been looking for these for years. When I found them I was so happy I bought several. They are strong yet small enough to fit in a side pocket and very durable too- my old one it&#x27;s about 15 years old.  A practical, simple and good product.</li>
    <li> These comb/brush combos are great for the purse or bag.  We&#x27;ve been looking for them for several years as the women in my wife&#x27;s office have wanted them after seeing hers.  They will make a great Christmas presents for the ladies as they have a low limit on what can be spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d purchase the Goody brand ones next time. These look cheap</li>
    <li> Very useful as a purse sized brush/comb.</li>
    <li> These are very handy in a small purse or backpack. They are not high quality construction, but the appropriate for the price. I had this design years ago and found it impossible to find in the normal retail sections so I was very happy to find them here. I purchased around 6 of them so I won&#x27;t be without. One of them did not close well, but at this price I just let it go. I am glad to have them in my purse.</li>
    <li> The hair brush/comb set is perfect for me.  I keep it in my handbag all the time and it fits just about anywhere.  Great product when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for travel,  My wife and I both have one each in her makeup bag and my shave bag for use when traveling on the road or on vacation when staying in hotels,  we also keep them in our vehicles.</li>
    <li> I love this folding brush and comb .</li>
    <li> A small footprint for pocket or purse.</li>
    <li> These are great little tools to carry in your purse or to keep close by.  They were widely available in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s and like everything else from those times, they do a great job when we need them.  They are not for really tangled hair, though.  Great for touch-ups.  I have very long hair and use mine frequently.</li>
    <li> Replacement - I&#x27;ve always had one of those in my daily cosmetic kit and in my travel cosmetic kit, and someone always took a liking to it, I guess. So I bought two more - we&#x27;ll see how long they will last. Since they were all stolen (unless there is something that makes them dissolve in thin air), I can&#x27;t say how long they stand up.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, very weak hinge, save your money!</li>
    <li> Great I had looked for them for years.  Thank you very. Much</li>
