    <li> Wonderful and very practical jars. We use them for cosmetic purposes.</li>
    <li> After purchasing some expensive facial creams that were offered in &#x27;supersized&#x27; containers (think 8 oz), I searched for and found these little jars.  An 8 oz. container of facial cream will last for months, so I wanted to put a smaller amount in a container to prevent not only oxidation that will occur every time I open the jar, but also contamination, even though I wash my hands before I open the jar.  I love the fact that they&#x27;re cobalt blue, not only for the beautiful color, but the dark color protects the product from sunlight.  I like the fact that they&#x27;re glass, not plastic.  I also ordered some 1 oz jars for eye creams.  These will be the perfect size for travelling, as well.  I had been reusing plastic and glass containers from products - I just had to re-label with paper and tape.  I will use the Avery self-laminating labels for these jars.  (An added bonus:  I ordered on 01.06.15 and received them on 01.10.15 - they were shipped 2-day priority - the estimated delivery was 01.19.15.)  I&#x27;ll be ordering some other sizes and applications.</li>
    <li> Nice well made jars!  Great for use with my homemade hand salves!  And small enough to carry comfortably in my bag!</li>
    <li> Attractive cobalt blue jars, consistent quality.  The vendor did a good job packing the items to ensure no jars were broken during transport.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> All six jars arrived in perfect condition because they were well packaged.  Cannot detect any imperfections in the glass.  They are the perfect size for me to mix experimental combinations of creams and lotions with aromatherapy oils to discover scented moisturizers that are uniquely mine.  Wish they came in other dark colors.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my little home made vicks product!</li>
    <li> Good quality, timely shipping, perfect for what I am using them for.  Thank you!</li>

    <li> Perfect for all my lotions and potions. Beautiful color and seals tight. Perfect size for standard lotion containers.</li>
    <li> Perfect for any homemade toiletries.  Love these little jars.  I use the clear ones for just coconut oil (which I use as a moisturizer and a million other things...no essential oils in the clear ones).  I use the same-size blue jars from same company for homemade toothpaste, and the brown ones for homemade pit paste.  I bought the smaller blue jars for lip balm.  Whether for my own family or for gifts, these are always a big hit.  I print out little labels with my label-maker, but because I use different colored jars for different products, just a quick glance at the jar color tells me what&#x27;s inside.  When products are used up, I just run the glass through the (top shelf) of the dishwasher and it&#x27;s good to go for re-use.</li>
