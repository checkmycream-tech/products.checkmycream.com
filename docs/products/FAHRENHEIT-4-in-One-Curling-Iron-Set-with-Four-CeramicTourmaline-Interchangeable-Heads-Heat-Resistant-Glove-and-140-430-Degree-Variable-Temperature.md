<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love this curling iron, I bought it like 4 years ago and its an amazing product.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for a curling iron for her birthday and she is thrilled with this one. She mostly uses the largest size rod because she has long hair. But the multiple sizes give her the option to make tighter curls if she wants to. She pointed out the the MSRP on the box is $400. I would never have paid that, and I&#x27;m pleased with the bargain I got.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried she would have trouble with the curling iron since it does not have a clamp to hold the hair on the iron. Not a problem for her at all. I tried it on my short hair and this was an issue but I&#x27;m pretty sure I could get used to the design if I practiced with it.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also likes the fact that the display tells you what temperature the iron has reached.</li>
    <li> Works well, great price! Better than the Sultra I own! Only issue is the barrel is a little hard to remove and insert, but still an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Love love love this curling iron. I love it because you get 4 irons in 1.  Its gets hot quick and you can control the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who has very thin hair that NEVER holds a curl, this curler absolutely does the job!!!  Not only does it curl good but you can make the curls as tight as you want and they DO NOT fall out!  I swear by this iron.  I have even curled by hair @ 10 in the morning wore it all day.  Partied all night. Went to bed and in the morning the curls are STILL there! No lie.  And I&#x27;m telling you, my hair is very thin and very heavy but with this iron, I can never go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest this iron to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I got a lot Curling Iron but I have to say. This Curling Iron make the best curls and stay so long until i wash my hair. I got thick, black, long Asian hair..  and this make super, cute nice curls. I told all my friends to buy it and also i got so many compliments. I think Fahrenheit and all the other names brands are the same but I got Fahrenheit and I think it is the best and I wish i know that before because than i wouldn&#x27;t bought all those other curling irons i have.. because this got 4 and you can have big and small curls. was the best purchase I ever made it and I just can say it is worth it from the money. I am happy and i love it sooo much. thanks</li>
    <li> Product heats up almost instantly. I set it to 360 degrees and it literally took less than a minute to get from room temperature to that heat. The box that it came in was a little dented in the corners, and upon opening, the item was somewhat dirty and covered in dust. The container that holds each curling iron was  cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the product functions excellently, but was shipped unclean.</li>
    <li> Gift for spouse, Spouse review. This might be good for a professional stylist.  I had no idea that it didn&#x27;t have the built in clip on the iron to hold your hair as you curl. . Even my stylist uses that type. This you do with your hand. No wonder it included a hot glove! lol</li>
    <li> This item is perfect I did tons of research on the perfect curling iron and I&#x27;m glad I choose this one works perfect even if your hair never holds a curl curls last for days!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I ordered this wand, however, when I got it...it didn&#x27;t even turn on! Bummer. I think the wands are great styling tools, but I returned it (because it didn&#x27;t work!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend buying this item.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter who is 17 and she absolutely loves it.  It is great quality and fun to use.</li>
    <li> I was debating on getting this one or the CORTEX curling iron,is basically the same thing! Works great,I get so Many compliments when I do my hair w/ the big barrel,which is my fave! Also,the price is great compared to other \\&quot;beauty websites\\&quot; which these retail for over $100! I would totally recommend this product to any girl friend of mine!</li>
    <li> EDIT (4 months after original review): This product only lasted a year, and I only curled my hair once or twice a month. It started turning off easily and eventually wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all. The wiring must easily come loose or something. I will not be purchasing this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;My hair is stick-straight, and I thought it was impossible to hold a curl for more than a couple hours without using half a bottle of hairspray. This product gets hot enough that my hair holds its curl with just a normal amount of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the 1 inch barrel (the 3rd largest size), because the largest barrel does not get hot enough. The 1 inch does make nice loose waves. I haven&#x27;t tried using the 2 smaller barrels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought this item to a hotel in Hawaii and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I thought it was broken, but I tried it back to my apartment again and it worked. I guess it probably has to do with the outlet voltage, but I&#x27;m not sure how the outlet voltage at the hotel was different than my apartment.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed hair dresser &amp; I use this for weddings and formal events. Love this because you have options for size of curls. Didn&#x27;t find the glove usefull but it is all personal preference. This also heats up very quick. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it! Hopefully mom will get to use it too!</li>
    <li> First off, this is the exact same thing as the Bellezza set. I opened the boxes side by side and sure enough - exact thing. So the same manufacturer is selling it under different brands, who knows why.  Moving on to the review - lucky me, I got it for fifty bucks at the local Winners, so I definitely scored considering I&#x27;ve seen it for over a hundred elsewhere on the Internet. It takes a few minutes to get the groove of using a rod instead of a clip curler, but is worth it for the more natural looking results. It works fairly well, though you do have to keep the temperature high [and it starts automatically at 360]. Considering I straighten my hair like a charm at 280, this is a bit high for my liking, as my hair is damaged easily. It feels/looks a little cheap, but is relatively sturdy. Not a luxe product, by any standards, but it will do the job. The one thing I was REALLY disappointed in, which bumps my rating down, is the fact that the two smallest rods are the exact same size; the difference is only that one is tapered and one is not. This is disappointing as you expect to have four different sized rods entirely; the front picture and other advertising pictures are very misleading. So, overall, the size differences are not quite substantial enough to make it worth it. They should have stuck with the biggest barrel, one slightly smaller than the smallest barrel, and the second biggest one as the &#x27;middle&#x27; barrel, and it would have been perfect.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me so I bought it for my daughter, she loves it, great product, awesome curls, exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> So far I like this.  I have only used it a few times so I can&#x27;t say how much I will like it over time.  I will try to come back and do an update review later.&lt;br /&gt;So far....&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Temp control - it also tells you when it reaches the temp.  The barrel sizes - It gives you a good selection of sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It&#x27;s a bit tricky to remove the barrels, especially if it&#x27;s still hot.  I don&#x27;t like the beeping.  It seems to me, it beeps to remind you it is ON - but this is kinda irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it for now.  So far I like enough to keep it and continue to use it.</li>
    <li> the Fahrenheit 4 in 1 Clipless Curling Iron Set is awesome. it heats up amazingly fast. i have no problems removing and snapping in the attachments. you actually have to hold the power button for a few seconds to turn it on or off which is great because you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while you&#x27;re curling. i love that it&#x27;s digital instead of an old fashioned dial for the heat setting. it works great and i&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I read through so many reviews on so many different brands and models before settling on this one.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  I&#x27;ve used it only once and know that this wand and I will get along great.  It has an on/off button that you hold down to turn on or off.  When on, the screen lights up, which is great for letting you know that it&#x27;s actually ON.  It shows you the temperature and has 2 buttons to set it to whatever temp you like, which a lot of other models don&#x27;t have.  The interchangeable wands are super easy to put on and take off and the swivel cord makes maneuvering very easy.  The wand also has little pegs on it to allow you to set it on the counter.  A small but very helpful detail, especially for us beginners who need to use both hands between curls.  The glove is a nice thought, but not practical.  I couldn&#x27;t feel my hair and it slipped out of my fingers when my arms were over my head.  So I curled glove free - got a nice burn to prove it.  :)  But the process was much easier than I thought and in no time I&#x27;ll have the routine down....burn free!  Please be careful, especially if you set it to a high temp.  Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase!  The product is great quality and hopefully it will last.  Free shipping didn&#x27;t hurt either and it showed up in a few days.  I don&#x27;t regret spending the money I did, seems totally worth it so far.  I highly recommend this!  HAPPY CURLING!!</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron, so easy to use &amp; change the barrell size. The ceramic barrels create beautiful curls that lasts all day long! I love it</li>
    <li> Love this curling wand. It gets hot really fast, it doesn&#x27;t take long at all. I like the wand out of all of the curling wands that I have recieved. I bou.ght this because I wanted to be able to change the curl size without have to use to many curlers. I have had it for over a month I use the high setting for weaves and the low setting for my hair and it works great. If you are looking for a curling wand this is the one. If its your first time using a curling wand use the glove that comes with it because you will burn yourself. Love Love Love this curling wand.</li>
    <li> This is truly a wonderful product. All 4 curling interchangable heads give my long hair completly different looks. It does not burn my hair &amp; it leaves my hair shiny &amp; smooth. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling wand set through Amazon after much debate.  I had been using the Remington tapered curling wand with pretty decent results.  I just wanted a wand that had a bigger barrel size for looser, more wavy curls.  This performs exactly like I expected.  So far, I&#x27;ve used the tapered barrel (which is slightly bigger than the remington) and the smallest of the uniform sized barrels.  Both work very well in my almost shoulder length hair. I had initially been concerned that my hair was too short to use these, but they work like a charm.  The tapered barrel is much easier to use since I can get a more defined curl from it.  Its just slightly harder to get a perfect curl with the uniform sized barrels.  Unfortunately, my hair is too short for the other barrels.  These bad boys heat up super quick and are very easy to use.  Just be careful because you can and will get burned with these (I don&#x27;t use the included glove - makes the whole process way more complicated). When I curl my hair with this, the curls will last 2 days.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this set instead of getting just one of the \\&quot;professional\\&quot; curling wands for the same price.  This set gives me so many options at a fraction of the cost.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using the wand when I actually do take the time to curl my hair.  I do wish there was a piece that was smaller than the smaller piece.  Quality product and depending on the heat and size used, your curls will last for days and then become really pretty waves (used on extensions and natural leave out). The glove makes no difference at all. It&#x27;s hard to grip the hair using it.  So I when I say be careful, BE CAREFUL! I have definitely burned myself a couple times lol.</li>
    <li> I get always compliment when I do my hair with this curling iron, thanks it helps me a lot. I have wild and frizzy hair it solved my problem</li>
    <li> ^ I&#x27;m his daughter:  I&#x27;ve seen SO many videos of this curler used on YouTube, and I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about it, so I figured, why not get it and try it out? When it arrived in the mail, I used it ASAP. I used the 2nd size barrel out of the 4. It is tapered, so it gives you the Taylor Swift waves/curls. I LOVE this curling wand! There are 4 different size barrels. It heats up very quickly, the glove is very helpful and comfy. I can sleep in my curls and wake up the next day, and my hair is still just as curly as the day before! As a bonus, I got it from Amazon, because the other websites I found this on was asking a LOT more. So, I got an amazing curling wand for a lot better price. It&#x27;s a win-win situation :)  Pros: great price, variety of different size/shape curls/waves, heats up very quickly, comes with glove. I don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray to keep curls together!  Cons: None so far!</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron the only thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was that it would be hard to make waves in your hair like a clip curling iron.</li>
    <li> I had a great clipless curling iron already but was going for something that had dual voltage for my trips to Europe. Not only did this suit my traveling purposes it has taken the place of my former curling iron! love love love! Definitely a great clipless curling iron for an unbelievable price!</li>
    <li> I actually really lliked this product, it takes a while to make the curl about  20 seconds or so ( if you  want it really curly) but they do last a whole day and make beautiful waves too. It was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I got this today and straight away I tried to curl my hair. This Curling Iron gave the hair a wavy natural look when you use the big one, however it&#x27;s very versatile and you can get many looks from the other iron. It&#x27;s also very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the iron removing is a pain in the ass, it&#x27;s so hard to pull it out and put another in but it&#x27;s not impossible.</li>
    <li> This product was excellent it doesn&#x27;t mistreat my hair it was shipped the next day and I am very happy with the results :) !!</li>
    <li> It takes a bit of practice but after a few times I mastered it ! Great iron and what a great price! I love that you can interchange barrels</li>
    <li> one of the best investments I have bought for my hair in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;it is perfect for long hair and short hair and amazing at making beach waves!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on Curling wands and read a lot of reviews. After much consideration I decided on this set. My hair is very long and although I&#x27;ve never had a problem curling it with my flat iron the curls just wouldn&#x27;t hold all day long. And because my hair is so long whenever I used my straightener I would only get a good curl towards the bottom not from top to bottom. This curling wand works very well. I love that it comes with different sizes to interchange (although they are a bit difficult to take off) and it heats up really quickly and displays the temp. It comes with a glove, which after trying to use it the first time without it and nearly burning myself several times I realized was a real asset. best of all it takes less time to curl all my hair than with my flat iron and the curls last all day. The first day I used it when I came home from work my husband complimented me and said your hair looks like you just did it! I love this curling wand. I saw some reviewers comented that it quits working for no reason, I haven&#x27;t had it very long so I guess that could happen to me but I hope not. If it does then I will update my review, but as for now I love it!</li>
    <li> The box was in shambles! im not lying either, the product is very good variable heats and its was for a good deal. Im just upset about the box.</li>
    <li> i was highly considering buying a NuMe wand with loads of recommendations but i really didnt want to spend a couple hundred dollars. I kept coming back to this set and decided id try it and if it didnt work out id return it and purchase the other wand. I have no complaints whatsoever. I love the options of different barrel sizes and it heats up quick and you have a great way of seeing the actual degree! caution: it gets VERY HOT i burned my arm (my fault) but i would recommend this products to anyone even over a clamp curling iron! the curl holds great for days! (of course depending on heat, hair texture and health)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there is a huge learning curve with these curling wands. I am not good at using them. As for the equipment, the largest and smallest barrels go on and off quite nicely and click into place firmly. The other two do NOT and I struggle to remove them or putting them on. I am unable to get them to click into place, but they still do heat up, and barring an act of god, will not fall off while using. The glove that comes with it is cumbersome for me. I have small hands and the glove is too big. So I have burned myself several times. It heats up quickly and the digital readout is nice. So far the hand full of times I used it, it performed as indicated. User error being the biggest problem, next to the 2 VERY frustrating wands that refuse to fit properly. I agree with several others that 2 of the wands are almost identical in size. Still, for the price it was a great deal. My 3 stars is due to the fact that the wands are a pain in the butt to change out.&lt;br /&gt;This item now resides deep in my closet unused.</li>
    <li> I bought this curler last year. I really loved it and it worked extremely well. I had it for about 2 months and then it broke. It kept turning off in the middle of using it and now every time I try to turn it on, it says error and does not go on at all. I couldn&#x27;t return it because I didn&#x27;t register the warrenty on the products website. If you buy this curler make sure you register the product so you can return it to get a new one if it breaks. I spent 80 dollars on this so i&#x27;m not too happy that it broke so soon...</li>
    <li> I love these curling wands they heat up super fast. They do what they are suppose to. I couldn&#x27;t imagine spending $200 on a set like this when this one does the job perfectly for a better price. Only issue is changing the wands is a little hard but I guess that is a good thing because you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being loose and falling off lol...</li>
    <li> The iron stopped working after I used it just couple of times. It just doesn&#x27;t turn on, no matter for how long I hold the &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; button. I checked different electrical outlets with no luck. This iron has a lifetime warranty, so I contacted Cortex Toll Free: 877-726-7839 which was answered immediately. They&#x27;re processing my claim currently. I have to send it back with money order of $25 for S&amp;H enclosed. It&#x27;s 50% of whatever I was paying for the iron set. Such a hassle!</li>
    <li> Love this set! You can use it for any occasion!  Do not purchase the sets for 100s of dollars! This one works just as good if not better than any I have bought previously!</li>
    <li> I was researching all the interchangeable curling wands because I wanted to be able to toss/sell all my mismatched curling irons taking up room under my sink.  I couldn&#x27;t find a set that had the lineup I wanted -- 1\\&quot;, 1.25\\&quot;, 1.5\\&quot;, and 1-1.5\\&quot; tapered -- so I settled on this one because it was the closest to what I needed.  So far, I&#x27;ve only used one of the wands before a wedding (the 1.25\\&quot;), so I can&#x27;t comment on the overall quality or how long it will last, HOWEVER, those curls looked like a dream and it&#x27;s definitely the best my hair has ever looked.  Worth the price right there, since I could have easily paid the price of the entire set to get it styled in a salon.  It does get really hot and I forgot that the end is just hot metal, not plastic like on my curling irons, so I did manage to give myself a few little burns.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased, and my bathroom is a lot less cluttered.</li>
    <li> I like how fast it heats up and it&#x27;s easy to use. It holds the curl for most of the day, but it does start to straighten out after a few hours. I use the 1 1/4 wand, not the largest one. I use that one because I get tighter curls, they last a little longer than if I used the 1.5 wand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a staple to good hair!! Heats up quickly also cools down fast great for traveling stylists. I own two :) recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> the product got burned without any reason :S</li>
    <li> different sizes of curls, high heat do it in seconds, is relatively easy to use, fast to heat and more.</li>
    <li> My hair never stayed curled. My hair is also medium thick and it took forever to complete half of my head!</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!! Definitely Best Iron out there for sure:) This is a really good Iron especially if your hair tends to lose the curl fairly quickly, heats up really fast which is always a plus!</li>
    <li> I have bone straight hair and if i use this it&#x27;s still curly the next day LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It works really well and it&#x27;s nice having the different sizes. It can get really hot which can be both good and bad. I&#x27;ve burnt myself a few times, but it really isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday. She didn&#x27;t us it till over a month later when the weather was good to have curls. When she turned it on it heated up and then the screen read error. it didn&#x27;t heat up enough to make a strong curl on her hair as it kept reading error flashing. What really sucks is that Amazon doesn&#x27;t leave a number to call for customer service as it wants to direct you to everything online. Then they ask you questions as to what product you have questions on, when you click it they see that it has been over 30 days to return the product and therefore don&#x27;t give you an option to explain your situation. So if you are reading this Amazon, just know that I see through your bull corn rerouting method. I will not want to purchase products like this in the future, because there is no easy way to explain its damaged to a live person. Instead you will get a run around webpage. Even if i would have tested it the first day I got it and it reacted the same way, the product still sucks as I was sold a damaged product that matches Amazons customer service!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Easier than regular curling irons by far &amp; work 10x better. Told all my girlfriends about it. If your contemplating whether to buy, the answer is YES!</li>
    <li> It is by far the est curling iron I have used! It&#x27;s hard toget hold of at first if your use to a clip but you get the hang quickly! The only thing is I would like a little better glove!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my traditional clip curling iron and am very happy with it. Love that I can change the barrels to different sizes, it heats up quickly, love the temperature setting and it makes beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron.  The heat setting is perfect for long-lasting curls.  I went with this curling iron because of the multiple barrels... but I ended up liking the first size I tried, and haven&#x27;t even attempted to switch to the other sizes!  But it&#x27;s nice to know I have them in case I want to experiment some more!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandaughter.  She has long hair and loves to curl and style it.  She told me over and over that she loves this set.  She, also, told me that I am the best &amp;#34;Nana&amp;#34; ever for getting it for her.  She is a teen. Better pricing than local stores.</li>
    <li> This tool is great! It arrived on time and works just as expected. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the &#x27;heat resistant&#x27; gloves though!</li>
    <li> Its easy to use. The curls last long but it burned my hair leaving lots of split end so i stop using it.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! Especially the fact that you get multiple size barrels. The only thing this I don&#x27;t like is the glove but I don&#x27;t really need it anyway. Thank you for the great product!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! I have extremely straight hair that NEVER holds any kind of style and this is the first product where I can have fun curls/beachy waves all day long! My new best friend!</li>
    <li> consistent heating. love that the parts are changeable even though I haven&#x27;t used anything but the largest size. I&#x27;ve used the other sizes on friends, though. Great for traveling. doesn&#x27;t burn hair and the curls stay regardless of hair type. Mine is thick, dark, straight, asian hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ecstatic with this product..  it is EVERYTHING!! Nd more. I had noo idea Hw much i&#x27;d love this thing. It&#x27;s officially my Number one essential. #HappyCustomer &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I was really suprised at how user friendly this product was. I would definately recommend it. I love that I&#x27;m able to get several different size curls with one product.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this curling wand! Gets super hot and keeps my curls fresh even when it is humid out. And I love the fact that I can choose what size I want my curls to be everyday without having 700 curling irons in my bathroom!</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this purchase, but after only 5 uses over the course of about 6 months it is now broken.  It gives a constant ERR message and will not turn on/heat up.  I tried contacting the company however their email is no longer valid.  There is never an answer at the customer service phone number.  Do not buy this product as the company is not there to help when it breaks.  An $85 curling iron should work more then 5 times.</li>
    <li> It comes with the Glove and all the Sizes you would want to use for this product. Glad I purchased</li>
    <li> Barrel gets suuuuper hot so be sure to wear the glove provided. The different sizes are great however once hot, it&#x27;s hard to switch to different sizes cuz you have to hold the barrel to take them off. I&#x27;ve found I use one size most of the time after all. The product is great and works perfectly and the price is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this curling wand. Exactly what I wanted. I use it all the time. It works great...love the different sizes!</li>
    <li> I purchased one because the price drop so much so I order one box. When I received it  my wife try it &amp; she like it. Then my sister &amp; 2 of my aunts asked me to order 3 boxes. Very good product. The country of manufactures is China \\&quot;if you wonder where\\&quot;. Highly Made.</li>
    <li> i was skeptical at first over this product because i had never heard of this brand and i loved my sultra bombshell curling iron very much but i have too many curling irons and i just wanted to travel with one instead of five! so this seemed like a good solution. I was so right! This curling iron has changed my life! my hair looks so good and I&#x27;m so happy that i have so many options on hair styles and so much more room in my bathroom! i defiantly recommend.</li>
    <li> one of my girlfriends recommended I get a wand, I originally had a curling iron and used it once when my hair got caught on the lip of the iron, the wand is great cause you just wrap your hair and release and the curls look great, your hair can&#x27;t get caught on anything and you have different barrels to change the size of your curls.</li>
    <li> If the last two barrels were not the same size, this set would be getting a standing ovation from me. I absolutely LOVE the curls that these wands create in my hair and how long they last after I finish them. The irons snap into the handle very well and the digital reading is a favorite of mine. The HEAT IS REAL, which is nice because you do not want an iron that will not heat up, but make sure you wear a glove because you will get burnt if you don&#x27;t. I learned the hard way. Some find the glove that comes with it uncomfortable, but I think that it works just find. Obviously you cannot put your hand directly on the barrel even if you do have the glove on, because the highest heat setting is simply not meant for that kind of action, so I am not sure why so many complain that the glove is useless. Now, on to the sizes of the barrels. The smaller two are the same size, and one is tapered and the other is not. If that is an issue for you, then just be mindful of it, but honestly, you are still getting an excellent deal for all of the barrels! I am a fan, and would definitely recommend these to a friend!</li>
    <li> This is sooooo easy to use. My hair would never curl in a curling iron with the clip if i hadn&#x27;t straightened it first. My hair is very frizzy, but this little baby gives me beautiful curls without the frizz and I don&#x27;t need to do anything but have dry hair and brush through it! Works really well and the curls hold all day. I don&#x27;t have to use any hair products either. Just my hair and the wand! Its perfect.</li>
    <li> Really nice product that doesn&#x27;t burn hair, heats up quickly, and very easy to use.  I would def recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I got this particular curling iron to use on my wigs and it works great the fact that it has different settings is very useful do to the fact that none of my wigs require the same settings and that I dont have to worry about having it too hot on one and not hot enough on the other.</li>
    <li> omg!!! you guys sent me a defect product! I&#x27;m so upset!!!!! all my $50 wasted. what a rip off. ugh.</li>
    <li> One of the best curling wands you could have.</li>
    <li> My hair is really straight and sometimes really hard to curl. Once I bought the Fahrenheit, my curls came out gorgeous ! They stayed all day long !</li>
    <li> this is amazing and was cheap as well! it works amazing temps up to 430. u can interchange sizes to get any type of curl you want. i love love love this! and recommend it to everyone! get it here b/c others will charge more</li>
    <li> I have had this thing for a few years now and I have to say that I love it!&lt;br /&gt;This is my first and only curling iron/wand. I&#x27;d never used one before and had no issues getting the hang of it, though I should mention I&#x27;m ambidextrous so I can easily switch hands to do both sides. BONUS: the glove works on both hands, make sure you use it cause this baby does get hot!&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research into curling irons and wands and finally decided on this one because of high reviews, the barrels are made of tourmaline, and it came with 4 sizes to try out, a money and space saver!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve traveled with it and use it all the time, one barrel in particular, and it still works as good as the day I bought it. I&#x27;ve had no issues with it frying my hair. It heats up quickly and evenly and can make multiple style curls depending on how you use it. I would definitely recommend this wand to anyone interested in a curling wand and would purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED IT AS A GIFT AND IT WAS PERFECT. IT APPEARS TO BE A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT AND IT IS EASY TO OPERATE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with them... It makes my hair so curly and it last for a long time really recomend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it comes with different barrels.  That is the only thing I liked.  The barrels were difficult to change and were way too slippery.  It was difficult to keep my hair from slipping off.  The curling iron stopped heating after about 6 months and of course, I didn&#x27;t have the purchase materials any longer.  I feel like I wasted a lot of money and would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this wand. The only problem is the curling iron turns on when it wants too. I think there is definately a malfunction with the curling wand. When it does come on it is great.</li>
    <li> It was greattttt!! I lovee itt and would def. recommend others to buy it because it heats up right away its a big size it has warranty and it comes with many different sized tubes. Other curlers were more expensive and weren&#x27;t at my standards.</li>
    <li> I recieved my styling wands in brand new packaging ,4 different wands for tons of different size curls n waves , ive previously bought 1 of these type wands for more thn double wht this set was at a hair supply store and it was garbage aftr a few uses , this ceramic is high quality n its wrth waaay more thn wht u pay here , would definetly recomend this for any hair perfectionist ..</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite curling wand. I love the different size barrels and the different hairstyles you can create with it. It heats up fairly quick and leaves my hair curly for hours!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift.  She loved it!</li>
    <li> I love this wand!  It heats up quickly and I like being able to switch out the barrel sizes.  They shipped very quickly too.</li>
    <li> Loved the way it made curls for my hair! Easy to use and different temperature settings to choose from. You will need the glove to use so your fingers don&#x27;t get burnt. It was a great price for a quality product. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I ordered it, it came pretty fast so that was a plus for me kuz I wanted to hurry and try this sucker out..soo wen i got it I did use it right away.i love the temp. Setting very very easy to use and see ,although one barrel came slightly damaged and it was the one I was Guna use it had a dent in it but its not that noticeable well to me it was,bt I wasn&#x27;t Guna let that make or break me kuz I new I would still get the same results even if that dent wasn&#x27;t there.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I curled my hair I didn&#x27;t use the glove just my preference kinda bothers me a lil after I was done I loved the curls!&amp; yes the curls do last more than two days!very happy with this buy and would recommend to any of my friends or aunties  kuz. I do not wanna let them barrow mine haha. .</li>
    <li> This product is a curling wand. There is no clip to hold hair which is very awkward to use. Not what I was looking for at all.</li>
    <li> when I changed it to the thicker curler it didn&#x27;t want too work but other than that I love it</li>
    <li> I LOVEE THISSS CURLER. IT HOLDS MY CURLS IN WITHOUT ANY HAIR SPRAY. AND THE CURLS LAST UP TO 2 DAYS</li>
    <li> I bought this tool in hopes of working more styling &amp; updo&#x27;s in my business. It had been sitting in my station &amp; only brought it out yesterday to use it on a client. Turns out it doesn&#x27;t work, wont even turn on. Since it&#x27;s past the return policy it would cost the same to just buy a different one. Thanks for nothing.</li>
    <li> Got the package on time, great condition and immediately plugged it in. Product arrived as described -- on/off switch, temp control buttons, 4 tourmaline barrels of different sizes (note the 13 mm size is tapered, the others are not), swivel / twist-free cord and includes a heat glove. Sounded perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issue switching the barrels from one to another -- you just have to line them up -- it only goes in one way and once you look inside it&#x27;s easy to figure out.  Also, realized had to hold down the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button for a bit for it to light up / turn on.  No problem there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once it was on -- with the right barrel inserted and locked -- the temperature would not go above 72 degrees no matter how many buttons I pushed nor for how long. The barrel remained stone cold after 20 minutes.  I tried 4 different electrical outlets at home without luck.  Tried a different barrel, same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned the item to Amazon with no problem. Got a hassle-free refund and free return shipping within 2 days.  Decided to go with a single barrel wand after reading several reviews that others have also experienced non-functional products in the 3-in-one and 4-in one varieties.</li>
    <li> I have really frizzy thick hair, it&#x27;s  so thick that sometimes I get headaches from wearing my hair up in a ponytail because of the weight.. I have to flat iron my hair with a expensive flat iron in order to wear my hair down, otherwise it will not last through out the day. I love this curlying iron , my hair is to my waist and it does not take long to do my hair. I will never touch the flat iron again. My curls last through out the week! I&#x27;m glad I took the chance and  purchased this curlying iron!</li>
    <li> I have pretty much replaced my curling irons for this one. it&#x27;s perfect it&#x27;s comes apart for easy travel. it comes with it&#x27;s own glove. the only thing that I have noticed is that for as long as I have had it which has been approximately over a year and  a half, when you connect the iron part it is a little loose and that can affect it being turned on or reading an error code. but I some how always get it to work. I am going to buy another one when this one finally craps the bed. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and the curls I get look like the beautiful, bouncy beachy waves that everyone is trying to get. I get a lot of compliments and &amp;#34;how do you get you hair that way?&amp;#34;.....LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My hair is hard to keep curls and this is the first wand I&#x27;ve bought and I really love it. I&#x27;ve used the biggest barrel and the I think 1&amp;#34; barrel, I love how my hair held the curls. I&#x27;d recommend it. I love how you get different sized barrels so you get more variety for a good price.</li>
    <li> It is a professional iron that is made with high quality cords and digital temperature.. It keeps my curls in for days....</li>
    <li> I have seriously straight hair that is pretty thick. For months I have been trying to perfect the long flowing wave style for my long locks. I have tried several curling irons and wasted so much money and time. I researched this curling iron on Amazon, read all the reviews, and even watched videos on YouTube demonstrating how well it works. I bought it, it shipped and arrived quickly, and in conjunction with the right styling products, I have got to admit that I am finally happy! Had to get used to wrapping my hair around the wand, but that didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
