<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful.....love moroccanoil and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. It really works. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product great transaction</li>
    <li> This is the best oil for your hair .. Love it.</li>
    <li> Hve been using this product for years. It works well the mask.</li>
    <li> This oil really de-frizzes my hair and leaves it shiny, not greasy. I use this every day after blow drying my hair</li>
    <li> Took a long time to receive, but I love, love, love the product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really helps tame the frizzies!! This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered the product with the pump, definitely a plus!</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel like silk but not greasy. And you use such a small amount that the bottle will last for such a long time. To avoid spills and residue outside the bottle I recommend getting one with a pump.</li>
    <li> Product came in a timely fashion, however it does not have the same fragrance as the Moroccan Oil I purchased from a salon. I&#x27;m not sure if it is a counterfeit or not.</li>
    <li> keeps my hair soft and hydrated, doesnt smell bad.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product... there are many hair oils out there, this one smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  Gives it that extra shine and softness and helps control flyaways.  I&#x27;ve had people stop me in stores asking what my perfume was (I wasn&#x27;t wearing any).  It&#x27;s a light scent, but I do love it.  This is one of the few products I will pay the high price for because I like it that much.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for hair care. Leaves no oily hair, but the leaves hydrated and soft. Recommend for all hair types.</li>
    <li> The aroma of this oil and the way it makes my hair so nice and soft and manageable is well worth the pricetag.  I love it and this seller got it here in a jiffy!</li>
    <li> I use just a little bit each day (one pump) that I was my hair. I really like it and I find the only other product that I need to use for my hair is hairspray. I made the mistake of trying a cheaper brand once and I ended up throwing it away. This is worth the money!</li>
    <li> A small dab great for hair.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  Has helped improved damaged, dry and dyed hair by 80% for me.  This is a staple in my hair care.</li>
    <li> great product, great transaction</li>
    <li> Great Product. Quick Shipping</li>
    <li> Very good product!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle already and I am using the first one for about 3 or 4 months already. It was so great, i am using it everyday, and my hair is manageably soft. I love it.</li>
    <li> Delivered as described. Brand new and pump works fine. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product leaves your hair smooth, shiny and smells so good, I bought the larger size available I think, the cost per oz on this size is the lowest.  You just have to take 2 drops, rub them with your hands and apply itr directly to the hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I like it very much, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have medium length curly thick hair which can be frizzy at times. I have battled with my hair since childhood; I&#x27;m 50 now. I&#x27;ve tried many many different hair care products. A co-worker recently gave me a sample of morroccan oil which worked fabulous!  It leave my hair very soft and never frizzy, it keeps the curls together and shiny, and looks as if I had my hair done professionally. Everyone at work and even in the grocery stores and while shopping always comment on how beautiful my hair is! This morroccan oil is the greatest product ever!!! My daughter who has long straight light brown hair even uses it to replenish oils lost during blow drying.</li>
    <li> this is my new obsession. i have thick, awkwardly wavy hair and this not only speeds up the drying process but also keeps my hair manageable and healthy looking. im trying to grow my hair long before my wedding this september and i think this is really going to support that goal.</li>
    <li> The photo in of the product is a bit confusing as to what is in the box.  For clarification, it is one regular blue box/bottle product with the pump, not two boxes or the green bottle.  It is a very good price for this product.  However, there is a marked difference between the original formula and the light version.  I noticed it immediately.  The light version has more of a sandlewood smell and the oil goes on more of a shine.  If using the regular version I noticed that it layed more on top of my hair rather than being immediately absorbed as the light version.  After drying, both versions were fine.</li>
    <li> Always a good product.</li>
    <li> price could be better though</li>
    <li> Been using this for years-great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought it before. Great bang for my buck.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product, it is great especially in the summer when hair tends to frizz.  My hair feels healthy and smooth when I use it.</li>
    <li> this is great and half the cost than at you hairdresser!.  gives my hair softness and holds blowdry..no static in winter either.  used on my grandaughter after swimming to detangle and keeps hair from knotting as her hair is very fine.  not oily either so can be used on all hair</li>
    <li> The wife likes it and she hasn&#x27;t complained to me about it, so I say it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair appear silk smooth. Since using this product my hair is no longer dry. It helps counteract the damage done by a straightener.</li>
    <li> Keeps the frizzies under control!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product .Love the scent!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Exceptional value.  I am a repeat customer of  Moroccan Oil via amazon, and I am always pleased with the product and seller.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it and this stuff keeps my hair from being so dry when I blow dry it.  Smells good too!</li>
    <li> You only have to use a small amount so it lasts forever! If you straighten your hair or blow dry it everyday def a must buy!!</li>
    <li> I use this product after Condi tioning it adds a finishing touch to your hair. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> Rub on palms, lightly touch hair for shine, nice light fragrance and to tame flyaway. Have used for years.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last 2 years and I absolutely love it!  At this time of year with all the dryness in the air, this product is exceptional for helping with static and fly away strands.  I would recommend this product for all that suffer from dry hair.  It is a miracle for your hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years. It works best when used with a styling brush and heat. Apply it to your hair (a little more on damaged areas) and then blow dry. It helps with frizz. Good product!</li>
    <li> My sister, niece and I all use this but for different reasons.  They love it because it helps control their curly hair - I like the moisture for my very fine, straight, dry hair. It helps give moisture and control without totally weighing my hair down - and it smalls nice.  And while it&#x27;s expensive you use so little, it lasts forever.  Mine didn&#x27;t come with a pump, though, and I wish it had.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Quick shipment. Great experience!!!! :D</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes hair so soft</li>
    <li> I love it! I am trying to grow my hair out and it seems to help. It helps get the tangles out of my hair, and I love the way it smells. This is the second treament that I have bought and I am still a big fan. It works great on my grandchildren&#x27;s tangled hair also.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky and shiny, easy to comb out without tangles, prevents split ends. I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love myself enough to promise I&#x27;ll never have to live without this product.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I came across thisproduct &amp; the entire line awhile ago &amp; use nothing else now. It gives shine, protection,&amp; smells wonderful ! It lasts forever cuz you don&#x27;t use much. Definately worth the $!</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and it does not leave your hair feeling greasy.  It lasts a long time and is worth the price</li>
    <li> This is a repeat order for me.  Love this product and you don&#x27;t have to use much for it to be beneficial.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this product two years after purchasing! It lasts a long time and works perfectly for my thick hair!</li>
    <li> very nice product. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I absolutlty love this product, I use it after I shower and then though out the week when I don&#x27;t wash my hair and it does not leave my hair greasy, my hair absorbs it and is making my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> I will buy again from here if I cannot get it cheaper from salon.  Moroccanoil is the best for color treated hair!!!</li>
    <li> Makes the hair silky!</li>
    <li> Provides great moisture without making hair too heavy.</li>
    <li> I Use Moroccan Oil Every Day.  This is the number one beauty treatment that I recommend to all my girl friends.</li>
    <li> I color and highlight my hair, so it tends to get dry......This is the best thing I have found to bring back the glow and shine !  best of all...It is not jusdt a &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34;.....It actually is good for your hair and scalp and your hair continues to Improve !  It only takes a drop or two rubbed between your palms and worked through your hair from scalp to ends.</li>
    <li> I love this oil treatment and love the price I pay for it online. It is so worth it. I would definitely order this online again.</li>
    <li> My daughter told me our hairdresser recommended this to her and I tried it and can&#x27;t believe the difference.  Would gladly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil is one of the best products on the market to keep hair in great shape and shiny! this is pure oil, comes in a convenient pump style bottle and you can refill your smaller bottles from it for travel. Great Bargain, considering the prices at salons.</li>
    <li> I like this Moroccan oil very much, but sometimes it blended into my hair too well. Overall, this is a great natural hair product.</li>
    <li> Makes my thick, naturally curly hair manageable without being frizzy.  Leaves hair feeling soft and not greasy.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Hair gets healthier Everytime I use it!</li>
    <li> control&#x27;s my frizzies smells great!</li>
    <li> Loved it. Buying it the second time. Best oil out there</li>
    <li> I use three pumps on my hair which is considered long. It gives me shine and softness for color treated and damaged hair. Once I&#x27;m done blow drying and curling my hair, I don&#x27;t have that greasy feel that most products leave behind.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have tried so many others but this really helps keep my hair from drying out.  I put just a couple of drops in my hands and run it through my hair the rest I rub into my cuticles.  Love it</li>
    <li> My hairdresser got me hooked on Moroccanoil.  It is absolutely THE BEST.  I have very thin hair on top, but it gets rather dry from coloring.  Moroccanoil keeps it looking very healthy and shiney.  Never weighs it down or makes it look greasy.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I have curley hair and so does my grandaughter. We both use the Moroccanoil and not only does it do a great job smoothing it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have fine, longer hair that&#x27;s color-treated and I use this product every time I shampoo. It&#x27;s amazing! My hair just soaks up the moisture and feels so soft afterwards. My hair stylist can&#x27;t believe how healthy my hair is now and they sell this product at her salon. I get it on Amazon because the price is much lower. I&#x27;ve bought from other sellers and it&#x27;s tampered with but this seller sells the real deal. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like crack for your hair.  The smell of this product is awesome too.  Makes my hair feel like silk.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that it arrived on time and with it&#x27;s full box. It was right like the description said.</li>
    <li> Would buy this product all the time but I can&#x27;t afford it all the time, so I found a cheaper product !</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Morrocan oil made my hair manageable. I have beautiful body and shine! Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
    <li> I was afraid after reading some other reviews that I wasn&#x27;t going to get Genuine Moroccanoil; I did get the real deal and am so happy. I LOVE this stuff and was excited to find such a large bottle for such a great price.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair look rich, and it was at a good price.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product.  Restores vitality and shine.  I use on wet or dry hair.  I also use in between shampoos.  I have long blonde color and keratin treated hair. I am particularly concerned about keeping it healthy.  This product really helps:)</li>
    <li> The item was received within 4 days....WOW that was awesome.  Very happy with my product.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that gets frizzy in humid weather.  I mix this oil with the styling cream and put it on my hair while it is damp.  It tames the frizz.</li>
    <li> This product is OK. I have mostly straight caucasian hair that does an unattractive wave kind of thing when it air dries or faces humidity. The oil works OK, but it&#x27;s not the miracle I was promised (especially at that price). I won&#x27;t be replacing this bottle when it runs out.</li>
    <li> This oil is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Its good for in-between hair wash and keeps the hair soft and silky. It does not make the hair look too oily.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look and feel beautiful. Don&#x27;t need to use a lot so the bottle lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend. My hair has looked and felt so much better throughout a hot, Georgia summer, even with all the pool time.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff...I am just the messenger. This item is especially good for gals that blow dry their hair frequently. The description and photo do not show it but the pump is included. Do not hesitate!!!</li>
    <li> The best stuff for dry hair! I have bleached my hair and put it through heat damage and this stuff really gives it back moisture and shine. Put a couple pumps of it on freshly washed damp hair, I just work it through with my fingers and then follow up with any other products you would normally use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a &amp;#34;restorative&amp;#34; product however, if you have split ends and breakage this is not going to help with that It&#x27;s only a moisturizer I would say. So worth the price.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and since they were out of the 4.23 oz. bottle, they supplemented with 2 bottles that equated the 4.23 and sent a letter of apology!  LOVE moroccanoil..</li>
    <li> This is the best oil I have ever used for my hair. It makes it feel so silky and smooth. It helps with the frizz, specially if you live in a humid environment. Ladies, if your hair it&#x27;s really damaged, use this oil treatment! It won&#x27;t fail you. I used to have damaged hair from all the minerals from the water and hair drier and humid weather and I started using this product and in a couple of months my hair was so healthy that everyone always compliments me on how health my hair looks. Great price, better than at the mall or hair salon pricing. Got it on time! Would definitely recommend! And even if do not have damaged hair, it a good way of keeping you hair health and looking beautiful!</li>
    <li> The absolute most important product in my cabinet!  I use this every day.  I apply it to my hair after I wash it.  I apply it to my hair every morning before I style it.  It is so light weight that it does not weigh my hair down at all, and I very fine hair.  Unlike most oils, this treatment gets absorbed into the hair.  My hair has gotten stronger and I experience very little breakage or split ends.  There are a lot of imitators out there.  But this is by far the best oil treatment on the market!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. Came complete even with a travel sample. Been using for years.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Helps me keep my crazy curly hair soft and moisturized. Plus it smells so wonderful. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair smooth and shinny and its all natural and good for it. Alittle expensive but it last for a long time. -GREGG HARRINGTON ALBANY</li>
    <li> I rated this product five stars because I am completely happy with it. It leaves my hair soft and shiny and NOT oily at all. I would recommend it to anyone with hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite product I&#x27;ve found for my hair! It makes it shiny, more manageable &amp; cuts down the drying time. Love that this one came with a pump!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I started using it in August 2013 and the first bottle was 4.23 ounces and lasted me 6 months, using it almost every day.  I love how soft and silky Moroccan Oil makes my hair look and feel, it&#x27;s not at all greasy feeling.  It is perfect for color treated or processed hair to combat drying out. I even use it on my freshly shaven legs.  It is the real stuff.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate, the Moroccanoil Treatment, keeps my hair soft and shiney. The bottle may appear small, but you only need a small amount, each time you use it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff . If you have a case of &amp;#34; old lady &amp;#34; hair , this will fix it ! Even fine hair will not be weighted down . It&#x27;s like youthful hair in a bottle !</li>
    <li> It is a little thicker in oil then pure Argan oil, which is much lighter but doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance. Although I&#x27;d say this is worth the money spent on it for how big the bottle is. You can get many uses out of it and it smells good. I usually put two pumps in my hand and out it on my ends because I have very dry and thick wavy hair. For thin hair I&#x27;d say one pump is all you would need so it isn&#x27;t so greasy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results I thought I was going to get maybe the formula is different.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and recommend it to everyone. Thanks for the efficiency and honesty. Buy more time with you</li>
    <li> This was what i was looking for and it works really well. i will definitely recommend to others. love it</li>
    <li> Yes, it more than met my expectations!!!  Love it.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Moroccan oil is the best! i have naturally curly dry hair and this makes it so soft and light when i blow dry it. nevery oily</li>
    <li> I love this product. Leaves my hair smooth and shiny. Would recommend to others. Will try other products by Moroccan oil.</li>
    <li> We love this product! It smells so amazing, without being overly pungent. It&#x27;s a great, clean smell. I&#x27;ve trained my hair to go about 3-4 weeks without being washed; it&#x27;s a great product to use daily or for a nice styling tool if you wash less often. Plus I cannot reiterate how lovely it smells.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and size was a great value, very happy !</li>
    <li> Love this product for my hair. A few pumps is all the product I need to keep my hair in great healthy condition even with blow-drying.</li>
    <li> Smells divine, and I love it every time.</li>
    <li> My hair is so much more shinier and under control when I use this product.  It is the only one I use.  Surprisingly although it is an oil my hair never becomes oily.  Although way to expensive I will continue to indulge myself and buy this product.  Some company says &amp;#34;Because i am worth it&amp;#34;  Yet, I am worth buying this splurge product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Great for styling and nourishing my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair a greasy mess, protects hair during blow dry, great finish, adds a nice shine to the hair and works great with curly hair (which needs more product and moisture overall).</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been using this for a while now and have never found anything better to help moisturize and protect hair from heat damage.  Really keeps frizz down too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for years and my salon stopped carrying it. Very happy to find it on here. Quick delivery too.</li>
    <li> Works well and a great price</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  My longtime hair dresser introduced me to Moroccanoil years ago and I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long colored hair that gets dry at the ends.  I can rub this oil into wet or dry hair and the ends of the hair are just&lt;br /&gt;as supple as the hair at the roots.  Plus, I am very, very tender headed and this Moroccanoil makes comb out easy-peasy.&lt;br /&gt;This item was shipped so fast I was amazed!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a number of years, it&#x27;s very good</li>
    <li> the best product for hair, cannot live without it. fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Got this oil for my wife and she loves it</li>
    <li> i love this product and have used it since it first came out on the market some years ago. I live in  mexico now and can&#x27;t  buy it there.  I looked at several retail stores and salons when I visited last summer and could not find it.  this time I ordered it on-line and it was shipped and here waiting for me when I got back to Tucson.  thank you!</li>
    <li> keep high qulitily....yeah...when i first time try that , it make my hair smooth.......oh, i like it , thank you so much ....</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It makes my long hair feel more manageable and softer. It smells fabulous as well and, I don&#x27;t have to use very much to get great results and amazing shine to my hair!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Everyone that gets near me says my hair smells great! Plus my hair is soft and healthy as ever!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, use it after every shampoo</li>
    <li> Love this product. I was first introduced to it at the Salon I go to. The girl that does my hair also has curly hair and could not say enough about it. I tried it and I&#x27;m hooked. I put it in my hair while it&#x27;s wet as soon as I get out if the shower. I comb it through and then add a gel cream and diffuse. It really cuts down on the frizz.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE Moroccan oil. I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years. Just one pump a day for my hair dry, and two when its wet. Makes my hair so much happier.</li>
    <li> this is the best hair product ive been using so far. it moisturise my hair and does not make it oily at all</li>
    <li> I received a free sample at a Holiday Mart and I have been hooked since the first time I used it. I love this stuff…...</li>
    <li> Awesome product and price was unbeatable</li>
    <li> Littlebit slow shipping, But good Quality.</li>
    <li> This really works! You just have to get used to a more oily feeling to your hair. it&#x27;s better than the alternative of dry, frizzy and coarse. I love it and appreciate the pump dispenser. This is the first product of this type I have purchase, so I can&#x27;t compare it to the other brands. I just can&#x27;t understand the price. What makes this so expensive? I may try a less expensive brand next time. But if I don&#x27;t get the same results, I will return to this product. I recommend Moroccanoil Original Treatment without any reservations.</li>
    <li> love this product!! awesome for my curly and frizzy hair!! also smells amazing, i recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and love the way it makes my hair look and feel.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it, with a natural curl.  This product helps me keep it tamed and shiny.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Expensive! BUT Love how my hair feels after using product!</li>
    <li> Nice product, but will clog your pores like crazy! I started breaking out all over the place and found out from my derm that it was from this Moroccanoil. All I wanted was for the split ends to calm a bit with the use of this product so I was very stunned. Immediately upon skipping this product cleared my face from all the acne. I still suffer multiple acne scars that will take couple months to go away. Shouldn&#x27;t hair products like this be more sensitive to skin needs especially if it is for use after shower? Buyers with large pores or sensitive skin, would you rather have your hair be a bit dry or end up with facial breakouts? Think again!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this oil.  It is greaseless and leaves our hair very soft and smooth.  We both have a tendency for dry frizzy hair.  Her hair is curly, and mine is wavy.  It works great for both of our hair types.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but you can go to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and get the Argan oil cheaper and it works the same.</li>
    <li> Use this on myself and my dog and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Smooth silky hair that lasts days and weeks with my dog.</li>
    <li> Never a bad hair day with this oil. Love it, and so do my daughters.</li>
    <li> Love the moroccanoil treatment for my hair!  Hope I never run out.  Great price and great shipping! ;)</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely, positively fabulous on one&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s light, it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. Giving your hair shine and body without all the other harsh chemicals on your hair.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product!  Reduces frizz,  helps with dry hair...Only product I use before blowvdrying!!</li>
    <li> Great not only for hair but also for skin care, especial in dry seasons. I mix it with my regular skin lotion and it helps to retain moisture longer, as well as leaving skin supple.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite hair product! I&#x27;ve used it for years and won&#x27;t use any other hair oil. Worth the money for the best! Smells amazing and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> item as described, shipped fast</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product helps my hair stay straight and frizz free. I love it. However, it is a little expensive.</li>
    <li> I ave very dry hair, this products really does wonders to make it feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Perfectly soaks into my scalp of fine grain hair.</li>
    <li> I only buy Moroccanoil.</li>
    <li> If I can&#x27;t buy this from Amazon I&#x27;ll be lost! It&#x27;s the best hair products for my hair.</li>
    <li> The product works great, and last like it&#x27;s supposed to, it&#x27;s one of the better made products,  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Never leave home without it</li>
    <li> Wife likes it; she&#x27;s amazing... so... 4 stars  :)</li>
    <li> I have tried similar products by other companies, and this is hands down the best.  My last bottle, which was a smaller size than the 4.23 oz bottle I got this time, lasted over 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I do NOT recommend you use the pump that comes with this.  A single pump provides way too much product.  I thought the pump would be useful, but in actuality, the product works best (on my hair) when I place the open bottle on my palm, turn the bottle upside down then backside up, and rub what comes out into the skin on my palms, then lightly run my palms through my hair - working my way up from the ends to the scalp.That&#x27;s the perfect amount of product, and probably the reason the bottle lasts me so long.</li>
    <li> The product it self is very good.&lt;br /&gt;However, I am not very satisfied with the package.&lt;br /&gt;It seems that it has been pressed and the box has some crease on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its good though.</li>
    <li> Great on my hair, and smells really nice.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the product. My hair does not feel the same.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping,  great value!</li>
    <li> Great product! Recommend</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just great!  it works amazing and it repairs your hair/ gives it shine and smooths out fly aways&lt;br /&gt;my stylist in Toronto recommended this and he&#x27;s a top stylist there... my stylist in NYC uses it as well... check it out... it&#x27;ll last months and months as well bc you only need a little</li>
    <li> Using this product is one of the best thing you can do for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not only it smells really good but after you use it you can use the excess oil for your hands.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of times my friends will ask if it makes your hair oily.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you follow the instruction and not put the whole bottle on you head it will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitively recommend this item to any girls. long and short hair.</li>
    <li> Great at moisturizing the hair.  It also gives your hair a nice sheen.  Even if I have to go without using conditioner (which, with curly hair is a big no no), my hair is fine.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by other similar products.  Pay the extra money for Moroccan Oil.  Okay to use before blow drying and after.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product for those with very dry hair.</li>
    <li> Just a small amount before you hot iron/straighten your hair and even chemically treated hair looks great.  Pump is handy.</li>
    <li> O produto realmente veio conforme a propaganda! Do tamanho correto e junto com o spray, conforme estava no desenho demonstrativo no site!</li>
    <li> I love this product - it&#x27;s amazing stuff and smells heavenly. My sister also loves it and I usually purchase her a large bottle as a gift each year for her birthday. This was advertised as &amp;#34;New in Box with Pump&amp;#34;. It arrived without a box so I was a little disappointed as gift wrapping it was cumbersome. Might sound a little shallow but if it says new and in a box, I expect the box.</li>
    <li> After sampling this product at the salon, I decided to buy it.  My first bottle lasted 2 years!  I have fine natural blonde hair, and live in Florida. The sun, wind, and salt air take a toll on my delicate strands.  Moroccan Oil saves me from needing major haircuts.  It protects from damage, detangles, softens and reduces breakage.  A little goes a looong way, so don&#x27;t overuse.  Try a SMALL pea sized drop, rub your hands together, and apply to ends first.  Smooth your hands over the top of your hair with the excess; avoiding the scalp and hairline if you have oily hair.  (Don&#x27;t rinse your hands--it&#x27;s a great fix for dry hands and cuticles).  I&#x27;ve tried several \\&quot;argon\\&quot; oil brands and none of them stack up to Moroccan Oil.  They leave a sticky residue on my hair, making it hard to comb, breaking my hair and clogging my brush.  Hope this helps some of you with your decision.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal!  Works great and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Hands down THE best hair oil out there....it&#x27;s light yet very effective. My daughter turned me on to this oil and I tried about 3 others when my bottle ran out....terrible. This Moroccan oil is the one you should have</li>
    <li> Great oil for my hair! It keeps it soft, but not flat during the day and helps calm the frizz in humid weather.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It sells itself I swear.</li>
    <li> The scent is intoxicating.  The feel is ravishing. The look helps my hair.  Life is better with this stuff.  Feels good.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Pure argan oil is better.</li>
    <li> Poor customer service by the distributor but great product. Item was sent and arrived broken and had a very difficult time getting the company to resend and think about better packaging since it comes in a glass bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Excellent price! I bought the really small bottle at a salon for $45 and they were selling the large one for over $100. Great deal! Quick delivery and love having the pump feature!</li>
    <li> My hair seems to be growing thicker and fuller since using this product.  Smells incredible too!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I just don&#x27;t use it in my hair,  also use it as a body oil after shaving.  It smells heavenly, my family always comments on how good I smell when I use it.  A little goes a very long way.  If you use too much, you&#x27;ll know it.  Your hair will be greasy and weighted down.  A bottle of this lasts me forever and I use it on shaved legs, too, and I have very thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> I just love this product! Makes my hair feel so soft. Also love the smell.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.  Yes, it is expensive but as you age or if you do a lot of things to hair... it tends to dry it out, it needs oil.  This oil will make your hair feel like it used to to ... before it got so dried out.  I love my hair again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really a good product for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s used by my hairdresser and I like to use it also at home.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it</li>
    <li> Have used for years on my coarse hair.  Works well in very humid conditions.  Very few hair salons carry it.</li>
    <li> Good product! I have very fine hair.  I apply the oil at the ends, and it absorbs in. It does not look greasy or add any weight to may hair.</li>
    <li> Love my Moroccanoil!  However, recently discovered that it causes my bleached hair to turn yellowish.  Have since switched to a clear color oil, but will keep my morroccan oil for when I decide to go darker again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! It makes my hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down. Best hair product hands down!</li>
    <li> This is completely fixing my fried hair! I recommend this to anyone! Especially if you have hair that needs TLC</li>
    <li> This oil has brought my hair back to life.  This is the ONLY brand that is not greasy or heavy on my fine hair. ( and its the orginal)  It came super fast from the third party seller and no leaks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell. It&#x27;s too strong for me. I think this moroccanoil likes other similar type of the oil hair treatment. Nothing look special.</li>
    <li> Purchased and shipped to my door for a fraction of what my Wife pays for the exact same thing at the salon.  It is doubtful she will ever buy this from her Stylist again.  The days of being overcharged for product are over....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the real Moroccanoil.  The smell and texture are different.  Dissapointed!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for the past year and it&#x27;s great for dry ends. I put it on after I wash my hair before I blow dry my hair and it makes my hair less dry after the blow out. highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> An amazing product! I use it everyday, it has completely changed my hair! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really in love with the Moroccan oil . I like how my hair is feeling and smelling after I use it. And even if I use more, my hair is not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is my go to oil!  Great smell and absorbs rather quickly.  I have tried less expensive brands and they work like less expensive brands.  A little goes a long way so go easy or you will think that Moroccanoil makes your hair too oily.</li>
    <li> When I ordered the product I did not see anything saying it was light.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for the product that was not light.  I would not have&lt;br /&gt;ordered it if I had realized it was the light version.</li>
    <li> Love this oil as it is much better than using hair gels that are full of chemicals. I have been using this product for about two years and it works as good as any hair gel and at the same time makes your hair shine and smell good at the same time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Ok to use on hair and skin. A little unde the yes with. Cold too makes you look refreshed instantly!</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair.  Moroccan oil makes my hair shinny, smooth, and controlable.</li>
    <li> Great product! Helps my hair feel so very smooth.</li>
    <li> ON LINE SHOPPING WAS CONVENIENT, IN A FEW DAYS PRODUCT WAS&lt;br /&gt;AT MY DOOR.&lt;br /&gt;NICE SMELL TO THE OIL &amp; MAKES YOUR HAIR GLOW.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Great price for such a large size.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product and she shares it with our daughters. It is a bit costly and hope it gets lower. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for curly hair and like the larger bottle because I use a lot of it.  Can use it on wet or dry hair and drying curly or blow drying</li>
    <li> Best product on the market for smooth and shiny hair...helps drying time, too. It is a little expensive, but lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using moroccanoil for years that I buy from a salon i bought this bottle from this dealer on Amazon and it&#x27;s not real! The bottle is different but more importantly the smell is off and the color of the product is much darker! I complained and they say they are &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;. Like I said I&#x27;ve been using moroccanoil for years on my hair and my 3 kids that&#x27;s 4x a day for two years! The minute I opened this bottle I can tell it was different. If your like me and very familiar with the real product don&#x27;t buy this! If you aren&#x27;t familiar you won&#x27;t notice the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT ever buy from this person again!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, but makes hair go straight. So, ladies if you have curly to wavy hair like mine, it will straighten your hair out. This may be a miracle to some ladies.. but not this one.</li>
    <li> Purchased the smaller size (3.5 oz) from my local salon for the same price.  I use this product every day.  I love it.  It makes my hair less frizzy and my natural curls/waves look great.</li>
    <li> i used this product and it did not do anything for my hair and made my scalp inflammation flame up.  You are better off buying the Immortal&#x27;s Oil (just google it) which is so much better and renewing to the hair and scalp, and does more what this oil can ever dream of.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, half way down my back, I use this everyday.  Put about a quarter size amount in your hands and rub it to spread it.  Do ends of hair first and then finish at the scalp.</li>
    <li> I was born with thick curly hair that tends to be frizzy.  This product does a nice job smoothing the cuticle and I am pretty sure I will not be able to do without it from here on.  It smells good, my hair looks much healthier, and styling is a breeze.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Great product, great value.</li>
    <li> Works wonders and is not oily.</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccanoil for a few years now and love it.  The scent is nice, and it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that truly helps tame my fly-away hair.  I have fine straight color treated hair and I only need to use 1 pump (rub hands together then run my hands through my hair)  so the bottle lasts a long time.  The &amp;#34;1 pump&amp;#34; factor is important to me considering the price of a bottle.  I have tried other products through the years but this one has worked the best for me.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Terrific, light feel, helps hair manageability and smells just right.  Good stuff, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Such a great buy - I have been using for some time.</li>
    <li> Light weight frizz control, works as described.</li>
    <li> It works well. My GF uses the oil regularly and swears by its end results and the properties that it imparts to her hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever! My hair is healthier than it has ever been and growing fast. It is worth every penny. I live in the same state as the seller so the package arrived super quick. Product was new and authentic.The shipping was faster than the ETA which is a plus. I am definitely going to continue to business with this seller.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and its down wonders for my hair!  I also find it cheaper on Amazon than in my Salon.  It shipped quickly and arrived unbroken.</li>
    <li> i have naturally curly hair and use this product as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; before adding any styling products after cleansing...hair is silky and products go on smoothly and hair smell phenomenal! A staple in my hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> Review Your Purchases... I thing this is a Very Good Moroccanoil Orginal Treatment 4.23 Oz 125 Ml New in Box with Pump</li>
    <li> this is one of the finest hair oil</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;wonder treatment&amp;#34;, but this was the first time ordering from Amazon.  Everything went as promised, and the product is exactly what I expected it to be!</li>
    <li> Expensive but unfortunately wife loves the stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had friends give me substitutes and I won&#x27;t use them there is nothing like the morracan oil original brand. Great for hair, wet or dry, great for skin, smells fantastic and a little dab will do you. It&#x27;s worth the money. This is a fairly generous size might last 6 months if u use small pumps.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent service.  This brand of oil is consistently superb.  Have used the product before but this is first experience with vendor; will return to both when time to re-order.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom. She actually dropped it and it broke, but she still uses it so I guess it is worth the price haha.</li>
    <li> Great product, use it every time after washing my hair. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I live in Korea, and with the humidity, my hair does some strange things.  This product has been a total life saver for me.</li>
    <li> Great deal! This is liquid gold. I love this product. I have long hair and it only takes a dime size in my hair. I love this product. Been using for 10 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m am a huge fan of this stuff!! It is my favorite hair product for many reasons. It smells awesome, keeps my hair shiny and conditioned and makes drying my hair (my hair is thick) easier because it decreases drying time. Love It!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser can tell the difference when I use the Moroccanoil.  I have long hair and the Moroccan oil keeps my ends smooth, free of breakage.</li>
    <li> This is great hair product.  It revitalizes one&#x27;s hair but does not leave it feeling or looking greasy.  A good product.</li>
    <li> Works great for straightening and smoothing hair! Great price and the pump dispenser makes it a quick and easy application.</li>
    <li> Have tried other argan oils, but this is the one that I WANT to keep buying, smells great, and I have very static hair so I use it for that, and when I want to flat iron my hair, and mostly for the smell.</li>
    <li> I could never go a day without this product. I have naturally curly hair that I have to straighten daily and this product makes it smoother to get a brush through!</li>
    <li> part of product damaged.  seeler not cooperating, saying they are out of product and cannot replace.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that gets dried out easily.  I use this after I &amp;#34;pre-dry&amp;#34; my hair before I style with the dryer and a round brush for a nice shine.  I use only about a half pump otherwise it looks oily.  This is better than the thin hair version in my opinion.</li>
    <li> If you like the loose curl / beach waves look this is what you need to be using after you have curled your hair. This will hold your curls / waves and keep hair super shiny. I get compliments every day.</li>
    <li> smells good. doesnt weigh hair down. makes it less frizzy.</li>
    <li> Great product! Came in sealed package. Very fast shipping. Will order more.</li>
    <li> Anything that can keep my hair looking smooth, shiny and healthy for days is a winner in my book!  I had no issue with a strong fragrance like other reviewers. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Great price for the bottle. Thank you</li>
    <li> Why is this the ONLY product that makes my hair feel nice and silky? Nothing else works the same.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, the way it softened by hair and the way it made my hair so shiny!!&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly amazing!</li>
    <li> Everything I have heard about this product is true and more. This Moroccan oil works like magic on my hair. My hair has never been so soft and have so much body. This product does not weigh your hair down. I have had family and friends that I let try, they to were amazed instantly. All you need is a small amount in the palm of your hand. Afterwards my hair smells so nice. People even asked me what perfume I am wearing when it was the Moroccan oil that was the fragrance. I know I will be using this indefinitely. Love, Love, Love IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil for years and I love, love,love it!!! I recommend this product great stuff, reasonably priced. Go get yourself some ....</li>

    <li> I love this for my hair it came new with pump</li>
    <li> Amazing product--doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy but instead moisturizes, smooths, protects, and scents hair. Now a staple in my morning routine!</li>
    <li> Perfect!! My wife liked it.</li>
    <li> It helps straighter my hair. Make sure do not use too much of it and your hair will looks oil and greasy for whole day. I&#x27;ll recommend use a small amount on the bottom of your hair. Smells good, even my BF complains all the time for the smell.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Best price anywhere.</li>
    <li> I just receive the order, the two Moroccanoil treatment ship without original boxes and the QR code in two bottles been scratch.</li>
    <li> I love this product unfortunately my last order was not sealed and some of the product leaked out.  :(</li>
    <li> I first tried this product when I was sick ... my sister said it was good for dry hair... Yep, It is! it also works for other dry areas around elbows and knees... this is like a fix all for anything dry on one&#x27;s body. One does not need a lot to do the job... two thumps up... works good on hands as well.</li>
    <li> This is the one things I use every time I wash my hair, no matter what brand I use. Its just my go to. Its awesome for damage, processed hair. It just works for me.. recommended to everyone with problem hair and you can use it on dry hair or as treatment.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best treatment for all hair types! I use it on my long, fine hair and also on my daughter&#x27;s thick, super curly hair. It works wonders!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for hair in dry AZ.</li>
    <li> Provide shine and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> This is great for wavy hair.  No matter how much you use it does not make your hair look oily!</li>
    <li> So, now that people have been raving on about the Moroccan Oil for your hair, everybody and their brother has been touting Moroccan oil in their products.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  This is the real thing and all those other companies have to do is add a drop of it to their existing formula and then they can jump on the MorrocanOil bandwagon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A light touch, a light oil, a light fragrance all produce a shining light on my long, thick, healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this from Amazon and you will save so much money because the mark-up in the salons is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> it worrked wonders on my coarse dry hair. You don&#x27;t have to use much so the product lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Love,love it! Will buy again! My hair feels silky after using this oil,I use it every day&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with this, and therefore with me :-D</li>
    <li> Great product for thick hair - makes it smooth and easier to manage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many things in my hair, but this is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever had!! Definitely recommend it to everyone!! You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I expected. And it arrived on time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love that it is not greasy it actually obsorbs!  I would highly reccomend to color treated, dryer hair.  I am Blonde with thinner hair and it works great!</li>
    <li> This still is hands down the BEST investment in my hair I have ever made!! I have VERY dry, dull frizzy curly hair that I have been straightening for years. I also dye it a lot so it is SO damaged that it hasnt grown in YEARS. I got this for Christmas and it literally saved my hair. My hair is growing again!! I put this on my hair when its wet and I use an additional pump just for the ends of my hair. I lather until it is smooth. TA-DA! no more split ends!! Hence, your hair will start to grow! This product will NOT make your hair feel heavy or greasy, only soft, shiny and beautiful. Cant say enough good things about it!!!! And mine came from Amazon, and as far as I can tell it is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because my hair stylist put some on my hair and I loved the way it smelled and helped my hair, which runs on the dry side.  BUYER BEWARE!  I read many reviews on here where people were reporting that the product was fake.  My thought - &#x27;Surely Amazon wouldn&#x27;t continue to allow fake products being sold on their site.  They must have fixed it by now.  I&#x27;m going to buy this.\\&quot;  Well, I received the product and rubbed a few squirts between my hands and applied it to my hair.  The first thing I noticed was a strong perfume-y smell.  I didn&#x27;t remember it smelling this way when my stylist put it on my hair.  This perfume-y smell lingered on for about two hours.  Then it happened the next time, again.  So I got online and re-read the negative reviews, and then went to a beauty store and bought the real thing.  I compared the two twice - at two different times just to be sure - rubbing each on one of my hands and then comparing.  The real Moroccanoil has a very subtle fragrance, with a very mild floral scent.  It is VERY mild.  The product purchased here on amazon.com still had a stronger perfume-y smell.  They were clearly different.  So I contacted the company directly.  Here is what they wrote back:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Please be advised that stores like pharmacies, or any website including http://www.ebay.com, &amp; http://www.amazon.com, are NOT authorized retailers of Moroccanoil and that Moroccanoil has not and will not sell any of its products to these companies and/or websites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, we have reasons to believe the products currently available through these retailers are counterfeited. Consequently, we are in the process of taking strong legal actions, and we are hopeful this will soon stop these companies from offering these products that may jeopardize the health of consumers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccanoil can only be sold in qualified hair salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed at your own risk.  You have been warned.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use it on my feet too!</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil is the best treatment for dry hair! I put it on when it is wet after showering or when styling and it always does the trick!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this oil was the real thing...</li>
    <li> New at using this product.  I think I&#x27;m going to like it.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product. Smells great too. Good for curly or straight hair. Also feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> A good friend shared this product with me several years ago when she worked at the front desk in a beauty salon.  I had always wondered why her hair always looked so great ... and I believe this is one of the reasons.  My hair combs out beautifully before drying...and it also dries faster with this product for some reason.  A tiny dab will do... so it lasts for a very long time...I definately feel like I get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair. I use this with a leave in conditioner. Makes a huge difference. Worth the price. Really!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Have used for years.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face, neck and hands right before I go to sleep at night.  It&#x27;s feel rich on my skin, and within 10 min it&#x27;s dry, not oily.  I can really see a difference.</li>
    <li> Item that was delivered was wrong!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this Moroccan Oil brand and products.  This came sealed so I know it&#x27;s a new product.  Fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My hair is smooth and controllable. Amazing!</li>
    <li> The best for hair over process</li>
    <li> I love all the Morrocan Oil hair products. I have baby fine hair that is subjected to almost daily heated tools and this oil helps keep my hair smooth and silky. And WOW, I LOVE the fragrance!!</li>
    <li> very good deal and works great</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and continue to use it when my hair needs it.I also rub it on my dog&#x27;s coat !</li>
    <li> Best product out there!! Great for daily use for extra dry hair. I&#x27;m extremely bleached and it saves my life!</li>
    <li> This was the original Moroccanoil and came in original packaging and was well priced. I am very happy with my product and would order again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The smell and the quality. It honestly is worth spending extra money!! Leaves your hair feeling amazing. I have tried products similar to this because I did not want to spend $50 on this product. SOOOO HAPPY I DID! It lasts a long time so good investment. Recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  My daughter has a very full head of curly/wavy hair.  She uses this oil when she uses her straightener.  She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product to put on your hair to make it silky smooth.  It really does a good job at taming the frizzies and protects the hair when using heat appliances.</li>
    <li> I had bought this 3 years ago...the bottle lasted me for so long and it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time the ordered product feels and work different. The product whichi  brought 3 years ago was great...this new formula does not work that well for me.</li>
