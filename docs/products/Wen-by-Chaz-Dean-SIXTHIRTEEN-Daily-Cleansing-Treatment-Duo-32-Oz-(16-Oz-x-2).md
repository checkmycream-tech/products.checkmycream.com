    <li> Love this stuff use it every day. I was it first with Argan oil of Morocco.  Then put this in let it set for a bit and wash out and style.so soft</li>
    <li> excellent products from Wen. I have very thin hair and this shampoo &amp; all the wen shampoo products are wonderful for thin hair</li>
    <li> love it but its overpriced:( isn&#x27;t to keep buying it but I can&#x27;t afford it....please make it affordable, you would have a lifelong customer...</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I could not live without it!</li>
    <li> Made my hair fall out. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair product. Use on a daily basis for the conditioning of dry color treated hair.  Would recommend this product for everyone.</li>
    <li> This product rocks! I will continue to use it for as long as it is sold on the market. 👍</li>
    <li> My relaxer-free hair drinks Wen 613 on a weekly basis.  My ends have less breakage and my curls have more &amp;#34;bungee.&amp;#34;  Also, the scent is heavenly!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> wen hit the spot with this product works wonderful leaving my hair soft shiny just beautiful</li>
    <li> Is good condition for the hair. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> 613 is my favorite Wen product and that&#x27;s saying a lot!  Haven&#x27;t received anything that didn&#x27;t work well on my hair. Just a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Best &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; ever! Leaves hair soft and silky. Expensive though, so I use as leave in conditioner most days.</li>
    <li> I love Chaz Dean&#x27;s products for many reasons, and wanted to love this one, as well...however, I just don&#x27;t. Unless you have extraordinarily dry and damaged hair, this is just too rich and greasy, and takes forever to rinse it out. If it weren&#x27;t so expensive to ship it back, I&#x27;d return it. I still may.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling clean! This is my favorite Wen daily cleasening product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is nice! The vanilla smell really comes out and there is a nice clean burning feel from tea tree in it as well. Its a little bit expensive for how big the bottles are. The bottles were sealed with a foil pressure seal that needed to be pulled off before use. The instructions on the bottles is clear on the procedures of use. I don&#x27;t use the pumper and the amount suggested for number of pumps to use on the bottle is extremely high. I&#x27;m guessing the instructions are written for a girl with very long hair. I&#x27;m a man with a military haircut and a quarter size amount is plenty for me to wash my entire head and face. It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried but its got good oils in it so it doesn&#x27;t need many soap suds to work. I also did like the instructions said and after the shower rubbed a nickle sized amount in my hair and let it dry in. When I woke up I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair had become, from only using this once! Its the kind of shampoo that gets used on you in the high end salons that you never before bought. Now you can get that same salon aroma and feeling everyday. Real good shampoo, a review from a man.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;LF</li>
    <li> Absolutely loves this product. I have fine hair that tangles very easily and this product allows me to easily comb through and prevents newly washed hair flt always! Smells nice and o fine I can use less product than what us suggested.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have very fine thin hair and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Cannot recommend any of the other WEN products for dry hair. BUT this one is really good, smells nice, makes my hair look and feel clean and yet does not dry it out.  Amazing really.  This WEN is worth the crazy price.</li>
    <li> Hair shines and feels soft after using Wen. Fragrance of Lemon, Rosemary and Vanilla Bean has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for the last 5 years.</li>
    <li> I was a Cucumber and Pomegranate user, now I am a SixThirteen fan.</li>
    <li> got these for my friend and she loves the product</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE this product.  My hair looks amazing.</li>
