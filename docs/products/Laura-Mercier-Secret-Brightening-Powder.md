      <li>I love Laura Mercier products.  </li>
      <li>but you will look better after using this.</li>
      <li>more Thank you so Much!!!!</li>
      <li>I also use it to set creme shadows and eye shadow bases with the end result being a very &#x60;clean&#x27; eye look that resists creases.</li>
      <li>I have pretty fair skin but after applying foundation and a full coverage concealer under my eyes, I apply this under my eyes to set the concealer to make my eyes pop - and they do!</li>
      <li>It really helps with under eye circles and is great right in the inside corners of your eyes.</li>
      <li>It is reflective and fine.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t it cake and settle in fine lines?</li>
      <li>When you remove the lid you&#x27;ll notice a fine film of powder there.]</li>
      <li>I felt this would give me the lighter lift I would feel comfortable with through the day.</li>
      <li>Pat powder lightly on the area of application without dragging or tugging across skin.</li>
      <li>Rarely do I need more than this.</li>
      <li>I will absolutely buy more of this line</li>
      <li>I wish the product was cheaper, but if have eye smudge issues and it does an excellent job of keeping my eye makeup in place (no raccoon eyes, no more waterproof makeup!).  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect under eye brightener,  it brightens the area enough without looking obvious, if I ever run out of this I would purchase again.</li>
      <li>I love Laura Mercier&#x27;s product line and in addition to the product being easy to use and effective little samples also arrived with the package!  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll love how this powder weightlessly increases the coverage of under eye cover products while adding soft focus lightening and brightening.</li>
      <li>I am not unhappy I purchased this product, but don&#x27;t use it as often as I thought I would.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rare that one product works well on everyone.     </li>
      <li>It helps you get just the right amount applied.</li>
      <li>and then right side up again.</li>
      <li>this powder will absorb it all day,if not it will suck the moisture right out of your face</li>
      <li>this is a real deal!</li>
      <li>Some people love it, some people thought it was too sheer.</li>
      <li>Secret Brightening Powder is great under the eye where allergies, stress, and lack of sleep show up quickly.</li>
      <li>The powder is ground to the micronised level so it won&#x27;t settle in the fine lines to emphasize like other powders can so easily do.    </li>
      <li>It is a great price because a little product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I would suggest poking just 4 or 5 holes in the sticker covering when you first open it because it is very fine</li>
      <li>I recommend tapping the above mentioned brush into the fine film of powder on the inside of the lid.</li>
      <li>It works to make the puffiness and dark circles disappear; super easy to use with the camouflage brush.  </li>
      <li>It helps to brighten your eyes really well.</li>
      <li>This product was better than I expected.</li>
      <li>really.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very creamy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to put on too much and look like a dead man walking.  </li>
      <li>Unlike other powders which can accentuate the look of dryness and lines in the eye area, Laura Mercier&#x27;s specially formulated under eye powder gives a soft focus to fine lines and minimizes imperfections.</li>
      <li>This product is fine as long as you realize that less is more.  </li>
      <li>Good thing is you need so little, it will last FOREVER at the rate i&#x27;m using it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find a comparable product for less, so will continue to buy.  </li>
      <li>Ideally this is used to set Laura&#x27;s Secret Brightener (a lightening brush wand highlighter), Secret Concealer (Laura&#x27;s fantastic under eye concealer), and/or Secret Camouflage (Laura&#x27;s famous and award winning camouflage coverup.)    </li>
      <li>Laura Mercier&#x27;s heavenly and lightweight Secret Brightening Powder makes your under eye area look bright and naturally radiant.</li>
      <li>On top of that a few of the samples were from Shiseido!</li>
      <li>-Micronized Pigments provide a soft weightless texture that won&#x27;t settle into lines . . .</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually really surprised.</li>
      <li>Transparent Pigment offers an invisible lightening effect on the skin without the look of ashiness.</li>
      <li>I use this product because it gives me a natural look without settling into my pores &amp; lines.</li>
      <li>I typically never touch up makeup and with this, no need to.</li>
      <li>When you first get it and open it up, you might think it is too sheer</li>
      <li>all having varying degrees of lines, bags, and dark circles and still got the same fabulous results every time.</li>
      <li>and the other reviewer is RIGHT ON.</li>
      <li>As a makeup artist I&#x27;ve used this powder all around the eyes of women of a broad range of skin tones (from pale Irish to deep African American) and different ages (from teen to great grandma)</li>
      <li>I find it easy to apply but hard to determine the correct amount to apply.  </li>
      <li>The texture is light and fluffy, not too sparkly and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Secret Brightening Powder is also appropriate for all skin types.</li>
      <li>White powder for the face can be scary but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>i have pretty dark circles under my eyes and this is the one thing i&#x27;ve found that truly takes them away!</li>
      <li>Definitely not too sparkly (I barely noticed a sparkle) as some have mentioned.</li>
      <li>For some reason the only blemish that really bothers me is the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely love this!! I will be repurchasing!!!</li>
    <li> I put this under my eyes for an extra shimmer. It looks great.</li>
    <li> If you want to brighten your face without foundation give this one a try in your shade. I use this product because it gives me a natural look without settling into my pores &amp; lines. Provides a subtle made up result.</li>
    <li> I use it for under my eyes to set my concealer and it is the only powder I will ever use under my eyes again!  It keeps my make up from creasing and stays put all day long!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using secret concealer for a while.  It&#x27;s very creamy so I&#x27;d often find that my mascara would run.  This powder is great for setting the concealer.  As others have said, you only use a very small amount and pat it on with a brush.  Consequently, this powder wil  probably last a very,very long time.</li>
    <li> great to set concealer, excellent product</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Item as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Laura Mercier&#x27;s heavenly and lightweight Secret Brightening Powder makes your under eye area look bright and naturally radiant. If you suffer from chronic dark under eye circles like I do you&#x27;ll love how this powder weightlessly increases the coverage of under eye cover products while adding soft focus lightening and brightening. It helps concealer to dramatically reduce the appearance of dark under eye circles as it sets concealer to keep it in place all day!    Unlike other powders which can accentuate the look of dryness and lines in the eye area, Laura Mercier&#x27;s specially formulated under eye powder gives a soft focus to fine lines and minimizes imperfections. The powder is ground to the micronised level so it won&#x27;t settle in the fine lines to emphasize like other powders can so easily do.    Usage Instructions:   Keep in mind a little of this product goes a very long way. Pat powder lightly on the area of application without dragging or tugging across skin. Laura recommends using her Camouflage Powder Brush which I agree makes any powder applied in the eye area look softer and less heavy while guarenteeing a soft and even application. It helps you get just the right amount applied. Secret Brightening Powder is great under the eye where allergies, stress, and lack of sleep show up quickly. Ideally this is used to set Laura&#x27;s Secret Brightener (a lightening brush wand highlighter), Secret Concealer (Laura&#x27;s fantastic under eye concealer), and/or Secret Camouflage (Laura&#x27;s famous and award winning camouflage coverup.)    Remember, if you get enough of anything packed on in one spot it will show up so only use a little bit. I recommend tapping the above mentioned brush into the fine film of powder on the inside of the lid. [With the lid in place, tip the jar upside down and then right side up again. When you remove the lid you&#x27;ll notice a fine film of powder there.] Rarely do I need more than this. Even though the container is smaller than the average face powder,it has lasted me a very long time even with constant use. I also use it to set creme shadows and eye shadow bases with the end result being a very &#x60;clean&#x27; eye look that resists creases. The silky texture also makes applying powder eye shadow a dream! As a makeup artist I&#x27;ve used this powder all around the eyes of women of a broad range of skin tones (from pale Irish to deep African American) and different ages (from teen to great grandma) all having varying degrees of lines, bags, and dark circles and still got the same fabulous results every time. Secret Brightening Powder is also appropriate for all skin types. It&#x27;s rare that one product works well on everyone.     Finer Points:  -Micronized Pigments provide a soft weightless texture that won&#x27;t settle into lines . . . really.  -Silicone Polymers provide an out of this world, slippy, silky feel.  -White Transparent Pigment offers an invisible lightening effect on the skin without the look of ashiness. The formulation is so sheer that it works on any and all skin tones. Instantly opens up your eyes.</li>
    <li> I was in bluemercury where i get all my laura mercier products and the gal put this on and I was amazed! I didn&#x27;t even know what it was good for and holy brightening. i love love love it. and the other reviewer is RIGHT ON. a tiny bit goes a LONG way! this is a real deal!</li>
    <li> It works to make the puffiness and dark circles disappear; super easy to use with the camouflage brush.  Will it change your life?  No, but you will look better after using this.</li>
    <li> I love Laura Mercier products.  I am in the middle on this one.  I like it, but don&#x27;t use it daily.  I find it easy to apply but hard to determine the correct amount to apply.  I am not unhappy I purchased this product, but don&#x27;t use it as often as I thought I would.</li>
    <li> This product is a MUST HAVE to set under eye concealer! Stays on all day, this silky powder seals under eye concealer, keeps concealer from settling into any wrinkles, a little goes a very long way and brightens perfectly- never leaving raccoon eyes. I have been using for years and the powder last forever! I have tried others, but this product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It sets my concealer so it lasts all day.  I typically never touch up makeup and with this, no need to. My biggest beef is the shipping!  I bought three items and had to pay $5.95 each for three very small items!!!  I will never buy this brand again for that reason.  And this was after I asked if they would combine the packages.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect under eye brightener,  it brightens the area enough without looking obvious, if I ever run out of this I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great! I have pretty fair skin but after applying foundation and a full coverage concealer under my eyes, I apply this under my eyes to set the concealer to make my eyes pop - and they do! I definitely recommend this. When you first get it and open it up, you might think it is too sheer but i swear it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually really surprised. When i first opened this product I thought for sure I was going to be disappointed since I had heard mixed things after I had already ordered. Some people love it, some people thought it was too sheer. Definitely not too sparkly (I barely noticed a sparkle) as some have mentioned. It is a great price because a little product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I would suggest poking just 4 or 5 holes in the sticker covering when you first open it because it is very fine and if you are traveling or carrying this around, product will be all over when you open it. Definitely recommend! I will buy this again...its a staple.</li>
    <li> For some reason the only blemish that really bothers me is the dark circles under my eyes.  I felt this would give me the lighter lift I would feel comfortable with through the day.</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of brightness--no sparkles</li>
    <li> This product is fine as long as you realize that less is more.  It&#x27;s very easy to put on too much and look like a dead man walking.  The texture is light and fluffy, not too sparkly and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> i dust this over my under eye concealer and it&#x27;s magic!  i have pretty dark circles under my eyes and this is the one thing i&#x27;ve found that truly takes them away!</li>
    <li> I wish the product was cheaper, but if have eye smudge issues and it does an excellent job of keeping my eye makeup in place (no raccoon eyes, no more waterproof makeup!).  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a comparable product for less, so will continue to buy.  Good thing is you need so little, it will last FOREVER at the rate i&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> I love Laura Mercier&#x27;s product line and in addition to the product being easy to use and effective little samples also arrived with the package!  I feel this is a major bonus as I hate buying products without trying them first but you can&#x27;t always get to the store.  On top of that a few of the samples were from Shiseido! I will absolutely buy more of this line and I suggest it to others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I do see a little brightening effect when I apply it over concealer under my eyes and along the sides of my nose. I think it&#x27;s way too expensive for what it does though.</li>
    <li> for the price, not really worth it.</li>
    <li> I liked this powder.  It&#x27;s very subtle.  I had never used a white powder before and I liked the affect.  But this one is kind of pricey so I may try others before I buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the Secret Concealer #2 and it does seem to really set this concealer. Overpriced.</li>
    <li> I bought this to set my undereye concealer. It worked great as a setting powder, but it was too sparkly for me. I was looking for a matte finish, not anything shimmery. I returned it. Will not try this again.</li>
    <li> This product is light but yet of good quality. I really love the look and quality of the product. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Great item! Love the seller items and will return for more Thank you so Much!!!!</li>
    <li> I had never thought of putting a powder under the eye. Wouldn&#x27;t it cake and settle in fine lines? Not this powder. It&#x27;s feather-light and bright while it keeps Laura Mercier&#x27;s creamy concealer in place. It is reflective and fine. It can also be used to set eye make-up. Who would have thought...?</li>
    <li> White powder for the face can be scary but this stuff is amazing.  I loved the awake glow it gives me.</li>
    <li> This product was better than I expected. It really helps with under eye circles and is great right in the inside corners of your eyes. It helps to brighten your eyes really well. This should last a long, long time. Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I like that it keeps my concealer in its place! the only con is that on photos it looks very white</li>
    <li> You must have this in your makeup box! I am a Makeup Artist and I love to use this on everyone!</li>
    <li> My go to product for my outside corner of eyes.</li>
    <li> Really good product to set under-eye concealer and keep it fresh all day. Nice brow bone highlighter as well. A little is all you need, so even though it is a bit pricey, it lasts a REALLY long time. My daughter got a sample of it for me at Sephora and I was hooked after one use.</li>
    <li> Powder is ok, I use a brush and that is better then a finger. I have noticed the powder does not last as long as other brands. It is something you will need to re-apply.</li>
    <li> there is nothing brightening about this product.if you have oily skin this powder will absorb it all day,if not it will suck the moisture right out of your face</li>
    <li> Nothing outstanding about this product. Would not reorder.</li>
