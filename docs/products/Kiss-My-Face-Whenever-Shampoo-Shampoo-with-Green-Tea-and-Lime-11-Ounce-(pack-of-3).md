      <li>I love the smell of the lime in the shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love it because it&#x27;s by \\&quot;Kiss</li>

      <li>For gluten free members of our family who also find they have sensitive skin, this has been a wonderful solution.</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner in this line.  </li>
      <li>Applying more conditioner to my ends didn&#x27;t do any better either.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Aloe is no longer at the top of the ingredients list</li>
      <li>Try this shampoo, It is sure to brighten your mood.</li>
      <li>Top should be sealed for protection.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and its paired conditioner.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells so regreshing, tangy, light, citrusy, juicy, and really just a burst of happiness!</li>
      <li>OK, here&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not super impressed...    </li>
      <li>Without conditioner I can easily go 2-3 days without washing my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is clean and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Love it so much I won&#x27;t use anything else now!!</li>
      <li>It arrived on time and was securely packaged.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel right after I get out of the shower though, but I may have to switch it up with something else for a while.</li>
      <li>It did take some time getting used to the way my hair feels at first, but now I love it.</li>
      <li>Again, the new fragrance is quite nice</li>
      <li>:  After posting, I have done more research and discovered, most of the shampoos that are organic and natural use olefin sulfonate in their hair products.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;d like, but I love the light scent and the silkiness of my hair after the fact.</li>
      <li>All of this being said, I will say that it does leave my hair squeaky clean (albeit somewhat dry) and the scent of the shampoo is VERY nice.</li>
      <li>but nothing special either.  </li>
      <li>theres usually only one thing or couple that works really good...  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather much; so, end up using more quantity</li>
      <li>I really like the citrus smell of the shampoo, more like lemon than anything else.  </li>
      <li>Just washed my hair maybe five hours ago and it feels super oily already.</li>
      <li>have used this with the condition for months and my hair is super manageable.</li>
      <li>i have been on the look-out for more natural products and this shampoo definitely fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>and it did get super shiney after that... shinier...  </li>
      <li>but if you have mixed like mine nothing better than this with a lil wheat germ oil rubbed in after (adds even more shine)..</li>
      <li>i love how its sulfate free so it really cleans my hair and make my hair so easy to brush and so soft</li>
      <li>be forewarned that my hair was drier than normal afterwards, with more knots.      </li>
      <li>When messaged into the hair, using your normal amount WILL leave your hair very clean even if it doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
      <li>Lastly, I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m able to wear my natural wave much more easily with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would recommend only if you have a good scalp/dandruff free hair and want to use natural shampoo.</li>
      <li>We buy it on the subscribe and save program....makes it economical as well.</li>
      <li>Worth for money.</li>
      <li>I have never had results this good from other shampoos.</li>
      <li>I used the conditioner right afterwards and it did make it softer.  </li>
      <li>Oh right, the scent, it smells like lemonade with a hint of verbena to me.</li>
      <li>for a non-sls shampoo, it lathers very well (although i do have to use a bit more shampoo than i normally do to achieve this lather).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it does a good job of cleaning, even on oily hairs, but it only foam/sud half as much as normal shampoos but is organic and good for you.</li>
      <li>and I verrryyyyy rarely use hot styling tools.</li>
      <li>Pleasant, but a tiny tiny bit sweet.</li>
      <li>That said, it smells great and the same small amount that I used to use produces much more lather.</li>
      <li>I can tell you already in 3 washes that it is very gently on hair</li>
      <li>This shampoo is way too drying for me - and I have very oily hair!  </li>
      <li>This is my first Kiss</li>
      <li>Nope, it feels smooth, soft and manageable when dried.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I first started using this</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Kiss</li>
      <li>I guess I never realized how much my scalp itched before!</li>
      <li>but this stuff made my hair exactly like i wanted it</li>
      <li>straight ( after using curling iron)... soft and light... leaves my hair cleaner looking than creme of nature..</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel like \\&quot;next day hair,\\&quot; but clean!  </li>
      <li>First positive thing I have noticed is that my hair is not falling out as much as before.</li>
      <li>I brushed right thru my hair with no tangles at all!!</li>
      <li>Scent is very mild; doesn&#x27;t last after bath&lt;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> OK, here&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not super impressed...    The shampoo does NOT lather well. It takes approximately two to three times the normal amount of shampoo to get a good lather going. Also, I think it leaves hair somewhat drier than I expected it to, so I would NOT recommend it as an every day shampoo.    All of this being said, I will say that it does leave my hair squeaky clean (albeit somewhat dry) and the scent of the shampoo is VERY nice. It smells like limes. I do love that.    I doubt I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a really great &#x27;clean&#x27; scent.  It&#x27;s not too feminine and not too masculine.  I love it because it&#x27;s by \\&quot;Kiss My Face\\&quot; which means it&#x27;s cruelty-free.  It has a nice lather.  My husband, who is surprisingly fussy about shampoo, likes the scent and the way it leaves his hair.  And it&#x27;s gentle enough for the kids to use.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the Whenever conditioner was also in the Subscribe n Save program.</li>
    <li> Recently, I started looking for a natural, sulfate-free shampoo. I have short, slightly wavy, fine but thick hair, and most brands, both natural and chemical, make my hair flat and dull or voluminous, but with tons of flyaways.    I love this shampoo and its paired conditioner. I have never had results this good from other shampoos. Although I was skeptical about the scent, I found it pleasant rather than overbearingly limey, as I feared. This is a great investment, and a steal for the price! Go for it, then come back and write a glowing review yourself.</li>
    <li> Great for us &amp;#34;allergic to everything we touch&amp;#34; folks.  I have been using this over a year now and still not having allergy issues with it.  My hair is clean and healthy.  We buy it on the subscribe and save program....makes it economical as well.</li>
    <li> Just washed my hair maybe five hours ago and it feels super oily already. I barely use any conditioner, and when I do I use it only on the ends (my hair is tailbone length, fwiw). I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel right after I get out of the shower though, but I may have to switch it up with something else for a while. As always, ymmv.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells citrusy</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the product... but nothing special either.  If I did purchase again, I would just get it at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I REALLY did want to love this shampoo, but it just does not work for my long, thick hair. This is my first stab at using natural shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using this combo for almost 7 months now and it&#x27;s just not working. After my showers, my hair was getting tangled! Every time I brushed my wet hair after washing it was a frustrating battle. I figured that my hair just needed a trim, so I got a hair cut and hoped that was the problem. But NOPE! I was still getting tangles after washing my hair! Applying more conditioner to my ends didn&#x27;t do any better either. I feel like my hair seemed drier and lifeless. I don&#x27;t use any other hair products except for the occasional spritz of hairspray to keep flyaways in place and I verrryyyyy rarely use hot styling tools. I only used this product for so long because I stupidly bought 4 bottles of both shampoo and conditioner thru a deal on Groupon. I purchased another brand of natural shampoo last week and am completely amazed at how much of a difference just ONE use made! I brushed right thru my hair with no tangles at all!! Overall, this was not a good match for my hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sulfate-free shampoo after reading how harsh the sulfate cleansers are on color-treated hair and after reading the reviews decided to gave it a try. Love it so much I won&#x27;t use anything else now!! It leaves my hair shiny and soft and my scalp feels awesome after shampooing. I guess I never realized how much my scalp itched before! Try it--you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is way too drying for me - and I have very oily hair!  Stripped the oil and left my hair very dry and flyaway.  It also made my scalp dry and itchy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not have the junk, chemicals etc. the other shampoos have. It is good for my curly hair. My husband also uses for his hair (which is straight). This is the best value for a bottle of natural shampoo. I highly recommend it. We also use the whenever conditioner too. They have the same quality as other expensive natural shampoos.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Kiss My Face shampoo and I&#x27;m really impressed.  It is great for everyday shampooers, cleans your hair without leaving it dried out and brittle, and has just a fresh hint of lime scent.  It makes my hair feel like \\&quot;next day hair,\\&quot; but clean!  Kiss My Face products do not disappoint, especially if you care about what&#x27;s in your shampoo and/or have dry or sensitive skin/scalp.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair, which means the only time I get the sqeaky clean feeling after rinse is if I use harsh or clarifying shampoo. The problem is, while that left my scalp feeling clean, my hair gets really dry and frail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo cleans well. When messaged into the hair, using your normal amount WILL leave your hair very clean even if it doesn&#x27;t foam. You need to use twice the amount for the sud/foam action of normal shampoos. When I rinse, I can feel my hair being sqeaky clean, which usually translate to dry/frail/easily tangled hair when my hair drys. Nope, it feels smooth, soft and manageable when dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does a good job of cleaning, even on oily hairs, but it only foam/sud half as much as normal shampoos but is organic and good for you. Oh right, the scent, it smells like lemonade with a hint of verbena to me. Pleasant, but a tiny tiny bit sweet. Cleans well but doesn&#x27;t foam much, pleasant smell, and organic</li>
    <li> i have very oily skin and scalp.  as a result, even though i shower in the morning, by afternoon, my scalp starts to smell of oil.  i hate it!  and for the first few weeks of using this product, my hair seemed to smell even right after i washed it...as if i didn&#x27;t wash it at all.      i have been on the look-out for more natural products and this shampoo definitely fit the bill.  for a non-sls shampoo, it lathers very well (although i do have to use a bit more shampoo than i normally do to achieve this lather).  be forewarned that my hair was drier than normal afterwards, with more knots.      BUT...as a side benefit, and a totally unforeseen one as well, my scalp no longer smells of oil...even by the next morning.  i love that!  i think it has to do with the ph balance of this shampoo.  but again, this took a few weeks of patience to achieve.  anyway, i would recommend this to anyone who might have the same problem.</li>
    <li> It smells really good and does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this after an extensive search for sulfate free shampoo.  I do like how \\&quot;Kiss\\&quot; works on my hair but was deeply disappointed it contains olefin sulfonate which I have discovered is harsher then SLS.  Why do they have to ruin the good in a shampoo by adding this nasty stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  After posting, I have done more research and discovered, most of the shampoos that are organic and natural use olefin sulfonate in their hair products.  I read it is more harsh then SLS but what to believe?</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo recently for the first time.  Reading another review I see that the ingredients have been changed.  That could account for what I found when using this shampoo.  When I wash my hair with this, instead of feeling soft, it feels like cardboard.  I used the conditioner right afterwards and it did make it softer.  But I was very disappointed in this shampoo and I won&#x27;t ever buy it again.  Horrible.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend with similar hair type (long, straight, limp) and she was right! It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve actually seen a difference in the body of my hair and I&#x27;ve tried everything from $30 bottles to $1.99. This is the one I&#x27;ll keep using, I even signed up to receive these as a subscription from amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost 9 lbs in two weeks dieting and using this shampoo.  I wash my hair about twice a day, so the fact that it said it was for frequent use really twisted my lemon.</li>
    <li> It cleans well and is not irritating. I have to wash my hair everyday and it gets all the goop out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got mixed hair texture.... straight... thin in the front... grows a lil thicker in the middle with baby hair on my neck... but gets frizzy sometimes... i&#x27;d been using the same shampoo for over 15 years until they stopped making it (creme of nature - orginal version)... pissed me off because i&#x27;m crazy picky about what i use on my skin and hair... theres usually only one thing or couple that works really good...  thought it would take me a long time to find a natural shampoo with almost the same ingrediants that would leave my hair looking like it used to...  bought this just so i&#x27;d have something to wash my hair with until i thought i&#x27;d have to go looking for a shampoo that i really wanted.... but this stuff made my hair exactly like i wanted it... didnt have to go looking for anything else... this plus organic wheat germ oil i bought on here [[ASIN:B004XF0BPC Wheat Germ Oil - 100% Pure and Organic 8 Oz]] actually left my hair shinier cleaner and straighter than creme of nature... i just wash it with this shampoo.. leave a lil in my hair like a conditioner and add a lil organic wheat germ oil and my hair looks like salon hair.. crazy shiney... straight ( after using curling iron)... soft and light... leaves my hair cleaner looking than creme of nature.. this shampoo probably makes any texture hair look good but if you have mixed like mine nothing better than this with a lil wheat germ oil rubbed in after (adds even more shine).. smells good too.. just like limes... not like a stinky perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAYBE A LIL DULL (without oil after) BUT NOT DRY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some people saying it leaves their hair dry...  if that happens just use hair oil or leave in conditioner after.. it&#x27;ll leave it shiney ... i never used this shampoo without rubbing a lil wheat germ oil on my hair after.. and it did get super shiney after that... shinier...  plus i leave a lil of this in my hair like a leave in conditioner which probably helps it shine... when i got it i thought it might dry my hair out because of the citrus in it but it turned out shiney with the oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theres nothing drying in this shampoo except for some fruits like lemon (and maybe green tea)... but the citrus or tea in this shampoo wont damage your hair dry it out and break it off like alcohol will... like a lot of other shampoos have in it... it might just leave it a lil duller if you dont put a lil oil or leave in conditioner in it after... alcohol will leave your hair really dry and break it off... like Jasons Naturals shampoo.. i used that shampoo and it looked shiney the day i washed it and the rest of the week my hair got so dry it started to break off really bad (Kiss My Face shampoo is actually saving it right now)... turns out that one has 2 alcohols in it plus a stinky perufme (perfumes another alcohol).. that will kill your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this stuff all you have to do is add a lil hair oil on top of the citrus if it ends up looking a lil dull or dry looking... best hair oil to use is wheat germ... olive oil.. jojoba.. almond... grapeseed.. organic aloe vera all left my hair a lil oily looking and greasy.. the wheat germ made it crazy shiney and healthybecause of the citrus in it but it turned out shiney with the oil  Theres nothing drying in this shampoo except for some fruits like lemon (and maybe green tea)... but the citrus or tea in this shampoo wont damage your hair dry it out and break it off like alcohol will... like a lot of other shampoos have in it... it might just leave it a lil duller if you dont put a lil oil or leave in conditioner in it after... alcohol will leave your hair really dry and break it off... like Jasons Naturals shampoo.. i used that shampoo and it looked shiney the day i washed it and the rest of the week my hair got so dry it started to break off really bad (Kiss My Face shampoo is actually saving it right now)... turns out that one has 2 alcohols in it plus a stinky perufme (perfumes another alcohol).. that will kill your hair  With this stuff all you have to do is add a lil hair oil on top of the citrus if it ends up looking a lil dull or dry looking... best hair oil to use is wheat germ... olive oil.. jojoba.. almond... grapeseed.. organic aloe vera all left my hair a lil oily looking and greasy.. the wheat germ made it crazy shiney and healthy</li>
    <li> This is my first Kiss My Face product.&lt;br /&gt;I am liking the the shampoo. It does feel a little runny (not as runny as water) but, runny compared to other brands like Pantene, head and shoulders etc. I can tell you already in 3 washes that it is very gently on hair and i can see that my hair fall has lessened. I used them on the kids and they did not eend up itchy eyes or anything like that and it almost felt to them like how it does when I used Kids shampoo. I like the product and would defenitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this before I went on vacation with the family, it was cheap!! Great brand, I love all there products.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the price online versus the store.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other viewers.  My entire family loves this shampoo.  I originally bought it for myself because my scalp always itches from regular shampoos.  It doesn&#x27;t wash out my colored hair and I find it lathers well - cleans well - and best of all it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.  I love the smell of the lime in the shampoo.</li>
    <li> After looking at excellent reviewes about this shampoo, I ordered 3 bottles. Writing this review after using this for over couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;My hair and scalp is dry and a little itchy. Have a little dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I liked:&lt;br /&gt;Mild Scent (while bathing)&lt;br /&gt;It is natural and contains minimum chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t work on itchy, dry scalp&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t lather much; so, end up using more quantity&lt;br /&gt;3. Scent is very mild; doesn&#x27;t last after bath&lt;br /&gt;4. Conditioning is also average; nothing to boast about&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend only if you have a good scalp/dandruff free hair and want to use natural shampoo. Otherwise, better to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Well...  the bottle is a dark see through green not white as the picture indicates. BUUUTTT that&#x27;s no big deal at all. This shampoo smells so regreshing, tangy, light, citrusy, juicy, and really just a burst of happiness! It seriously reminds me of the NOW &amp;#34;Cheer up buttercup&amp;#34; blend. Yeah. Try this shampoo, It is sure to brighten your mood.</li>
    <li> This product shows up under the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; title.  However, the makers of this product have not provided a list of ingredients.  I won&#x27;t buy without knowing what&#x27;s in it.</li>
    <li> This is not the same formula that I have been using for the past 5-6 years, as the new ingredient list indicates. It HAS been updated. That said, it smells great and the same small amount that I used to use produces much more lather. It seems to leave my hair looking very healthy and shiny. I just need to use a bit less. Again, the new fragrance is quite nice but it is somewhat different than the old green bottle. The new bottle is still green but with a new label. It is still not animal tested.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great.  It has a lovely fragrance and it tingles on the scalp.  I plan of purchasing more when this is gone.  It arrived on time and was securely packaged.</li>
    <li> Makes this older woman&#x27;s hair feel like it used to - and no conditioner is needed.</li>
    <li> Without much foam, difficult to use in the beginning. After getting used to this, you cant go back. might be little costlier compared to normal shampoos. Worth for money.</li>
    <li> I bought Kiss my face shampoo, conditioner and body wash.  This one is my least favorite smell compared to the rest.  (   [...]      [...]   )      That said, it doesn&#x27;t have SLS that&#x27;s supposed to be a really good thing.      One negative is that it doesn&#x27;t get very soapy with bubbles, but I suspect that&#x27;s just due to the lack of SLS.    The smell is good,  but just not my favorite.    I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use it every day on my color treated hair. It&#x27;s become my favorite shampoo.  It&#x27;s gentle and cleans my hair well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo kind of smells like gin.  Really not something I want my hair to smell like.  I regret that we got this many bottles of it.</li>
    <li> For gluten free members of our family who also find they have sensitive skin, this has been a wonderful solution.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an affordable and safe shampoo that smells pleasant and does the job. I like lime and green tea. Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo features both of these scents in their product line. It is great to see that this is a shampoo that smells good, lathers well, leaves your hair manageable and does not contain nasty chemicals to get the job done. Lovely!</li>
    <li> The wife and I really like this shampoo because of it&#x27;s natural scent (not overpowering) and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave any soapy residue on your scalp (at least it doesn&#x27;t appear to).    We use it every day, and switch to the KMF \\&quot;Mistreated\\&quot; for weekend use, to subject our scalps to a different formulation weekly for a slight change in scent, and to prevent our hair from getting acclimated to a single shampoo.    Our only sour note is that it doesn&#x27;t come in bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair. Not thinning, but very fine hair. This stuff made my hair feel brittle. Kinda like straw. I also purchased the conditioner, but that did nothing to ease the straw feeling.    I guess it&#x27;s back to pert plus for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a long time so I was very disappointed to see it had been reformulated.  Aloe is no longer at the top of the ingredients list instead they&#x27;ve added C14-16 olefin sulfonate.  Clearly they&#x27;ve changed the product packaging to reflect the newer, less natural formula.  As a result I don&#x27;t plan to purchase this product anymore.</li>
    <li> i love how its sulfate free so it really cleans my hair and make my hair so easy to brush and so soft</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 months. It did take some time getting used to the way my hair feels at first, but now I love it. First positive thing I have noticed is that my hair is not falling out as much as before. I have not changed up any other part of my hair care regimen. I still dye the grays every 6-8 weeks. I also don&#x27;t need to use conditioner at all. When I first started using this I used it in conjunction with conditioner but I found that using the conditioner actually made my hair way too greasy. Without conditioner I can easily go 2-3 days without washing my hair. Another thing I have noticed is that I don&#x27;t get the scalp tenderness I used to get when I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a while. Lastly, I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m able to wear my natural wave much more easily with this shampoo. With traditional shampoo my waves were very stringy, and would only show up if I worked on them with a diffuser and mousse/gel, etc. Even then they looked really frizzy. Now I don&#x27;t have to use a diffuser, although I can make it really wavy/curly if I do use that and mousse. All in all, I really like the shampoo. It took a little getting used to and some experimenting with the use of conditioner, but now I won&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo. Oh, and my dry scalp issues have gone away too. No more itch. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now, and it&#x27;s the only shampoo I have ever used that fixed up my flaky scalp. I have flare-ups of eczema now and then, and this stuff has been the best for me. Maybe its because there is no SLS in it, I don&#x27;t know. Your results will vary. Works for me.</li>
    <li> For months, I used baking soda to wash my hair and apple cider vinegar to rise as a conditioner. While this method was great and was so much better than shampoos with harsh sulfates, my hair began to get terrible split ends and never quite smelled the way I would have liked. I found this product when I wanted something that would stop splitting my hair. It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;d like, but I love the light scent and the silkiness of my hair after the fact. I will change up the shampoo once the bottle runs out, but only get keep my hair from being unaffected by it. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchase Kiss My Face products because they supposedly do not test on animals. This is a very nice shampoo. It cleans well, but does not dry the hair. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  However each bottle was a bit sticky so there was some leakage.  Top should be sealed for protection.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this with the condition for months and my hair is super manageable.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner in this line.  They smell great and leave my hair feeling great as well.</li>
    <li> I really like the citrus smell of the shampoo, more like lemon than anything else.  My boyfriend does not like it, but to each their own.  I don&#x27;t think it does anything fantastic for my hair (I use it daily), but I like the product.  It doesn&#x27;t moisturize or give my hair volume, so if you&#x27;re looking for that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  My hair is generally fine and flat with random waves if I let it air dry, and if I only use the shampoo and no conditioner my hair is really dry for the whole day.  It&#x27;s great for every day use and smells good.</li>
