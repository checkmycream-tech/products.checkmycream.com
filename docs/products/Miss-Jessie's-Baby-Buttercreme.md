      <li>It&#x27;s the best for my dry, kinky hair.</li>
      <li>pretty amazing.....</li>
      <li>It is a nice product to have in your collection combined with a tangle teaser brush, it really brings out your curl pattern even if you thought you didn&#x27;t have a curl pattern.   </li>
      <li>This product makes the hair shiny and really smooth.</li>
      <li>I really love the smell of this, don&#x27;t buy it as much any more because it is pricey.</li>
      <li>something we don´t have in good old Europe for curly hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it acts as a vehicle to carry the other great things in this product.</li>
      <li>My sister&#x27;s friend had very fine straight hair</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite Miss Jessie product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and recommend it to anyone who wants to grow out their curly hair.</li>
      <li>or you want a nice soft curly hair....</li>
      <li>It smells sweet too.</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t kinky but it is very curly , I bought the 2oz as a sample to try it out on my hair and i must say I&#x27;m glad i got it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing and works better than I expected!</li>
      <li>and i will let my hair air dry, and not only does it leave my hair smelling good but it kept my curly  hair looking healthy, shiny, soft,non frizzy , and strong .</li>
      <li>I first became familiar with this product when my sister&#x27;s friend went to the Tyra Banks</li>
      <li>However now whenever I apply it, to me, my hair smells like success  because I found a product that truly works for me.</li>
      <li>Anyway spent money on something of a good quality.</li>
      <li>Worth the cost</li>
      <li>In retrospect, this product did seem to moisturize my hair, but my scalp was itchy and I found myself washing my hair more frequently</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so worth it.  </li>
      <li>It is also HIGHLY fragrant, smelling like strong baby powder and something else I can&#x27;t identify.  </li>
      <li>However, be aware that there is coconut in the ingredients, so nut-sensitive kids may have an issue with this, luckily (knock on wood) not us.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even smell it, unless it&#x27;s right after I use it.      </li>
      <li>Makes hair soft, easy to style and holds for days.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great for  adults with natural curly, afro, wavy hair even straight dry hair will benefit from it&#x27;s usage too.</li>
      <li>The smell lessens the next day, and I receive many compliments on the smell of my hair.</li>
      <li>me say, that at first, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell.</li>
      <li>This was my mistake when I first tried the product.</li>
      <li>I use this product for two strand twist, my hair is left shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>Actually, I haven&#x27;t gotten so many compliments about the smell.  </li>
      <li>This is great for thick, bi-racial hair that you don&#x27;t always know what to do with.</li>
      <li>I was only able to buy it because I applied for the Amazon card and got a $40 discount.  </li>
      <li>This is such a great product for curly dry hair!</li>
      <li>It smells great with a delicate scent reminiscent of light powder and peppermint.</li>
      <li>I have really healthy, medium to long hair and the petroleum</li>
      <li>this was the very first product I used when I went natural.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Miss Jessie&#x27;s Baby Buttercreme for a few years now, and I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really wat</li>
      <li>It makes it so much easier to comb through.</li>
      <li>Other products have been OK, but my hair has to be very damp for the product to absorb.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried other products but fell in love with this product.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on my hair...as well as questions from other naturals.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes without being heavy and makes my natural hair feel light and easy to style.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair is happy with this product. My curls stay moist and soft for days. I suggest using it immediately after washing hair.  While the hair is damp and let it air dry. Then use as a re-moisturizer every other day.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite Miss Jessie product.  I will be ordering this over and over again.  Wish it was cheaper but I guess you get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s so worth it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used the Babybutter Creme on and off for about 2 years now.  Because of the price, I have tried to find a replacement.  I have used Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Qhuemet Biologics, Shea Moisture, Kinky Curly, Jane Carter, plain shea butter, Curls, Aveda, Hair Rulez, Curly Q, Devacurls, and others.      People complain about the smell.  Actually, I haven&#x27;t gotten so many compliments about the smell.  I can&#x27;t even smell it, unless it&#x27;s right after I use it.      There are also complaints about the build up.  I actually don&#x27;t see it.  Because my hair is dry (4A), I have to use the creme 1 to 2 times a day.  I like to wash my hair about every 5-7 days or so.  I guess if you don&#x27;t wash often, you will get build up and that bad smell.  I even don&#x27;t use shampoo every time, since it \\&quot;strips\\&quot; my hair.      Because my hair is extremely porous and dry, it likes the petroleum actually.  Shea butters and natural oils often \\&quot;sit\\&quot; on top of my strands.  Water is a good moisturizer for me too.  I have really healthy, medium to long hair and the petroleum doesn&#x27;t harm it in any way.  Actually, you have to use what works for your hair type.    I like to 2 strand twist my hair when it&#x27;s dry.  The first time is usually on damp hair, and it looks shrunken.  After that, it usually stretches out.  I do this every night because I hate gels in my hair.  Also, it keeps it in place at night when it&#x27;s twisted.  Sometimes, i mix the creme with a little gel, so that my curls will hold.      All in all, I do like the creme.  I get so many compliments on my hair...as well as questions from other naturals.  I hate the price, but I wont give it a lower rating.  Im rating on the product itself.  It&#x27;s the best for my dry, kinky hair.</li>
    <li> Miss Jessie&#x27;s baby butter cream is a great product for children or adults. It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair feeling very soft, and it prevents breaking. It makes it so much easier to comb through. It smells sweet too. However, be aware that there is coconut in the ingredients, so nut-sensitive kids may have an issue with this, luckily (knock on wood) not us. I love this product and recommend it to anyone who wants to grow out their curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product !!!*</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughters (ages 7 and 20) who have natural African hair (4a/4b) and breakage has significantly reduced. My hair is processed but I use this particularly on my new growth to keep it moisturized.</li>
    <li> This product works well.</li>
    <li> A friend got this for me to try on my daughters hair. My daughter is 16 months old, I started using this when she was 12 months. She is mixed (1/2 black and white) and I was having a hard time finding a product that wouldn&#x27;t dry her hair out and would last throughout the day. This is such a great product for curly dry hair! It is a little pricey but worth it. I do wet her hair a little before applying it to help not use so much of the creme. I love it! The smell isn&#x27;t so bad either.</li>
    <li> I was only able to buy it because I applied for the Amazon card and got a $40 discount.  It is a nice product to have in your collection combined with a tangle teaser brush, it really brings out your curl pattern even if you thought you didn&#x27;t have a curl pattern.   Still I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again without another deep discount.  You shouldn&#x27;t have to apply for credit or mortgage your house to do your hair.  Save or invest your $60 and pass on this product.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this product before on my daughter&#x27;s hair. i&#x27;ve tried other products but fell in love with this product. a little pricey though.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s amazing thank you...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing and works better than I expected! Everyone in our family had tried it on their hair. Just superb stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural gal and use this product on my two-strand twists. It smells great and holds well. The product lasts long as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hispanic and i have curly thick hair it isn&#x27;t kinky but it is very curly , I bought the 2oz as a sample to try it out on my hair and i must say I&#x27;m glad i got it. Many people tend to put this hair product the wrong way. I would part my hair into four parts and apply a penny size on Miss Jessies butter creme while hair is damped from the roots  to my ends and i will let my hair air dry, and not only does it leave my hair smelling good but it kept my curly  hair looking healthy, shiny, soft,non frizzy , and strong . I fell in LOVE with it i wouldn&#x27;t change it for nothing in the world i will be buying the big jar next time though it might be expensive a little goes a long way you do not have to apply so much of his hair product.</li>
    <li> Works great on my kids hair.  good for shiny twist-outs.  just wish the price was better!!</li>
    <li> I Love Miss Jessie&#x27;s Baby Buttercreme. I first became familiar with this product when my sister&#x27;s friend went to the Tyra Banks show. It was the gift for that taping. My sister&#x27;s friend had very fine straight hair so she gave the product to my sister who gave it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say, that at first, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell. I thought \\&quot;Oh great my hair is going to smell like smarties candies. This is for children.\\&quot; However now whenever I apply it, to me, my hair smells like success  because I found a product that truly works for me. The smell lessens the next day, and I receive many compliments on the smell of my hair. So, even if you don&#x27;t like the smell other people do. The price doesn&#x27;t bother me either because it last several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, very coily hair that shrinks daily. My hair also can be quite dry. I apply baby buttercreme after washing and deep conditioning my hair. I apply it liberally (dime to quarter sized amounts) to medium sized hair sections, rewetting my hair with a water spray bottle and olive oil (sometimes leave in con.). I make several braids. wrap my hair, and have elongated stretched extremely well defined curls the next day assuming that my hair has completely or nearly dried. If I wait two days to unwrap my hair it is even more well defined. Every three or four days I refresh my curls with a dime sized amount of baby buttercreme. This product absorbs in my low porosity hair. It also makes it shine. I&#x27;m cool with a little petroleum in my hair. I&#x27;m sure it acts as a vehicle to carry the other great things in this product. Even Corinne Bailey Rae says she puts Vaseline in her hair. Not a large amount of course. I have a serious peeve for over greased hair and an even bigger peeve with dry crunchy hair out in public. If your hair is dry please find a moist lotion product and spray with oil sheen to polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation as a young women who has had natural hair for some time is to start off with cheaper products...find what works for you at Walgreens and then move up. For those of you who previously had relaxed hair, do you not recall the hits and misses of finding the right relaxer? This is the same process. See what product consistency your hair responds to and then buy similar products. Baby Buttercreme is a wet, thick, lotion, slightly pudding but lighter, product. The product shows in your hair when wet. In my hair it completely dissolves the next day. Maybe in yours it won&#x27;t, keep searching. I have also tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding (left my hair white, limp and wretched),curly meringue (no effect), and quick curls (little to no effect, this is for someone with a more loose curl pattern). None of them worked for me. I use the slippery shampoo (best hair wash ever), crème de la crème shampoo (aiight), and the sweetback deep conditioner (love it). Buy small containers see what works. If it doesn&#x27;t cut your losses and keep searching.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product on my girls for 5 years and won&#x27;t use anything else!!! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for our baby&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> This product is Not just for Kids ! it&#x27;s great for  adults with natural curly, afro, wavy hair even straight dry hair will benefit from it&#x27;s usage too. Wonderful for hot comb pressed , perfect before and after blow drying , wash and roller set ,&lt;br /&gt;braids , twist, protection for Flat iron, and electric curling  etc ....&lt;br /&gt;Great for women with Mixed Textured hair !&lt;br /&gt;Great for Damaged Hair from Bleaching , Permed over processed  hair !&lt;br /&gt;I brought this on Amazon because it was the best priced I&#x27;ve seen anywhere. As long as the price is reasonable here on Amazon,&lt;br /&gt; I will continue to buy !</li>
    <li> Have used this product when you could only purchase it from Miss Jessie, this is my go to product when my hair is breaking or over processed. I really love the smell of this, don&#x27;t buy it as much any more because it is pricey.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very harsh on the hair because of the mineral oil and Petroleum in it, in my opinion it&#x27;s not for black people hair... it&#x27;s a way too expensive, it doesn&#x27;t work waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I have been natural for 9 years and this was the very first product I used when I went natural.  My hair has gone through many changes (as most naturals will learn).  Nonetheless, I am back to using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Baby Buttercreme.  It goes well with the pudding.  both smell amazing and moisturizers GREAT!  My only complaint, it is so expensive...I guess you pay for what you get...pretty amazing.....and for that reason NO COMPLAINTS!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Miss Jessie&#x27;s Baby Buttercreme for a few years now, and I love it! It smells great with a delicate scent reminiscent of light powder and peppermint. It moisturizes without being heavy and makes my natural hair feel light and easy to style. I even use it on my daughter. :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my twin girls&#x27; hair. It smells delicious and keeps hair shiny and moisturized. It&#x27;s a magic potion!</li>
    <li> This is very moisturizing and gives good shine with a nice smell. Slightly greasy but not too much. This is the best moisturizer for curly hair I have ever found!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them all from Dax to Bees wax. This is the best product of them all even to include Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly pudding which i used to use before being introduced to the Baby Buttercreme. Makes hair soft, easy to style and holds for days. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I started using the Miss Jessie&#x27;s line about 18 months ago.  I did like the buttercreme until I read the label.  In retrospect, this product did seem to moisturize my hair, but my scalp was itchy and I found myself washing my hair more frequently ( at least 2-3x/week).  Had to use a clarifying shampoo to get this stuff out.  The smell was awesome.  The 16oz jar lasted about a year and I shared it with my cousin. I think this product is way too expensive, especially with so many other products out there for 1/4 of the cost.  I&#x27;d like to see them revamp the product with no mineral oil.</li>
    <li> Brought it for my mom as she transitioned from relaxed to natural hair. This product makes the hair shiny and really smooth. Really good, but think it&#x27;s a bit expensive. Anyway spent money on something of a good quality.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product was not satisfactory. I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years and I know how it should look, smell, feel and all the rest.  It was old product.  I was not happy at all.</li>
    <li> The absolute only product that I can use on my natural hair when it&#x27;s dry.  No beading up or dandruff looking stuff with Miss Jessie&#x27;s Baby Buttercream. Not sure what my hair type is. Other products have been OK, but my hair has to be very damp for the product to absorb.  Maybe it&#x27;s the petrolatum in Miss Jessie&#x27;s that my hair needs.  I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s bad for African American natural hair, but whatever is in the product let&#x27;s me not have to wet my hair every time I want to re-twist. So I&#x27;m in love !!!</li>
    <li> I have been natural for 7 years and this is one of the first products that I tried.  I love the smell and it is an excellent moisturizing hair dress.  Perfect for shingling, twists and any style really.  I just a small amount after co-washing my hair (washing with a conditioner only) and finger comb it through my hair. It definitely leaves my hair super soft and moisturized,  The only thing I do not like is the price. I get this when I can catch a good sale.</li>
    <li> I kind of wish that I ever tried it.I love it so much, but it&#x27;s really expensive. I have 4b hair type. I started using the curly buttercreme, because I was scared that anything marketed for children would not do anything for my hair. But the baby buttercreme works just the same and I prefer the smell. I use this for twists and twist outs. I use the rapid recovery treatment after my wash. I do not use the baby butter creme until the next day. My hair will not hold moisture after a wash. I re twist my hair the following day using the baby buttercreme. This was my mistake when I first tried the product. I actually thought it was a big scam. Once the product can actually soak into my strands, it is wonderful. It takes a few uses to make it supper soft. I have been wearing twists for years and never before have I gotten as many compliments as I do when I use this stuff.   I will say again that the price is hard to swallow, but I have stopped buying all of those other things to supplement my favorite products (you know what I mean, &#x27;I use this to moisturize; I use that to defriz; I use this other stuff to hold).  I also do not feel the need to go stalking the hair isle one a month trying to find just one more thing to make it do what I want. I just need this</li>
    <li> This product leaves a very heavy, greasy, gummy residue on hair.  It is also HIGHLY fragrant, smelling like strong baby powder and something else I can&#x27;t identify.  Everyone I came in contact with commented on the fragrance coming from my head.  That tells you how LOUD the smell is.  It was so unpleasant that I washed it out later that day. It took 3 shampoo applications to get it out of my hair.  I am sooo sorry that I wasted my money.  Please PAY ATTENTION to the less positive reviews that you read.  It will save you time and money.</li>
    <li> My only issue is that one of the two jars seems to be leaking. A ounce or two of wasted product makes a difference since this stuff is practically priced like gold. I haven&#x27;t un-shrink wrapped the container, so it could just be residue. I don&#x27;t know if this stuff spoils, but I hope not because its hard to find where I live.........Price was good. Packing seemed sturdy. I would try ordering again; unless it turns out to be spoiled and I have trouble returning or exchanging.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. it helps if you have dry scalp and leaves your hair feeling silky. It smells good too. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been transitioning my hair for 8 months .  A coworker convinced me to purchase this product.  After reviewing the product on Amazon, I went to my local CVS to purchase it.  Well it made my hair soft but, it was too heavy and too thick for my transitioning hair.  I gave it another try using less product but, I got the same results.  Definitely not worth the steep price tag .</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well this works.  I used it after shampooing when doing my two stand twists and it worked fantastically.  My curls were soft and moisturized, even after not taking them down for two days.  Definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really wat it says it is I lovebit</li>
    <li> The only reason I give this a 4 is because the price is a little outrageous, but I&#x27;m happy I took the risk. I&#x27;m black and Indian and my hair is thick, long and curly, and most other creams just sit on top of my hair. This stuff actually soaks in, and for the first time today, I have worn a twist out that didn&#x27;t poof out when I walked out the door this morning. This is really good and I think it&#x27;ll last me a while. You only need a little at a time, and for the price, I&#x27;m not trying to use it up too quickly! This is great for thick, bi-racial hair that you don&#x27;t always know what to do with. I&#x27;ve struggled most of my life trying to figure it out, and now I get compliments everywhere I go. My friend saw me walking into work this morning, and pointed out how great my hair looks. I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this for mt mom. We have natural kinky curly hair. I personally do not like this product because it is way to fragrant. It gives me a headache. Plus for the price it has petroleum as one of the main ingredients. She loves it though.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse natural hair, and Miss Jessie&#x27;s Baby Buttercreme softens and adds sheen in between shampoos and conditioning.  It softens the hair without making it overly greasy and helps maintain the definition of two-strand twists.  I would highly recommend the product for all textures of natural hair to enhance styling and maintenance between shampoos.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well on my coarse type 4 hair at all.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, but a little too expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for my children&#x27;s hair. It has a nice smell and its not to strong. Great product.</li>
    <li> I use this product for two strand twist, my hair is left shiny and healthy. I love it. Worth the cost</li>
    <li> The received product had been opened and used. I will avoid using this buyer in the future. Buyer beware! Xxx</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my grand baby&#x27;s hair. my daughter loves it I even use it on my hair.  The price is affordable alot cheaper than stores</li>
    <li> MJ Baby Buttercream is my staple product.  I love how it moisturizers my hair.  It is pricey, but it last a long time so it equals out and is worth it for me.  I notice people saying negative things about mineral oil and lanolin but i have used this product for at least a year and it is the only thing that really moisturizes. It has only enhanced my hair growth.  Miss Jessie&#x27;s&#x27; has a huge customer base of satisfied customers so maybe it just works some and not for others. Others moisturizers do not do the job for me.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend loves it. It´s something we don´t have in good old Europe for curly hair. So if you  have curly hair, don´t miss it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair.  It softens and conditions my hair beautifully...this is a product i will continue to use.</li>
    <li> The only product that I use in my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my daughter hair texture. My daughter have super sensitive scalp/skin &amp; it took me SEVERAL other products to go thru before i found Miss Jessie&#x27;s.The price for this particular size is awesome! I received my shipment in the time frame it was estimated to be at my location. A must buy product for sensitive scalp, natural hair, dry scalp or you want a nice soft curly hair....THIS IS IT!!!!</li>
