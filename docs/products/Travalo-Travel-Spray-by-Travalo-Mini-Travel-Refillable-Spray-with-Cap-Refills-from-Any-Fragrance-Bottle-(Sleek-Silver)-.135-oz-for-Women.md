      <li>like 3 days lol.</li>
      <li>This travel spray is a great invention.  </li>
      <li>a shame, as I was hoping to find a product where I could have a set of really great atomisers - with one perfume per atomiser.</li>

      <li>They look nice, and are great when staying &amp;#34;down to earth&amp;#34;, however,  they leak when flying.</li>
      <li>ordered one for my husband and he loved it too.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I bought these for X-mas for my family and they all loved them.  </li>
      <li>They are great and very easy to fill.</li>
      <li>you a great day :)</li>
      <li>However every time I fly it leaks most of the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this item!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Great product, easy to use, love it!</li>
      <li>They work great and are easy to fill.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;- works great, easy to fill up&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it is great to be able to take my favorite perfume with me.  </li>
      <li>nice product</li>
      <li>Nice concept.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchas and am thinking about giving them out as stocking stuffers this Xmas.</li>
      <li>by the first day of our 3 month trip, most of our valuable scents had been lost; as well as damage to some neighbouring items in our luggage (even with plastic zip lock bags - the traveller&#x27;s best friend for carrying liguids in pressurised airplanes without having everything doused in toiletries - involved in the equation).</li>
      <li>I liked this invention&lt;br /&gt;And endowed a gift for my mother and sister gorgeous handbag and easy way</li>
      <li>it is very easy to refill</li>
      <li>We are always travelling, and out and about at beach etc, so really handy to always carry atomisers and wear whichever scent takes our fancy at any point in time, and carry it with you through the day to freshen up :)  </li>
      <li>I have already put some perfume in it and it&#x27;s as easy as Pie!  </li>
      <li>So easy!</li>
      <li>It is easy fill, convenient and looks nice.</li>
      <li>Love to give this as an additional present&lt;br /&gt;to family and friends.</li>
      <li>but it became even better when they started pooping up at the discounts stores</li>
      <li>then got two more.</li>
      <li>I travel a lot, so the more I can use compact items, the better.  </li>
      <li>Appropriate size to put in the pocket and pouch  Packaged fragrance that you love</li>
      <li>I love to take my Shaliamar with me when I travel</li>
      <li>and you smell lovely  </li>
      <li>Great way to travel with your perfumes without taking the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>I love that you can fill it with whatever perfume you like (provided</li>
      <li>The magic  </li>
      <li>but if it doesn&#x27;t leak I will be buying more.  </li>
      <li>I bought three of these to use for travel and I love them.</li>
      <li>Really pleased with this purchase for my travel bag.</li>
      <li>Every girl needs one of these :)</li>
      <li>I love to travel, and I love to be efficient with space.</li>
      <li>I really love this travel spray.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>Had to pop the top off with a pliers to and just dump in the liquid.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for my short trips, with all restriction that the airporta had.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite gifts.</li>
      <li>Finally, a great way to carry your favorite perfume  without having to carry the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>the perfume just bubbled over the top.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the idea and the colors</li>
      <li>Sure something will come on the market at some point :)</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t even close to fitting into the bottom of the Travalo.</li>
      <li>Very attractive, easy to fill from your larger perfume bottles and then throw in your purse and go.  </li>
      <li>I thought the price was pretty good, haven&#x27;t tried to use it yet since it was a gift for someone</li>
      <li>one thing I&#x27;d add is a place to easily label the cologne so you can carry more than one and know which is which instead of differentiating by color.</li>
      <li>Great product, I&#x27;ve had multiple uses: breath mint spray, and my own deodorant spray.</li>
      <li>It is super easy to refill and it fits nicely into purse or 1 quart \\&quot;liquids\\&quot; bag.  </li>
      <li>I filled this one with my favorite perfume and carry it in my purse.  </li>
      <li>I find it easy to fill.</li>
      <li>The product cannot be easily hygienically cleaned ie.</li>
      <li>Though this is easy to fill I don&#x27;t recommend it for air travel.</li>
      <li>easy to fill, works fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was intrigued when I saw an ad on TV for this little guy so I bought it for my vacation to Hawaii, and it worked wonderfully.  I love that you can fill it with whatever perfume you like (provided you can take that little spray cap off!) and it seemed to do a wonderful job of not leaking (there&#x27;s a window that shows you the level).  I&#x27;m very impressed and ordered a couple of more so I can have a travel variety for future trips!</li>
    <li> Love the product no problem with leakage like other reviews... I took it on an 8 day vacation and it didn&#x27;t hold enough:(</li>
    <li> it is bullet proof and saves space in my shaving kit - great idea and good implementation for the road warrior.</li>
    <li> I love this item! it is very easy to refill it takes just enough perfume. At first i only ordered one because i was scared that it will leak after the perfume was inside but it doesnt! it is very compact so it fits any where.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for all those looking for an ultra-portable refillable fragrance bottle.   Sleek design, non-leaking, super easy to refill.</li>
    <li> this is so easy to fill, so fast and so small. I may even order another one. I filled this one with my favorite perfume and carry it in my purse.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I travel a lot, and actually bought this little gem of a product duty free on a transpacific flight on Cathay. Now why didn&#x27;t anyont think of this before? Before the Travalo travel sprayer, I struggled to find travel sizes of my perfume, or samples. I even looked on eBay. What a hassle. I&#x27;ve refilled a few times, so far so good. I hope it passes the test of time. At this price point, I&#x27;ll be happy if it lasts a year or two, I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever but I hope it lasts through some trips. I will update in a year or so. Anyhow, I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchas and am thinking about giving them out as stocking stuffers this Xmas.</li>
    <li> In Asia, it&#x27;s hot and humid.  I always like to bring my cologne along, but not the whole big bottle.  This travel spray is a great invention.  I can take my cologne anywhere.</li>
    <li> This product is a piece of crap, not only would it not fill but I got perfume in my eyes trying to fill it. Do not I repeat Do not buy.[[ASIN:B004G8MGSQ Travalo Travel Spray by Travalo Mini Travel Refillable Spray with Cap Refills from Any Fragrance Bottle (Jet Black) .135 oz For Men]]</li>
    <li> I ordered two Travalo refilliable sprayers for Christmas gifts that were mailed my friend. I did not learn until five days ago that the person I sent them to said they did not work! When I asked her to send them back to me I learned that the window for the return had passed where I could get a refund.I am not happy![[ASIN:B002FQKKBQ Travalo Travel Spray by Travalo Mini Travel Refillable Spray with Cap Refills from Any Fragrance Bottle (Sleek Silver) .135 oz for Women]]</li>
    <li> This little gadget is just superb! It was so easy to fill and is the perfect size to travel with. I ended up buying more in other colors so that I could take along the scent du jour. I have flown with it and it didn&#x27;t leak. I am also very hard on things and this little gem has held up extremely well. Don&#x27;t think twice. Excellent stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> I carry this everywhere I go. It&#x27;s very convenient when I don&#x27;t want to carry around a big perfume bottle. It fits into wristlets and clutches to carry to events and its very discreet. I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 because two of four I&#x27;ve bought over the years stopped working after a few uses.  It would no longer &#x27;suck&#x27; up the perfume into the bottle, instead it would just spill out.</li>
    <li> Great idea and looks like it would&#x27;ve worked well if the nozzle on my perfume bottle was small enough to fit into the Travalo.  I tried using a standard size Calvin Klein Euphoria bottle.  The nozzle is 2.5-3mm across and it wasn&#x27;t even close to fitting into the bottom of the Travalo. I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;d need a nozzle no bigger than 1mm for this to work.  Wish the company would include some size guides on the product info.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002FQKKBQ Travalo Travel Spray by Travalo Mini Travel Refillable Spray with Cap Refills from Any Fragrance Bottle (Sleek Silver) .135 oz for Women]] Loved this!  Very attractive, easy to fill from your larger perfume bottles and then throw in your purse and go.  You simply remove the spray cap on the larger spray bottle, place the Travalo mini bottle over the tip and pump up and down a few times and it is filled.  So easy! I bought this for travel because it is small, will fit in my purse and is allowed in your carryon for flying.  I liked it so much, I ordered two each,a pink and a silver one, for me and my two daughters. One of my favorite gifts. Would make great stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> I have had this products for 2 months now.&lt;br /&gt;- works great, easy to fill up&lt;br /&gt;- no leakage&lt;br /&gt;- does the job!&lt;br /&gt; no longer need to take the big 3.4 bottle of cologne/perfume with you.. just load this up and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> Item arrived within a week of order! I thought the price was pretty good, haven&#x27;t tried to use it yet since it was a gift for someone but I didn&#x27;t notice any imperfections in the item yet. would definitely order from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and just love it.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered one for my husband and he loved it too.&lt;br /&gt;Now I just ordered one for my best friend who loves&lt;br /&gt;to travel. This item is great have been looking for one&lt;br /&gt;for a while.  Love to give this as an additional present&lt;br /&gt;to family and friends. SO far everyone LOVES it. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is totally awesome!  I travel a lot by air and it is great to be able to take my favorite perfume with me.  It is super easy to refill and it fits nicely into purse or 1 quart \\&quot;liquids\\&quot; bag.  I am buying these for stocking stuffers for all this Christmas!  This only works for spray perfume/colognes.</li>
    <li> Very useful in travel  Appropriate size to put in the pocket and pouch  Packaged fragrance that you love and you smell lovely  The magic  I thank the seller and wish him success</li>
    <li> Though this is easy to fill I don&#x27;t recommend it for air travel. Leaks when pressurized, spilling ALL your goods in your bag. Also, the spray top is quite small, near the size of a sample sized fragrance spray. Other than that, its decent...not worth more than $5.</li>
    <li> This little refillable atomizer is just what I wanted.  I have several filled with different fragrances which I can put in my purse and always have with me.  They will be great for travel.  The vendor was very prompt in shipping my order.</li>
    <li> I got a few of these months ago and they are great. Only problem is the red one somehow got messed up. I noticed that the perfume in that one was really low compared to the other two. I didn&#x27;t think too much of it and went to refill it again. The little white part on the bottom fell off and it wouldn&#x27;t take any of the perfume at all, just kept spilling out of the big bottle when I pressed down. These are really good, but once it dies, what then? There&#x27;s no way to fix it and these aren&#x27;t cheap. I don&#x27;t know, it was fine for months and suddenly stopped working and broke. Very disappointing and too bad. Now I&#x27;m hoping that the other two I have don&#x27;t suddenly break too sometime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many travel perfume containers and they usually leak no matter what I did. The Travalo Travel Spray was everything its advertisement said. It was easy to fill and didn&#x27;t leak once even though I had multiple connecting flights. I couldn&#x27;t have been happier!</li>
    <li> I find it very easy to fill the travalo, not messy and no product is wasted.  Problem is that the mechanism that allows you to fill the small bottle is not airtight, and the product very quickly evaporates.  Sure, your purse smells lovely from the evaporating fragrance, but two days later when you go to spray some perfume, the bottle is empty. For me, too much expensive product is wasted into thin air.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Easy fill/refill, super portable... very user friendly. Only issue with this item is that it is very small and therefore only holds enough for about a week (using with perfume twice a day)... So if you are like me and want this for travel, know that you&#x27;re covered for about a week.</li>
    <li> Finally, a great way to carry your favorite perfume  without having to carry the whole bottle. Its so simple to fill  and it gives you enough sprays to last you a few days .Every one should get one if you want to always smell good!!</li>
    <li> After a small period of time the perfume evaporates from the bottle. Everytime I tried to take it to trips I would waste about 10 pumps of my perfume bottle to get a single pump from the traveling bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I bought half a dozen of these for my close friends and sisters and none of them work. LOVE LOVE LOVE the idea and the colors - but when you try to push down on the bottle, they don&#x27;t fill up, you just get leaks around the nozzel if anything at all.</li>
    <li> It is very useful, but the instructions are not very clear and I needed to fix it because it didn&#x27;t fit well on perfume&#x27;s cap</li>
    <li> I bought this product to have when I travel.  Unfortunately, it is not as great as it looks.  You need to take your cologne bottle sprayer apart in order to pump in the fragrance and I have not been able to reattach it properly.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> There are smuggling from the bottom.....  I advise not to buy....  Product quality very low ....  Not good...Not good....Not good....Not good</li>
    <li> Works Perfectly. .I&#x27;m able to use older colognes that we&#x27;re clogged up.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these to use for travel and I love them. They take the hassle,weight and inconvenience of carrying cologne out of the travel quotient. Beyond simple to use,compact and a great spray pump. Bringing three different scents wherever you go has never been so easy. They are light,come in various colors,have a great compact design that shows the amount you have filled/left over and you can pack them anywhere in your gear. To some the $11 Amazon price may seem high, but compared to $15 retail and their reuseability, I think it&#x27;s a bargain!</li>
    <li> I purchased a bunch of these for myself and for gifts. They are great and very easy to fill. I carry it in my purse and use it for travel which saves me SO much on travel size perfumes. Men appreciate it too!</li>
    <li> I travel a lot, so the more I can use compact items, the better.  The size is great and it holds enough to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works for pump dispensed personal lube too, great for travel..... Try Uber Lube, it&#x27;s worth it.  Don&#x27;t use the same tube for both though.....BAD THINGS.</li>
    <li> easy to fill, works fine. no issues</li>
    <li> My wife was very pleased she enjoys being able to keep her expensive perfume in her purse in a small container. It is easy fill, convenient and looks nice. I was so empressed that I purchased one in black for myself, it fits great in my pocket, I  like a refresh of my cologne in the afternoon as well.</li>
    <li> Yes, it leaks small amounts after a little while but this was rather negligible to me. I use it on vacations only so I fill it up before I leave and then leave it in my vanity bag. I&#x27;ll come back 2 months later and my bag will smell a little like cologne so I know it leaks a bit inside the pouch but it&#x27;s very negligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the small size, the ease of filling, and  the fact it doesn&#x27;t leak massive amounts of cologne.</li>
    <li> These are great!!  Perfect for travel and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed to fill perfume into an on-the-go container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to fill up with just a few pumps into the bottom vent. I was worried the transfer might be smelly, or leak, but none of it happened. No leak whatsoever, and the bottom doesn&#x27;t smell of perfume after filling the container.</li>
    <li> I have a few of these Travelo Mini Refillable sprayers and love them.  They last quite a while before I have to fill them up again.  Also, they have so far, never leaked.</li>
    <li> Hold perfume but you need to make sure that it stays upright in your purse as it can leak and then your purse smells real good</li>
    <li> This item  is great for short trips. If I travel longer then a week I need a larger container probably double the size. It&#x27;s too small for my needs.</li>
    <li> Nice concept. Does NOT work on all perfume bottles. Mine has a pump but it refuses to fill and instead just covers my hand with perfume. It does, however, work with my husband&#x27;s spray cologne.</li>
    <li> I read these glowing reviews and do not understand how it is possible. For a vacation travel I filled this silver travel spray with Coco Mademoiselle perfume and went through the airport security with no problem. However, upon arriving to the hotel at my destination, I had was heartbroken to see the perfume leaked and messed up everything in my cosmetic bag. Inspecting the spray, I do not see any apparent problem, so think it is just a failed design overall.   As other reviewer pointed correctly, this spray cannot be refilled from any perfume bottle as claimed, but only from another spray bottle, and you do need to remove the spray cap. This was another disappointment to me. Will not recommend and regret buying.</li>
    <li> If you need to travel, and like me, you cannot live without a signature scent (or two!) THIS is your answer!!  All you do is put the bottom of it over the top of your favorite perfume, spritz your bottle a few times, and, like magic, your perfume is suddenly in the Travalo case!!  These are unbreakable, lightweight, accepted at airports, I could go on and on.  For perfume wearers everywhere, these are a major find. You don&#x27;t even need to go away, they&#x27;re perfect for your purse!</li>
    <li> The item was garbage.  Does not fill, does not work at all.  Mine may be defective.  Very rarely do I ever review items, and I shop on Amazon a lot, since I have Amazon Prime.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this trinket.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use with a cologne. It&#x27;s very functional for that purpose! Lives up to its advertisements.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking about how much I want to be able to take small amounts of my choice cologne traveling with me for a while now.  I never thought to check if something like this exists until I stumbled upon it by accident.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I haven&#x27;t found it to leak at all, and it sprays a generous amount with each pump.  If you haven&#x27;t sprayed it in a while, the first spray will only be like half a spray, though, which I guess is expected.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my sister, she LOVED it!!</li>
    <li> Took this on a wedding out of state, it leaked everywhere and I had no fragrance to wear to the wedding.  I threw it out and wasted my money and time.</li>
    <li> nice product but it is expensive&lt;br /&gt;mmmmm may be I will not buy it again if it will be in the same price</li>
    <li> Cool if it works but doesn&#x27;t work for refills. It just turns into a mess. Had to pop the top off with a pliers to and just dump in the liquid.</li>
    <li> This item seems absolutely fabulous.  Haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet, but if it doesn&#x27;t leak I will be buying more.  I love to take my Shaliamar with me when I travel and they don&#x27;t have the one I used anymore.  this seems to be a wonderful solution.  I have already put some perfume in it and it&#x27;s as easy as Pie!  thank you, Jane spann</li>
    <li> this leaked, maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right, but I open the little plug and pumped my scent in...ok...cut to tomorrow and there&#x27;s not scent in the travalo</li>
    <li> Reconendet, very quality products and look durable</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my short trips, with all restriction that the airporta had. This refiliable spray works perfect</li>
    <li> I love this little gadget; never leaks, and allows me to bring a little bit of whatever fancy perfume I&#x27;m into these days with me on the road. I actually own a few, and give them as gifts to friends.</li>
    <li> Product leaks for me after airplane trips. Another reviewer mentioned this is due to pressurization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item doesn&#x27;t seem to be damaged in any way, and does not leak over several weeks at my house when I tested it in a ziploc bag. However every time I fly it leaks most of the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend for air travel. Otherwise, fine. Fills easily, good amount of misting per each spray, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great idea, sorry that it has failed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now looking for another option to carry on some cologne when I fly...</li>
    <li> These are perfect for traveling or just to use in your purse, I bought 2 because once you fill them up, the only way to empty it is to spray it so I wanted to have a few travalo choices for fragrances so I wouldn&#x27;t be stuck with one scent until it was all gone. Every girl needs one of these :)</li>
    <li> This item did not work at all; it could not be filled. In retrospect, I should have been suspicious from the condition of the packaging as it had clearly been previously opened and likely returned by another customer.</li>
    <li> This is a real Travalo and shipping was fast. I had no problems. The product works great and is lightweight so I don&#x27;t weight down my purse.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great idea, but unfortunately the product has about the same level of quality as a prize you&#x27;d win at a carnival. Mine leaked on the first trip I took, ensuring that I had the most fragrant piece of luggage on the airplane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again when I got home. Same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into the garbage it goes. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> they are hard to fill, they leaks during the filling process and after they being filled, they leaks until they become empty.</li>
    <li> kind of useless, doesn&#x27;t work with any perfume or pray cans to insert properly</li>
    <li> I really love this travel spray. It&#x27;s so convenient to fill and throw in my purse. I know what I&#x27;m getting my coworkers for Christmas this year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d seen this at a large organizing store, and finally purchased on Amazon. Amazing!!  This fills so neatly, and travels perfectly without any leakage or evaporation. Really pleased with this purchase for my travel bag.</li>
    <li> i had the &amp;#34;flo&amp;#34; refillable perfume atomizer and that thing just sucked!&lt;br /&gt;this travalo is pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: easy perfume transfer and refilling, great and high quality sprayer to get every last drop, does not leak, and does everything it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: plastic construction makes it seem like it not going to last very long (But i have used it over 8months almost bi-weekly with no issues), when you use the feature were you just press down on the perfume bottle to refill the travalo it leaks a little liquid and after trying to refill the whole thing you loose about a whole days worth of perfume and because of that it looses a star. otherwise its awesome!</li>
    <li> They look nice, and are great when staying &amp;#34;down to earth&amp;#34;, however,  they leak when flying.</li>
    <li> Great way to travel with your perfumes without taking the whole bottle. Right size for carry-on luggage. When full, will last for a week.</li>
    <li> I liked this invention&lt;br /&gt;And endowed a gift for my mother and sister gorgeous handbag and easy way&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to purchase</li>
    <li> I bought these for X-mas for my family and they all loved them.  They work great and are easy to fill.  I will be ordering more since they are great quality!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item on Amazon from a seller named \\&quot;Low Poke\\&quot; and the item was delivered within the promised shipping time.  On arrival, I noticed that it was not shipped in a Travalo box, only a sealed, clear plastic bag.  Nor did it include any sort of descriptive insert (not even a packing slip).  As a result, I can&#x27;t be certain that it is a genuine Travalo (as opposed to a knock-off), especially since nowhere on the item is the \\&quot;Travalo\\&quot; name noted.  Since my wife already had a genuine Travalo that she purchased at a high-end department store (albeit at a much higher price), I knew what to look for.  However, all that said, even if it is a knock-off, other than the fact that the cap doesn&#x27;t fit as snugly as I think it should, the product seems to be working ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing worth mentioning is that once you fill the Travalo, there is no easy way to thoroughly clean the reservoir after it&#x27;s empty in case you wanted to re-fill it with a different perfume/cologne.  So once you fill it with a certain perfume/cologne, you&#x27;re pretty much stuck with always re-filling it with the same scent.  However, I suppose these are now inexpensive enough such that having several Travalos for several different scents is not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these at my local Dillards&#x27; store, and they come with a great packaging container and this one did not, however the atomizer itself is all you need and it works like a charm and is discreet enough for my husband to tuck in his pocket and use on hot sticky days when he needs to fresh up and it is great for traveling as this is less than the .3 ounces allowed by the airlines.  Great product, easy to use, love it!</li>
    <li> So I am a travel products junkie...I love to travel, and I love to be efficient with space. This sprayer is the perfect size for traveling. It is so easy to fill and nice to have around for when you either sit next to someone else on a long flight who smells ripe, or if you have been on a long haul flight with no chance to shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It, of course, is just the right size to be put in my small toiletries bag and to get by TSA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that my favorite bottle of cologne has lost its spraying cap, so this, which is so easily filled up, has saved me from having to throw away the whole bottle of cologne. Definitely a must have for any traveler.</li>
    <li> I havent encountered any issues with this item and i have used it several times for trips.....original price wasnt too much but it became even better when they started pooping up at the discounts stores</li>
    <li> Buyer beware&lt;br /&gt;The very thorough social media campaign related to this product does not tell the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;I have had one of the mini Travalo&#x27;s for years. It is OK for general usage.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased (directly from Travalo) an entire set of atomisers ($300 worth), in various sizes - expressly for pending travel; with a different colour for each scent to be taken on 3 months of travel.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the products did not stand up to flying - at all. Some were in my carryon luggage; the rest were in my checked luggage. All leaked; indeed, the outer plastic cases were fused shut, and upon discovering this big mess upon arrival - it took many hours (and attempts at many many methods) to get them open and salvage what was left of my perfume and my partners cologne.&lt;br /&gt;ie. by the first day of our 3 month trip, most of our valuable scents had been lost; as well as damage to some neighbouring items in our luggage (even with plastic zip lock bags - the traveller&#x27;s best friend for carrying liguids in pressurised airplanes without having everything doused in toiletries - involved in the equation). The atomisers and their cases all looked like mini bombs - the plastic was melted/dissolved and fused together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shared photos of this damage (and full details) directly with Travalo (who then deleted the image from public view; then blocked me; then had facebook lock my FB profile! A bit of an extreme response for a customer who has just shared their personal experience with their product - and lost quite a lot of money in the process. Not what I would normally consider good customer service. As a result, instead of them convincing me that their might be future hope in their product - this instead motivated me to share the details of my experience with any customers who might be unsuspecting ... given the thoroughness of the social media advertising campaign).&lt;br /&gt;I have not been compensated the $300+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary...&lt;br /&gt;The concept is good(not a new concept at all*), but lots of improvement needs to be made&lt;br /&gt;a) The product needs to work as advertised (and if it cannot handle flying, then don&#x27;t market it for that purpose!)&lt;br /&gt;b) The product cannot be easily hygienically cleaned ie. as we all know, all atomisers should be cleaned very carefully between refills of perfumes (we all know the dangers of traces of old perfumes, cosmetics, etc ... none of them last forever.. and stale cosmetics etc are simply not healthy for any of us).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wanting an item that is just for basic use (and you don&#x27;t mind the risk of leakage even just in your gym bag or purse; and you are aware that you&#x27;ll have to be careful with hygiene) then this item might meet your need. However if you are wanting an item that performs as per the advertising promises currently being made for this product ... the unfortunately this product has a long way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I have reverted to using my ancient atomiser that my grandmother gave me. Glass, perfectly cleanable, solid, pretty, and fully functional. It has not leaked once in the years that I have had it; what is more it is very solid and has not shown any sign of damage even after many years of use including a few times of being accidentally bounced like a superball across the tiles :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a shame, as I was hoping to find a product where I could have a set of really great atomisers - with one perfume per atomiser. We are always travelling, and out and about at beach etc, so really handy to always carry atomisers and wear whichever scent takes our fancy at any point in time, and carry it with you through the day to freshen up :)  Sure something will come on the market at some point :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wishing you a great day :)</li>
    <li> I like the fact that there is little chance of breakage.</li>
    <li> It started leaking after a couple of weeks of use.</li>
    <li> bueno, practico, c&amp;oacute;modo, econ&amp;oacute;mico y el mejor invento del mundo despu&amp;eacute;s de las bombillas... jajaja es en serio!!! se los recomiendo!!!</li>
    <li> Great little product!!</li>
    <li> I chose this product b/c I hate packing bottles of cologne!&lt;br /&gt;This allows one to take just enough with you (and plenty to last a few weeks even) in a tiny portable unit in your toiletry bag, center console of car, or even your pocket!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;d add is a place to easily label the cologne so you can carry more than one and know which is which instead of differentiating by color.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I recomend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how to transfer perfume from larger bottle. So. I can&#x27;t say that it works. Instructions would help.</li>
    <li> This is way too small.  I wish it was double the size.  It would last for like 5 sprays.</li>
    <li> This product is fine if you&#x27;re looking for portability of your perfume in the short term. I find it easy to fill. What other people are saying about it about it evaporating is true though. I fill it quite regularly and find that even though I haven&#x27;t sprayed any of it, the perfume is gone. I don&#x27;t have issues with it spilling out or creating an odor in my purse.  It&#x27;s not good for expensive perfume.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve had multiple uses: breath mint spray, and my own deodorant spray. I used vodka and pepperment oil to make my breath mint spray, and boy oh boy does it work great!</li>
    <li> i first ordered one of this. filled and worked like a charm. then got two more. one of them didn&#x27;t fill up. the perfume just bubbled over the top. i thought it was a freak defective piece. okay, so i used the other two and loved them. then they needed to be refilled and the same problem - they just wouldn&#x27;t fill up and bubbled all over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/3. something&#x27;s wrong with the way this thing works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i finally got the one with the built-in funnel at one end.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a wonderful product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years, and it&#x27;s perfect. I travel a lot, and it&#x27;s much easier to bring this travel spray than an entire bottle of spray. Refilling it is as simple as taking the top off your current perfume bottle and pumping your perfume into it. The only downside, is that you probably can&#x27;t trade off using different perfumes because I notice some of my stronger perfumes will linger in the bottle, but for this price, you can easily buy multiples!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this little guy! The product doesn&#x27;t last to me, just because i just spray a lot for no reason, &amp; it will only last me for like 3 days lol. But definitely worth the money! I wish it was a little bigger though! i would like to pack this little thing with more product just so i can go the store &amp; get my own samples. BAD, i know but this is the only way i would get my free sample lol! oh well. i love it so far!</li>
