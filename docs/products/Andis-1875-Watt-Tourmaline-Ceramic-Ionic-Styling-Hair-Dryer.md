<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have purchased this blow dryer more than once over the years and I like the way it works</li>
    <li> reduced drying time on my tricky hair. brush attachment will not go through my hair (used comb attachments only)</li>
    <li> The brush was really  not made well.  It was not packaged well (the brush).  The vents should be on the top not on the side.  It will catch your hair.</li>
    <li> I actually love this hair dryer, it works perfectly, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the actual dryer. My issue is with the comb attachments. I have fine, biracial, naturally curly hair that is typically easy to deal with. I use the comb attachments to blow my hair out for a straight style (prior to flat ironing for a bone straight look), but approximately 6 months into owning the product, the fine tooth comb that came with the dryer began to break. Pieces of the comb would break off during each use. I tried to continue to use the comb, but it started to get caught on my hair and break it off or pull it out. I discontinued using the comb until I had the chance to purchase another ( since then I have ordered and received one but I&#x27;m hesitant to use it). Hopefully the fine tooth comb design will get better as andis comes out with more products.</li>
    <li> The styling of blow-dryer is great; the functions are not! The cool down button feature was pressed once for use, but got stuck inside of unit wobbling around, but would not release back so the warm mode. The 240 V option only worked on the low feature. Also, I found the brush attachment flimsy, not firm and would eventually wear out quickly. SUB-STAND FEATURES ruined a great looking unit! Quality would be the remedy! This could have been a winner...sad;(</li>
    <li> I had this hair dryer only a month and it has stop working. If I send it back I only get half of my money back on this worthless dryer.</li>
    <li> Seems like a mostly quality unit but the highest setting still doesn&#x27;t give you a lot of air speed, just a lot of heat.  The cold shot button is hard to push where it is located, and should have been placed on the opposite side of the handle.  Notice that the fan speed slows and becomes erratic when using the cold shot button, but returns to normal after release.  Unsure how long this unit will last.  Not sure where the &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; part of the dryer comes in since the internals look like a standard heat element setup.  Don&#x27;t like this as much as the Vidal Sassoon unit that it is replacing.</li>
    <li> I love my Andis Ceramic blow dryer. Not only does it get our hair dry quickly but it also straightens at the Sam&#x27;s time. Can&#x27;t get no better for me and my family. Quick and easy!</li>
    <li> I should first mention that I don&#x27;t use this item in the typical way.  I never use the attachments as my hair is super short (2 inches), I just figured the shape would allow me to straighten my hair more efficiently.  It&#x27;s a bit cumbersome and heavy.  It gets plenty hot and the low heat setting, although weak, is good for gradual straightening.  I don&#x27;t like that you have to hold the cool shot button, plus it takes a lot of effort to press.  The button is placed in a very awkward spot for the way I hold it, facing down (again, not typical).  The brush attachment is useless because it&#x27;s softer than hair!  I imagine this item would be more useful for someone with longer hair.</li>
    <li> Hair is full of volume and straight</li>
    <li> I needed a new dryer with dual voltage because I&#x27;m always traveling to different countries. This was perfect dryer for on the go and easier to manage instead of using a comb or brush separately.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after going through 3 golden hand held dryers.  This product is top notch and the attachments are very durable as well and the dryer had yet to cut out like previous ones.</li>
    <li> Yes, please and thank you! I&#x27;m so happy with this dryer. I have very thick, coarse hair (4c), medium length. This dryer beat my old Conair dryer hands down - it takes about 30% less time to dry my hair. The design is perfect - comb attachments slide in and stays in place during the entire drying process (my old dryer&#x27;s comb would always pop off at least twice and I&#x27;ve broken two comb attachments in as many months). I also like the width of this dryer. It does get very hot so use a high smoke point oil like coconut to protect your hair while drying. Bottom line, this is a very good product at a very good price. I also got the Andis flat iron - my new dynamic duo!</li>
    <li> I have always had difficulty using the round brush and a normal hair dryer to straighten my hair.  My arms would get so tired.  With the Andis 82105 Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer, I am able to make my spiral curl hair straight in 1/2 the time that it used to.  I have been getting so many compliments on my hair since I bought it!</li>
    <li> The ladies in the house seem to love it and I&#x27;m all for keeping them happy.</li>
    <li> I definitely have not had the negative opinion on this dryer as other customers have had.  My natural hair has very tightly coiled curls, so a normal dryer without a comb attachment only can do so much.  I put the dryer on medium and blow dried my hair in sections, and it dried my hair so fast, and straightened it well! Now, I don&#x27;t have to deal with the hassle of not being able to comb through my hair easily. My only dislike about the dryer is that it is kind of on the larger side, and I wish the attachments were so big/long, but aside from that, it works well for me, and saves me time and frustration!  Plus, you can&#x27;t be the price!</li>
    <li> This is a great blowdryer and very inexpensive too.  It comes with the necessary attachment combs so I don&#x27;t have to buy ones that never quite fit right like other hand held blow dryers.  There are 2 different comb attachments for different hair textures.  This gets my hair ready for a flat iron when I decide to straighten it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer/styler is heavy and oxy to hold on to.  Buttons are in a position so that you turn it off when drying hair. Makes hair very dull, big and fly-away. Definitely will not recommend!!</li>
    <li> She liked this product a lot</li>
    <li> I honestly do not know where this has been my entire life.  I have very thick and wavy hair, this dryer styles my hair in half the time.  I usually would blow dry my hair, put a frizz control then use the flat iron.  With this my hair is healthier, I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron as much and I use very little anti-frizz product now. I would reccomend this to anyone who has thick, wavy, or even curly hair and wants to be able to quickly style their hair. I&#x27;ve tried everything thing I could think of to get my hair to straighten easily and efficently and this is the one.  In 32 years, I&#x27;ve never been more in love with any of my hair tools.</li>
    <li> Best investment needed a good blow dryer</li>
    <li> Not what I expected and does not work well with my type of hair (thick, curly, coarse and long).</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. The different heat settings is great.</li>
    <li> This product give beautiful volume! ★★★★★</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer. Its construction makes it easy to handle regardless of which portion of my head I am drying. It also does a beautiful job of drying and subduing the texture of my fine, course 4C hair. I don&#x27;t have to use high heat to get the results that I am loving, loving, loving.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer is very suitable for my fine, short and not very thick hair. I used it on the lowest setting and it felt just right: gentle and not extremely hot. I also liked its comb attachment: it helped me dry hair faster.&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this dryer to my older Philips (I moved so I had to leave it in another country), I must note that this dryer provides weaker blow. I think it is because of much bigger output vent.&lt;br /&gt;Minus 1 star because there is no ceramic heating element - just wires.</li>
    <li> I love the combination of styling tool and hair dryer!  It makes it so much easier to get the heat directed at the roots and gives it better lift without using multiple sized brushes. And the ceramic-Ionic component has cut my drying time in half. I am styled and out the door in just over 5 minutes!</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer even though I don&#x27;t use heat tools all the time. Nice to have one on hand just in case.</li>
    <li> Terrible blow dryer!!! It caught fire rite after I turned it on!!! You get what you pay for with this dryer, LITERALLY!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love! I&#x27;ve got kinky curly hair and this straightens and drys my hair in about 20-30 min.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are easy to SLIDE on and off.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I love Andis products. They all tend do a great job heating up quickly and drying and straightening your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, their flat irons are great as well.</li>
    <li> Seems to do well on my 4a/4b afro hair!</li>
    <li> Had it for only a few months and it already is losing it&#x27;s heating element. Also the dial to change the heat doesn&#x27;t work. The attachments are flimsy and get stuck easily. I can&#x27;t wait for it to completely break so I can buy one that works properly. I wish I read all of the reviews for this product. Never again will I make that mistake.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer as an extra but for an 1875 watt blowdryer this hairdryer is weak!! The medium and high settings blow equivalent air. Maybe I just got a defective one. I have a conair one that is much better.</li>
    <li> The description is misleading relative to heat/air settings. There are 2 air speeds and 2 heat settings plus a \\&quot;no heat\\&quot; button vs. 3 air/heat settings. The air speed, and not much of it, is the same on high and medium; the heat changes. On low, the heat is the same as medium but the air flow decreases.    I have medium-long hair and was looking for a dryer with three distinct settings. This doesn&#x27;t have them. My old and working Conair has only two settings and is more effective than this. At 1875 watts, the air flow on this is sad. Perhaps that&#x27;s intentional and I just fail to understand why high isn&#x27;t very high. The cool air button on the back is marginally inconvenient. Regardless, here&#x27;s one to avoid and I&#x27;m going to try to return the one I got.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected. Easy to handle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working very good.  High quality product.  But unfortunately, they don&#x27;t have a coarser brushs.  I was contacted with the industrialized company and they informed me that they don&#x27;t have coarser brushs for this model.</li>
    <li> I wanted this style hair dryer which is very hard to find in stores. This one fit the bill perfectly. Have only used it twice but appears to work fine and was exactly what was advertised. So far I am very please and happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brush attachment are too soft to pull my hair strongly enough so that it straightens nicely. Also, the drier can&#x27;t handle the highest strength heat setting.</li>
    <li> BEST BLOW DRYER EVER. I have very thick hair and it works better than the Thunderbird dryer I&#x27;ve had for the past couple of years.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!! Do not hesitate to purchase. Great for any hair type. I had a blow dryer similar to this which I used for years but it pales in comparison to this one. I was pleasantly surprised at how much heat this blow dryer packs which makes drying my hair quick and easy. It is best used with one of the attachments. I use the fine tooth comb attachment which straightens as well as detangles my hair. This is truly worth the price you will not regret your purchase.</li>
    <li> works well very high quiality no complaints from me gets very hot perfact for thick hair loved it  will rebuy</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer! I am an african american woman with shoulder length hair and I had been looking for a blow dryer that I could use with ibe hand that had a comb attachment. When I found this dryer and saw the reviews I immediately thought it would be a great buy and it was! I have very thick hair, so I devide my hair into about ten sections when blow drying to prevent myself from breaking the comb. I love this dryer! I use it on medium and then turn to high after my hair is detagled a little because it does get very hot and you don&#x27;t want that stuck in your hair. I use this along with the Nairobi detangling smokless press cream, and it works well. The dryer does not have a heavy air flow, which I love because I don&#x27;t get a heap of hot air in my face whilt blow drying my hair. My only advice is use a heat protector because the dryer does get very hot and use small sections because the air flow is low and you don&#x27;t want to break the comb.</li>
    <li> It works but when I turn it on low to start it, it kinda grumbles like it&#x27;s about to break and short circuit but then it starts blowing the air normally. I&#x27;m scared to turn it on and immediately go to the &#x27;Medium&#x27; or &#x27;High&#x27; setting because I&#x27;m afraid it will be too much for it as it gets warmed up. Other than that it leaves my natural afro hair (range from 3c-4a/4b) smooth and easy to flat iron. I use the babyliss pro argan heat ceramic to flatiron :)</li>
    <li> Great for my Natural hair. Has proven to be sturdy &amp; saves me a lot of time in the washing process.</li>
    <li> This dryer makes it extremely easy to blow dry my medium length, thick &amp; curly hair straight.  Of the three attachments, I&#x27;ve only used the wider-tooth comb attachment and it went through my hair very easily and the attachment never popped off which happens to me all the time with different style dryers.  It is usually a headache and a long process to blow dry my hair but not with the Andis dryer! I was done in about 10 minutes and my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy at all and had a lot of movement.    The only complaint I have is that the cool shot button being on the back of the dryer is very inconvenient and awkward.  I prefer the way most dryers have the cool setting as another setting on the main switch.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BLOW DRYER..IT STRAIGHTENS AND SOFTENS YOUR HAIR INSTANTLY LEAVING IT WITH NO DAMAGE...I USE IT EVERY DAY!</li>
    <li> Very good construction!</li>
    <li> Great hand held dryer.  Seems to dry hair quickly with less blowing then my previous model</li>
    <li> This is a very good dryer,I give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is the first I have owned that truly fits my needs. I have very, VERY curly hair so I am always looking for ways and tools that maky hair maintenance easier. This blow dryer works magic on my hair. It straightens it so fast which really saves me on time. I have small hands so the way this dryer is shaped makes it easy to hold and use. It isn&#x27;t very heavy which adds to its ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the three attachments, I use the &amp;#34;big comb&amp;#34; right after washing my hair and the &amp;#34;small comb&amp;#34; for touch ups. I would say without a good thermal balm, heat protectant, etc... It make be a little freezy. Since my hair is so curly, I am uses to using such products so if you dont, you may want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat dial only has 3 ranges which I thought would be an issue. I would say medium is good for most people. I have never had a problem with not getting the right temperature for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with my purchase. It doesnt break the bank yet works better than any other blow dryer I have had. It saves me a lot of time because of how good of a job it does. I would consider this a must buy.</li>
    <li> This dryer does a super job drying my very thick curly hair, and is very quick at to boot!  Plus, it leaves my hair smooth and silky, with no frizz.  I would highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> A friend told me to buy this dryer, I&#x27;m glad I did. It works great! I have absolutely no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Nice heat settings. Wide Brush. Lacks the ability to turn off the ionizing feature. Cool shot button a little cumbersome. Still researching the availabilty of replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> Very please with the way it feels and its comfortable in my hand also easy to use. I like the color which is why i call it my diva dryer. easy to clean and the attachments are very secure.</li>
    <li> This hair styler is a great product  love it!  And the color is great as well.</li>
    <li> Love it it&#x27;s just what I wanted. I prefer this style of hand dryer to others and the attachments are great! No complaints.</li>
    <li> Love it! It works perfectly and I would diffidently recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it, It was half the price of the first one I bought and has 3 power levels the first one I got only had a low and high setting. Although the medium and high feel almost exactly the same.. maybe be the same. Anyway this one does less damage to my hair and I have actually been able to get away with just using this to straighten my hair. I have very curly hair, and it doesn&#x27;t make it bone straight, but Blow dry it straight with this put it back and over the next few days it ends up getting straighter on its own. Andis is a great company I was been meaning to get one of their flat irons because they are amazing and work better than any other ones I have tried. The are an good affordable company and I would recommend them to anyone that tortures themselves weekly to straighten their hair. Their products really cut the time in half</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this blow dryer - you will only be frustrated and end up with frizzy, over processed hair.  The brush attachment is awful and doesn&#x27;t grip in your hair, you&#x27;ll be brushing and brushing and get mediocre results.  I decided to give this a try after my trusty Conair shorted out - what a disappointment! Even after blow drying I would still need to flat iron in order to get out the frizz.  Will never buy this product again!</li>
    <li> No other hair dryer has worked this well for me. I have that seriously coily painful hair, and this was amazing to work with. I blow dried my huge head in like half an hour, and that&#x27;s cause I took breaks to moisturize. Get it!&lt;br /&gt;Only thing, it shipped from target and the price said 15 dollars free shipping, but I&#x27;m not hating on whoever is running their weird business of buying things with free shipping and charging you two dollars. Lol. Whatever, came quickly and was great!</li>
    <li> Great product. Exceeds expected results.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, and serves it purpose!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have THICK coarse hair that I usually let dry by itself (which takes forever) just so I will not have to deal with blow drying it.  Well it is getting to long and too much to deal with, to the point where I will  braid it and put on a wig before I mess with it.  I decided yesterday to buy the dryer to see if it would make my hair easier. Keep in mind my last blow dryers ALWAYS cut off because my hair is so thick OR the comb pieces break to where I cant use it anymore. Blow drying my hair with out a comb piece is like drinking a shaken up soda, hair is everywhere with only a little of it getting the real action.  Well I used it and I like it. It is the shape of my blow dryer that I bought ten years ago that I have no comb pieces too because they broke and always cuts off immediately when you put it on high so skeptical was  my attitude. However, this was the ONLY blow dryer in Target with the comb attachments, so I bought it. I am impressed. Good heat, good pieces, easy to handle. I cant ask for more, it does what is says with minimum hassle and comes with a whopping 5 year warranty!  SO even if it does break, I know I will at least have an operable blow dryer for 5 years, which is more than I can say for all my other blow dryers I have had in the past.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer works great for me. I am African American with natural course hair. It has the perfect amount of heat to my hair to straighten just enough so I don&#x27;t have to use a straightener. But, when I do put heat to my hair after using this blow dryer it lays down so beautifully. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Good heat but very soft brush</li>
    <li> This hairdryer with the brush attachment works very well for drying and straightening out curly hair. A must for everyone with these extra curls! It&#x27;s also quite nice to have the availability of the two currents that one might use built into this one unit. It will be great for traveling to Europe.</li>
    <li> A must-have! Will buy for a friend.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these and both quit working on the high setting.  It still works on medium which is the only reason I am giving it two stars.  Also, I use the brush to dry my hair and the bristles don&#x27;t last long.  I would like to find a replacement brush because I still use it when my Gold n Hot decides to over heat and shut down.</li>
    <li> Great dryer at a wonderful price.</li>
    <li> Got  product today 8/23/13 about 4pm on time and well packed...was so trilled but had to wait to use it because i was feeling a little under the weather. Anyway i decided to to try it that same night so i pulled myself out of bed a little after 10pm washed my 2&amp;#34; tall nappy hair and comb through with a big tooth comb plug in and turn on my new and well rated ,within 2 minutes the thing stop working and as if that wasn&#x27;t enough half of my apartment went in total darkness.....hell no no no !!!  If i could have given this no star i would.</li>
    <li> good product but not great, air flow not so great and brush attachment too soft but worth the price nnn</li>
    <li> Now This is what u call a blow dryer</li>
    <li> The brush is so soft that it won&#x27;t even go through my hair! The Conair Infinity is much better than this...despite the fact that I have to replace it every year after it dies on me. Still, this Andis doesn&#x27;t do the job at all for me. I use it with wet hair and the brush attachment to blow it out straight..and this doesn&#x27;t work. The bristles are soft and practically melted on first use. Back to Conair for me, this was a total waste.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and this works well when I want a blowout BUT it overheats about halfway through and shuts down for a few minutes so I have to use two dryers!  It either has motor problems or heat problems.  I like the concept but will invest in a more reliable comb dryer.</li>
    <li> Great little inexpensive sturdy hair dryer.  Because I&#x27;m on a healthy hair journey I was looking for a hair dryer that wouldn&#x27;t expose my hair to too much direct heat so the styling attachments act as a something of a barrier between the dryer and the hair and I can get my 4a/b textured hair relatively straight on medium heat a few passes using the larger if the 2 comb attachments when I need to do a trim or a length check.</li>
    <li> Great product....excellent quality!!</li>
    <li> Received and works as described.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer when I decided to replace my still working, but not doing the best job, Conair. I am a sucker for anything different, and this fit the bill. I washed my hair right after I bought it so I could check it out. After using it all I could think of were these three words: No Me Gusta. I didn&#x27;t even finish drying my hair with it, my Conair takes me 5 minutes tops to dry my thick, shoulder length hair. I was on 20 minutes with this one and I had had enough. Also, it kept sucking my hair into the vents which was rather painful. This hair dryer is severely lacking oomph. It takes me less time to dry my hair with my old conair and style separately then it would have taken me to style and dry with this thing.     I am returning it tomorrow and I&#x27;ll buy a regular blow dryer.     Once again, NO ME GUSTA.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVEs it...! She says it&#x27;s a quick and easy process for her to blow dry and comb out her heir and our two girls...</li>
    <li> This hairdryer worked OK for me but did not last too long.  It runs very hot on the high setting; I sometimes worried it might explode because it was soooooo hot.  Therefore, I mostly used the 2 lower settings.  One day, it quit altogether.  The one good thing about it: it was quieter than any other hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer would be perfect if it didn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off when it runs too hot. I have long thick hair that needs to be straightened and this hair dryer makes my drying sessions longer cause it keeps shutting off. I would recommend more of a professional drier for people with thick coarse hair because you definitively regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my first new blow dryer in  about 10 years.  What a difference.:).  I am African American and I have long thick hair.  The dryer has 3 speeds and a cool button which I tried once and it curled the ends of my hair under very nice.  I was able to dry my hair in just under 1hr.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer! I&#x27;m black with a head full of thick, coarse type 4 hair so this thing is a must for detangling on wash days. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that I don&#x27;t think the attachments will hold up very long...they have a cheap feel to them and I fear that one day my thick hair will be the death of them!</li>
    <li> Love this dryer! I haven&#x27;t had any issues with fizzy hair. Very light weight and the attachments are easy to switch out. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is its a bit loud.</li>
    <li> Love it, I love this blow dryer really amazing. Don&#x27;t listen to the bad reviews listen to me and get this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> The brush is much to soft...doesn&#x27;t really serve a purpose.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this.  She&#x27;s in sales and is very particular about her hair. Neatness really counts in her business. The item is all it was stated to be. We&#x27;ll packaged delivered on time. She can&#x27;t stop talking about this item. She&#x27;s telling all hers friends.</li>
    <li> I got my styler today, which was day that they said it would come. I have thick hair and what normally takes 30 mins to dry took less than half the time with the styler. It makes your hair so soft and healthy looking. This is a must buy especially at this price. It&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have twenty words to express on this product.  Everything works as stated.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is the brush tines are too soft.  I would expect something more rigged.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my gold &#x27;n hot one that I&#x27;d had for years. The brush attachment is very thin and pretty much useless in my thick hair. The gold n hot brush had way more bristles that were sturdier. Other than that, it hets hot and dries my hair, but not as straight as the gold n hot.</li>
    <li> Handy to use and I exclusively use the brush every day.  It is performing quite well and seems to be well built.</li>
    <li> In the beginning things were fine , I just started using it  2weeks ago even though I bought it months ago. With 2week(3 times a week) of use the thing has already died on me. This is not something, I would buy again. It didn&#x27;t flat out die , it started declining in performance.</li>
    <li> This blower has a great price and quickley shipped but it is a very weak blower. Needs stronger output to be max effective</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the price and the reviews. It&#x27;s a decent hair dryer but the bristle attachment (the only one I had planned to use) was flimsy. Flimsy in a way that the bristles bend from pressure easily so if you have a lot of hair, it wont go all the way through. I would suggest this item for people with, at most, normal thickness hair. I would not suggest this item for women of darker skin. I myself am Caucasian but I have medium thickness, curly hair and I can just barely use it. I have to use the comb attachments and thats not very fun. I suggest this item mostly for women with a little but of curl that they want to straighten out.</li>
    <li> I really do like the combination of styling tool and hair dryer!  But I haven&#x27;t had the dryer for a year yet and is dying already,  smelled like was burning itself up and dropped down to only one very slow speed and not much air flow coming out.</li>
    <li> This is my second Andis dryer because my first one died on me, but the dryer is very reasonably priced, and does the job on blowing out my thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It fits so nicely in my hand has three different setting and three attachments. The attachments are not thin I love this as other products I bought were thin and broke, If I ever need another hair dryer this is what I would buy again</li>
    <li> Cool, my wife loved it.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair so it takes FOREVER and I have a CHI so this dryer cuts the time almost in half. I wouldnt suggest using it everyday because the temp is pretty hot but its worth the money.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic hair dryer.  It has the cooler setting, but with the same wind power as the high setting so you can get your hair dry and smooth without burning it.  I have owned numerous dryers from Vidal Sassoon and Conair and many other brands, however this is just the best and so well priced.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Andis.</li>
    <li> I was in need of a new hair dryer after mine broke and I discovered that they don&#x27;t make it anymore. I purchased a hairdryer at a local beauty supply chain, thinking that it would work about as well as my dearly departed one. Wrong! It left my hair feeling very dry, in spite of the product I use on my hair prior to blowing it dry. I was going to invest in a CHI, but after reading mostly negative reviews on that model, I decided to save my money and get this Andis hair dryer. I have very thick, coarse, long hair (4 inches past my shoulders), and I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxer to natural. I have about 3-4 inches of new growth, and the rest is still relaxed, so straighter styles work for the time being. This hair dryer is EVERYTHING! Not only was it easy on the wallet, it gets my hair dry super quickly, while not sucking all of the moisture out of my hair. It takes less than 20 minutes to dry my hair, which is quicker than even my original blow dryer, and gets my roots pretty straight (I use the small tooth comb attachment). It&#x27;s easy to hold and gets hot without burning my scalp. Coupled with my Sedu flat iron, my hair is almost salon quality, super soft and shiny! I would recommend this to anyone with the same hair texture as me. I am VERY pleased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hatchet hair dryer for awhile as I find them easier to use on my dense. kinky hair. I decided on the Andis b/c it is wonderfully priced and I have a ceramic flat iron that I&#x27;ve had from Andis since 2005 that puts my Chi iron to shame. As what I&#x27;ve come to expect from this brand, this hair dryer does not disappoint. Even heat distribution, has 3 temperature settings, and offers more than enough power. One thing I am not in love with is the brush. It doesn&#x27;t grip the hair all that great but I&#x27;m hoping I can buy an aftermarket attachment to remedy that issue.</li>
    <li> After only using it once I noticed the bristles on the brush attachment have already started to flatten.  I am returning it because I can only imagine what it&#x27;s going to look like after daily use for only a month.  I noticed another reviewer wrote s/he is looking for replacement attachments.  I&#x27;d rather just buy a better quality product to start with.  Also, the power of this hairdryer doesn&#x27;t even match my cheaper Conair dryer that I bought at the drugstore and was hoping to replace with this more expensive and supposedly better quality hairdryer.</li>
    <li> The concept seemed perfect - combing and drying your hair at the same time.  The problem is that it simply does not dry my hair.  Not even at the highest setting.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for</li>
    <li> My daughter had this hair dryer already so I had used it before I purchased my own.  What I like most about the dryer is it&#x27;s not loud &amp; it straightens my hair very quickly.  I have shoulder length thick hair and it&#x27;s very easy to use with the comb attachments.  You will love your&#x27;s too.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is a big hairdryer and none of  the attachments do for my fine hair.  It was loud as well.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this are way to flimsy.</li>
    <li> Great product easy to use.....better than traditional hand held blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is gold, and looks very unlike other dryers out today.  The comb attachments work great, and help you be able to pull your hair straight while blowing it out.  When it is on, it works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this thing shuts off continuously.  It overheats like no dryer with comb attachments that I&#x27;ve ever purchased before.  I thought Andis sold this dryer for a great price, but really, you&#x27;re not getting at all what you are paying for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this blow dryer to anyone.  Yes, it&#x27;s cute to have a gold dryer, but cute doesn&#x27;t get your hair dry.</li>
    <li> Where has this been my whole life?!?? This is honestly the best hair dryer ever.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work when I plugged it in it didn&#x27;t work how do I return it</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the BEST hand hair dryer I have every had.  I have 4B hair/natural,  and it dries my hair in less time and straight!  You will not go wrong with this</li>
    <li> This dryer is so easy to handle, dries your hair quickly without drying it out (like regular blow dryers do).  It also gets your hair pretty straight, so you only have to go over it with a ceramic flat iron for a more intense shine or control of the ends of your hair (curl or flip or bend, etc...)</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s right - makes blowdrying pre-flat ironing so quick.&lt;br /&gt;Being a curly head, I usually spend a solid hour straightening my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product (with a keratin spray) cuts the time into half, and leaves my hair feeling soft all day long.</li>
    <li> I love how this is shaped...makes it so much easier to dry my hair.  No need to have a dryer in one hand and a brush or comb in the other; it&#x27;s all in one so I really love it.</li>
    <li> The Andis 82105 has so far been an outstanding product in terms of both performance and value for the dollar. I totally disagree with the reviewer who insinuated that it has a cheapo look. This Andis unit strikes me as being well made and attractive. I have zero complaints after my first month of using this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed to read the reviews and find that no one has mentioned that the air flow from this dryer is weak.  I have short hair and having owned other brands and use to good air movement - this Andis is way under powered.  It comes with 3 heat settings and 2 air speeds...low and medium speeds.  I give this product 2 thumbs down.  In fact I&#x27;m going to replace it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister in law and she was very happy</li>
    <li> I recently got a pixie cut and its great for it! Now I don&#x27;t have to put a straightener to my head. It still gives your hair waves but if you have long hair, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d have to worry about that. You save time and money by using this product. Instead of blow drying your hair and then straightening it, now you can just do it all together. :) very happy.</li>
    <li> this works wonders with kinky hair, use it to straighten hair on kids after washing. great that you can adjust the heat</li>
    <li> Product is much larger than it appears in the photo. I ordered it and can&#x27;t use it, it is too heavy for my&lt;br /&gt;hands as I have locking fingers and it is very painful. I am keeping for others in the house but will have&lt;br /&gt;to look further for another one.</li>
    <li> my roommates couldn&#x27;t keep their hands off this</li>
    <li> The Andis Ceramic Hair Dryer certainly looks good and it does what it says on the tin, it dries your hair very efficiently it as to be said, but there is a down side.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is imported from the U.S.A. and it claims to be dual voltage which strictly speaking it is but upon switching from 120v to 220v you immediately loose the medium and high speed functions which to say the very least is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;The accessories are good, it looks good and it does dry your hair!</li>
    <li> i am grateful to still be able to find this type of dryer.  they are very hard, impossible, to find in a store on the shelf.  so thanks for letting us count on you to find items for us.</li>
    <li> This is the best blow-dryer I have ever owned. I am African-American with coarse natural hair. This blow dryer gets my hair dry very quickly with minimal hair loss. The design is lightweight and easy to hold plus the attachments are perfect. I find the goldish color to be kinda nice in my opinion as well. The price is competitive and it is lasting me a while. Andis might be highly underrated like a best kept secret. Most people wouldn&#x27;t expect something with such a low price to work so greatly! I love this and recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Always wanted one of these and this one is great quality so far. My hair is so straight and tangle free. So much easier than using a comb and dryer with both hands.</li>
    <li> The brushes are poor and too soft , and the dryer is heavy. On the whole I am not too impressed.</li>
    <li> Amazingggg ! I love this blow dryer . Takes me only 10mins to blow dry my hair. Its quick , easy , light &amp; fun all in one :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this dryer to replace a &amp;#34;Vidal Sassoon&amp;#34; branded hot comb/dryer that had served me well for many years.  I wanted it because I really like the &amp;#34;hot comb&amp;#34; style.  After receiving it and noting the similarities with my old unit I would bet that Andis manufactured the dryer for Vidal Sassoon.  Not only was the design almost identical, but the comb and brush attachments were identical and, in fact, would interchange perfectly with my old unit.  If that is the case, this one should also last for many trouble free years.  It does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion.  The unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds.  The fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything.  A check with my ammeter revealed, however, that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position.  I am not saying that this is any kind of a problem, but I just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would personally question the part about the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; feature &amp;#34;breaking up water molecules&amp;#34; to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, it was just what I was looking for and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Love this... It has made blow drying so much easier for me.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!! I have long, thick  hair, and it only takes about 10 min to dry it!!! I used to spend about 25 min just drying my hair and another 15 min styling it. I&#x27;ve reduced that time to just 15 min. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Good  hair dryer, I have to get used to the rectangle shape of it  rather than being round, it&#x27;s a little bigger than I would like but works great and has 3 heat settings, and 3 comb attachment - Didn&#x27;t care for the comb too much.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer! My first one finally died after 5 years of constant use and I ended up trying a similar Gold N Hot and it stopped working and overheated on the first use. I quickly ordered the Andis and have had no issues! I have long curly hair and it drys  my hair in under 20 min. I will definitely purchase this product a third time once I&#x27;ve worn the one I just bought out.</li>
    <li> Difficult to find a hair dryer with a brush anymore.  Very well made but much larger and clumsy to hold than the one it replaced.</li>
    <li> I received the Hair Dryer today.  I used it on my daughters hair and it worked just as promised.  I am African American and this is the first hair dryer that I have purchased that has actually lived up to its claims.  My daughter has thick hair and this dryer literally cut the drying time in half.  The handle is comfortable to hold and the attachments work perfectly.  Also this hair dryer is much quieter than older models similar to this one.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone who hates long drying times.  It gets the job done and it gives your hair a natural shine.</li>
    <li> The heat is SUPER STRONG, so I would advise people to be careful. Some hair types can handle heat better than others, but heat in general isn&#x27;t the best for your hair. I personally like it. I have transitioning hair (relaxed to natural African American hair, it&#x27;s extremely wavy, coily and stubborn), so the heat really helps me a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this product so far! The heat setting is just perfect for me because I have natural hair. I put it to my desired heat setting and it dries my hair great without the heat damage and the comb attachment doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair, it glides right through while it dries. I gave it 5 stars because I haven&#x27;t experienced any flaws yet. Hopefully it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> this is larger and heavier than my previous dryer but works better as my hair gets longer...dries hair quickly even on low setting</li>
    <li> this is great for thick coarse hair it took me less time than usual to dry I love it,would buy again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its lack of skills on my part or lack of quality in this product but it just doesn&#x27;t do what I expected. Also, when I used the highest setting I literally, not exaggerating, burned skin off my thumb. I don&#x27;t know if I touched the dryer or my hair while it was hot because when it happened I didn&#x27;t feel it at first. I don&#x27;t want to return it because I&#x27;m still hoping I can make it work for me.&lt;br /&gt;When I get someone who knows how to make my hair look the way I want with this dryer I&#x27;ll update.</li>
    <li> Love it--drys my hair really fast. Easy to hold and manage. Have not tried the brushes or combs yet--may never--as I like the brush I use. But Pleasantly  surprised at how fast my hair drys--so yes I would purchase this again and so recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Heating is fine, however it doesn&#x27;t have enough fan speed, therefore drying is slow. I subsequently bought the Revlon Amber Waves model and it is much better - lots of heat and blowing power.</li>
    <li> I glad I found this works great</li>
    <li> They get very hot, love them.</li>
    <li> wish I would of known the brush was so soft does not go through my hair otherwise would of been good</li>
    <li> Makes weird noise everyone I use it.  Feels like the motor is messed up.</li>
    <li> Item was the exact item as seem on the pictures. Came with all three extra pieces for blowing out the hair. Use it recently n it was good......I must say its very hot.  Good tool. Its just to see how long it will last. But no regrets in this purchase n I&#x27;m loving my dryer</li>
    <li> I have short naturally curly hair that is quite fine, but I have a good amount of it. The brush on this dryer was so &amp;#34;wimpy&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t get the bristles to reach my scalp to lift my hair up and dry it. On the first use the bristles bent from the heat of the dryer. I don&#x27;t like to use the combs because you can&#x27;t control the curl in your hair with a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent it back, and am very disappointed in what I thought was going to be a nice dryer. This type of dryer is getting hard to find, and a good one is ever harder to find!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to mynaturalsistas&#x27; review I can blow-dry my hair with less heat....!&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> Too big, too heavy and awkward for me. I didn&#x27;t try the features because I couldn&#x27;t get past the problems.</li>
    <li> It is ok and that&#x27;s it just ok. Not really a lot of power blowing out of here. It does the job.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair dryer with a comb and this one fit the pocket just right.  It&#x27;s not a heavy dryer and it dries my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> The best blow dryer I have ever bought,  my hair is dry within 3 minutes. Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not completely impressed with the cheap plastic although, Ive used it about 6 times and it&#x27;s still in good condition ( also keep in mind that I am hispanic and have very long, thick and curly hair ). I purchased this because my daughter has one and after using it, I fell in love. But, hers is definitely made with better quality materials, you can tell by just holding both of them in your hands the difference in quality.  I thought I was getting a super steal based on the price I paid for it ($25) opposed to what my daughter paid ( she purchased hers directly from Andis for $52) As I previously mentioned, mines is still in good condition after using it several times, I&#x27;m just waiting to see how many more uses I get out of it. This is a case of you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> If you have IBS like myself and hate that your girlfriend judges you after you come out of the bathroom. This hair dryer is great!! Turn this amazing sound machine on and all she thinks is that you are cold, not an extreme bout of IBS! Until she reads this review and my secret will be out. Sigh.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer it work really well. Heat is evenly distributed throughout the blower. easy to use. I never have issues using this dryer.</li>
    <li> Dries very fast n straight</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer - ergonimically balanced and dries hair fast. No high pitched whining noise like my old hair dryer.</li>
    <li> The item arrive in perfect condition. Even though I haven&#x27;t been using this dryer a lot , the times when i did, it worked flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are an extra added bonus and also arrived in great condition. The dryer is super light and feels comfortable in the hand.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be an easier dryer for a young girl.  It&#x27;s not.  It feels less powerful than my 6 year old Conair and the brush head that I thought would make it terrific is so flimsy-bristled it&#x27;s useless.  My hair is fine and thin and the bristles just bend over if you try to use it.</li>
    <li> I prefer side dryers. This an inexpensive andis that gets the job done perfectly for my 4yr old&#x27;s hair. My afro is not so understanding.</li>
    <li> Was not very powerful, was expecting a little more from it.</li>
    <li> this dryer is: clumsy, clumsy attachements, I don&#x27;t like the gold paint, it&#x27;s hard to hold, I never use it.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this hair dryer it&#x27;s straightened my hair and I don&#x27;t have to do too much to it it has the speed and the heat that is needed to have a glossy shiny look for my hair I am a cancer patient and this is new hair so it makes it look very sexy and I really like the product.</li>
    <li> the brush did not stay on well. Very heavy and difficult to use</li>
    <li> Works like a Charm Great Buy especially with the Pricing... They ship on time :-).. Dries my hair how i like it and gets it straight enough w/o having to flat iron..</li>
    <li> I am african american and have very thick and course hair. Normal hair drying would take over an hour with prep. I found that this hair dryer has cut that time down more than half while effectively drying and straightening my hair. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I bought 2 as Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> Brush too soft. The hair dryer too bulky. I would like to return it. I do not know how. Please, respond.</li>
    <li> Really great dryer for those -- like me -- who need dryer and brush in one.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles on the brush are a little soft for my taste -- hence the four rather tun 5 star rating-- but otherwise great!</li>
    <li> works perfectly great quality. I trust this brand, so didn&#x27;t hesitate when buying it and was not disapointed. I reccommend.</li>
    <li> The dryer itself was really nice but the packaging could have been better.</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased! I have very very long curly hair, it&#x27;s also a bit thick. I&#x27;m mixed so finding just the right blow dryer is paramount. It makes the difference in a good hair day and a bad hair day. When I&#x27;m done, my hair has the appearance of being flat ironed! I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medium comb is what I use mostly. Therefore, I sort of go through them rather quicly. They usually last over a year. The other great thing about this blow dryer is it&#x27;s dual voltage. Yes, dual voltage. I travel outside of the country most of the year, and this blow dryer is standard packing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price here is considerably less than what I paid. I purchased mine from Sally&#x27;s, go figure. Ladies if your have hair like mine, this blow dryer is a must have.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer !!!!</li>
    <li> worth every bit of the money i paid for it  I would recommend it to anybody thank you making such a good product</li>
    <li> This item sat in my wish list for over a year. I finally purchased it as a birthday gift to myself. I am happy I chose this one. I like the gold color. It is much easier to use than the other type of hair dryers. It&#x27;s light weight and comes with 3 combs/brushes that makes it easy to use on any hair type. I have thick curly hair and it does a great job straightening my curls without damaging them. It also cuts down on my drying time being able to comb and dry with one tool. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have a regular hair dryer but because I am an African American, I wanted a dryer with a comb and brush and this one works fine.  It straightens my hair with ease and leaves it with a lot of body, is very sturdy and I can tell that it will last.  I had this kind of dryer years ago and thought that I would never find one again but I did.  When using the regular hair dryer with a comb, over time the attachment breaks and I had to keep replacing the comb but it seems that I will not have that problem with this one.</li>
    <li> Makes it so much easier to dry my hair</li>
    <li> I like that I can get great results on the medium setting. Found that I only use the hot setting when I am in a rush. But be careful because it&#x27;s gets really hot.</li>
    <li> I really liked this when it came. It is a nice sturdy hand held hair dryer and it has comb attachments that come with it. I won&#x27;t be stupid and let someone borrow this one because the last one came back broken.</li>
    <li> The hair brush and combs fall off when you use them.The hairdryer specification say it three speed but fails to mention it only works on one speed and one heat setting if used at the 240 voltage!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel that the seller fails to mention the limitations... who buys a one speed one heat hair dryer?</li>
    <li> I got the status of being an unhappy customer becasue of this product.  It didn&#x27;t look NEW and it was packaged poorly.  However, I didn&#x27;t want to waste the time to return it.  If this is the first time that I have heard from you, then so be it  I bought this in the summertime.  YES I an unhappy about this product and I still do care for it.......</li>
    <li> I love the lower noise of this unit but it doesn&#x27;t have near the volume of air of our other hand driers.  Takes a little longer to dry but, at least you aren&#x27;t killing your hearing while you are doing it!</li>
    <li> Great item, love it and would buy this item again and again.Have to get it if you need it. Luv it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m able to straighten my daughter&#x27;s very kinky hair with no problems with the comb attachment. No problems so far, I don&#x27;t really use it much, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Love the color &amp;&amp; ive been searching for a blow dryer like this but all ive been seeing are cylinder-end shaped dryers &amp;&amp; when i found this i had to get it! It shipped in two days which was great too! Only reason i didnt give 5 stars is because the packaging was kind of beat up which had me skeptical for a little minute but other than that great buy</li>
    <li> worked for 5 seconds then stopped working.  due to moving, this disappeared so I couldn&#x27;t return, but i must have gotten a dud.  I&#x27;m going to stick with my regular ionic blow dryer for gentle effective hair drying.</li>
    <li> I Received This Dryer In A Few Days After Ordering It....And Im So Glad That I Did!!! My Hair Takes A Long Time To Dry Typically; But Not W This Dryer.My Hair Is Very Thick &amp; To Dry It Usually Is A Process. I Love This Dryer Simply Because It Dries My Hair In Record Time.!!! I Would Recommend This Dryer To Anyone.For The Price; This Dryer Is Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> brush too soft. gave it away.</li>
    <li> This dryer gives good, steady, warm enough but not burning heat.  It has one major flaw, however.  I need to use the brush attachment to straighten my hair, and after less than five minutes of using the brush, the bristles had bent significantly, and the brush barely made any difference in my hair.  The brush need to have strong bristles to be effective.  I decided to return the item.  I emailed Amazon about a return, and they not only understood my issue, they agreed to cover return shipping costs and emailed me a pre-paid return shipping label.  It is precisely because of this kind of excellent service that I do so much shopping at Amazon.  I never feel I will get &amp;#34;stuck with&amp;#34; a defective product.</li>
    <li> Perfect hairdryer! I&#x27;m glad I found this on Amazon for an amazing price. I plan on buying a few for Gifts to give out.</li>
    <li> Dryer works well, but is a little big.  I like them just a little smaller to fit the hand better.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever.</li>
    <li> The power is not great. It takes twice the time to dry my hair as with a standard hair dryer with a diffuser attachment</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best hair dryer I have ever used.  Not loud and like the controls.  Have used many dryers and this beats them all.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me for Christmas last year and I love this blow dryer. I have naturally thick hair and it usually takes a while to dryer my hair because the previous blow dryers would cut off due to over heating and sometimes trip the circuit breaker, but not this one.</li>
    <li> Greatest tool for natural chicks</li>
    <li> This is the best investment i have made in a very long time. I don&#x27;t have to go to the salon as much as i used to.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer!!! My hair looks amazing without me flat ironing it when using this!</li>
    <li> I am writing this review to save anyone interested in this dryer to beware!  If you have thick hair you will not find this brush to be adequate.  I have medium long hair and am white, but my hair is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I know this dryer style is usually advertised for African Americans but it works well for caucasians with thick hair as well.  I found a different dryer that is working great.  Conair is the manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the brush this dryer appears to be well constructed.  I did not use it so I can say how well it drys.</li>
    <li> It does everything it says it will - nice drying, not too hot, very even, and the attachments work well.  The heat is very even and it does a good job.  This is kind of a \\&quot;cadillac\\&quot; of hair dryers for people who want to pamper their hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!  It heats up super fast and is lightweight for easy use.  This dryer would&#x27;ve cost me a fortune at a local beauty supply place.</li>
    <li> This dryer works very well to dry and straighten when using the bigger comb attachment but the comb used alone. The comb alone leaves my hair somewhat frizzy and without style.  To style I need the brush which is way too soft.  It glides over my hair making it useless.  I still like the comb for the initial drying but will go back to Conair for the brush and hope it doesn&#x27;t fall off all the time as it typically does.</li>
    <li> So I brought this for a dog with long hair/fur. The wide toothed comb is great for getting through wet fur after a bath. The power (especially low) is the perfect fan speed and heat for a pet that hates loud things. I don&#x27;t like where the cool shot button is and it&#x27;s hard to hold down from stiffness. But I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll ever need it. I&#x27;ve never needed hair dryers for myself, so I can&#x27;t speak for how it would work with my hair.  6-22-16 UPDATE: I see this model has been updated and now has a more rounded appearance than before. I now have two of the older version my original review was about and it need of a replacement wide toothed comb. I can&#x27;t one anywhere. All the replacement combs are for this new model dryer. :(</li>
    <li> This is an amazing dryer for fine hair! My daughter has super fine hair. This is a great dryer for her to get used to managing all we do in the styling process! It is super lightweight!  I have super thick naturally curly hair that would take eons to dry with this dryer but that said we all have different needs. My daughter would fry her hair if she used my dryer, plus it is way to heavy and requires the skill of holding while brushing! This is a great product for teenagers!! Mom approved!!!</li>
    <li> Well I used this four times and the fourth time it sparked and never came back on! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere in a retail store and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for...will definitely buy another!</li>
    <li> No problems or criticisms whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m a guy, so my standards may be lower. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as strong-forced a &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34; as my previous 20-year-old blow dryer generated, but it still dries my thinning hair rapidly, and is not as noisy as my old dryer.  It feels solid (not cheap) to handle, and has a nice gold color in person.  It&#x27;s good that there are three comb/brush attachments, as I know they tend to break over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Happy customer</li>
    <li> So far so good! As long as it stays this way for 2 years. I&#x27;m a little weary about anything that&#x27;s made in China, but I&#x27;m hoping Andis will reach beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast hair drying process. I hair is all combed afterwards too!&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is it&#x27;s dual voltage and lightweight in comparison to regular hair dryer. I can take this with me on any trip!</li>
    <li> At 1st I thought it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough because I had always used bigger dryers. This little gem is so much better for my hair! No more frizz! Best of all it is flat enough that it fits in my drawer. I love this(I do have short hair and do not use the attachments)</li>
    <li> Loved this blow dryer... BUT one night it got too hot too fast and went out! I thought it had died! But it was just hot and had to cool down overnight. I was only half dry!</li>
    <li> The best for my family.</li>
    <li> Not hot, brush broad and not combing all the hair, which makes you have to repeat the process on a single trait several times.However, it does not comb his hair, just dried.</li>
    <li> This dryer has 3 sppeds which I love and it has a button for cool shot. I found the location of the button was a little difficult for me but after a while I got used to it.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this hair dryer.  It is a 1875 watt dryer.  I rated it simply &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; because it does NOT have high-velocity airflow.  I am comparing it to a 1875 watt Vidal Sasson Styler Hair Dryer I purchased in January 2013.  The Andis dryer even on its highest airflow setting compares to the Vidal Sasson&#x27;s medium setting at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I did not purchase another Vidal Sasson was because the one I purchased in January 2013 started making a screeching sound a week ago and I was afraid to use it.  I am returning it for a replacement - hopefully.  It was my second Vidal Sasson Styler Dryer - the first one having lasted me probably 4-5 years and was used every day.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer came to me without the brush attachment. I tried to obtain the brush even if I had&lt;br /&gt;to pay for it. The seller was  not  helpful at all in me getting the attachment.</li>
    <li> It does blow dry my hair, but it&#x27;s not very powerful, I think. And the brush and combs that come with it do not really help with anything.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  Dries hair quickly, even thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job straightening hair as well. So far no complaints.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this hair dryer. I needed it to straighten my unruly beard. I don&#x27;t just it everyday but its loud fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> doesnt get hot enough</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Does wonders to my hair!</li>
    <li> Used once - recently cut hair - Sure to use it again after hot weather ends.</li>
    <li> I have used more expensive brand for my daughter&#x27;s hair and being an African American I can say this is pretty handy and does a better job than what we have used for over 10 years. I forgot mine during a visit to my friend&#x27;s and after borrowing one of this kind I had to buy one myself. It works great. I read a few review and the combs are a little delicate but I have not had issues with mine. otherwise I bought a set for replacement just in case for $dollars. I would recommend this unit and would surely go for another one if this breaks. it seams to be gently on hair and make it real straight.</li>
    <li> It does the job but I find it a little bit heavy to hold. For the rest it is OKAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanne</li>
    <li> Makes Blow drying so easy. I have very thick hair and the combs are sturdy. Easy to handle and does not get too hot.</li>
    <li> Seems of good heating quality but only used once so far! Arrived ahead of schedule from this sender</li>
    <li> I finally decided to use this product today (as I have not used heat on my hair for months) and had I used it when I first bought it, I would have returned it promptly!&lt;br /&gt;First it looks; and feels so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Second I can hear it &amp;#34;creaking&amp;#34; while holding it to even gently pull through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Third, if it did break, the heating element; (which is plainly visible), would cause an awful burning accident.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the plastic casing is thinner than a child&#x27;s play toy.&lt;br /&gt;ONE of the comb attachments is more durable than the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;They should have used the harder more durable materiel as they used to manufacture the comb, to make the body of this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I will more than likely discard this hair dyer; and go into a B&amp;M store  to actually handle a more substantial one, before I buy!</li>
    <li> After reading several answers to my question about whether this dryer has 2 or 3 fan speeds, I decided to go ahead and buy it at a retail store.  I can tell you definitively that it has 3 heat settings, but only 2 fan settings.  The only difference between the medium and high settings is the temperature that blows out.  The fan speeds are actually low and medium.  It turns out that this worked out fine for me, because I wanted a dryer that didn’t feel like a hurricane while trying to style my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with long, thick hair probably won’t like this dryer because it doesn’t have a real powerful fan speed.  May I recommend for you guys the Conair 1875 Watt Ion Shine Hair Styler.  That dryer has 2 fan speeds, one is a gentle breeze, the other a virtual hurricane, but I bet it dries long hair in a jiffy.  I have relegated that dryer to the closet, perhaps to dry hand-washed clothes or something like that.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist of just about a decade. The main reason that I purchased this dryer was its price, practicality and its brand. Andis is one of the leaders in professional clippers in the hair industry, so I figured that I would give this dryer a shot. I have fine/normal curly just to about the ears, and this dryer gets it QUITE straight.I must admit that the &amp;#34;high velocity&amp;#34; air speed is not there, however, The HEAT is REALLY intense. As a professional, if I had to compare this to a standard salon dryer, performance wise, I would say that it acts a lot like the original Chi dryers, low speed, INTENSE heat, with ionic coating to break water molecules up faster. Now, that being said, if someone wants a dryer that really BLOWS the water out of the hair, I would recommend, concerning affordability and professional performance, the Babyliss 2800,  not that weighty and TRULY cuts drying time, in half, has a 3 year warranty AND Amazon sells it for half the retail price .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little Andis dryer works great for hair shorter than top of the shoulders, if you have really thick/curly or long hair, I would recommend use a T parting in your hair (draw a straight line with a wide toothed comb from the center of your eyebrows, to the back of your neck and comb each section down, from the very top of your head, draw a line from ear to ear to make a lower case &#x27;t&#x27; on your head) and do your hair in quadrants, (clipping them with butterfly clamps helps to keep other sections out of your way) 3-5 min extra prep time, but works WONDERS for straightening effectively, and saves you time in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer does exactly what it says, it &#x27;styles&#x27; hair, quite nicely might I add.The attachments are better than other vertical dryers that I have owned.The brush attachment is boar bristle, which allows one to naturally distribute oil through the hair, which is essential to a less frizzy and smoother blow dry. For those who have coarse, thick,tightly curled, or all of the above, use the comb attachment that best suits you, and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go, this will &#x27;mold&#x27; your hair. Air cool the section that you are working on,The cool shot button on ANY dryer is almost useless, takes too long to cool, by the time it does, the section that you are working on is practically almost ready and is &#x27;set&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a four star dryer, it comes with a FIVE year warranty, it&#x27;s very hot, and it is great for people (like me) who suffer from carp-tunnel and arthritis in their hands. At under twenty dollars, this is a great deal, it is nearly impossible to find one locally at that price, especially with a professional brand backing it. Thanks again Amazon, I find SO much great stuff here!r all of the above, use the comb attachment that best suits you, and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go, this will &#x27;mold&#x27; your hair.

    <li> I hoped to replace my similarly-styled hair dryer from many years ago with this model to save my having to wield a brush in one hand and a blow dryer in the other to style my hair dry.  Unfortunately, once I had it and its attachments before me I knew its brush attachment was much too large to curl my hair under.  So I returned it and continue to use my Andis RC-2 Ionic1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord (80020) with a removable hair dryer holder attached to a front panel of my vanity cabinet because space on the vanity top is so limited.</li>
    <li> Its a very good blow dyer I love it  and it wroth the money you are spending on it and its easy to use</li>
    <li> It is ok..But I thought might be more powerful..but does the job for me since my hair is not very thick.  has some good&lt;br /&gt;attachments also..fairly priced.</li>
    <li> Favorite model. No longer available in stores. Bought as backup for 3 year old one currently using.</li>
    <li> Great, very powerful and easy too use.</li>
    <li> Item deliver as promised love the color</li>
    <li> I have had this dryer for one month now and it is performing beautifully.  It dries my hair faster than my other dryer and it is much quieter even though they both have 1875 watts of power.  Only con is its length.  Just a little too long to fit in my overnight carrier.  Otherwise I would rate it with 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This item was bought for my wife. It did come on time and was nicely packaged. The item came in its original manufacturer&#x27;s package. As for I know, the item works as it should and for its intended purpose. She is not complaining, she likes it.</li>
    <li> Got this recently as i was in desperate need of a new hair dryer. I have short shoulder length hair thats really fine. This limits my use of this product as only the really fine toothed comb works for me. However i love how it makes my hair all sleek and shiny. takes less than 15mins too. overall its not bad for the price expect its a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> I really needed a good blow dryer to dry &amp; straighten my hair and this one made my hair look really healthy. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this hair dryer!! The low heat is more then enough for my hair, and these days I use the cool air setting to dry my Afro hair for obvious reasons and no heat damage. I wish they had a wider toothed appliance but it&#x27;s no biggie. Really happy I purchased this!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING HAIR DRYER!!! Some of the attachments don&#x27;t work all that great but the power of the dryer itself and the comb attachment make drying your hair as easy as brushing!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my dryer is broken. When switched to 250, I can not move the heat level passed low. Also, the bristles to the brush arrived bent. I have thick Sicilian hair and the brush does not comb through my curls. I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I ever had! I recommend this to everybody! &amp; it was a good price too!</li>
    <li> Makes a noise like its broke</li>
    <li> Let me say first, I did not buy this on Amazon.  I saw it in a department store and bought for my wife for Christmas.  The box says \\&quot;Even-heat ceramic technology\\&quot; with the word ceramic in bold type.  This is the only reason I bought it.  Ceramic heat is wonderful, it produces smooth, even heat and is self regulating so that it will not overheat.  No singed or scorched hair, no shutting down from overheat, no fire hazzard as exists with conventional nichrome wire heating elements.  The problem is, this dryer is NOT ceramic technology!  It is just the same conventional nichrome wire heat.  This infuriates me, and I will be returning it for a refund tomorrow.  Too bad it wasn&#x27;t what it claims to be.</li>
    <li> The lint fills up quickly and shuts off every few minutes. I have owned this for only 3 months.  I wanted to try a different styler dryer for my thick hair but I will go and re-purchase my stand-by; Conair Black Infiniti Hot Air Styling Set</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Very easy to use and just what I needed however after one use the brush attachment is starting to fall apart.  Despite this one issue this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> When my trusty old dryer broke (actually it was the brush that broke), I looked for a replacement and found that there were few dryers around with an attached brush. Target had one on their website, but not in stock, so I searched Amazon to find this one.    Never mind the ugly yellow/gold color, worse is that it is almost ridiculously large (reminds one of the first brick mobile phones or the early home cordless telephones of the eighties). It&#x27;s stupid big, though in fairness, not particularly heavy.    But what really makes this a laughably poor product is that although it heats pretty well (the top setting being too hot for my comfort), it does not move the air well at all. Add to it (or perhaps subtract from it) the brush is much too soft.    At under twenty bucks, it may not be worth sending back for refund, but I occasionally entertain the thought of jumping on it repeatedly while a friend makes a video of its deserved destruction.    A couple weeks after writing this review, while traveling, I happened to notice that the hair dryer in my hotel room was made by the same company. It seemed fine; I have no idea why they would make this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> First off, I found this at a goodwill for 4 dollars brand new. The only thing that was missing was one of the attachments. Which isn&#x27;t really a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very long, thick, and full of both spiral curls and waves that make it pretty hard to style naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is seriously amazing. It dryed my hair SO fast. I always put in Renewing Argon Oil of Morocco extra penetrating treatment from Organix (about 5 dollars at Walmart) before I blow dry my hair which leaves it smooth and soft, so I&#x27;m not sure how the dryer would have done on it&#x27;s own without it, but I am still blown away with how fast, efficient, and quiet this dryer is. Seriously such a great find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is that it is kind of bigger and while it&#x27;s light when you&#x27;re just holding it, it can make your wrist tired pretty fast if you have a lot of hair to dry. Even so, I still highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> Not very powerful at all.</li>
    <li> THE BEST HAIR DRYER EVER! My children are biracial so I have to find products that can accompany their individual hair textures. My daughter has coarse thick hair whereas my son has thin straight hair. This dryer works for both of them efficiently. Works FAST! Don&#x27;t need a flat iron for my daughter since this gets it pretty straight while drying. Cuts time in half. Bought based on good reviews and I now Highly recommend it myself!  Try it and you&#x27;ll never want a different hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great.  I love it.</li>
    <li> have not use this product as of  to date but the delivery was on time and the packaging is just as pictured, no visual defects or scratches.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dryer fora while.  I settled on this one I am glad I did. It is easy to handle and does not get overly hot in your hands</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with this product is that the comb are not durable</li>
    <li> Not al all what I expected. Low air output.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s is awesome, made my life easier and I don&#x27;t have to go to the parlor every week as I was doing before. I have curly hair, with this product Im able to blow dryer well and style with my flat iron. The only negative about it  is the little attachable brush, not good quality, I used once and its gone, needs a replacement. The combs are fine!&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend the product, It was a great addition.&lt;br /&gt;Rose Rosa</li>
    <li> I like this dryer. It helps to straighten your hair. I do hate that the combs are plastic and probably won&#x27;t last too long. If you have really coarse hair be careful with the combs because they just might break. All in all it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> We have been looking for this style of hair dryer for some time.  A similar but different brand dryer from local store was disappointing; loud, strong vibration, poorly made.  We have been very pleased with the well made Andis dryer after several weeks of use.  It is quiet, vibration free, well made with a long cord.</li>
    <li> The brush attachment&#x27;s bristles are so flimsy , I could even grab one hair with it . I sent it back .</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews.&lt;br /&gt;When I was buying a hair dryer I looked at this for the price. Then I started to read the reviews and I googled it. I watched a video about it. I&#x27;m Moroccan/American  ( North Africa) my hair is Curley and frizzy. I hate having to do my hair.  It takes forever to do usually. And I&#x27;m a new mom so I don&#x27;t have time. So I got this. I thought oh well might as well. I just got this this morning. Omg! I love it. I used it and it was so fast. So easy my arms didn&#x27;t hurt.  I have never ever had a blow dryer only get my hair so straight. It gets hot to handle my African hair. I love it. Please just get it and you&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;I also used my new flat iron I bought from here. My hair is completely straight like I went to the salon!! ( ion platinum flat iron)</li>
    <li> This works fine, does what it is supposed to do. It is just a tad bulky for me but I was unable to find a smaller dryer with comb attachment.</li>
    <li> This is a great blow dryer. It does not overheat. The airflow is not as much as my others; however, it does dry your hair just as effectively.</li>
    <li> The teeth of the comb are way too small and I feel like l&#x27;m really damaging/pulling out my hair when I blow dry it. If I blow dryer smaller sections It will take all day. I have thick afro hair so I think I need a higher end blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Product was not like my Conair. The bristles were too soft so it didn&#x27;t even brush through my hair. My hair would often get stuck into the hair dryer and break my hair. It did make my hair smooth when it did dry some of it but it did not work at all and I couldn&#x27;t even use it. I threw out the other attachments, though, so I couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> Not a lot of power. It takes a lot longer to dry long hair than with other dryers. The brush attachment is also a little too soft for hair straightening.</li>
    <li> Ive had this blow dryer for a little while now maybe a month... great temp and powerful but it whistles and rattles as if something is loose inside...</li>
    <li> As a hair \\&quot;dryer\\&quot; this is a good product, it has plenty of \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; it is not too loud, it looks good.&lt;br /&gt;But if you bought it like I did, for styling your hair, using the attachments that came with it, you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;the boars hair bristle brush is the only useful attachment out of the 3 that come with it. The other two have barely any room between the bristles, and so unless you have extremely short hair, you are not going to be able to run it through your hair. So you are left with the Boars hair brush. But that too, is pretty much useless, because the bristles are really long, and really weak, they don&#x27;t get into your hair at all, rather they just skim over the top of it. After one use, those boar bristles were leaning every which way but straight, so the brush was effectively ruined after one use.&lt;br /&gt;I got a refund on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve chemically straightened my hair for years. Even right after, I still have to blow dry and flatiron my hair daily to keep it even somewhat straight. Otherwise, it frizzes and becomes a tangled, horrible mess. I didn&#x27;t think hairdryers were all that different, but when my cheapo hairdryer broke and I got this one, I was astonished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the comb attachment as soon as I get out of the dryer with the ion feature, and I love it. My hair dries quicker and flatter than it ever has. I spend less than half the time using my flatiron now. It&#x27;s been wonderful and I&#x27;m never going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the hairdryer itself is bulky and difficult to handle, and for a left handed person is a bit annoying. But it is worth the result.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer gave my hair great body but when it came to straightening it it fails. Its really only because I have insanely thick hair, this product would probably work on someone with thinner and more tamable hair than myself.</li>
    <li> The brush attachment is so soft, you can&#x27;t style your hair with it.  I had to superglue the brush from my old hair dryer onto this one.</li>
    <li> The brush is too soft.</li>
    <li> I really loved this blow dryer however,  I have only had it for about 5 months and it has just stopped working. I didn&#x27;t use it everyday either.</li>
    <li> I love it this dryer is prefect for my daughters and I .</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Just purchased it this week and used it once to help straighten my hair (all natural).  Heated up great, accessories clicked right in place and was able to hold it comfortably with no issues.</li>
    <li> The prefect blow dryer. I love combs and brush. The different setting a great also.</li>
    <li> Not powerful enough and not a good value for the mney.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer after having the similar Vidal Sassoon one for years hoping it would be comparable, it is similar but there is very little heat, once in awhile it&#x27;s nice and warm for about the first minute then gets cold other times it never gets warm, sometimes if I turn it off and then on again it&#x27;ll be warm for a minute again but ultimately goes cool. Yes, I am aware of where the cool button is on the handle (horrible place for it) maybe I just got a defective one but either way I&#x27;m going back to my Vidal Sassoon!</li>
    <li> Worst blow dryer I have ever purchased.  The attachments do not slide on well, it does not dry my hair well, and the bristles on the brush aren&#x27;t stiff enough.  Unfortunately I missed my window to return the item. I&#x27;ll have to buy another brand and will just keep this one in the garage if I ever need to blow something dry.  At least it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! I have 4B/4C type hair. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever blow-dried my hair this fast before. The comb attachments are great. Despite what other reviews say, they do fit. You just need to make sure you are sliding it on correctly. I did not have any problem with the comb attachments feeling loose either. For this price, it doesn&#x27;t get any better!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the hair dryer with comb in the stores so I was quite pleased to find it on Amazon.  The Andis Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer lives up to my expectations. It&#x27;s everything I hoped to find.  I especially like the high heat setting for drying more quickly yet the fan speed doesn&#x27;t increase so that it doesn&#x27;t make styling harder.  I would buy this hair dryer again.  .</li>
    <li> my wife said that it works great out daughter loves it too. I also ordered some extra combs just in case.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing hair dryer!!! much buy!!! it works great (i use the thin comb) but the others work just as well!!!!!!!! and the shipping was WAY faster than expected. i ordered it on standard shipping and it came the very next day!!! couldnt ask for better!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and decided to go ahead and just now review it after months of using it.  I love it.  I had one of these growing up and I didn&#x27;t know they still made hair dryers like these.  It does take a tad bit longer to dry your hair, but if you are wanting to straighten your hair you know it takes time to get that look.  It fits well in my hand.  It&#x27;s not too heavy.  I don&#x27;t use the comb attachments.  A lot of people complain about the brush attachment, but I guess they never used one growing up and know the trick with the brush.  No it doesn&#x27;t grab onto your hair like a regular brush does since it&#x27;s so soft AND because the air is blowing your hair away from the brush itself.  I put my hand on the other side of my hair.  So I have the hairdryer with the brush attached on one side. the hair in the middle (of course) and I have my hand on the other side to keep the hair pressed into the bristles.</li>
    <li> Is all made all cheap plastic</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer. I&#x27;ve used many over my lifetime and this one is my favorite. Great price, too. It does not damage my hair like my last few have.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of hair dryer for years and this one is as good as any that I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair, so I use the highest setting and it will dry my hair in about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the comb attachments, just the brush attachment.&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a slight curve at the end for better handling.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a 5 star rating but my brush attachment came with the bristles smashed and deformed, but it does not affect the performance of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Ionic dryers are great in the winter when the air in the house is so dry.</li>
    <li> Truly a great dryer! I ordered one for my mother, who then ordered one for her sister, so naturally I had to have one of my own! Significantly reduces flat iron time. I took a star because the brush attachment does not stay on properly. It comes off the dryer once or twice while I&#x27;m using it. I have a had an issue in the past with most style dryers tripping the GFCI outlet, but have not had an issue with this one.</li>
    <li> Like the color and the brush. Never use the combs although they may be helpful, but not for my curly hair. Wish it had more watts, but overall, like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever! Really good on natural hair. The comes along with the heat makes it easier to straighten hair. Absolutely love it and would recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> I was able to quickly blow dry my hair.  The combs were able to glide through my thick hair quickly.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> GREAT!!! when drying hair dont put 2 much pressure on the dryer when the combs are attached they will slide out.</li>
    <li> If you use a brush attachment, don&#x27;t bother with this dryer!  Also, the high, medium and lowsettings only manage heat.  There is no difference in the force of the air flow.  If you have medium to thick hair, this dryer won&#x27;t provide enough power to dry your hair in a reasonable lenght of time.  This dryer is weak.  I would only recommend it for people with fine or short hair.</li>
    <li> I have natural 4c hair. My hair is very thick and coarse. This dryer is the best ever. It straightens my hair quickly and very nicely. You cannot go wrong with this dryer. I love it.</li>
    <li> This dryer gets very hot, very fast and makes drying my hair take less time. My hair felt softer as well. Great dryer.</li>
    <li> Very nice Hair Dryer!</li>
    <li> I have used a brush type styler/dryer for many years. They straighten and add lift to my otherwise wavy hair, plus I have more control over the drying process. This dryer has a brush with very soft bristles that will not grab the hair in the same way similar brands do. The bristles will no doubt collapse after a few uses. It&#x27;s also not a very strong blowing hair dryer. I found very little difference in the medium and high settings. I have long hair and it took me quite a bit longer to dry my hair with this model than with the Vidal Sassoon dryer I was using previously. I&#x27;m not impressed with this dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She says its easy to handle, light weight, and gets as hot as she needs it. Based on that, I would recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy well engineered hairdryer.  Comes with 3 attachments.  Medium and high heat settings are both at the high fan speed.</li>
    <li> Great Product and it came as described. Heat level is not to much not to little. Awesome.  Which I love.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.. its easy to hold in my hand and I like the different levels.. I recommend</li>
    <li> This is okay, just not like the one I am use to using, it does the job, sort of but l must air dry my hair first or if I force dry it it becomes fuzzy and I dont like that, other wise it is ok. I was worth the price I guess.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t rate this one, because it was a x-mas gift, but my sister asked for it and she had had one just like it and she asked for another one, so I guess she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have it and use it when I needed (usually for my bangs) I don&#x27;t like how it stiffens my hair when I blow dry it. I like the real thing when I blow dry my long thick hair...</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to make it easier to do both my daughters hair and to teach them how to dry their hair on the type of dryer I learned on.  Wonderful purchase the price was great and this dryer dries hair so much faster than my old model.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer I have ever had.. I recommend it for everyone.It was the best decision I made.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer, it gets hot enough and it is light weight, which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Fantastic blow dryer!! Just what I was looking for and at a great price that beat Walmart.  Light weight, cool design and color.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is just what I need.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer, for me, is just fair! I rate it as such because the attachments do not &amp;#34;stay on!&amp;#34; When I comb my hair, the combs come off. IF the combs could stay in place as I am styling my hair, this would rank a 5 star product! If someone &amp;#34;out in Amazon land knows a trick to keep the attachments on....please let me know! I was going to send it back, but since I used &amp;#34;points&amp;#34;....that is not an option! I could &amp;#34;super glue&amp;#34; on  one attachment....but then I would not be able to use the others! The one review I read about the brush is correct! The brush is very poor! I do not use it at all! The dryer gets really hot but does not really get hair bone straight at the nape of the neck.....unless, I guess if you want to burn your neck! THUMBS DOWN ON THIS ONE!!</li>
    <li> The comb attachments are crap.</li>
    <li> Proble with thick hair - the attachments come off too easily</li>
    <li> Awesome product, pretty much as described. does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. If you want a good ceramic product, then this is it for you.</li>
    <li> Very powerful! straightens hair easily.</li>
    <li> Dries my extremely thick, long hair quickly.  I use leave-in conditioner, brush out with my Wet Brush and then use the comb attachment to dry.  It takes &amp;#60;10 min.  This is unheard of for me.  Its also fairly quiet.  My friends are sick or hearing about it so, I thought I&#x27;d tell Amazonians... I really love this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I love it, I have been trying to find one for two years.</li>
    <li> Good Product i dont have any major problems with it besides the fact that it did not come with an adapter thought company should consider one in for those who live outside of america.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any air temperature settings (air temp and strength are all combined I think, as low, medium and high), I greatly prefer this hair dryer over my old traditional style one. The comb attachments are AWESOME, and I feel like my hair dries much quicker and straighter now that I use them. The way the dryer vertically spreads the air throughout your hair leads to quicker and more even blow drying times and styles as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the brush attachement with the blowdryer but actually sometimes use it to just brush my hair when it&#x27;s wet haha- works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. It works well on my kinky-curly, coarse combination 4b hair type. I am a African American woman with natural hair since 2008. I have embraced the hair growth journey so far so good. This blow dryer is inexpensive and worth every penny at a good deal on Amazon. It is easy to hold, comes with three combs that have not chipped off since using on a weekly basis. I also like the fact that is sturdy but not heavy to hold for long period of time. The high setting for blow drying your hair straight works very well, but be careful and switch to medium setting periodically while straightening. I also like the gold and black color!</li>
    <li> I have thick Polynesian hair so in my case, it doesn&#x27;t give off enough blow power to get through my large mane. Looks like a good idea though.</li>
    <li> Was really looking forward to this item - but the two dry speeds are the same! And, the worse part of it - the brush that comes with it, which I rely on to help straighten my hair while drying, is SO SOFT IT WON&#x27;T GO THROUGH MY HAIR!  Or my son&#x27;s hair either! My hair is not course or overly thick, and my son&#x27;s hair is short.  So WHY won&#x27;t this brush properly glide through the hair?  It merely skims the surface of your hair, meaning, the hair isn&#x27;t held straight while drying. So,what&#x27;s the point?  It basically sucks because of that hair brush attachment &amp; the two speeds being exactly the same speed. Yuck!</li>
    <li> Just as described and was a perfect gift for my fianc&amp;eacute;&#x27;s mother for christmas!</li>
    <li> No doubt!!! This item as its described and it&#x27;s worth to buy it. The confident feeling came on from first item that bein open &amp; use&lt;br /&gt;I like it</li>
    <li> Works very good. I&#x27;m and African American with permed hair. Now ladies you know after we wash and blow dry our hair we normally have to flat iron it as well. But that&#x27;s not the case with this blow dryer since I started using it I haven&#x27;t flat ironed my hair. I just blow dry and I&#x27;m out the door. I once told my cousin this and she said I looked like I when to the hair dresser. Product works great. And drying and combing with one hand is absolutely awesome. The combs snap only firmly. I have no fear it will fall off even with my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer after my old one died- it was a different brand but a similar shape: I really like blow dryers that are this shape, and come with the diffuser attachments. I think they make styling my frizzy hair much easier, and I love not having to balance a brush and the dryer. However, this dryer seems to lack power. I was very disappointed by how little air seems to come out (and too slowly), and the heat settings stink: the medium is not hot enough, but the high setting seems to be too hot. Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t spend a lot on this product, because I&#x27;m sure I will buy a different dryer soon.</li>
    <li> Heats instantly, dries hair very quickly and it&#x27;s much quieter than any other brand I&#x27;ve ever had...well worth the price.</li>
    <li> The description of this product says it comes with a \\&quot;100 percent boar bristle brush.\\&quot; Not so. It&#x27;s plastic. I put it side by side with my real boar bristle brush and the contrast is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I otherwise like this hair dryer, though, especially the dual-voltage design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers complained that this hair dryer is weak. I wonder if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s relatively quiet. My Conair hair dryer is much nosier than this one. This is why I wanted to replace the Conair. I&#x27;m happy with the heat this Andis puts out but YMMV as I don&#x27;t have very thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, except for the false \\&quot;100 percent boar bristle brush\\&quot; claim, I think it&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;m still debating whether to keep it, though, as I really don&#x27;t like false claims in ads, and the boar bristle was one of the main reasons I bought this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Tried many Dryers, this one seems the best I had. Salient point, hair does not burn, it dries. Which is what a dryer should do.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has really curly hair and it usually takes me 1-2 hours to blow dry it with a regular blow dryer, this helped me lots and it made fast to blow dry it. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I thought it would be a little more powerful.</li>
    <li> Love- love- love this hairdryer!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a dryer with attachments since high school, but this thing is a life saver! I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair when I use the small tooth comb and it dries my hair very fast. So much of my time has been saved since I got this wonderful gadget.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and this blow dryer straightens my hair very well helping to give it a relaxed look when accompanied by a ceramic iron.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM WAS GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR  CHRISTMAS AND SHE LOVED IT SHE SAID IT TAKES LESS TIME DRYING FOR HAIR.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase!! It works absolutely great.  I have very thick hair with natural curls.  Normally it takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to blow dry my hair and then I have to go over it with the flat iron to get it completely straight.  It took me ten minutes tops when using this blow dryer and it was perfect when I was done.  Not only was it straight but I was able to style it as well.  I have to say I&#x27;m shocked!!! and happy!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who blow dries there hair straight.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer only lasted a couple of months before it died on me. Pretty disappointed it didn&#x27;t last very long because it was a great blow dryer when it worked.</li>
    <li> great product, quality shipping</li>
    <li> This is a good dryer. I&#x27;m pleased with the performance. It dries my hair quickly and gets it straight. I hand relaxed course hair. The attachments seem strong enough.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is great.  This is my second.  The only thing I can recommend is to buy additional combs and brushes.</li>
    <li> Extremely light and easy to handle.  Even paying several times what this dryer cost you will be hard pressed to find one this good.  Best bargain in town.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product as it is not well manufactured nor does it last for a good period of time. It is not a good investment of your money.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be easier to use than a conventional hair dryer that blows my hair around a bit too much.  My mother had a similar-looking hair dryer MANY years ago and I thought this would work just as well for quick styling, avoiding the need to blow dry using a brush.  I was wrong.  This is very hard to handle, hard to use to style your hair (well, my hair) and worse, the motor sounds sick.  It makes a kind of lame vroom-vroom sound like it can&#x27;t quite decide it wants to be running.  I should have known I would not get much quality for this price but I didn&#x27;t think it would be quite so awful.  I will probably donate it to Goodwill, as I think it might be functional, but it does not do what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the &amp;#34;High-velocity airflow&amp;#34; statement - this hair dryer only had a low &amp; medium setting.  I don&#x27;t have what people would call a thick head of hair and it took a long time for me to dry what I have.  The hair brush was flimsy and the bristles were mangled when I received it.  Another thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it is quite heavy and the handle is long so it makes it seem even heavier when you are holding it.  I ended up returning it since it was pretty useless to to.</li>
    <li> This dryer is powerful...Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Product works perfectly. Really happy with the quick response.</li>
    <li> Loooooove It!! Pulls most of the kinks out, and has even reduced the number of relaxers I have to get by a week or so.</li>
    <li> Makes blow drying so much easier.  The time it takes to blow dry has gone waaaay down.  Also I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use the hottest temperature to get the hair dry and straight.  After blowdrying it only takes a few minutes with the flat iron to get curly hair bone straight.  The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is because the hair can get caught where the comb attachment is made.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and curly. I used to to blow dry my hair as straight as I possibly could, and it did a fine job of achieving the results I wanted. It&#x27;s sturdy and I love the attachments.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that frizzes if I don&#x27;t blow dry. It is thick and takes a while to dry so I wait about 1/2 hour before I dry it. I absolutely hate the brush because the bristles just fold over when I try to brush my hair. The good news is that the dryer does stay on long enough to dry my hair which other dryers just don&#x27;t seem to be able to do. Could it be better, YES NO QUESTION about that but in this price range it does stay running longer than four other dryers I have tried in the past several months. I know I need a good dryer with a good brush and I would buy a professional one if they made them with brushes but until then it is just a matter of which one works the best. This design needs to be changed because anyone with long hair knows that it is always pulled into the intake. Three stars because it stays running for me but I&#x27;m still looking for one I really like. Not sure it exists in the USA right now. Maybe women need to start with a few designs, I&#x27;m tired of my hair dryer being designed by a bunch of bald men, and that&#x27;s just what I think might be happening. lol Our choices just suck right now.</li>
    <li> The ceramic dryer made drying my hair much easier than ever before. It cut my time down drastically and no more tangles at all. I love this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I always buy these styler dryers but this one, really lacks power. No matter how long you dry, it creates frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with a Conair Infinity styler dryer, which is much much better</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer. Using it in the Uk so had to purchase suitable adaptor . Works well with attachments and is very easy to use. Only issue is that even on minimum setting it gets quite hot so I won&#x27;t be using it with the attachments all the time as I don&#x27;t want to damage my hair too much.</li>
    <li> At the time I purchased this hair dryer (2011), I was straightening out my natural african american hair (now I wear no heat styles). It took very little effort for me and less time than normal to get my hair straight enough to flat iron. The hair dryer still turns on, but since I do not straighten my hair any longer, I have no need for it. I do recommend ordering the extra combs because I did have a problem with them breaking.</li>
    <li> I love it. You should get one!</li>
    <li> I totally love this hair dryer my bestfriend hair is to her butt. I blow driedger hair n less than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> This item works well. Although the medium and high settings seem to be the same. But it didn&#x27;t really bother my because i was trying not to use it on such a high setting anyway to prevent damage.. my only complaint is that i wanted to dry my hair using the cool button, i found that pressing it made my hand hurt, it wasn&#x27;t easy to hold down, felt like i was getting a cramp. And depending on what product you have in my your hair the whole dryer might slide from your hand. Other that that it seems to be a good product, it gets the job done, and doesn&#x27;t feel wimpy in the hand.. if you have curly or corse hair then you won&#x27;t find the brush attachment helpful.</li>
    <li> no clue about the bad reviews...this dryer gets my hair good and dry. And it dries really fast too! Its a keeper!</li>
    <li> best dryer a gir could ask for.. this is perfect for my natural hair</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I have the same blow dryer in the past and that lasted a long time it&#x27;s a really great blow dryer</li>
    <li> Love  the colour of the dryer.</li>
    <li> this dryer did not blow with much power, I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have had this blow dryer for 6 months. The first five months it worked great then all of a sudden it fell apart. The blow dryer started over heating and then it would shut off then the attachment wouldnt stay on anymore and the comb broke into pieces. I have bought new comb attachment pieces because I dont feel like buying an entire new blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I am an African-American woman with hair past my shoulders. I do not have a perm / relaxer yet I am not natural with locks or twists so maintaining a smooth straight style for my beautiful thick, yet coarse hair is a challenge. This blow dryer is just what the doctor ordered. I now only have to bend the bottom with a flat iron for a bump after using this wonderful tool and I&#x27;m good to go. The pros are many: It doesn&#x27;t overheat, yet filters heat evenly  and provides a nice shine, it doesn&#x27;t emanate a \\&quot;burning hair\\&quot; smell when you shut it off like my old one, and the fine tooth comb straightens my hair to perfection and as stated, enables only mild flat iron action for curl effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this blow dryer and have even purchased a second one to leave at my honey&#x27;s house! A great purchase! I highly recommend the Andis 82105 Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to throw my old blow dryer in the trash. Me being multiracial (black/mexican) my hair would be all over the place after blow drying. Now I blow dry in half the time, with the waves in my hair being smooth out so well. It gets down to my roots, so now I don&#x27;t have to burn my head while using a flat iron. (Also my hair is relaxed going natural.)</li>
    <li> I got this for my 11 yr old for Xmas, she enjoys having her hair straightened once in a while and I thought this was a great product for her to get started, she has the InStyler, but using that on her own is tricky. This is a great blow dryer..but with the included combs and brush it&#x27;s becomes a pain in the butt..it makes more knots than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen. You cannot blow your hair around and force it through a comb or flimsy brush and expects straight smooth hair. This is going back...</li>
    <li> Now my girls don&#x27;t have to use mine</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have one on order or not... just ordered another one!  Because of the price.... We&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> Sounds like it will burn out.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the best anywhere. This is my second purchase due to one of my granddaughters breaking the previous one. Will order again in the future if need be.</li>
    <li> Really Like This Dryer My Cousin Has The Same One But Hers iS Silver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I Don&#x27;t Have To Go To Her House, Just To Blow Dry My HAir Now LOL ;-)</li>
    <li> Very good product but my daughter&#x27;s hair is very thick and sbout 12 inches long so before finishing the dryer cut off...overheated... so let it cool 5 minutes and start back up. Other than that I would give it 5 stars. We love the color! Very pretty and eye catching!</li>
    <li> I have been enjoying this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Great dryer for the price. No issues.</li>
    <li> Not enough flow, Get the Vidal Sasoon VS783</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel soft to the touch and look silk like. I rubbed my hair with organic coconut oil prior to using this product. No fringe or burnt hair as a result.</li>
    <li> The brush on this is like a baby&#x27;s brush it did not brush through my hair. Terrible don&#x27;t waste your time buying. Price is great but brush isn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> This hairdryer doesn&#x27;t have enough oomph to get the job done.  It needs more power to blow air.  It is frustrating to dry my hair with it.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I needed! It dries and smooths my long, wavy, curly hair. Also very easy to handle.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is the best thing I discovered. When I was making my transition to natural hair, this blow dryer allowed me to successful get to my roots and blow it out. I was able to manage my course African hair</li>
    <li> Just not enough blow power compared to the one I had.  Takes too long to dry even on high.  No, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love it! My daughter has had hers for almost 3 years now and I jus decided to get my own. I do wonder if you can just replace the combs??? Because my children have really thick natural hair and I broke one of the combs, otherwise, it staightens my natural hair so nicely that I rarely need to flat iron it!!</li>
    <li> just like the other reviews,Andis works beautifully. I can get straighter hair now with only my blowdryer and the cool shot is a bonus.Thank you</li>
    <li> It is a great hairdryer and it is amazing.  I wanted to use it in both South Africa and America and the dual voltage thing is super cool.  It makes drying your hair really easy especially if you have curly hair and want it blow dry it straight. I usually have to blow dry my hair with a normal hairdryer and then it gets super frizzy and then spend a lot of time with the flat iron.  I have a medium type of curl but it is really frizzy.  I washed my hair and then just used the large comb attachment to blow dry my hair.  It turned out really straight and hardly any frizz - I then just lightly went over with the flat iron on a low heat setting - and it was as perfectly straight as when I spend an hour straightening it out.  The whole process only took about 15 minutes.  I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone.  Infact I am about to order another one that I can leave in the States.</li>
    <li> Worked well for about 4 months. The high heat will no longer work although the other functions are still operative. I was very disappointed in this product. I will try a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use. My sister had the same brand hair dryer well the same just different color. I would never learn how to blow out my hair in a million years, it&#x27;ll be three times as puffy and frizzy after I&#x27;m done with it. After using this product with the comb i instantly fell for it. Thanks to my sis and ofourse Andis hair dryer I love and an finally manage my hair, most importantly I save a lot of time getting ready in the morning. I guess its great quality for its price. I would recommend it. Actually I did and my cousin bought the same one after using mines.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Styler Hair Dryer at the request of my wife....she is a happy camper....she is constantly going on how great it performs...if she is happy I am happy...</li>
    <li> The blow dryer came before expect so thats great. everything was great&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is, i have thick hair so im scared i might break the combs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This is my favorite blow dryer ever! It does the job and I love the different parts that you can use from the big tooth, little tooth or brush. Also, You can have it on cool air as well which is different and pretty cool. It works great on my african american 4c hair.</li>
    <li> Plenty of power and settings.  Lightweight and easy to handle.  Several attachments and decent length cord.  A very good buy.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is generally nice. The only thing that I do not like is that it does not have temp. and speed settings. It only has low temp./low speed, medium temp/medium speed, and high temp./high speed. You cannot change these corresponding temp./speed settings. Other than this I like the wide tooth comb attachment. I have natural hair and this helps me detangle and stretch all of my hair. It works pretty great, came on time. My mom is buying two for herself and my sister. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> It works really good and makes my hair smooth, I recommend it! My hair has some \\&quot;waves\\&quot; and it makes it straight and doesn&#x27;t smell like when I iron it.</li>
    <li> My husband alway wants a hair dryer with a brush attachment.  They are not always easy to find, so I was happy to find this one on Amazon.  He likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Dryer is okay, but the brush attachment is so soft that it doesn&#x27;t work with thick hair.  I have curly hair, but like to blow it into a straighter style.  This brush is not strong enough for me to do this.  I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t expensive.  I will keep as a back up dryer.</li>
    <li> Amazing hair dryer! So easy to use! I&#x27;m so exited I can straighten my hair without a straightener!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this one.  Doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as my last one.  I&#x27;m black so it also doesn&#x27;t get my hair very straight.  I look like a poodle.</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brush are too flimsy to straighten very curly hair. plus this drier does not get hot enough or have enough air flow..it took forever to dry my hair and i was left with a frizzy mess.</li>
    <li> Works great - I love this product.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive blow dryer works great! I&#x27;m an African American woman and my hair isn&#x27;t straight. This gets it there. My daughter has curly hair and this does the job on hers as well. I love it! It&#x27;s a quick and easy blow out!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this blow dryer more because of the reviews on it. But there just aren&#x27;t enough heat settings on it, and it gets really hot, too hot! But the combs are sturdy, and it&#x27;s serves it&#x27;s purpose when I decide to use it. I switch up with my Vidal Sassoon dryer, when I need something with more alternatives to heat settings.</li>
    <li> It dries hair in a decent amount of time. (30 minutes on my hip length hair, and 15-20 on my daughters hair)  It dries it fairly straight, but I would still need a flat iron afterwards.  This thing may say ionic, but I found it actually DULLED my daughters hair.  That was enough of a sign of damage to cause me to return this.  I might also add that though the attachments are interchangeable, they feel almost impossible to get off,  I kept feeling like I might break them, and there was no easy way to grasp them.  I had to pry my fingers UNDER the attachment through the ends to get any kind of leverage.  As this ages those attachments will be more prone to breaking.  Finally I found this didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough on the low setting, but was hotter on the fast blow. This didn&#x27;t seem very helpful to trying to get that smooth style I needed.  I still had plenty of curl it didn&#x27;t get out of my hair. (I have very soft waves in the back... it didn&#x27;t TOUCH them).  I hear a lot of kinky curly girls rave about this, it may work for them, but not on my waves.  I also won&#x27;t risk losing shine.  I will stick to the round brush and dryer.  If it didn&#x27;t DULL hair I would give it three stars, as otherwise it is a decent product.</li>
    <li> Love it.  This hair dryer works wonders on natural hair.  I was not sure if it would be strong enough to use on natural hair, but surprisingly it is.  As a matter of fact, it works really well on natural hair.  I love how soft and silky it leaves our hair.</li>
    <li> Great product and amazing price!!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer had such soft bristles that it wouldn&#x27;t hold onto my hair to dry it.  I returned it and amazon.com says it didn&#x27;t get my return.  Now I have paid for a unit I didn&#x27;t like, couldn&#x27;t use and don&#x27;t have.  BAD!!!</li>
    <li> It was a bit to powerful but it was good, as good as I&#x27;d been expecting it to be. It was worth the money!</li>
    <li> It is a great product- its three (3) attachments Quick and easy to switch attachments</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t originally buy this on amazon but i did have one. best blow dryer i ever had. had it for 5 years and may have had it longer had my boyfriend not done something to the heating coil and it conked out on me. he bought me a new one but not the same, and i miss this one dearly. it is awesome.</li>
    <li> The problem I have with this product is that even with a medium heat, the comb attachments melt. There is no warning on the manual whatsoever on what heat stand should be used in order to prevent the comb attachments from melting. I am grateful to Amazon for replacing my damaged items</li>
    <li> Had this for 6 months has been shorting out  pretty much from the beginning, I think it has a 30 day return policy...</li>
    <li> Works very well and I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> VERY REASONABLE PRICE</li>
    <li> Have lots of hair but the medium heat seems to handle it well. I&#x27;m happy with it &amp; hope it last long.</li>
    <li> Well this product is way bigger then i thought it would be, i thought it would be a smaller handheld one , kinda like a portable. but other than that this is very good, and looks good to. alothough the brush bristles got bent in the mail , but overall good</li>
    <li> Great product for coarse hair! I have a 4b texture and when I use the high setting with the fine tooth comb attachment, I get my hair very straight. The only reason why it doesn&#x27;t get a full 5 stars is because of the placement of the cool button. If the button was a setting instead of at the back, the blow drier would be perfect.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! I have 4c hair with a tendency to shrink almost 75%! This gets the job done! I also use this on my three daughters&#x27; hair, we all have 4a-4c with high shrinkage, and this is one tough dryer! The attachments hold on for dear life and still have not broken!</li>
    <li> It does the job for me.  A bit heavy but otherwise is just what I wanted.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Delivered by On Trac at my door. Opened and was very surprised by the workmanship and attachments I Like the brush attachment I have short hair. Like the GFI protection and the buttons are easy to operate. The cooling feature is great. I  now can dry my hair after my showers and don&#x27;t have to sleep with wet hair at nights. Thanks to Amazon Prime 2-day delivery my choice for purchase. and the high reviews on this product. that made decide to purchase this unit.</li>
    <li> This was my best purchase yet!&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer straightens as it dries; however, it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am enjoying this hair dryer so much, I&#x27;m thinking of getting a backup in case something happens to this one.</li>
    <li> This is a good blow dryer.  The attachments are very helpful in getting your hair straight.  I&#x27;m a natural, I have thick hair.  With the right products, this dryer gets your hair straight enough so that all you have to do is one pass through with a flat iron.</li>
    <li> My gf loves it. She says it does no damage to her hair and she uses no heat protection treatment.</li>
    <li> All the girls in the dorm uses it so it much be great.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer!  Does a wonderful job. Will not buy another brand.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, pretty good at getting the job done. I just wish the cool button was easier to press. Other than that, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it yet, but it seems average as far as quality.</li>
    <li> too big, thought that it was a smaller one.</li>
    <li> This is durable, gets very hot and has a great design.</li>
    <li> I had to have one for my natural hair style, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint</li>
    <li> Works nice and is very convient!</li>
    <li> I love it, after using it my hair is silky as if I use flat iron it. It really straighten my hair out!!!</li>
    <li> Straightens while it dries, great combination for super curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> The brush was mashed on arrival. The bristles ( if you call them that) were so weak they bent over permanently. The combs, I guess were ok.ay. I didn&#x27;t want them.  I threw he whole thing away.</li>
    <li> Good product - still using it.</li>
    <li> Great Hair dryer.  Love the attachments.</li>
    <li> Im in love...the best blow drier ever.</li>
    <li> Brush is a bit soft, but good product</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t put out a big volume of air. But it&#x27;s hot air and it works ok.&lt;br /&gt;The Vidal Sassoon I had was a better dryer before it blew up.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  Attachments slip on and off easily, multiple settings, price was right and shipping was super fast.  A great buy and great deal all the way around.</li>
    <li> My tween was looking for something like this that she can easily handle. She likes the brushes when she dries her hair as it makes her hair smoother and straighter.</li>
    <li> Very good article! i have 4C natural hair and I use the large comb to make the blow dry, wonderful! i&#x27;m in love&lt;br /&gt;I leave in france and the article was well packed</li>
    <li> Perfect. Just what I wanted. Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Great for traveling. Powerful enough for medium length hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not spectacular, a good regular old hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of blow dryer my whole life and thought I would try this brand.  The brush is way to soft.  I was going to return it, but missed the 30 day return window, so now it is in the guest bath.  I purchased the infinity pro by conair, and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair dryer.  It gets the job done better than other blow dryers I have tried for my 4a, 4b textured ethnic hair.  I had another model of an Andis hair dryer that looked similar to this particular Andis style dryer and it was better than this one as it blow dryed my hair so well that I didn&#x27;t even need to flat iron my hair a lot of times because it was that efficient with the proper amount of heat combined with the fine tooth comb attachment (without causing heat damage).  This dryer still a relief for me as I had been going without a good blow dryer for a while and this one works for my hair compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> WHEN USING HIGH SPEED SETTING. ORDERED &amp;#62;&amp;#62; Vidal Sassoon VS783 1875-Watt&amp;#60;&amp;#60; THAT HAS A LOT OF POWER ON HIGH SPEED SETTING.</li>
    <li> I am an African American women with thick 4B/4C natural hair.  I bought this after reading some good reviews and I have to say it wasn&#x27;t that great for me.  I thought it would be a bit more powerful blowing wise and it was just didn&#x27;t have the blowing power I expected and didn&#x27;t blow my hair out as straight as I am used to.  The heat settings were just ok also. I almost could not feel the difference in medium and high heat and to be honest I much rather prefer the dryers with separate heat and speed settings because you have more control over how much heat your using to dry your hair.  The comb attachments are cheaply made ans definitely seem like the break easily.  Overall its a decent blow dryer but not the best you can get for the price.  I&#x27;m actually returning mine to get something better.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have thick hair and it dries really quickly with this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Purchased this hair dryer because it looked a lot like one I&#x27;d had years ago.  Loved that one.  This dryer is ok, the brush attachment has extremely soft bristles so that it lays the hair down rather than brushes through it.  The highest temperature setting feels more like a medium setting.  I would not recommend this dryer if you&#x27;re looking to brush while drying since the brush really doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> there was a comb that fit my texture of hair perfectly. the only thing is that this baby gets HOT!</li>
    <li> I have had better, Not very hot.</li>
    <li> Dryer is easy to handle, which is why I purchased the comb-like handle. I like the three settings so low heat is really low heat that does not dry out the hair. I was uncertain about the comb, but so far it is sturdy and holds up well during the process. Dryer is also attractive.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of dryer to straighten my hair for thirty years. Usually, I purchase vidal sasoon, but found this one on clearance at wal-mart. It works well. However, you will get your long hair caught in plastic seam found on the front of the dryer. Very painful and annoying.  Sometimes you can gently get hair out without it breaking, but sometimes, your hair will get ripped out by the plastic seam. Bummer!</li>
    <li> I paid under 40.00 for this dryer, and got 100.00Results. The dryer dried my hair in a matter of minutes, and it left my hair smooth and bouncy. I presently have relaxed and colored hair, this dryer did not leave my hair brittle.</li>
    <li> I had this blow dryer before but i dropped it had to get another one. And i luv it</li>
    <li> The hairdryer is advertised as dual voltage for use in any country-----------true but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the voltage changer has an interlock on it so it only enables the highest temperature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and speed which is not good.What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this style of dryer for decades, and this is my favorite model ever! It gets the job done quickly and efficiently, and it is kinder to my hair. To top it off, it is the most reasonably priced dryer I&#x27;ve bought in many years. I bought an extra one, just in case!</li>
    <li> i used this after applying the hair conditioner and did not straighten out my hair but made it softer , its cool</li>
    <li> I have looked all over for this particular item.  I don&#x27;t like the traditional blower that blows your hair all over.  This model has a comb so you can manage your hair better.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice replacement for my old hair dryer.  All 3 attachments work great for however I want to style my hair.  This dryer motor is occasionally  makes a loud grinding sound but it continues to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. I have long thick hair that normally takes forever to dry. This makes it easier and faster to dry my hair. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Andis Dryer.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair dryer............does the job.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is great . I use it all the time.  Mainly on extensions.  Have not tried it on natural hair (4a-4c) yet.  It should be fine.  Makes drying my hair so much faster and easier</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer. It dries very fast and leaves a nice shine to my hair...definitely worth the price. Andis makes good blow dryers and this ceramic one is great!... loved it so much had to get on for my mom too.</li>
    <li> handheld and plenty of attachments...great value for what you get. its gets hot and gets my hair as straight as my curly hair can get.</li>
    <li> Love it. Drys my hair fast and now I can dry with one hand instead of two hands. It gets really hot two. Only use the small comb attachment. I wish it had a thicker brush attachment.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this dryer and he is so grateful to have this style available.  He cannot use a dryer and brush in each hand so I will buy another when it fails.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the brush, use it to straighten hair but the brush is to soft, had a different brush that fit so works great</li>
    <li> I can blow dry my hair straight without using a brush. I love this item and I still have it today</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this in the mail, but disappointed when I turned it on. It looks like good quality, but I feel as though I received a &amp;#34;wonky&amp;#34; model. Aside from the normal sound of a hair dryer, it has this loud, horrible horn-like buzz in the vent. I tried to ignore it and use it anyway, and it did dry my hair quickly as described in the product description. I found that it didn&#x27;t get very hot. Overall, I am not pleased with this experience. I may send this one back.</li>
    <li> Easy and cheap.  Does the job for course hair, but shuts off constantly.  You&#x27;ll need to hit the cool button, to prevent it from getting too hot and shutting off.  That has made it easier.  worth the price for a blow-dryer with comb locked-in attachment.</li>
    <li> No power.  Combs and brushes were not right for my hair.  The ends of the combs were sharp and hurt my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unusable, should have returned it, but I threw away the box.</li>
    <li> This is a decent hairdryer, but a bit cumbersome to use - it&#x27;s larger than I thought it would be. Like really large. I recently purchased hot-boxed hair extensions, and bought this to make my life a bit easier (as I can&#x27;t blow-dry upside-down), after a recommendation by my hair stylist. It works super well at the top of my hair (it looks amazing), but it&#x27;s very difficult to maneuver around the head, especially the back, due to the weight, the size, and the brush. Make sure you give yourself enough time to dry your hair, as it will take a while trying to use this.</li>
    <li> I have had it for a year now.  I try not use heat on my hair, but I wash it at night and going to bed with wet hair in the winter isn&#x27;t ideal so I use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little dryer, but be warned it gets HOT.  I mean, steam coming off of your hair hot.  I have a lot of hair, and it it&#x27;s long (just past the shoulderblades).  This will dry it in about 8 minutes and it will be straighter than any flat iron I have used.  I like my body curl, so I am not crazy about that.  I did however use it on my mom who had unspeakably thick and curly hair and we were shocked at how quick it dried and how orderly it was.  It still curled under, but she hasn&#x27;t been able to achieve that with out serious effort in years.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. I have thick hair. Hair dried well and felt silky too.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was great. I have natural black hair and it usually takes hours to separate and blow dry. It took only about 40 min. When I flat iron my hair it usually doesnt stay straight, but when I flatironed it this time it got so silky, straight and flowy.. definitely a great purchase</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, straightens/dries my hair in half the time. Wonderful little dryer .. mad I didn&#x27;t know about this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> This is the weakest hair dryer I have ever owned. It has minimal power and minimal heat. A few years ago I bought an Andis 80345 which was wonderful, and it lasted two years. (I had to look back into my Amazon purchases to find out what went wrong.) I would recommend Model 80345, but NOT Model 82105.</li>
    <li> I love brush blow dryers.  Even though they are hard to find in stores, you can easily find them on line.  This one, unfortunately, is not powerful enough and more importantly, the brush attachment is very ineffective.  The brush is too soft and the bristles don&#x27;t grasp on to the hair adequately.  I would not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Works great wife loves it</li>
    <li> At first i wasn&#x27;t sure about how it would work, after buying the right adaptor, however it did and i an very impress. I have decided to buy this same product for a friend&#x27;s birthday, i hope she too would find it as useful as i did.</li>
    <li> got to hot and hot off not really to haapy about that so i just threw away . Just tried it so its been in a package until i moved .maybe next time the product wont shut off and not come back on .</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer for our second home.  I would have liked another identical to the one I already have at our main home, but it&#x27;s no longer available.  I thought the additional wattage of the Andis dryer would be more effective, which it is.  However, there are three aspects of the dryer that aren&#x27;t as effective.  The bristles on the brush are too soft to work properly with my short, normal textured hair.  The dryer is heavier than my other one, making it awkward to hold above my head for any length of time.  There is too much space between the bristles of the brush and the place on the dryer from which the hot air blows.  Because of this, the air is blowing and drying hair that I have not yet had a chance to style with the brush.  The end result is a much fluffier, untamed look than ideal.  I can&#x27;t imagine how that would work for someone with long hair.  Had I purchased this hair dryer at a local store, I might have attempted to return it and try a different brand.  Since I seldom wash my hair at our second home, it&#x27;s not so much an issue.</li>
    <li> The heat is SUPER STRONG, so I would advise people to be careful. Some hair types can handle heat better than others, but heat in general isn&#x27;t the best for your hair. I personally like it. I have transitioning hair (relaxed to natural African American hair, it&#x27;s extremely wavy, coily and stubborn), so the heat really helps me a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: The brush attachment is some BS. The brush is super soft and does absolutely nothing. Unless you&#x27;re using the bristles on an infant, this won&#x27;t work for you. It&#x27;s THAT soft. Both combs are pretty strong. My hair tangles easily and I&#x27;m able to work through it without breaking the teeth. I&#x27;ve broken a few off of other attachment combs for other dryers, so that is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star for the horrible brush attachment. Overall, pretty good dryer.</li>
    <li> So far this hair dryer is great. Last year I purchased a conair one similar to this, and it seemed to over heat easily. I like the fact that this one has a low,medium, and high setting. The attachments that came with it are pretty good. I know a lot of people were complaining about the brush being too soft,  and I can see why they say that. Fortunately my hair isn&#x27;t that thick, so the soft brush works fine for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a hairdryer but I brought this one because I was tired of having to wait forever for my hair to dry so I could straighten it so I got this one because of the price and it&#x27;s good I guess it takes awhile for my hair to dry I don&#x27;t like that I have to hold the button down for the cold air my finger get tired lol</li>
    <li> Good find.  Have used this style for years.  Look forward to many years of use. Expect the ceramic to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair dryer, much faster than the regular ones. I&#x27;ve had this for years and it&#x27;s still going strong. The combs are great when I want to straighten my hair, it starts the job while drying so flat ironing doesn&#x27;t take so long.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the air vent is on the side and I sometimes catch my hair in it.</li>
    <li> Liked this product, ordered two.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find in this style anymore with these attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Works excellent, and attachments perfect.</li>
    <li> LOVEEEE!! I brought my Mom&#x27;s and this was the only place i could find and replace her exact dryer.  Very Durable!</li>
    <li> Works great and dries your hair fast and it leave it silky and shiny. Please try its fantastic thank you</li>
    <li> The brush attachment doesn&#x27;t work well through the hair</li>
    <li> This should be the only style of hair dryer that any beauty supply location has the most of.  So much easier to use then the ol&#x27; platypus method.  Especially when working on your hair solo!  Totally love it and would recommend this to any and everyone looking to make the switch to this style blow dryer!</li>
