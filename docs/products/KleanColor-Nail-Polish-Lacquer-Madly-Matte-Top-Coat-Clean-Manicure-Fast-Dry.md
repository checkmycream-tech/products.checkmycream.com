<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Never seems to dry. I would love it if it worked.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if gunky is a word...but that&#x27;s what comes to mind when I think of this matte polish. This is the first matte polish I&#x27;ve ever had, so I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re all like that or what but I wasn&#x27;t a fan. Also, it didn&#x27;t give as much of a drastic matte finish as I would&#x27;ve hoped for. I will not be re-purchasing this polish once my bottle is finished. Bleh.</li>
    <li> I love the Matte topcoat!</li>
    <li> Is perfect for beginners and advanced! i absolutely love it, but i suggest putting a thin layer first and let dry for 10-15 minutes before doing handy tasks!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy nail polish online because you never know with the packaging and shipping however i am very satisfied.! it is most definitely matte and very clean looking!</li>
    <li> Really works &amp; dries really fast! Super pleased:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use it three times and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The shipping for this product was very fast. I love the matte look of nail polish and wanted to try it. The polish works, but I think it is probably worth it to buy a little more expensive brand. It is very think. Not that easy to apply to nails. It does look nice but it takes awhile for it to dry.</li>
    <li> this is an awesome way to take any glossy nail polish to a matte finish I love the effect it gives</li>
    <li> best price i&#x27;ve found, quick delivery. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Dries fairly fast. I like the matte look on short nails the best.  If long, i go over the tips with a glossy top coat for a two tone</li>
    <li> It came within the expected shipping time, and works amazing! I love the bottle and it actually smells kind of nice for a polish! Would recommend for anyone wanting to buy matte top coat.</li>
    <li> I like this, the polish comes out matte, but it&#x27;s kind of uneven. And it takes FOREVER to dry. Like two hours. No joke. So I think I would rely on how patient you are before you go buying this.</li>
    <li> Yea it&#x27;s thick and takes long to dry but it dose do give the matte color to it.</li>
    <li> Not impressed  with this product</li>
    <li> bad quality and very poor customer service</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay I mean it gives you that really nice matte finish but it takes forever to dry &amp; even though the polish may seem dry it isn&#x27;t so if your nails touch something it will mess up the polish. It&#x27;s just really thick &amp; makes bubbles in the paint if you put too much, but I suggest just using a small layer &amp; letting it dry for a while.</li>
    <li> My 12yo daughter loves this.</li>
    <li> Took way too long to dry. Seemed like it never dried. I ended up throwing it away after I took it to my nail tech guy and he said it was a horrible brand.</li>
    <li> It does its job although it does take awhile to dry so therefore I would give it a 4 stars but the shipping was pretty fast so I&#x27;ll give it a 5.</li>
    <li> Temporarily turns white after fingers submerged in water  .. weird . Maybe it&#x27;s just me ..</li>
    <li> This is an awesome  product u can use any nail polish u have in house an give a nice mate pro look I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been dying for matte polish for weeks and had tried another product, which didn&#x27;t give me the finish I wanted. I was skeptical that because KleanColor was so cheap, it would also be a disappointment, so I tried it on the moment it dropped into my mailbox. It goes on a bit thick, but it&#x27;s definitely matte and the exact finish I wanted and dries quickly. Bonus: it arrived in almost no time at all.</li>
    <li> It works really good with black nail polish, I just don&#x27;t like the way it looks with some of the colored nail polish I have, but, it still works amazingly.</li>
    <li> Im in love with my Matte Finisher....It makes my nail  looks So Different.....Especially my french tips....Does Exactly wat it Suppose to ...I waa skeptical because I really didnt kno which product to use because it was my first time tryin the Matte look......And I introduce it to the nailshop i go....</li>
    <li> This top coat was WAY!! too thick and it NEVER DRIED! and it smudged hours after I put it on a</li>
    <li> Seems like it takes the polish underneath it off if you put on too much and can look streaky.</li>
    <li> ITS A GREAT PRODUCT AND THE SHIPPING WAS FAST I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS TO YOU GUYS IT&#x27;S JUST AWESOME. AND REALLY UNIQUE TO TRY GUYS!!</li>
    <li> I was praying this nail polish would work. And it does no lie! The shipping was super fast. Came in about 2-3 days. This does work on any nail polish, I love it, especially for fall now! :D</li>
    <li> I love that I can throw this on over any polish and have a perfect matte look. HOWEVER, you can visit shopmissa.com and get this for $1.</li>
    <li> amazing love it. really nice to use. black polish works the best. my bottle was slightly chipped but it still works. over all good product.</li>
    <li> OMG DO NOT BUY MELTY AND IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG TO DRY!! This is the worst matte top coat ever!!!! First time i used it i let my nail polish dry for a half an hour and put it on. as soon as i put it on it like melted off the nail polish and did not make it matte at all. the second and last time i used it i let my nails dry for a whole day and a half and the top coat melted off the polish once again. just do not buy please it is a waste of money. The only thing i use it for now is to help clean my nail brushes.if i could give zero stars i would.</li>

    <li> The only tiny problem is that it is difficult to take off but it will chip like any other nail polish. Otherwise, the matte looks great!</li>
    <li> Ordered this on April 5 &amp; I still haven&#x27;t got it yet. It&#x27;s been weeks now... I&#x27;m getting impatient and now have to go buy a different bottle of it from somewhere for prom</li>
    <li> This works alright for like one evening. But it just makes your polish chip off in sheets. I do not recommend buying, spring for a higher quality and don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is okay. It could have had more of a matte look to it. It takes away the shine, but it looks very dull. By trying another coat of the matte polish might make the manicure clumpy depending on what kind of polish you use under the matte.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a matte nail polish and luckily found this one with a reasonable price. It does the job but takes long to dry i don&#x27;t know if its my impatience lol.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast and its exactly what I ordered but it chips off way too easily. I love matte nails but if I have to do it every other day then I&#x27;m going to stick with regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> All you need is a really thin coat to get it lookin matte. If you do a thick coat it never dries and will smudge the polish. I love it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My daughter kept it so it must have worked.</li>
    <li> Works good, dries fast.</li>
    <li> Works good for such a cheap price</li>
    <li> Love this product! But it seems to be fading away over the days. The matte turns into a shiny coat after several days of washing. I lobe it but kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> i like it a lot but i think you should go and buy one that has black nail polish and matte if you want to use black lol</li>
    <li> It works like it should, just chips the polish super easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using matte top coats for a long time- I know what I&#x27;m doing but this will screw up you&#x27;re manicure for sure. I tried it on every type of polish I had. It split the existing color and messed it up. Every try.</li>
    <li> I am beyond livid right now. I ordered this polish days ago.. Excited for it to come, I checked the mail nearly every day. Given that it arrived in expected timing I can&#x27;t be upset about the wait. However, once I received the package &amp; opened it...the bottle was EMPTY. Not a drip-drop of polish inside. Not even a HINT of a nail polishes scent as if it had never even been filled!! I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I received my polish three days after I ordered it. It smells really strong when being applied, like super glue or something. But it dries fast &amp; the matte looks really nice. It also isn&#x27;t a cheap small bottle, it&#x27;s an average sized bottle, enough for plenty mani&#x27;s. I recommend 100%!</li>
    <li> I applied 2 coats of this top coat in the morning and by evening, the polish was chipped. Would not buy again! If I were in the construction business, I&#x27;d understand but I work a desk job. There should be no reason why 1/4 of the polish is chipped in less than 12 hours of applying.</li>
    <li> really works and gives that matte finish look on any nail polish. finally found something that works! thank you (:</li>
    <li> This polish works well but makes nail polish chip after not even 24 hours after applying. I would not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> it worked good but i wasn&#x27;t so thrilled by the color</li>
    <li> Received package on time, packed appropriately. Seller did provide tracking info.  I recently went to the nail salon for a fill in and brought this nailpolish w me for the nail tech to use on top of the black nail polish I selected. Nail polish did exactly what it advertised it did. I left happy w a fresh matte black nail job. Polish is cool. Would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want shiny nailpolish any longer or who wants something different.</li>
    <li> my son is a makeup artist and he paints his nails (well i paint his nails) and he likes the matte better because he&#x27;s a &amp;#34;boy&amp;#34; and boys shouldn&#x27;t be shiny so it&#x27;s a great product for everyone&#x27;s nails</li>
    <li> Just loved it. I like matt finish nail paint and this one is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Leaves a soft matte, but at least it stays in the same consistency in the bottle. I&#x27;ve had others that became a solid in the bottle after some time.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It turns any color polish into a beautiful matte finish. Save all your money and buy this ONE polish rather than every color of matte nail polish. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the way the finished product look after applying the KleanColor matte nail polish over my color coated nails</li>
    <li> Great item! Shipped pretty fast and arrived at my house safely. The nail polish works amazingly and I will definitely be ordering it again!</li>
    <li> I am very happy to have a \\&quot;matte\\&quot; polish. I like how I can put it over anything I already have so I&#x27;m not getting tired of same&#x27;ol color. I dont know if it necessarily matte&#x27;s, but it does dull leaving a satin like sheen, but definitely not shiny like original color. I like it and will continue to use it. Takes LOOOOOONG time to dry and smudges easy for long time after put on.</li>
    <li> Smudgy and thick. Takes forever to dry.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles (like an idiot). The polish is very obviously old and out-dated, because as I brought the brush up out of the bottle, it was extremely thick, &#x27;sticky&#x27; and gloppy. Even after overnight, the polish on my nails is STILL soft and tacky. I&#x27;ll never buy another product from this supplier  since they don&#x27;t seem to care about the quality of the products they sell and would rather make the bucks than make sure what they&#x27;re selling even usable. Really crappy polish and a crummy experience. If I could give this rating a No-star I certainly would.</li>
    <li> Thought it wasn&#x27;t gonna work, but it did.</li>
    <li> It is a matte top coat that turns out great but by the end of the day you nails will be all chipped. Super cheap product.</li>
    <li> Love how this turns any polish edgy &amp; chic with its matte finish. Arrived rapidly! Makes my nails so strong.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. It just takes a really really long time to dry. Thinking of getting drying drops. Love it tho:)</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
    <li> You can use it on any nail polish it works! It&#x27;s clear and it does give you a matte look. Did I mention it was delivered before the estimation date? It was; I ordered it the 24 I got it the 27. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a matte color and this awesome matte top coat. Not to mention the fast shipping of my order. Thank you all. I will make another purchase soon.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Dries pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Good product, all perfect, Quiverr are professionals!</li>
    <li> It works really well for making any color matte. However, it goes on thin, so army bumps on your nails or something will make the matte look ugly. I have to put my polish, a clear coat, and then the matte coat so it can look nice and smooth. Would totally recommend</li>
    <li> This was the very first matte top coat that I bought. I don&#x27;t recommend this matte coat to anyone. It goes on way too thick and its very difficult to put on.</li>
    <li> Got this and it was so clumpy and never even worked. It was almost like it was 10 year old nail polish. So disappointing</li>
    <li> i got my matte nail polish today and i love it shipping was quick will order again in the future 💟</li>
    <li> But it&#x27;s cheaper than most other matte top coat. So if you want to try matte finishes use this one.  I also tried the Essie matte top coat it&#x27;s a bit thinner but try it with the inexpensive version first.</li>
    <li> This product works well, although I ordered it in January and it was cold outside so when it showed up, it was VERY thick. I will keep this in mind next time I purchase polish off line.</li>
    <li> Clear coat that turns your polish matte, absolutely genius, love this!</li>
    <li> But I honestly don&#x27;t like the look of matte polish, I discovered.  It looks like what I spend forever trying to get nail polish NOT to do.  Five stars are because it will indeed make shiny polish matte, goes on well, stays on well, and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Very skeptical about product especially since other matte polishes and top coats cost way more. Nevertheless I bought it and it worked like a charm! Almost amazed at how smooth it looks too.</li>
    <li> I try to use this 3 times and its don&#x27;t work this make the polish get off my nails&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> Did not do what I expected it to do at all.  It didn&#x27;t really give a matte look, just made the polish a little dull.</li>
    <li> this stuff is hard to get off but it works really good but it smells pretty bad other than that:)</li>
    <li> I have to be careful to keep bubbles out of the paint when I apply but it&#x27;s been an awesome purchase. Came wrapped in bubble wrap so no damage!</li>
    <li> I like it but it takes nearly a day to dry and its a little too thick. Other then that, it works as expected</li>
    <li> I was psyched to get this at first because I am obsessed with matte nail polish. When it arrived in the mail I quickly proceeded to use it. It. Was. AWFUL!! It didn&#x27;t make my nails matte, not even one bit; rather it gave my nails a super dull shine as if wax was on my nails. So, my warning is do NOT buy this junk!</li>
    <li> It takes a long time to dry.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! It was a little bit thick but, nothing a cheap nail polish thinner can&#x27;t fix. Works really well, no bad smells.</li>
    <li> Okay it arrived in a timely manner, it was intact although the lid was loose, it hadn&#x27;t opened completely or spilled out, but I thought that was kind of weird that the top was so loose on it. The product itself doesn&#x27;t work like I expected it to. It basically melts the gloss finish of the bottom coat of nail polish. It might have been my not being patient enough, but after waiting a fairly long time for it to dry, (it seemed dry) it kinda just sloughed off with the nail polish and completely glommed up. Second try after waiting a really long time (15 plus min) it seemed dryer, but wasn&#x27;t what I would call &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish. Long and short of it is the product itself didnt match my expectations, but the vendor did everything right on their end of the sale. I wouldn&#x27;t dream of buying this in the store and then attempting to return it because it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations, this isn&#x27;t Walmart afterwhile. You live and you learn. Maybe it was just me?</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and the polish worked very well !</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Dry fust! Really nice mate tone</li>
