### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The four brush head pack is the best money $aving  deal around as the need to change heads every three months is fulfilled with a years supply.</li>
      <li>Very happy with the upgraded models.</li>
      <li>Great purchase!</li>
      <li>My toothbrush has a 2 minute timer, I jog in place for those 2 minutes, a great way to get the blood circulating!</li>
      <li>This is a great price for these.</li>
      <li>Great buy on four replacements heads for the Philips Sonicare Elite.  </li>
      <li>Since purchasing the Sonicare, my husband and I have had great dental checkups too.  </li>
      <li>I checked many places for the replacement brushes for my Sonicare Elite Tooth brush and the one offered on Amazon was the best price....</li>
      <li>I get good checkups from my dentist</li>
      <li>It was great that they fit elite essence and</li>
      <li>I was very happy that these heads fit both our Essence and Advanced units, as advertised.</li>
      <li>Well there isn&#x27;t really much to say, except it&#x27;s a very good product.  </li>
      <li>Be doubly sure this is for the model brush you own based on the description and NOT ON THE PHOTO before ordering.</li>
      <li>Price was better than buying 2 - 2 packs over the year and figured this way I have a year of toothbrush heads with one purchase.  </li>
      <li>I love having a supply now.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used the Sonicare for many years and love it.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by my dentist; seems to remove plaque better than hand brushing.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to order all of these online, at a good price and with my specific code in front of me.</li>
      <li>Sonicare is a very good toothbrush, and the 4 pac of refills last over a year for me.</li>
      <li>Makes thorough brushing so easy.</li>
      <li>The product was accurately described and met my expectations.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use and to clean.  </li>
      <li>BARGAINHUNTERS has the 4 pack at $45.42 but has two ads, one with free shipping one w/o.</li>
      <li>is great so that I have plenty of spares for the future.  </li>
      <li>Biggest concern was whether they would fit or not.  </li>
      <li>Plus free $shipping &amp; zero tax is an added bonus.</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable for so many toothbrush heads.  </li>
      <li>To the Sonicare Advance users that is good news because these brusheads are far superior to the older large Advance brusheads.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick and the return went smooth.</li>
      <li>so it can reach the backtooth and hard-to-reach areas far more easily and dextrously.</li>
      <li>Item arrived in no time with Super Saver shipping and I am all set until I need to reorder in 11 months...</li>
      <li>My son seems to go through them quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love brushing my teeth with fresh, new bristles and the 4 pack</li>
      <li>product came quickly and was exactly as described on site.</li>
      <li>Keep drilling around until you find the \\&quot;right deal\\&quot;, as what I mentioned beforehand may have changed by the time you read this review.</li>
      <li>I have an older Sonicare toothbrush (Advanced) and recently they discontinued the toothbrush heads that originally came with the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Although these brushheads vibrate at the same rate as the older Advance brusheads, they vibrate much more vigorously and create a far more intense sonic pulse and brushing action.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and complete.</li>
      <li>I would say these clean about 20% better than the old Advance brusheads, which were not exactly deficient.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will absolutely order from these folks again.</li>
      <li>It is smaller than the head it replaces,  and doesn&#x27;t fit as smoothly as the prior version.    </li>
      <li>I received the item promptly and the toothbrush heads fit my Sonicare base perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I have one of the older models of Sonicare called Advance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unlike the older Advance brusheahds, which required replacement every 6 months, these need to be replaced every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I searched around for awhile trying to locate the older brushes when I came across these brushes, which were made to replace the older brushes.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend the Philips Sonicare system.</li>
      <li>I thought I liked the compact head instead of the standard head but changed my mind when I needed to replace my compact head and only had the standard one that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>you are a Sonic Advance owner, do not hesistate to replace your old brusheads with these.</li>
      <li>The hardest thing is when you are out and need these replacements, but there are multiple size heads to go with your particular toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I am a long time user of the Sonicare Elite toothbrush and have seen a huge difference over other brands...</li>
      <li>In fact I&#x27;m currently using an old fashioned one since I had to return the ones I ordered.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Apparently, Sonicare decided to stop manufacturing the old Advance brushheads and made these smaller and tilted brusheads compatible with the Advance models.</li>

    <li> Great buy on four replacements heads for the Philips Sonicare Elite.  Since purchasing the Sonicare, my husband and I have had great dental checkups too.  Would highly recommend the Philips Sonicare system.</li>
    <li> This replacement head for the Sonicare toothbrush seems flimsy. It is smaller than the head it replaces,  and doesn&#x27;t fit as smoothly as the prior version.    When these wear out, may switch to another brand.</li>
    <li> This Sonicare brand name has been working for me in the last 2 years as compared to the other brand names that I&#x27;ve used.</li>

The heads on the brushes are a bit smaller so I was skeptical, but I must say I actually prefer these brushes to the older version. Very happy with the upgraded models.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of the Sonicare Elite toothbrush and have seen a huge difference over other brands...I thought I liked the compact head instead of the standard head but changed my mind when I needed to replace my compact head and only had the standard one that came with the toothbrush.  I was hooked; needed to get replacements and found this 4 pack on Amazon.  Price was better than buying 2 - 2 packs over the year and figured this way I have a year of toothbrush heads with one purchase.  Item arrived in no time with Super Saver shipping and I am all set until I need to reorder in 11 months...hopefully the price will come down or at least stay the same!!</li>
    <li> It was great that they fit elite essence and Xtreme toothbrushes, instead of having to buy different sets, since my family each has a different model.</li>
    <li> If ordering this, beware as the while the description is correct, it does not match the item pictured.  Be doubly sure this is for the model brush you own based on the description and NOT ON THE PHOTO before ordering.</li>
    <li> I have one of the older models of Sonicare called Advance. It came with larger brushheads and, until now, these types of smaller brushheads did not fit the older Sonicare Advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, Sonicare decided to stop manufacturing the old Advance brushheads and made these smaller and tilted brusheads compatible with the Advance models. To the Sonicare Advance users that is good news because these brusheads are far superior to the older large Advance brusheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theses heads are ergonomically tilted and smaller so it can reach the backtooth and hard-to-reach areas far more easily and dextrously. Although these brushheads vibrate at the same rate as the older Advance brusheads, they vibrate much more vigorously and create a far more intense sonic pulse and brushing action. The result is a substantially cleaner teeth. I would say these clean about 20% better than the old Advance brusheads, which were not exactly deficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the older Advance brusheahds, which required replacement every 6 months, these need to be replaced every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a Sonic Advance owner, do not hesistate to replace your old brusheads with these.</li>
    <li> Got this four pack at BJ&#x27;S today for $35.00. So if you are a member, save some money and buy yours there.</li>
    <li> I checked many places for the replacement brushes for my Sonicare Elite Tooth brush and the one offered on Amazon was the best price....product came quickly and was exactly as described on site.</li>
    <li> I received the item promptly and the toothbrush heads fit my Sonicare base perfectly.  I love brushing my teeth with fresh, new bristles and the 4 pack is great so that I have plenty of spares for the future.  My husband will probably end up using a couple of them.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 3 months behind times to write this review. The four brush head pack is the best money $aving  deal around as the need to change heads every three months is fulfilled with a years supply. Plus free $shipping &amp; zero tax is an added bonus. Go figure why the DABNUTRITION ad states \\&quot;3 BRUSH HEADS\\&quot; when it&#x27;s pictured as a 4 pack. BARGAINHUNTERS has the 4 pack at $45.42 but has two ads, one with free shipping one w/o. Keep drilling around until you find the \\&quot;right deal\\&quot;, as what I mentioned beforehand may have changed by the time you read this review.</li>
    <li> Well there isn&#x27;t really much to say, except it&#x27;s a very good product.  I get good checkups from my dentist, it&#x27;s easy to use and to clean.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The product was accurately described and met my expectations. It arrived as expected. CONS: Came sealed in that thick, plastic shrink wrap that is extremely difficult to open. I had to use industrial snips to open the package and was concerned that I was going to damage the product.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is a very good toothbrush, and the 4 pac of refills last over a year for me. My toothbrush has a 2 minute timer, I jog in place for those 2 minutes, a great way to get the blood circulating!</li>

    <li> I was very happy that these heads fit both our Essence and Advanced units, as advertised.</li>
    <li> Biggest concern was whether they would fit or not.  They do and the product is the only one we use here.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to order all of these online, at a good price and with my specific code in front of me. The hardest thing is when you are out and need these replacements, but there are multiple size heads to go with your particular toothbrush. I love having a supply now.</li>
