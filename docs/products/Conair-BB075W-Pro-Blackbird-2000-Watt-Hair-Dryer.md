      <li>Super happy with this</li>
      <li>as I said, by far the best!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best blowdryer I have ever used.</li>
      <li>got it fast and it works great.</li>
      <li>It died after I dropped it one too many times.</li>
      <li>My wife and two daughters love it too.</li>
      <li>but when I ran them side by side the Conair made much more noise.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I and am glad to say this one meets my expectations with the volume of air flow and 4 temperature settings.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with the Blackbird that I wanted to share.  </li>
      <li>heat settings and fan speeds  -longer cord than most (8 feet instead of 6 feet)  </li>
      <li>Most of my clients have curly hair and come see me to blow out stright.</li>
      <li>When I use it, I feel like there should be disco music playing :)</li>
      <li>Much better than anything I&#x27;ve found in drug stores.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SO, I got 2 :-)</li>
      <li>what I call, for lack of a better description, \\&quot;Squirrel Cage\\&quot; driers.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good!</li>
      <li>It has the best power and can get my hair straight or can diffuse it exactly how I want it with the settings.</li>
      <li>In this day and age when this product like others offer no warranty time at all I quess thats pretty good.</li>
      <li>settings are good- the highest heat is quite hot.</li>
      <li>This blow dryer is the greatest hair tool I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time.</li>
      <li>although I have it set for warm, gets very hot and often feels as if it is burning my hair.  </li>
      <li>Had the yellow bird for many years and loved it, until it broke!</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s used them (and others) in salons for many years and mentioned this one as a sound hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>But a true performer!</li>
      <li>The flip out side air filter on the intake side makes cleaning sucked in debris an easy chore.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>But, it doesn&#x27;t seem to move the air as strong as my YellowBird does.</li>
      <li>Looking forward to many beautiful blow drying years with the black bird :)</li>
      <li>Light weight and easy to handle.</li>
      <li>And while this is not the best one I&#x27;ve ever had (my favorite was an 1875 watt Helen of Troy Professional that died several years ago)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use the hottest setting and get great results at a lesser heat level.  </li>
      <li>It is the most powerful and the hottest dryer I have ever had.</li>
      <li>I find the weight and design of this dryer to be comfortable, and it is quite sturdy.</li>
      <li>The higher heat settings would be perfect for a woman with long hair.  </li>
      <li>While it does have a convenient lint trap that is easy to keep clean, it does not have a cool setting with sufficient velocity.</li>
      <li>The original hair dryer got to me in a matter of days but the replacement was going to weeks</li>
      <li>After using the Blackbird, I am equally impressed (if not more).</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is very powerful and I do a lot of styling on the cool setings as well.          </li>
      <li>Transaction was smooth and quick.</li>
      <li>I do not believe that this is an authentic item, more than likely a cheap knockoff.  </li>
      <li>for the price i was not expecting the dryer to do much but turned out to love it</li>
      <li>Good performance in that it has lots of air blowing power but that only occurs at its highest heat setting.</li>
      <li>Clearly defective model, it can&#x27;t handle it&#x27;s own heat.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad dryer.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
      <li>I am super picky about my hair dryers.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have kinky curly 4a hair.&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a blow dryer that had a lot of power to dry my hair quicker and make my hair less frizzy. This blow dryer does a great job drying my hair faster and it makes my hair softer and straighter. It can get very hot. Lots of power. I like that it has four heat settings. Its also very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;a little heavier than I expected but its not too bad. Its four speeds but you have to play around with it to get the right speed that you want because you cant tell which is the low, medium, and high speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that I really like this blow dryer</li>
    <li> I have been using Conair since the early 70&#x27;s.  They are the best hair dryer on the market for the price.  You will not be unhappy at all with your purchase.</li>
    <li> This Conair Pro is one of the few hair dryers that still uses a squirrel cage blower fan. This type of fan puts out a lot more air than the prop style for the same noise level. This is a Pro quality dryer with a heavy duty motor so it weighs a little more than a regular unit. It does the job fast.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this hairdryer because all my hairdryers die within 2 years (and I do clean the lint trap!) so I paid 1/3 more than I usually pay for a hairdryer.  I researched a lot of different ones and settled on this one based on the claims that an AC motor lasts longer.  I also assumed that 2000 watts would mean a powerful airstream blowing into my hair.  Another reason I chose this one is because it looks like the old Conair that I had 20 years ago that lasted forever.  Well it is much heavier than that one, and it has a huge fan that sticks out of the back of the round part (you don&#x27;t see this in the photo).  It is bulky to use and the 8-foot cord is a pain if you don&#x27;t need one that long.  There is no cool heat setting, only warm and hot.  I wish I had bought the orange conair 529 Infiniti.  I held that one in my hand at Target, but they were out of stock.  It was much lighter than this one is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have bought this one at [...] instead of amazon, because it is so heavy that I know returning shipping will cost a bundle. Unfortunately Walmart does not carry it in the store where I could have tested the weight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this hair dryer could have been great.  I loved my Yellowbird but unfortunately, this Blackbird would not power on.  The original hair dryer got to me in a matter of days but the replacement was going to weeks so I had to cancel it and get a refund.  Bummer!</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this model to me.  She&#x27;s used them (and others) in salons for many years and mentioned this one as a sound hair dryer.  I needed one at school after I started growing my hair out again, so I looked online for this model.    PROS:  -Classic design/substantial housing: has the potential to last years  -Multiple heat settings and fan speeds  -longer cord than most (8 feet instead of 6 feet)  -Low noise (more like a whoosh than a wine: shouldn&#x27;t wake neighbors if you&#x27;re in a dorm/apartment situation)    CONS:  -Heat settings are distinctive but not straightforward nor precise      Overall, I feel like I got a very good product at a great price.  I would buy it again, though not if it doesn&#x27;t last.  I&#x27;ve only had it for two days and it seems to be doing well.</li>
    <li> I had another Conair that lasted about five years. It died after I dropped it one too many times. I wanted one just like it, and this was the closest match I could find. It is heavier, which took a little getting used to, but it is so powerful and dries my hair so fast, it is a good trade-off.</li>
    <li> Great dryer but the first one lasted a couple of months, the second died after about 5 blow drys! So listen to the other reviews, I didn&#x27;t and now I have to buy another dryer. Update: Tried a third, it died after 3 or so blow drys. Clearly defective model, it can&#x27;t handle it&#x27;s own heat.</li>
    <li> I bought the Conair Blackbird to replace a similar older model that I had for many years.  I know that there a lot of new-tech hair dryers out there. For my needs; I didn&#x27;t need the new technology.  I wanted to replace my old Conair with a powerful and modern version of the original.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the Blackbird.  I&#x27;m a male and only blow dry my hair a couple of times a week.  I don&#x27;t have to use the hottest setting and get great results at a lesser heat level.  The higher heat settings would be perfect for a woman with long hair.  This hair dryer is very powerful and I do a lot of styling on the cool setings as well.          This is the first time I&#x27;ve reviewed a product...I&#x27;m so pleased with the Blackbird that I wanted to share.  Starlight</li>
    <li> My wife has had Conair hair dryers in the past that have lasted many years. Old one finally died. Wanted the same pistol grip style so bought the Blackbird Pro, thinking it would last even longer. This one only lasted 19 months before the bearings went out and I am told by Conair it only has a 12 month warranty. Paid $30 for it, but was able to buy a different cheaper model at WalMart for $17 with a 24 month warranty. Go figure.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Lots of power&lt;br /&gt;2. Dries hair quickly&lt;br /&gt;3. Well built&lt;br /&gt;4. Long cord&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Uncomfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;2. Somewhat ackward temp switches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you \\&quot;live and die\\&quot; by your hair dryer, this may be a bit taxing after a long days work. But a true performer! Kind of miss the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button of my last dryer...</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted/needed...  I read the other reviews to make my decision,  they were right on,,,  Thank you</li>
    <li> This is by far the best blowdryer I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been using Conair&#x27;s Yellowbird for 33 years, since I was 13. After using the Blackbird, I am equally impressed (if not more). My 25 year old daughter is now a big fan as well. I highly recommend these blowdryers...as I said, by far the best!</li>
    <li> for the price i was not expecting the dryer to do much but turned out to love it and i am so glad i bought it!! i have \\&quot;very\\&quot; thick hair that takes forever to dry but with this dryer i can dry my hair in minutes!! very happy with my purchase....</li>
    <li> The Conair Blackbird is the best non-professional hair dryer out there. Multiple settings and 2000 watts make for fast drying without burning!</li>
    <li> I have had this dryer for a while now, and I am pleased to say that it dries my long hair really fast. There are numerous control settings to change the temperature from super hot to icy cold. I find the weight and design of this dryer to be comfortable, and it is quite sturdy. I have a basket of hair supplies under my bathroom counter and this poor dryer gets (not gently) tossed into the basket every morning when I&#x27;m done with it. It has taken my abuse without a scratch and continues to work like a charm.</li>
    <li> I received this hair dryer a while back and it works wonderfully!  I used to just let my hair air dry because most dryers just take too long.  This one dries quickly and I love the multiple settings.</li>
    <li> Im a hair dresser. This is the only dryer I willl use. Its got alot of power and heat. Best of all it&#x27;s light weight. Most of my clients have curly hair and come see me to blow out stright. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 10 years now. The only down fall is it only lasts just a little over a year. I put to good use and for the price. I don&#x27;t maid having to replace it. For at home use I&#x27;m sure it will last at longer.</li>
    <li> Even though this dryer is more sturdy than my previous Conair Euro 1600, it also weighs about twice as much and takes longer to dry my hair. While it does have a convenient lint trap that is easy to keep clean, it does not have a cool setting with sufficient velocity. All-in-all, not the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> hate it i got broke in 2 weeks ,never buy this one get something else so you are not stuck with something worthles.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer.  It&#x27;s up there with some of the $100 dryers I have purchased.  It isn&#x27;t whisper quiet, but it dries hair fairly quickly.  I love that it has four different heat settings.  I have long, super thick hair, so I need a strong dryer, and this definitely does the job.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer because it is strong and gets hair dried fast and helps staighten my wavy hair more than most others. This model is used at a very exclusive $alon in downtown Chicago that I&#x27;ve been to. My only complaint is that the dryer is heavy to handle and hold at angles. Yet the price is right. The lighter ones all seem to be over $100! Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been a hair stylist for 9 years and I absolutely love this blow dryer! It is the most powerful and the hottest dryer I have ever had. Works beautifully for African American hair. It just about Will be pressed out after a good blow dry. When this dryer stops working I&#x27;ll be buying it over and over again!</li>
    <li> After about 20 years of daily use and many minor repairs, my wife&#x27;s Conair finally bit the and we found this to be the closest replacement model. Other than being a little heavier than her original , it still has the features that she needs. Very happy with it - maybe it will last as long as the first one.</li>
    <li> The best feature on this hair dryer is the extra long cord. Very good hair dryer as well. This is the second one I am buying.  First one blew out after a couple of years. Even thinking about buying another one for my summer house.</li>
    <li> My wife uses her new hair dryer every chance she gets. She told me to buy the conair hair dryer because of it&#x27;s reputation of being dependable in a professional environment.</li>
    <li> Powerful blow dryer. I love it. I use it for my hair and I use it after giving my poodle and Maltese a bath. I highly recommend this blow dryer. Will purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I am super picky about my hair dryers.  And while this is not the best one I&#x27;ve ever had (my favorite was an 1875 watt Helen of Troy Professional that died several years ago), it&#x27;s not bad.  Unfortunately, in this day and age, the only dryers I can seem to find are ionic ones.  For me ionic dryers &#x3D; flat hair.  So, with the choices so limited, this dryer is decent.  I wish it had slow fan speed with high heat, but I can&#x27;t be too choosy at this point.</li>
    <li> Got it to replace my Yellowbird after 6 years! Very hot, and sturdy. I think it will make me just as happy as the Yellowbird!</li>
    <li> Awesome power, totally old school in a good way. When I use it, I feel like there should be disco music playing :) This was just what I wanted, I purchased TWO dryers previous to this and one was ceramic/ionizing and made my hair look flat and awful. The other I liked but it didn&#x27;t have the concentrated power from the smaller nozzle that I wanted. This dryer has both. Good purchase</li>
    <li> i am not picky on my driers, how ever the bigger i have always think the more strengh it has, so it is heavy, but i like it.</li>
    <li> I regret this purchased , 30 days and my dryer stop working.... Bad quality product , not worthy ... GET SOMTHING ELSE . I DONT KNOW HOW PEOPLE RATED SO HIGH</li>
    <li> Love the various heat settings and speed combinations. Light weight and easy to handle. I have natural hair and use it for my wash and goes.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at the beginning of June and three weeks later, it died.  Literally, stopped drying with heat and then slowly, little by little the item died.  I don&#x27;t have the box anymore so cannot ship the item back.  Not happy at all about having spend money on something that dies in less than a month. I do not believe that this is an authentic item, more than likely a cheap knockoff.  I&#x27;ve purchased this exact hairdryer before and it had a different cord and was much heavier than the one that just died.  Feeling ripped off and pissed off.  But there you go.  It&#x27;s always better to go from the ACTUAL manufacturer than trying to save a few pennies.  $38 down the drain.</li>
    <li> Had the yellow bird for many years and loved it, until it broke! Decided to replace it with the black bird and I am so happy with it! My yellow bird motor is still going strong, but after years of blow drying with the included pick I guess it was too much pressure and snapped! The yellow bird broke where the screws for the long part connected to the motor/handle part (you may want to go look at a picture to understand what I&#x27;m describing) anyway...the black bird does not have those sections screwed on as separate pieces, it&#x27;s actually a whole piece so that solves any future breaking problem. Looking forward to many beautiful blow drying years with the black bird :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should also mention I have thick curly hair and I use this to dry and straighten my hair every time I wash it. No one ever believes me that I don&#x27;t flat iron. That&#x27;s how great my hair looks, and all I use is a little serum and this dryer!</li>
    <li> i got this after my ConAir Yellowbird died on me after 3 years. it&#x27;s really powerful and blows out my natural textured black and puerto rican hair in half the time of a typical 1875 watt dryer. i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I have incredibly thick hair - in the winter I need to use a dryer and I can stand there FOREVER.  I got a gift card for Christmas (smart friend) and without any hesitation ordered this powerful dryer.  I no longer dread the drying process - wow - talk about powerful and fast!!!  Heavier than usual, I adjusted to its weight quickly - a bit louder than usual - FINE BY ME!!!  This wonderful dryer gets the job done and fast.  I am so so so happy with it that I may even use it during the Texas summers!  If you choose this model you will be a happy as I.  Grins to all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I wanted a powerful. non-ionic, non-tourmaline, non-ceramic hair dryer... which is almost impossible to find now, as I&#x27;m sure you realize if you&#x27;re looking at this!  I am VERY happy with it!  I only have a couple of small \\&quot;cons\\&quot;... one is that the dryer is fairly heavy, which I only may be noticing because I&#x27;m getting old!; the other is that it is slightly difficult to regulate the temperature to the level of \\&quot;warm\\&quot; I want... it&#x27;s not too bad, but is \\&quot;slightly\\&quot; warmer than I&#x27;d like.  If you, like me, are searching for a dryer of all the \\&quot;nons\\&quot; I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer I have ever owned, and they discontinued it, but luckily I was able to get it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;SO, I got 2 :-)</li>
    <li> The drier was selected for the 2000w rating (higher than the usual) and the alleged professional (durability implied) construction. It is not the quietest drier, but it IS extremely fast. My short hair is dry in under a minute. My wife&#x27;s very long hair is done in record time without over-heating. We operate it at full blast, the adjustment switches are only ornaments to us. The wide-spaced teeth of the comb accessory are particularly useful for long hair, fewer snarls and more fluff (body) to her hair. Nice. One other VERY thoughtful part of the design is placement of the air intake to the side. Driers with a rear mount intake seem more prone to gather lint etc., a leading cause of over-heating and failure no matter how vigilant the user. The side mount intake of the Pro is easy to clean, is easy to see (as a more obvious reminder to inspect) and (in our case) after weeks of use had only a 3/16\\&quot; square patch of debris. Remarkable.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is the greatest hair tool I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time. I can do my daughters hair now with ease and less pulling out of our thick curly hair!</li>
    <li> The best professioanl dryer. Old school in style and in power. Will dry your hair quickly. Cord is long and this makes it easy to plug in and reach in areas that don&#x27;t have a convenient outlet.</li>
    <li> I am a guy and have used Conair dryers for about 10 seconds a day for years. Lost my last one (about 10 years old) during a move. This thing is heavy and appears to have great bearings. The flip out side air filter on the intake side makes cleaning sucked in debris an easy chore.</li>
    <li> Our previous dryer lasted about 15 years before the bearings went out.  We have a wall mounted holder for the dryer that requires a more narrow 2\\&quot; diameter barrel, rather than the short - fat snouts popular now.  I chose the ConAir Pro Blackbird mainly for its ability to fit our holder.  It worked fine for the first 3 months, then the high speed setting quit, and we had a single speed with hot or cold air dryer.  Less than a year from the purchase date the power on/off switch now jams in the on position, requiring the unit to be unplugged to shut it off. It&#x27;s now in the trash.  I expected much better service from a \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; dryer.  Primarily, one person uses this dryer once a day; hardly a taxing load for any blow dryer. Also of note is that this machine carries no safety agency compliance labeling such as UL or CSA, which may have performance criteria for operator switches.</li>
    <li> I have used Conair for many years including 20 years as a professional stylist. I have not worked doing hair for may years -but when I needed to get a new dryer for my personal use at home I bought a blackbird. Mistake! The wiring burned up within 3 months with only 5 minutes a day of use. When I called Conair to see what could be done, they made the process sooooooo difficult that no one will actually do it. So they got my money but they will not get it again. I hope no one else will purchase Conair products either!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Blackbird in December of 2006 and now in April of 2011 smoke started coming out of the on-off switch, so I got a good 4 years out of it.    In this day and age when this product like others offer no warranty time at all I quess thats pretty good.</li>
    <li> With this black bird 2200 watt blow dryer and a good deep conditioner , I never will perm my hair again. This dryer presses out natural hair smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to use a heat protectant !</li>
    <li> The 2000 watts gives it the blowing power needed as well as generous air intake that doesn&#x27;t stifle it&#x27;s power.  The heating element is placed far enough back so the hair doesn&#x27;t get burnt.  Tough - I&#x27;ve dropped mine several times and it&#x27;s still up 40 blow dries a week. This one has been in daily service for a year and probably won&#x27;t break on it&#x27;s own ... leave that up to me - my favorite dryer for the past 12 years.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my father, I needed something super powerful, and not too girlie. It is perfect you could almost use this thing to power a sailboat! but it is kind of big and heavy.</li>
    <li> I share another reviewers comments about ionic dryers equaling flat hair; it&#x27;s really frustrating, yet it seems nearly all hairdryers these days are ionic.  This is my second blackbird as my first one only lasted about a year before the on off switch broke and I couldn&#x27;t fix it.  Again, my choices being limited, I decided to try another and my second one seems to be holding up better more than a year later.  I also wish this dryer had a slower speed with high heat but it doesn&#x27;t so I make due with what it has.</li>
    <li> Conair 2000 watt hair dryer is perfect. Transaction was smooth and quick. Excellent deal, durable product powerful and easy to use. Surprised when it arrived early next morning.</li>
    <li> got it fast and it works great. I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I would buy another here , if something happens to this dryer</li>
    <li> This product is not good.  When I first use this blow dryer it worked very well but after six months It stopped working.  I plugged it in and it wasn&#x27;t blowing but smelled like something was burning.  I would not recommend this  product.</li>
    <li> After my old hair dryer died, I decided to get this one because my mom has it. I had it for only two or three months before it started to make rattling noises when I used it. I would hit it, and the rattling would lessen. However, after a short while of this happening, I was drying my hair and it started to smell smoky. I decided to give up on it before it caught fire or something.&lt;br /&gt;If my mom didn&#x27;t have the same one that has been working perfectly fine for over a year, I would have rated this one star.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer because it handles my wavy hair however; I have gone through 3, in 1 1/2  years. So if you&#x27;re looking for a blower to last, pass this one bye.</li>
    <li> I love the power of this blowdryer, it is the only one that works for me, I have tried others and there is a big difference, I am glad that I was able to find this one, they are not easy to find.  Thank you for having it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It has great power and capabilities.  Much better than anything I&#x27;ve found in drug stores.</li>
    <li> It takes a long time to dry very long, thick hair like mine, so a dryer with a heavy duty AC motor is a must.  It might be a bit heavy, but it works well and should last a while.</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is amazing. My sylist uses it in my hair and I had to buy it for my home. It works for me and my daughter with ease. A must buy.</li>
    <li> Best Hairdryer going. Big powerfull, lasts yaears and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is about teh third one I have purchased and I hope they keep making them..</li>
    <li> I read a recommendation for the Conair Yellow Bird on a web site whose ratings I trust, but when I saw that this black one was more powerful, I just went for it.  So far, it has worked well.  And I must say that when you turn it on high, it really means HIGH.  On medium setting, it puts out almost the same amount of airflow as my previous dryer (1800 watts) cranked up full blast.  It dries my hair in about 2/3rds of the time.  Of course, it doesn&#x27;t ionize my hair, but I don&#x27;t mind.  When I used an ionic dryer, my fine hair was shiny but limp, even though my hair is colored.  This dryer leaves the cuticle just a little bit roughed up, so now I don&#x27;t have to use as much styling product to give my hair some body.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a Conair Blackbird dryer from several years ago.  The new dryer does not have the same features as the old one.  The old dryer had better control of heat and power.  This dryer although I have it set for warm, gets very hot and often feels as if it is burning my hair.  It does not compare with the old dryer.</li>
    <li> loved yellow bird, now black bird also! they are both great hair dryers and they last a long time without problems.</li>
    <li> Good performance in that it has lots of air blowing power but that only occurs at its highest heat setting. Lower the heat setting and you also get lower blowing speeds. Also no option for cold only drying. Unfortunately the low heat and cold only settings are what I use the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be quieter than my old dryer but when I ran them side by side the Conair made much more noise. Checked it against my wife and daughters dryer and it is noisier than those models too. Conair should stop claiming its quiet or even better, actually make it quiet.</li>
    <li> Even more powerful than the Yellow Bird I&#x27;d owned for over 10 years, seems lighter too. Super happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Update 7/5/2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning for 4 months, the power switch got stuck and stopped working. That NEVER happened with my Yellow Bird. I now have scotch tape holding the power switch in place so i can actually use it, guess I&#x27;ll be ordering another, seeing as I&#x27;m past the return period :/</li>
    <li> I have been extremely happy with all the items that I have purchased.  The item is as described and arrived in just 2 days, how terrific.  This is a wonderful way to shop.</li>
    <li> The only hair dryer manufactured with the vents on the side.  This is essential for my work, the newer backk vent ones are worthless to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for over 10 years (or close)! It has the best power and can get my hair straight or can diffuse it exactly how I want it with the settings. Will continue buying if anything ever happens to it!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was exactly what I wanted. Feels very substantial. Great quality and works beautifully. And it even arrived much earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service.</li>
    <li> I had a Conair YellowBird Pro which is an awesome dryer. I had it for so many years the styling pick had developed a crack. Thought I would upgrade, and this BlackBird seemed like a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad dryer. I&#x27;m thankful it is 2000 Watts. But, it doesn&#x27;t seem to move the air as strong as my YellowBird does. It seems a little underpowered, I&#x27;m still going to search for perhaps a 2200 Watt dryer, if I can find one. I want a dryer that has more power, not necessarily more heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat settings are good- the highest heat is quite hot. I use the second-highest setting. It&#x27;s nice to also have a no-heat setting. But the no-heat only works on low power, with is useless. Next time, I&#x27;ll make sure that I get the Conair that has the Cool-shot button that cuts the heat while keeping the speed high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad dryer- does the job, and certainly better that the 1875 Watt piece of junk you get at the drugstore. Consider a different model if airspeed is important to you.</li>
    <li> The Blackbird and its Yellow counterpart seem to be becoming the last of an unfortunately dying breed of hairdryer -- what I call, for lack of a better description, \\&quot;Squirrel Cage\\&quot; driers. These are dryers that utilize the barrel fan design rather than the propeller fans that almost every other drier seems to employee these days. Not only do they seem to move air more efficiently, but they tend to emit a lower-frequency, and therefore much less annoying noise when in operation, and, at least in my experience, last longer. I will keep insisting on nothing but these driers as long as they are still available. It is absolutely worth the difference to me.</li>
    <li> My first hair dryer was a Conair pistol style just like this one over 30 years ago. I was very happy with it I and am glad to say this one meets my expectations with the volume of air flow and 4 temperature settings. My wife and two daughters love it too. Since hair dryers seem to change so often and the one you want is no longer available by the time you need it, I have purchased a 2nd Conair Pro Blackbird just to have it on hand.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Very high volume of air. Good heat control. Easy to hold.  Seems to be very high quality  blow dryer.</li>
    <li> works wonderful. gets hot and drys very fast. shipped fast, Would buy another one if I had to. If you need heat to your hair you wont go wrong purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> This is my second Blackbird.  I had the first one for 10 years before it gave out.  I have very thick hair and it takes about 20 minutes of drying to style and dry my hair.  I&#x27;m hoping I have this one as long as the first one.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and go through blow dryers quite frequently. I am always upset when I have to spend so much($75+) on something I know I will have to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this dryer has been WONDERFUL! I have had it much longer than I have had any other blow dryer. Also I can rest easy knowing that if I do have to replace it it is well within a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Conair!</li>
    <li> I love the blow dryer it works great. it was a little heavier than I thought it would be but is great.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product to me! Works flawlessly. Drys my hair quickly and the attachments are great!! Love it!!</li>
