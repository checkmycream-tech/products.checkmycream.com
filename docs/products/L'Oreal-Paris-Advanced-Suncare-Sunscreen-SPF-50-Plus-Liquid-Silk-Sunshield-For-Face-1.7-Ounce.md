      <li>Once absorbed it is perfect.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen!  </li>
      <li>I wear a SPF 15 sunscreen every day that absorbs into my skin nicely.  </li>
      <li>and then you can add your own makeup with no problem.  </li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and burn easily, so I use it under makeup.</li>
      <li>Great sun protection, perfect size to carry even in a small bag.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel soooo smooth!</li>
      <li>When I recently went for a skin check, she was very impressed with my skin.</li>
      <li>Goes on nice and smooth without being greasy.</li>
      <li>I feel like it did make my face sweat a bit more, but I experience that with all sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>Very light and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I love the light consistency for using under foundation.</li>
      <li>It is very runny, as has been mentioned, but feels good on the skin...not greasy like some sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>Its non-greasy, applies easily and seems to protect.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t make this mistake because it is easy to do.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy it goes all the way into the skin</li>
      <li>It is almost like a light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Great cheaper alternative to Kiehls Super Fluid or La Roche-Posay Anthelios Ultra Light Sunscreen.</li>
      <li>/&gt;HOWEVER...once it has been applied, my face looks entirely greasy--the shine is remarkable.</li>
      <li>Light feel that is just mildly greasy.  </li>
      <li>Sunscreen is a must for me, as I am extremely fair skinned, burn easily, and have lots of previous sun damage.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy and has a light, pleasant smell typical for sunscreens that disappears moments after application.</li>
      <li>So light and not white like most sunscreens</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely, does not leave a white film, and contains SPF 50 for those days when I am at beach.  </li>
      <li>Worth a try if you are looking for a sunscreen for your face.</li>
      <li>After having used it for quite some time, I do think that my skin is seems good for my age: minimal wrinkles and age spots, etc.</li>
      <li>Soaks right in and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Absorbs right in.</li>
      <li>It is very light and apparently does protect my face from the sun.  </li>
      <li>But after seeing how much you need-its adequate.</li>
      <li>This is my second purchase of this one which is my favorite face sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Since I have brown skin, the invisibility of good facial sun protection is critical.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s very liquid.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine why L&#x27;Oreal would discontinue such an effective product and hope they bring it back.</li>
      <li>This lotion goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy sunscreen feeling on your face.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist instructed me last year to start wearing SPF 50 due to my fair skin and earlier damage.</li>
      <li>I previously used a product from Ahava, but it is no longer available.</li>
      <li>Most SPFs over a 30 produce a white mask on my face, which is entirely unacceptable (since I am not a professional clown).</li>
      <li>and I have used many, equal to La-Roche Posay&#x27;s at half the price,has a silky touch yet not greasy and can wear under tinted moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It lasts all day as far as I can see.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t put it to the test with prolonged direct sun exposure though.</li>
      <li>Almost liquid out of the bottle and absorbs completely.</li>
      <li>However, it is difficult to find a higher SPF that goes on nice without leaving a white film.</li>
      <li>My new regular sunscreen</li>
      <li>It disappears completely and I rely on it and wear it daily.  </li>
      <li>For the first time in my entire life, I returned from a beach vacation without looking like a lobster due to sunburn.  </li>
      <li>Go back to the old bottle or a different bottle/box like before.</li>
      <li>The consistency of this is quite thin, but it spreads easily and there is no whiteness to it once rubbed in.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s thin and isn&#x27;t especially fragranced,  does leave a slight sheen</li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t break me out or feel heavy on my skin.  </li>
<li> I usually solve this problem by dabbing away the excess oil with a tissue.</li>
<li> It usually does not form lines of sunscreen buildup on my neck.</li>
<li> Bottle is small, and around $10-$12</li>
<li> I had read negative comments on the size but didn&#x27;t find it that small.  </li>
<li> No more breaking out from sunblock!</li>
<li> The BB is tinted a crazy, bizarre orange and looked AWFUL!  </li>
<li> The size was shocking (it&#x27;s small).</li>
<li> I&#x27;m shocked.</li>

    <li> Perfect sunscreen .. love it</li>
    <li> Enjoy it goes all the way into the skin and then you can add your own makeup with no problem.  I had read negative comments on the size but didn&#x27;t find it that small.  Have not used it during a day in the sun but I have faith it will work.</li>
    <li> This a wonderful product.  I use it every morning under my makeup. It lasts all day as far as I can see.  When I went to our granddaughters graduation we had to sit outside in the Sun! I was the only one without a sunburn on my face, neck and chest.  Soaks right in and not greasy.  I have oily skin so it is not a problem.  I hope they don&#x27;t do away with it!!</li>
    <li> Great cheaper alternative to Kiehls Super Fluid or La Roche-Posay Anthelios Ultra Light Sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen!  It truly does disappear on your skin and is moisturing enough that I don&#x27;t require a separate lotion. My dermatologist instructed me last year to start wearing SPF 50 due to my fair skin and earlier damage. When I recently went for a skin check, she was very impressed with my skin. This sunscreen is the only product change I have made. I highly recommend it, wear it year round, and never go outside without wearing it. I can&#x27;t imagine why L&#x27;Oreal would discontinue such an effective product and hope they bring it back.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is matte! Non-greasy formula that&#x27;s very liquid. It&#x27;s perfect for putting under, over, or without makeup. It doesn&#x27;t make my face look sweaty or my makeup slide off. It also doesn&#x27;t break me out or feel heavy on my skin.  This is my second purchase of this one which is my favorite face sunscreen. Just wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Light feel that is just mildly greasy.  Once absorbed it is perfect. Great sun protection.  Well needed for someone who lives in Houston.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife. She likes it a lot. Its non-greasy, applies easily and seems to protect. You only need a little amount to cover your face. The size was shocking (it&#x27;s small). But after seeing how much you need-its adequate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen and its preceding versions for years.  I am fair skinned and burn easily, so I use it under makeup. It is almost like a light moisturizer. It disappears completely and I rely on it and wear it daily.  After having used it for quite some time, I do think that my skin is seems good for my age: minimal wrinkles and age spots, etc. compared to my one-year-younger sister who uses only makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Accidentally, I once bought the BB cream because the bottles now look so similar.  The BB is tinted a crazy, bizarre orange and looked AWFUL!  Don&#x27;t make this mistake because it is easy to do.  This Sunscreen is the good one, and you will like it.&lt;br /&gt;Just one point: The other L&#x27;Oreal sunscreens appear to be marketed to people who want protection while laying on the beach sunbathing or going swimming, while fair-skinned people like me want protection in our daily lives, like driving and going to the market.  We are two different populations, and this product is the one I use summer AND winter because the exposure to UV is cumulative.&lt;br /&gt;Note to L&#x27;Oreal: The bottles look too similar and it is easy to grab the wrong one.  Go back to the old bottle or a different bottle/box like before.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for the face. Very light and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Great sun protection, perfect size to carry even in a small bag. I only try it at the beach, reapplied after I went into the water and it works well.</li>
    <li> I wear a SPF 15 sunscreen every day that absorbs into my skin nicely.  However, it is difficult to find a higher SPF that goes on nice without leaving a white film. However, this product does just that.  It goes on nicely, does not leave a white film, and contains SPF 50 for those days when I am at beach.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> No more breaking out from sunblock! My new regular sunscreen</li>
    <li> I have struggled since I was a kid to find a sunscreen to use on my face that didn&#x27;t burn/tingle on my skin or sting my eyes by running constantly.  I bought this sunscreen for a trip to the Caribbean.  Sunscreen is a must for me, as I am extremely fair skinned, burn easily, and have lots of previous sun damage.  I am really happy with this purchase.  It is very runny, as has been mentioned, but feels good on the skin...not greasy like some sunscreens.  I feel like it did make my face sweat a bit more, but I experience that with all sunscreens.  I used this product on my face religiously and when out hiking or on the beach also wore a hat with SPF.  For the first time in my entire life, I returned from a beach vacation without looking like a lobster due to sunburn.  Yay!</li>
    <li> I love the light consistency for using under foundation. It usually does not form lines of sunscreen buildup on my neck. With using SPF 15 or plus foundation and this sunscreen,I feel I am giving my face good sun protection.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy sunscreen feeling on your face.  Absorbs right in. Good protection at beach.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice and smooth without being greasy. Great to wear under face powder. The only negative thing is the bottle is tiny at 1.7 oz.</li>
    <li> Excellent, the best sunscreen I have ever used! Thank you Loreal and please keep producing the product!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the perfect sun block and for me, this is it.  It&#x27;s thin and isn&#x27;t especially fragranced,  does leave a slight sheen but I think of it as &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;. I can now use my Retin-a regularly and not worry about further sun damage</li>
    <li> So light and not white like most sunscreens</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this sunscreen.  It is very light and apparently does protect my face from the sun.  Worth a try if you are looking for a sunscreen for your face.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel soooo smooth!</li>
    <li> Since I have brown skin, the invisibility of good facial sun protection is critical. Most SPFs over a 30 produce a white mask on my face, which is entirely unacceptable (since I am not a professional clown). This little bottle of reasonably priced sunscreen goes a long way, and the thin, white liquid is absolutely invisible on my brown face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER...once it has been applied, my face looks entirely greasy--the shine is remarkable. I usually solve this problem by dabbing away the excess oil with a tissue. Now the only question is: am I dabbing away the sun protection altogether? I haven&#x27;t burned at the beach, so I guess it still protects.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for the face that I have found and I have used many, equal to La-Roche Posay&#x27;s at half the price,has a silky touch yet not greasy and can wear under tinted moisturizer.  despite watery consistency a little goes a long way .</li>
    <li> Whoa! This IS sheer and silky. I&#x27;m shocked. Not greasy at all. Almost liquid out of the bottle and absorbs completely. No slimy feel. Didn&#x27;t feel like anything. Just soaked in and gone. I haven&#x27;t put it to the test with prolonged direct sun exposure though.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn this as a sunscreen alone, but I wear it daily under my makeup. I had a spot of skin cancer on my jaw in 2008 and wear sunscreen religiously. I previously used a product from Ahava, but it is no longer available. The consistency of this is quite thin, but it spreads easily and there is no whiteness to it once rubbed in. Not greasy and has a light, pleasant smell typical for sunscreens that disappears moments after application. Bottle is small, and around $10-$12 but you need only a bit.</li>
