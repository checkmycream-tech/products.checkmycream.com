<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not work at all!!! Waste of money</li>
    <li> This product from my experience does not work, and its called hot cream but it stays cold the hold time you have it on. i have switched to a better product.</li>
    <li> The cream isn&#x27;t hot and the directions on the side have spelling errors</li>
    <li> Nothing hot about it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference while using this product and I guess I should&#x27;ve none better. I know I sound like a broken record, but you need to change your diet and excersise. I don&#x27;t think I will try any other products from this company.</li>
    <li> Im using this account to write this comment,. Anyways,  im 13 years old and i used this cream for a weak and I&#x27;ve seen results, i know its not. miracle cream thoo, but it doesnt get hot at all but ive seen some changes .. buy u need to do a diet to get better results :3</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work like it said it would I didn&#x27;t loose anything around my stomach or waist. So want to know what happen!</li>
    <li> Great product, I use it in the am before a work out really works when you are faithful user.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money  not even a tingle.. use this as a skin cream ... what a jip-off then to return the item it cost more to return than to buy it</li>
    <li> It was affordable.It was listed with natural ingredients.It was easy to use and no mess or smell. I liked it</li>
    <li> These product don&#x27;t work at all waste your money if you want it&#x27;s a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> I paid 9.45 for this \\&quot;hot cream.\\&quot; Not hot. Very sticky. I have other hot products i use n THEY ARE hot. THEY work. I will not buy this product again n i will not recommend this to ANYONE</li>
    <li> Sorry but no cigar! Dont waste your time.  I worked out and dieted and this cream did nothing.  I didnt feel anything either, total flop</li>
    <li> I was super excited to try this \\&quot;hot\\&quot; cream...well let me say that i dont feel the hot sensation what i do feel is none stop itching!! is been an hour after i applied it and im still itching..they said to apply it at night well now i caint get no sleep..as to if it works?? dont know and i guess i will not find out cause there is no way im doing this again tomorrow night...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this cream really works</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work sorry, I didn&#x27;t like it all because, I didn&#x27;t see anything happening 4 me. Used both cream cold &amp; hot.</li>
    <li> Works Like It Says. I Use It With The McDavid Waist Trimmer !</li>
    <li> Anything that help lose the tummy fat. just got it It does make my tummy area warm,  I let you know if it does work.</li>
    <li> I always get things from Amazon.com and I never leave a feedback but I have been using this cream for over a month now and I truly see the difference. Ive brought 2 jars and I am on my third one now. Ive been using it on my stomach and I see change lot.  You have to use it 3 times a day. Mornings afternoons and nighttime. It also helps if you wrap yourself with plastic saran wrap and sleep in it over night but just like any product you have to use it constantly and more than likely use 2 or 3 bottles before you see results.</li>
    <li> This jar came to me open already, it looked like it had been opened and dripping out the jar</li>
    <li> great product happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have started using this product, but its good to know products such as this can be ordered from the comfort of my home.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough. To notice if it works or not</li>
    <li> Sucks. Doesn&#x60;t work..don&#x60;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It does not feel hot. Not even warm. A cold jelly like cream. Thats it. Does not work at all. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I recently started using, therefore its too soon to give an opinion.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t rub it in till its dry! Leave it a little wet, then you can feel it being hot. It drys on its own</li>
    <li> I was expected feel more hot. It just a little bit.</li>
    <li> No good waist of money didn&#x27;t nothing for me!!</li>
    <li> I SCORED THIS GEL LOW BECAUSE WHEN I APPLYED IT TO MY MIDD SECTION, I FELT SO AWFUL PHYSICALLY, I HAD TO LAY DOWN AND IT MADE ME FEEL SO STRANGE THAT I CAN NOT EXPLAIN</li>
    <li> I tried this cream for little less than a week and I noticed a difference and my kids noticed a difference in the reduction of fat on my tummy, I am a mother of five, but what I have been doing in stead of rubbing the cream and &amp;#34;magically &amp;#34; thinking the fat will just melt away, I rub the cream on and I exercise, and you can feel the heat sensation. I will continue to buy this product. The cream and 100 ab crunches a day is working for me.</li>
    <li> the product was very helpful and its all gone will tell others about the product and recommend for them to purchase.</li>
    <li> Well this cream was blah, matter of fact I Kind of dropped it on the floor with the lid off, and was glad so it can get close to finished as possible. It was not hot what so ever, I didn&#x27;t see any toning going on, I gave one star cause of the so called natural ingredients in it, so I wont be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I only used it for a week, it did tighten the skin in different areas. It did not get hot as the name suggested, but it did work. I wanted something that would warm up more.</li>
    <li> It wasnt really that hot like they said&lt;br /&gt;But i can see a difference</li>
    <li> It smiles like Vicks vapor rub, but not greasy like vicks,But I&#x27;m putting it on when I exercise and sleep waiting for results haven&#x27;t seen it yet but waiting!!</li>
    <li> This product is not good at all, I only tried it because I had an online credit.. i gave 1 star because i had to, I&#x27;m going back to preperationH &amp; my waist garment during woekouts, it actually works!!</li>
    <li> First of all it is not hot.  Secondly, it does not do what it claims to do.  I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Is a scam, did nothing of what is promised</li>
    <li> I really think it has worked. I do plan on buying more in the up coming weeks. Thanks so much!!!!</li>
    <li> When I received this it was in a little plastic cover. When I slid the cover off to open it the sealed cover wasn&#x27;t sealed so was kind of nervous to use it. Really wondering why it was open but not going to figure out why or put it on my skin. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> Waste of money, should have just stuck to sweat band belt</li>
    <li> Absolute waste of money... Product was nothing as advertised.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; This is really good... And it works too!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great stuff but it does not get hot at all like some creams do. If you measure yourself when using this product you will loss inches even if it does not get hot. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Maybe that is how it&#x27;s supposed to be,but i simply dont like it at all.Also maybe the tummy patch i bought wasn&#x27;t fit for this type of cream.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used american natuarl hot cream in a while. But when I did it also helped fade stretch marks. Going to stat using this product again. Wish me luck! Lol</li>
    <li> I received it before time,,,,love it</li>
    <li> ive only has the prod. for abt 2wks, but I can see a slight difference. some ppl r saying on there reviews that u need to wrap urself w/it and that it only last 1wk. that&#x27;s not true! I hv plenty  left in my jar. it doesn&#x27;t take much(don&#x27;t over do it) and it dissolves into ur skin w/in 30mins which was nice for me. its not hot tho, it has a cooling sensation when u apply it. Although last night my belly did feel extremely warm. So maybe its really starting to work through my system. im pretty sure that I will see a major change by the time I finish the jar. I was kinda skeptical at first because it just seems crazy that something as simple as a cream could do this, but its working. And since abdominal fat is the hardest fat to loose im gonna remain patient and stick to it!...Hope this helps someone!</li>
    <li> The Product is great, works well.  Helps you burn off the fat BUT it makes you itch like crazy which interrupts your sleep.  I hated to stop using it but the itching was keeping me up half the night.  I am an earlier rising and have a long drive in the mornings so I had to stop using.  If they could do something abt what makes you itch in the product i would start using it again.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of the reviews it received. it did nothing for me. perhaps I expected too much but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> im on my first jar and using it periodicly but smells similar to ben gay lol but found that wrapping my calves and stomach are in plastic intensifies the heat like fire but my legs and stomach are soaked in sweat after 20 minutes on the treadmill so far it does get hot but im trying different techniques next im gonna wrap with it on over nite for a week and we shall see</li>
    <li> This cream is CRAP!!----DO NOT BUY!!---IT SMELLS LIKE BEN GAY!!---DOES NOT GET HOT NOT EVEN WARM!!---AND IT BROKE MY SKIN OUT REAL BAD!!!</li>
    <li> it reminds me of icy hot really and the smell i didnt enjoy but waiting to see it work um</li>
    <li> I used this just for one week an seen results. I would rub on an put my waistcincher on an then do light work outs. I only worked out every other night but put the cream on in the morning an before bed. I highly recommend it to every one! Very good product in my opinion an I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This product surprised me by  high quality and excellent price!&lt;br /&gt;Has  fast results with the help of exercises.&lt;br /&gt;The skin absorbs very fast, the that  indicates a very  good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price, high quality, it makes the  that  promises!&lt;br /&gt;Note 10!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my stomach a little. it was a waste of money. all it did was make my stomach feel like slime. it says to put on at night and that&#x27;s what I did. don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> does not work it dont make u sweat i will switch to a different product DO NOT WASTE UR DOUGH i even cover my nutz and my dingaling and felt noda</li>
    <li> I like this one best it seems to be helping more than the other ones and it is more conveinent to use at night</li>
    <li> terrible damage my skin</li>
    <li> I am still in the process of using it will give my comments when I get some results...</li>
    <li> unlike any other reviews,I don&#x27;t feel itchy ,maybe they have alergyes or something .it has a poor label but I&#x27;ve being using the product and has being working for me ..I will let you know what happens after a month.people you gotta admit is very cheap.can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I just used this product once, and I wouldn&#x27;t say I really felt a \\&quot;Warming\\&quot; or \\&quot;hot\\&quot; sensation on my legs, but I do feel a slight one on my stomach and sides. I wouldn&#x27;t consider buying this product if you think that this is all you need to eliminate cellulite or fat. With a decent workout regimen I believe this product may tighten skin. I&#x27;m not sure yet but I will update when I begin seeing results. It does have a light smell that some may not like. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what it smells like but It&#x27;s slightly like menthol. Also on the label It says it contains cinnamon extract. Just a warning to those allergic. Don&#x27;t forget, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very hot &amp; you don&#x27;t need to use allot!!! Easy to apply &amp; use before worm up&#x27;s!  I like it:)</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t do much, sorry</li>
    <li> it did not work at all this was a lie! false advertisement!</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive but not if your buying multiple creams just because the one you have purchased all ready did not work. I would not recommend wasting your money. Save it for a tummy tuck.</li>
    <li> does not get hot at all</li>
    <li> It kind of work that&#x27;s why I went ahead and order again</li>
    <li> The product is a waste of money it does not get hot when you apply it and they won&#x27;t refund your money if it&#x27;s already open. How will a person know if it works if they don&#x27;t apply. It&#x27;s bs don&#x27;t waste your time buying this!</li>
    <li> It makes you sweat as stated but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do any justice for me at all.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of time ,,, I filed a claim to get my money back. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.very disappointed</li>
    <li> This product actually works.</li>
    <li> If I could give this a negative star I would.  Waste of money. DO NOT PURCHASE</li>
    <li> this is stuff is not worth it</li>
    <li> i didnt like this product it wasnt what i was looking for. i expected the product to actually heat up where ever i put it on my body and it didnt. i couldnt tell any difference so its just another wasted product but thanks anyway. would not order it again nor reccommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> this cream does get your tummy, thighs, arms heated. i like it .would purchase it again in a stronger strenght.feel like a moisturizer. really soft on your skin. does not irritate.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not hot, I even rap my self and still was not hot</li>
    <li> I just started using this product a few days ago.I feel tingling sensations if anything,so I WILL use til it&#x27;s all gone,and then write another review with any results of the fat burning promise this product makes.I can say however, I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;itching&amp;#34; like others have said they experienced with this product.It does however,smell just like Vicks vapor rub,and if it does work out, I may just go out and buy the Vicks and use that.Same ingredients.Til then.....I&#x27;ll keep you posted.....</li>
    <li> I love this product. When i apply it i can feel it just work its magic. I lost 8 pounds since i had it. I am gonna get more and stock up on it.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.iv use it over a week now and it has yet to get hot and I&#x27;m active all day long no result if you work hard for your money keep it in your pocket cause this cream is a waste of time and money I&#x27;ve even forgot it was on me and got into the tanning bed and it still doesn&#x27;t get hot</li>
    <li> I always use the hot cream because I find it more effective than the cold creams.  I just wish it were a bit more potent</li>
    <li> Smell like Ben gay  but no results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 2 weeks and I really see the difference. My stomach feels tighter and smaller. Great product for the money!</li>
    <li> Would&#x27;ve gave no stars. Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> It make me sweat a lot.Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this hot cream it helped me out a lot it helped me lose inches on my thighs hips and especially my wast.</li>
    <li> Nothing hot about it. Didn&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> works as advertised, its hot</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
    <li> American natural hot cream does not get hot.. This product is just a greasy mess.. Needs to be removed and replaced with something else</li>
