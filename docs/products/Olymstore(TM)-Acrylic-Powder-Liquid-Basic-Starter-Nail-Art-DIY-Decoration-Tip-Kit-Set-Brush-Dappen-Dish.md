      <li>The powders are great but the pink could be a bit darker IMO.</li>
      <li>NOT A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT, BUT GOOD FOR PRACTICE</li>
      <li>The white powder tends to clump up when I use it, but the clear and pink work just great!</li>
      <li>i got this in the mail the other day and judging by the picture you would thing they would be nice size containers</li>
      <li>Everything came in one peice which was nice, but that bag had a little damage done to it...</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price considering you get a decent amount of product.</li>
      <li>The bottles r so small wish they was a little bigger but great value for the price</li>
      <li>Its a little stinky, but it arrived way before I expected which is a huge plus!</li>

<li> the pink isn&#x27;t really pink but a clear with a slight tint of pink.</li>
<li> It had a little bit of holes in one area, but thankfully nothing was affected.</li>
<li> but they are so small and a little bit of product so you could use it about 5 times</li>
<li> The liquid works like you would expect it to, however the brush that is included is horrible.</li>
