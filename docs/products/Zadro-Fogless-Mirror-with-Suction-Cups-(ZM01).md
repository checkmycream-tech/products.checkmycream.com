### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a very good product.</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>It looked nice when I got it</li>
      <li>I have used these mirrors for many years, and have one in each shower for shaving.</li>
      <li>The one that I got at the dollar store was a better quality than this mirror.</li>
      <li>many times to clean the wall and face of mirror--</li>
      <li>Service and shipping was easy.</li>
      <li>The mirror is fine however, one of the suction cups fell off.  </li>
      <li>Does not stay on shower wall or stay fog free.</li>
      <li>Mirror frame is made of light weight plastic.</li>
      <li>reflective surface is ok but the whole thing is made of light</li>
      <li>They can fog up during a shower, but a splash of water clears it right up.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Has 4 suctions which work pretty well.</li>
      <li>I think the suction would be much better on a smooth surface, such as a larger bathroom mirror, so this may not be an issue for some.</li>
      <li>Tried this mirror on shower wall and it sticks really well, also works really well.</li>
      <li>It fogged from the very beginning of use and its stained with water marks almost immidiately</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really work for applying makeup.  </li>
      <li>Prefect size, very clear.</li>
      <li>Now he can take a steamy shower and still see to shave without wiping down the whole room first!</li>
      <li>It is fixed now</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this shower mirror.</li>
      <li>, I put it back in the frame and the third time it fell breaking the frame.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money as it&#x27;s flimsy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is unfortunate because Z-Fogless products are usually so good.</li>
      <li>Over time, however, the mirror did show fogginess, and it became necessary to splash water on the surface to clear it.</li>
      <li>the suction cups are too small to hold the mirror in place for more than a few minutes.</li>

    <li> I have used these mirrors for many years, and have one in each shower for shaving. They are small and unobtrusive, yet functional. They can fog up during a shower, but a splash of water clears it right up. The suction cups are a little small, and the mirror has fallen off on occasion. Only once did it break, not the mirror itself (which isn&#x27;t even rigid), but the plastic frame.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. Exactly as described. Has 4 suctions which work pretty well. My boyfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> I used this mirror for several weeks in my shower, and the initial results were very much as expected. Over time, however, the mirror did show fogginess, and it became necessary to splash water on the surface to clear it. Additionally, the suction cups would lose their grip, and the mirror crashed to the shower floor. After about three falls, the plastic frame was rendered useless, so I tried to keep just the mirror glass in the shower, sitting in a shower caddy. That did not last long, and I have since discontinued using this product. I think the suction would be much better on a smooth surface, such as a larger bathroom mirror, so this may not be an issue for some.</li>
    <li> This small mirror works very well in the shower.</li>
    <li> Mirror frame is made of light weight plastic. Only a dab of glue to hold the actual mirror to the frame. the suction cups are too small to hold the mirror in place for more than a few minutes. The fogless property lasted for one shower.&lt;br /&gt;It fell off my tile wall 3 times the second time the mirror came out of the frame, I put it back in the frame and the third time it fell breaking the frame.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money as it&#x27;s flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;The reflective surface is ok but the whole thing is made of light plastic.&lt;br /&gt;The company Showerdoordirect.com told me Amazon would give a refund for the mirror.</li>
    <li> Does not stay on shower wall or stay fog free. Hoped this mirror would be usefull while shaving in shower.&lt;br /&gt;Tried many times to clean the wall and face of mirror--</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because he&#x27;s a foot taller than me so my mirror was set too low for him. Now he can take a steamy shower and still see to shave without wiping down the whole room first! LOL</li>
    <li> No good, mirror is not glued to frame</li>
    <li> It only lasted for 55 days and had to be replaced.  Too bad for us.  This is unfortunate because Z-Fogless products are usually so good.</li>
    <li> Prefect size, very clear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like looking at yourself in aluminum foil. I definitely can&#x27;t shave with it... Major waste.</li>
    <li> ... finally gave up before inevitably walking into broken glass on the bathtub floor.  Anti-fog kinda works, but doesn&#x27;t do anything about anti splash...</li>
    <li> The mirror is fine however, one of the suction cups fell off.  It is fixed now so we will see what happens.</li>
    <li> It looked nice when I got it but the heat of the shower is causing the mirror coating on the back to slowly come off.  I&#x27;ll have to replace it in a few months.  The last one I bought lasted 11 years.  This is a poor purchase and not worthwhile.</li>
    <li> do not wate your money on this mirror. It fogged from the very beginning of use and its stained with water marks almost immidiately</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this shower mirror. The one that I got at the dollar store was a better quality than this mirror. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Tried this mirror on shower wall and it sticks really well, also works really well. I would recommend this mirror to anyone. Service and shipping was easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was thinking when I purchased this mirror but it doesn&#x27;t really work for applying makeup.  I believe that it&#x27;s meant for the shower and I don&#x27;t need nor use one in the shower.  It went in the drawer.</li>
    <li> It sticks to the surface well.  I have not checked out it&#x27;s fog resistance.  Other than that it works as advertized.</li>
