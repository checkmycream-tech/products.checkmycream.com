      <li>I am able to use my moisturizer right after as well.</li>
      <li>and it was love at first touch.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves skin smooth.</li>
      <li>The bottle was 1/2 full.</li>
      <li>Prior to this I&#x27;ve been using separate C and Hyaluronic serums, as part of my regime, with good results.</li>
      <li>was delighted to know this product made such a noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>

      <li>I love these products, they feel like they really get absorbed into the skin.</li>

      <li>and it is dewy fresh looking all day.</li>
      <li>This is a nice light serum that easily sinks into my skin.</li>
      <li>If I lean in real close to the mirror, there is but a trace of those familiar lines</li>
      <li>Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Peptidesfollow has been a great little helper and has all but erased the crow’s-feet cropping up along the outer edges of my eyes.</li>
      <li>Very overpriced and rarely a full bottle.  </li>
      <li>Peptides is a thick serum that comes in a beautifully packaged bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily and my skin is soft and bright.</li>
      <li>and I like that very much.</li>
      <li>Since becoming a mom, I have been more conscious about a lot of things, and when it comes to my appearance I am highly aware of where my skin is starting to show signs of aging.</li>
      <li>I am a serum user and try everything from the top to the middle in terms of product and price.  </li>
      <li>Only time will tell but I suspect I will see even more results and will continue to purchase this item.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my skin soft and smooth, like this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 43 and should have been taking better care of my skin when I was younger.</li>
      <li>, she made my day and maybe my next decade : )</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally bought it.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping too, I always appreciate that!</li>
      <li>After application, my skin feels really smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Much more convenient to only apply one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gave as gift &amp; she loved them!</li>
    <li> Used a few weeks .  Not impressed.  I&#x27;ll stick with Olay.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product like this before. I just tried it for the first time and it went on like liquid silk. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. Two drops was all it took for my entire face. After application, my skin feels really smooth and soft. I can hardly wait to see the results after I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile. I&#x27;m 64 and only wish I had discovered this stuff a whole lot sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and my skin really is tighter and healthier. I was actually approached by a co-worker asking how I manage to &amp;#34;look so young&amp;#34;. She commented that my face is &amp;#34;so beautiful&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;what do you use&amp;#34;. She also used the term &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;. This is unbelievable for someone who has suffered through eczema, psoriasis and other ugly facial afflictions her whole life. I don&#x27;t know if THE VERY BEST is responsible but I&#x27;m giving it all the credit and will continue to buy this amazing liquid.</li>
    <li> Have only used 3 days and noticeable great results. Definite less deep wrinkles around mouth. Overall, face is smoother and softer. No fragrance and nice texture.</li>
    <li> I was on vacation with my youngest adult daughter,  she handed me her bottle of 180 and it was love at first touch.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately my skin felt moist, not oily but hydrated and I could see the difference immediately. Luckily I&lt;br /&gt;have a very thoughtful daughter, she gave me the bottle because she had two. I have  experienced&lt;br /&gt;this awesome product under beach conditions and now in my dry house (heat pump and fireplace) and&lt;br /&gt;my face has never been happier, my skin glows, is soft to the touch, it even seems to have more depth and&lt;br /&gt;firmness to it.&lt;br /&gt;My oldest adult daughter cornered me a month after I began using 180, she wanted to know if I had &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done ??&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted to know this product made such a noticeable difference. When I told her what I was using she&lt;br /&gt;had trouble believing me at first. Seems my mature skin that had taken on a thin look was recovering the elasticity so visibly&lt;br /&gt;that my oldest daughter picked up on it from across the room ... Yep, I&#x27;m glowing, this daughter is not one to compliment&lt;br /&gt;easily and it actually came out as an accusation ... how dare I think I could get away with having face work done and not&lt;br /&gt;tell her, she made my day and maybe my next decade : )</li>
    <li> So far nothing noticeable but has only been a week. It goes on smoothly and absorbs well, no smell, feels light and no problem under makeup. Will use the whole bottle and see if I notice anything. i hope I do!</li>
    <li> To be honest I was expecting a larger bottle. Fortunately, a little goes a long way with this product.  The cap doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the groves will and is on a slant. I was worried, it could have been broken in shipment. However, it works great and my skin feels fantastic after use. *Sample provided for Review*</li>
    <li> My skin seemed to be softer after using it a few days.  Such a small bottle does not last very long.  Maybe I used too much at a time.  Overall, I like the product.</li>
    <li> OK , but too expensive for the time it lasted. I need at least three bottles a month</li>
    <li> Great stuff-goes on smoothly, makes a big difference in skin smoothness, after about 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. You can see and feel the difference in just a couple of days. I would recommend it to anyone over 50 ( like myself).</li>
    <li> I am a serum user and try everything from the top to the middle in terms of product and price.  I just purchased this serum a few days ago and love the way my skin looks and feels.  The serum dries quickly and allows me to put my moisturizer, primer, foundation on effortfulessly.  I have seen a noticable difference in the texture of my skin since I started using.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all.</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels and looks</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and will reorder. I do see a difference in skin texture.I like the way it is absorbed quickly.</li>
    <li> Loved the product. Will continue to order this product. I could see a difference in my skin. Shipped fast. All around great deal. Thank you.</li>
    <li> very very very good product! Works very well. definitely I will reorder!</li>
    <li> This serum offers three in one. A combination of Vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid and peptides. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and also helps in regeneration of collagen in skin and can even reverse some damage with continued use. Hyaluronic acid holds in moisture so the skin is hydrated and less wrinkled. Peptides are now part of any good skin care. They boost collagen and diminish wrinkles. I always take care of my skin and when this product was offered, I was thrilled to get it since it has all the ingredients known best for skin in one bottle. You don’t need to apply a lot to get the benefit. It absorbs quickly and leaves skin smooth. I spray my face with rose water after cleansing and apply this on damp face to keep moisture in. It has made my skin hydrated, radiant and supple. I can see a difference how my makeup goes on smooth and stays longer. It is a winner product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 66 and wanted something to use that may help with wrinkles, of course, but also perhaps to nourish my dry patches on my cheeks. (bumpy). Nothing else helped but this has. Very little goes a long way and the small bottle last quite long.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product.  My skin looks renewed and younger and soft...love it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light serum that easily sinks into my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it daily and my skin is soft and bright. I&#x27;m pleased with it. I received this for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few short weeks, but man ohh man......what an improvement in my skin already!! It&#x27;s smoother, softer and what a glow!! I haven&#x27;t even worn makeup in these past two weeks. I love this product, recommend this product, and I will definitely purchase this serum again and again. I just wish they&#x27;d sell it in a larger bottle. Buy this serum,.....you won&#x27;t regret it. It arrived when the seller advised and there were no problems with the purchase or the product.......Bernadette Ostrawski.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I am still in the 30 day test range to truly see how this affects my skin. But I can safely tell you it is softer, more supple, and I can even tell there is more firmness to my face. One product that honestly has lived up to my expectations!</li>
    <li> Really like this product -goes on silky smooth!  Only negative -the small .5 oz size is gone too quickly. (please list size openly in product description, I couldn&#x27;t find it when I placed the initial order)&lt;br /&gt;~ thanks</li>
    <li> I love the serum, makes your skin soft and within a week or so tiny lines seem to disappear. I notice it mostly on my neck believe it or not. Great product</li>
    <li> I love these products, they feel like they really get absorbed into the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 6 months and find it to be excellent.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on my neck as I am in my 40&#x27;s and have begun to notice the signs of aging.  Noticed a difference in my skin after using a few times. Smoother and wrinkles are less pronounced. Only problem is the bottle is tiny and it didn&#x27;t last very long. A bit pricey to be ordering every month.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product makes my skin look. My skin feels smoother and more firmer. I am over 40 but no one can tell!</li>
    <li> The bottle didn&#x27;t last very long (less than a month) and there are no changes as a result of using it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what happened but the bottle was cracked and I lost all the serum inside.  I did not try to return because I had upcoming surgery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used nearly half the bottle and love the way it makes my skin feel. Prior to this I&#x27;ve been using separate C and Hyaluronic serums, as part of my regime, with good results. Much more convenient to only apply one. It did cause a slight break out after the first week (but that could have been some other factor). So I started using less and every other day until my skin acclimated. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the quick absorption of product into skin and can feel it working immediately.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now but I haven&#x27;t seen much difference. I will continue to use product to see if I can see a change.&lt;br /&gt;I know some products take longer to work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really too soon to tell whether or not its working, but I&#x27;m using it twice daily as recommended.  It certainly can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this product has not produced a skin reaction.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Never used these products before.  It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It&#x27;s not bad. It just want what I expected.</li>
    <li> I am 49 years old.  I feel like after only a few days of use, my wrinkles seem less noticeable and my skin has a healthy glow.  I only have to use a very small amount to cover my entire face.  Goes on very easily.  Only time will tell but I suspect I will see even more results and will continue to purchase this item.  Pleased!</li>
    <li> 180 Cosmetics Pure Swill Hyaluronic Serum + Peptides is amazing, You can see a difference within minutes the first time you use it. Try it you will like it.</li>
    <li> I do feel like my skin looks smoother and younger after about 2 weeks. And sun spots are fading better than with any other product I&#x27;ve used. I am 50 yrs old and the serum with peptides was recommended for my age.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Makes skin smooth and Dewey.</li>
    <li> Since becoming a mom, I have been more conscious about a lot of things, and when it comes to my appearance I am highly aware of where my skin is starting to show signs of aging. Because I am an older first time mom, I want to get rid of those pesky little lines around my eyes and firm the rest of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Peptidesfollow has been a great little helper and has all but erased the crow’s-feet cropping up along the outer edges of my eyes. If I lean in real close to the mirror, there is but a trace of those familiar lines and I feel years younger with a single glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Peptides is a thick serum that comes in a beautifully packaged bottle. It is a real treat to smooth on the serum each morning. I use two to three drops all over my face and neck, but I am sure I could just add a drop around the eye area for those fine lines and wrinkles. I do like the way the rest of my face feels after I apply 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Peptides so I indulge in a little extra. My skin feels hydrated, nourished and more elastic after using so it is doing a lot more than just banishing those fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little 180 Cosmetics Pure Hyaluronic Serum + Peptides goes a long way. Always apply on clean, dry skin and allow it to penetrate your skin before applying moisturizer. I highly recommend 180 Cosmetics Pure Hyaluronic Serum + Peptides. It is great for anyone trying to maintain a youthful image and turn back the clock. Beware fine lines and wrinkles, 180 Cosmetics Pure Hyaluronic Serum + Peptides will make you disappear.</li>
    <li> I love and need some more!</li>
    <li> have not been using long,, but so far so good... love the way it feels on skin.</li>
    <li> Great serum. Have tried others  but this is the best. Would recommend to everyone who wants to reduce wrinkle lines.</li>
    <li> I got the same results using a Garnier Fructice product, I was not impressed.</li>
    <li> Good Product.  Has all of the correct ingredients as extremely expensive products, but at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t want to stop using it ever. It is the best product I found that goes smooth and not sticky in a very very very long time. I recommend for every lady who cares for their skin , and specially the 40 years old and above..</li>
    <li> I like this serum because it really smooth and tighten my skin. I hope this serum will lift up my face after I finish this bottle then I&#x27;ll come back for the 5 stars and continue using it for a long run.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> It is great ... The serum improves in just a few DAYS the area around my eyes. The lines are much softer looking. It adds a moisture look too.</li>
    <li> Bottle much smaller than expected.did the weight of product include weight of container product packaged in?have purchased other skin care products of same size and amount and received twice the product than I got from this company.sad really good product</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any Improvement yet.Perhaps it takes much longer than just a month or less.</li>
    <li> The best hyaluronic and peptide serum I have been able to find.  Instantly transforms my skin:  all the little wrinkles vanish and it is dewy fresh looking all day. I use it at night as well for extra protection and smoothness.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s ok, I&#x60;ts a good serum</li>
    <li> The bottle was 1/2 full. I have 0.5 oz cosmetic products and know how much product should be in the bottle. I purchased new, never opened item. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ladies, at my age (63) I’ve tried it all and very few if any products did much to really improve the way my skin looks. This hyaluronic serum has worked wonders. My wrinkles aren’t as visible, my skin feels tighter. Try it, you won’t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works but I love how silky it makes my skin. Wish it was in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!! I&#x27;ve seen a difference already and have only been using it for a couple of weeks! Fast shipping too, I always appreciate that!</li>
    <li> This product is great for fine lines but it does nothing for the deep wrinkles</li>
    <li> Easy to use dropper and nice thick serum that easily absorbs into skin without any tackiness left behind.  I use on my face and neck and instantly feel my skin hydrating.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and smooth, like this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...only three days into using it and the benefits are noticeable without a doubt.  I will definitely incorporate this into my skincare regime!</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT.  I&#x27;m a cynic about pretty much everything and have been looking at this product for months.  I&#x27;m so glad I finally bought it.  It&#x27;s shockingly hydrating and simple.  I want to use it head to toe when I get out of the shower.  It&#x27;s that fabulous.  JUST BUY IT!  03/17 Very overpriced and rarely a full bottle.  I&#x27;ve tried 3 other products that are not quite as good but less expensive.  My hunt will continue and I&#x27;ll share what I find.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of vitamin c and hyaluronic acid serums and this is my favorite. The instant lift doesn&#x27;t work for everyone it sounds like but it does for me. If I wash my face and let it dry, then apply the serum and WAIT (at least 5 but maybe 10 minutes), I do get that instant lift. If you don&#x27;t wait till it&#x27;s fully dried the lift part won&#x27;t work.  I am 53 and have olive skin and don&#x27;t have the usual fine lines but have some hyperpigmentation and a little drooping around the eyes and slight grooves alongside my mouth. It&#x27;s the slight drooping around the eye area that really gets the lift. I let it soak in for 5 min or more and then put on moisturizer and makeup. I use other products too, but this is one part of what keeps my skin looking great and glowy and reduces redness and discoloration. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is very slick and applies easily to my face. There is no burning or irritation. I take a couple drops to my finger tips and rub it in all over my face and neck. It absorbs almost instantly and no oily residue is left. Other serums tend to leave a greasy feel even after they dry and I like that this is not the case here. I am able to use my moisturizer right after as well. There is no scent so you will not have any issues if you are sensitive to smells.I really enjoy using it and the cooling sensation it leaves on my face is a plus. It makes my face feel extra soft. I have applied it to one side of my face and there is a noticeable difference to the softness of my face. You still need to apply a moisturizer though as with all serums.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free using Tomoson. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I did see a little bit of improvement.  Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine any positive results. it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and I like that very much. Will update futher after I have used ti another month.</li>
    <li> The stuff is very expensive for the quantity you get. By the time you go through the bottle which comes with an eyedropper, it hasn&#x27;t had enough time to do anything. If he is supposed to take 4 to 6 months for results to show it&#x27;s going to cost you a bundle. I used the one bottle didn&#x27;t see any results. Quit</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a total skeptic when it comes to anti-aging products, but this realllllly works for me. I just ordered 2 more bottles. I&#x27;m 43 and should have been taking better care of my skin when I was younger. The small wrinkles between my eyebrows have all but disappeared after using this for about 3 months.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for age 50 and above as I am 53. I enjoy the youthfulness this product provides for me. I don&#x27;t like going without it. I use it each morning and and evening.</li>
