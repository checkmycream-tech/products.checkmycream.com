      <li>best to put it on a cotton ball first... then apply.  </li>
      <li>I guess it’s sort of a nice problem to have – faster growing hair – but I’m having to buy more hair color!  </li>
      <li>My breaking point came three months ago when I noticed an incredible amount of hair &amp;#34;fall&amp;#34; on my bathroom floor every day, and my hairline was becoming wider and wider and under bright light</li>
      <li>I guess it’s sort of a nice problem to have – faster growing hair – but I’m having to buy more hair color!  </li>
      <li>Amazing product!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best thing is that i don&#x27;t have to invest so much money into rogaine, nor do i have to put that stuff on my head anymore.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say between a change in my lifestyle and these supplements/additives, I&#x27;ve been able to correct my hair problems and more.</li>
      <li>and it has to be applied twice a day, every day, in order to be effective.  </li>
      <li>The best thing is that i don&#x27;t have to invest so much money into rogaine, nor do i have to put that stuff on my head anymore.</li>
      <li>Happy to report that a year later the results are still excellent.</li>
      <li>am three months into treatment now, and I am so thrilled with my results.</li>
      <li>and it has to be applied twice a day, every day, in order to be effective.  </li>
      <li>I was very proud and pleased with my pure silver mane, and now it&#x27;s sort of slate gray.</li>
      <li>I started using this product because several Doctor&#x27;s told me that it was the best thing that I could do to prevent losing my hair folicles for good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just started using Rogaine two weeks ago, very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so far, i&#x27;m happy!</li>
      <li>Buying it online is the most cost effective way to get it.</li>
      <li>course i&#x27;ll keep my review updated but so far i&#x27;m already very impressed.</li>
      <li>Have always had very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>and I also have very fine hair.</li>
      <li>Easy purchase!</li>
      <li>so it is best suited for someone who can keep that kind of daily regimen.  </li>
      <li>A nice side effect is that my eyebrows and eyelashes are also becoming thicker and longer.</li>
      <li>First time I used for 4 months following the instruction twice a day and saw the beautiful result - I was so happy!</li>
      <li>I have been using the product since April (full 5 months) and see a surprising difference.</li>
      <li>did not* give me better than what I lost.  </li>
      <li>But make sure you use it twice a day or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m more patient</li>
      <li>and I do not experience this any more.</li>
      <li>I am glad I decided to try it and wish I had thought of it sooner.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT, BUT PREFER FOAM</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m needing to use much more product to control my hair now that I&#x27;m using Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My front hair is getting better and better.</li>
      <li>It seems to be making my hair much more \\&quot;wiry\\&quot; than it ever has been.  </li>
      <li>It is supposed to have the consistency of water, but it acts more like oil when it hits my scalp.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not for everyone. I started using this product.. 4 days after I started i got a horrible migraine (never had one in my entire life). It continued for 2 days. I did not changed anything in my diet the only thing I change in my routine was using this product. Off course at the second day I stop using it and since then I feel normal again. Crazy/scary.</li>
    <li> Be careful with the side effects. I started to have muscle spasms after using this product. I did some research about the side effects, ant it&#x27;s one of them. I stopped using it immediately.</li>
    <li> This product takes time but I do see some improvement in my hair on the temples and nape.</li>
    <li> I mistakenly ordered the liquid instead of the foam, which is my error, so now I have to buy the foam.  A wasted my money.  I&#x27;ve used the liquid form for years and prefer the foam</li>
    <li> I assume this stuff works.. Never used it. WORST DRUNK PURCHASE EVER. Apparently, I was feeling pretty down about my thin hair while drinking one weekend. When this came in the mail I sighed and then laughed.&lt;br /&gt;I thought my drunken purchase of crocs was my low point. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 26, with a full head of hair... Yeah.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine since it came on the market, but recently noticed that it inflames my scalp and that I&#x27;m losing hair rather than growing more, as well as experiencing dizzy spells after use.  In truth, I think Rogaine works in a way similar to a root lifter in that it makes you appear to have more hair when you use it, but when you stop your hair appears much as it did before.  The best hair growth was on my face.  I&#x27;m blonde and developed peach-fuzz on my cheeks, and single dark hairs on my forehead and cheeks as well as my chin.  I&#x27;m post-menopausal and realize that hair growth happens, but since stopping Rogaine I no longer have a facial hair problem, other than an occasional dark hair on my chin.  I&#x27;m content to use Pantene Anti-breakage shampoo/conditioner and a styling gel.  My hair looks better and is certainly less brittle and dry.  It also is a better color than during the years of Rogaine use.  Those who are blonde may notice that the roots always look darker when using Rogaine, and hair greys more readily.  There are several articles on long-term Rogaine use online, and I think I&#x27;ve reached the point of diminishing returns with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for almost one month and can already see tiny hair growth.</li>
    <li> rip off i used it faithfully for six months and totally got no benefits. its an expensive rip off. no good at all.</li>
    <li> I am 63 and I have a receding hairline.  I believe I see results and I do have realistic expectations.  And, my husband, a barber,  said he sees some results.  More importantly, I feel I have some control with respect to my hair loss.  I feel better using it.  I hope this helps.  Cheers!!!</li>
    <li> had this product about a month ago and is just too early to review this item.it take some time to kick off.hopefully will work as they stated.</li>
    <li> this product is so dangerous, amazon will not accept a return on it. all of the dangers listed on the written material in the carton, are not on the product description on the sales page. if this product is not safe for return, and is not labeled haz mate, why is it for sale in this manner. i puchased this product for my mate, she has experienced bad side effects from it, any good lawyers out there?</li>
    <li> I have Lupus, which causes hair loss in some people, especially around the hairline.  Even though my hair is pretty thick, I started seeing some thin spots.  I have been using this for 4 months, and it actually works better than expected.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I had lost so much hair. Try it if you have lupus related hair loss.</li>
    <li> My hair at 68 years old was getting thin in spots. I started using this product and, I not kidding, I now have nice thick hair again. It took about six weeks but was well worth the wait.I highly recommend Rogaine for Women Hair Regrowth Treatment.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, BUT PREFER FOAM</li>
    <li> First of all the application method for this product s horrible. I can&#x27;t believe anyone has put up with this garbage for this long. The way you apply this liquid is with a dropper. So you get uneven coverage at best, as well as drips of the stuff running down your face or the back of your head where you do not need or want it. Seriously, anything would be better than a dropper. I don&#x27;t want a HAIR GROWTH product running down my face. I worked around it and finally found a method of application that worked for me, but for the price point no one should have to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the directions for how to apply this suck. I&#x27;m not gonna get specific it&#x27;s too much to type, but I paid a lot for this product the directions should be clear as a bell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, there is a lot of sketchiness in this product. Like... It says that you probably won&#x27;t see new growth for 4 months, yet they only ever sell it in 1 or 3 month supplies. No matter, you have to use it forever if it starts working for you! Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you want to try rogain get the foaming kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to stop using this after a month because I started having chest pains, which is one of the listed side effects. BTW, they use the words &amp;#34;chest pain&amp;#34; because that doesn&#x27;t sound nearly as bad as &amp;#34;heart pain&amp;#34; which is actually what it is. So I get to go to the doctor now. Hopefully, whatever is wrong with my heart isn&#x27;t permanent. Today is actually the first day I didn&#x27;t use rogaine and I only had some tiny heart pains for about 30 seconds. So that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-40s and had noticed a thinning hairline about two years ago.  I started using Rogaine for Women over a year ago.  Yes, it is a tiny bit inconvenient having to use it morning and night, but I find that by applying it at the end of my &#x27;hair routine&#x27; in the morning works best for me.  Apply the Rogaine to your scalp with the dropper touching the scalp and the product stays off of the hair...it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the finished look of my hair style.  (I flat iron).  At night I apply the Rogaine about an hour before bedtime.  Over the last year I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is much more full than before, both at the hairline and the crown.  I don&#x27;t plan to ever stop using Rogaine for Women.</li>
    <li> This product works very well at stopping hair loss, and does minimally enhance new growth.  Because it&#x27;s colorless and fragrance free, it&#x27;s less likely to discolor hair.</li>
    <li> I can only give it a 4 stars since I have only been using this item for 2 days. However, the result is Superb! I have used the product for only two days and guess what? My hair stop falling out!! YEPPY! Well, it still falls out but not in clumps or large amount like before. I have not notice any new growth yet since it is only my second day of use. I&#x27;ve called my mom to tell her that my hair has improved after the two days used of Rogain.......! I am a happy camper! Hopefully, new ones will grow out soon and having ticker hair will be nice! BTW, I am only 32 and to have lots of hair falling out is scary...</li>
    <li> If you are not ready to use Rogaine (or less expensive generic minoxidil) each day, twice a day for the rest of your life (or until a new medication is available) don&#x27;t start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using Rogaine in 2000 (it was my Y2K !) and I never stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen years later, I feel uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loosing hair ceased within 4 months and regrowing started within 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist told me I was his best case.</li>
    <li> Good price, arrived on time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year. It has brought back some hair is in the areas that were bare on my scalp but not really to a fullness that I desired.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical after reading what Consumer Reports said, but I was losing hair, and the dermatologist diagnosed &#x27;androgenic allopecia\\&quot; (middle age hormonal hair loss) and recommended Rogaine for women, along with 2.5 mg biotin per day.  I could not tolerate the biotin, so I just did the Rogaine.  My hair is thicker now than it has ever been, and is really beautiful.   Side effects:  facial hair, yes.  Not too bad, I can bleach it and pluck a little.  No problem.  Scalp itches due to the alcohol:  use conditioner and that helps.    I use a needleless syringe to apply the liquid, rather than the applicator, and move the locations of application around on my head.  It does not seem to interfere with hair styling, if you get most of the liquid on the scalp.  My eyelashes and eyebrows are thick now too, so obviously minoxidil is systemic.  Definitely worth a try, if your hair is thinning.  It takes a while, so stick with it through the whole first box. I&#x27;ve been lucky, the difference is really dramatic, and that is probably not everyone&#x27;s experience.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really too early to tell yet if the product works for me.  I&#x27;ve just started my second month, and I&#x27;m still losing hair. It&#x27;s easy to apply, and I&#x27;ve found that the 2 ounces last for slightly less than a month.  I&#x27;m willing to continue to give it a try, and see what happens over a period of time.  Overall, if it does help to regrow my hair, I&#x27;ll give it a 5 star rating. Think positive!</li>
    <li> When I first considered using Rogaine, I read user reviews and they were so mixed, I wasn&#x27;t sure how the product would work for me. I think this is because there are so many different hair types, as well as so many different reasons people lose their hair. My hair has always been genetically fine, oily and thin (basically the worst hair a woman could have!). I learned to live and work with what I had. When I was about 40, I noticed my hair was alarming thin on the front sides and top. I had a very stressful job and initially thought it was situational. However after leaving the job, seeing my doctor, and a year passed, the situation did not change and we determined it was genetic hair loss. I started using Rogaine about 9 months ago. It HAS worked for me in the respect that I am now regrowing hair in the front of my head. However, it has more or less restored me to my former hair situation which was never great to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I want to address is how it affects your hair styling. The potential disruption of my morning hair styling routine was a big dealbreaker for me.  I apply it right after I get out of the shower in the morning and then blow dry my hair. It does leave the hair feeling a little funky, as if I put product in the front. It does not weigh it down or make it greasy which I would notice right away since my hair tends to become oily quickly. I don&#x27;t have any problem styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss for women is very tough socially so if you are on the fence, I would encourage you to give it a try. It&#x27;s about $10-12 a month which is very reasonable. But be patient! It was a good six months before I could really say I saw improvement. My hair stylist who sees me every six weeks was able to better note the product&#x27;s success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Rogaine, you have to set a realistic expectation. I think it works well because it did what it was supposed to do. However, if I had hopes it would all of a sudden change my genetics and give me thick hair, I would be very disappointed!ry disappointed!</li>
    <li> It burns my scalp when I put it on. not using it. thanks</li>
    <li> Hair loss is caused by a variety of issues. Age, health condition, stress and diet. I have been using Rogaine for Women for about a year now and once my supply is out, I will not buy again. I am an Asian woman in her mid-30s with fine hair. Last year I was losing an alarming amount of hair in the shower - wallnut size hairball 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might have been because I was stressed or trying a vegetarian diet for one month, but I decided to use Rogaine because I was scared of losing all my hair. Within a couple of weeks the amount of hair I was losing decreased dramatically. I was losing less hair in the shower than ever before. I noticed new baby hairs growing too - so the product does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback is that when the new hair was growing, I developed an annoying case of dandruff, but that went away after a couple of weeks. After about a year of use now, my scalp has grown sensitive to the product and I get a rash if I use it every day. I can apply about once a week without irritation. Since I have decreased the use of Rogaine, I am now losing an alarming amount of hair in the shower. It says in the product manual that if dosage of Rogaine stops, the loss of hair can happen again.</li>
    <li> The twice a day application leaves my hair greasy and flat looking- not worth any possible results as you have to use it forever or any gain is lost and meanwhile your hair looks awful</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for 2 months and we haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth.  This product does not work.  Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> This transaction was very satisfactory.  The product is very good! The product does work in keeping hair loss for women at bay.</li>
    <li> This product works just as claimed.  The only reason for the 4 stars is because it takes 8 months or so to see the results and you cannot stop it once you start as you will end up as you started.  But that is OK as long as it works!</li>
    <li> hair thinning, age 44; it&#x27;s been going on the past 2 years &amp; am now doing something about it; took the rogaine for one month, ordered another go round, then re-read the instructions:  if you are hypothyroid (check), recently off birth control pills (check), and have low iron (check) DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.  sent message to rogaine for more clarification and all i received back was an email w/ the flipping instructions.  all righty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so even on the advice of my dermatologist, who recommended this after diagnosing alopecia (which i&#x27;m now wondering if correct) i&#x27;ve stopped using it. i was too frustrated to call the derm and ask for more direction.  i have a follow up appt in feb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, while using it, i did notice immediate (w/i a couple of weeks) hair regrowh in certain areas, though not much for the &#x27;thinning.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am sticking w/ multi-genics multivitamin w/o iron, separately taking opti-ferin c *just began two months ago* and staying off b/c pills(per pharmacist recommendation on all 3).  follow up appt w/ the derm early feb. we&#x27;ll see how the blood work is and how my hair responds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************&lt;br /&gt;follow up:&lt;br /&gt;had bloodwork done in February 2012 and my iron levels doubled, also my hair is coming back.  when i mentioned the above to the dermatologist&#x27;s nurse, she noted the improvement was most likely from the iron (opti-ferrin +C), not the Rogaine.</li>
    <li> Received my product today,great timing sure but what good is the timing if you cannot get what you think you purchased I am an avid amazon shopper and never been so disappointed with a seller as I am with this one. I was so ripped off. I paid a total of $56.69 yes that tax included however I thought I was paying so much for name brand Rogaine (for women) and as stated I received it today and opened package for an off Brand EQUATE if I wanted EQUATE there is a seller who sells it here for just cents of $25 dollars that&#x27;s ill more than half. Amazon will  absolutely be hearing from me I have yet to receive amazon feedback email oh but when I do.. WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS AGAIN WITH PEOPLE LIKE THIS WHO HAVE NO INTEGRITY AT ALL people just who we are giving our money too. I truly cannot believe this paid for what I thought was ROGAINE AND GOT EQUATE. I WAS FOR SURE RIPPED OFF NEVER AGAIN HOPE YOU GUYS ENJOY SWINDLING CUSTOMERS... VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. I WILL BE CALLING AMAZON ON THIS ISSUE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.I SPEND SERIOUS MONEY HERE FOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER. First time and for sure last time! Really?? Almost 50 dollars without tax or shipping and I got EQUATE.. OFF BRAND! Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I used this product over the last year after head laceration. My hair was slow to regrow but then I started using this product and within a month I started to get fuzz, then real hair. (hair grows in stages so you need to be patient.) It&#x27;s liquidy and spills easily out of the dropper, so I just wish it were easier to apply. But no side effects for me otherwise. No redness or burning. Very pleased. I&#x27;m continuing to use it until my hair is grown back.</li>
    <li> I have little new short hairs. This is my second or third try with this product. The first time, I wasn&#x27;t diligent about using it twice a day or even every day. The second time I was a little more but not totally diligent. Now I&#x27;m in there morning and night and it&#x27;s working. They used to have an Extra or Super Strength but I haven&#x27;t seen that in a while. I&#x27;m a fan no matter the strength.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my aunt, she has been using this for a while now, she claimed that it work very well.  This is a great price compare to outside source.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me and after using it for a couple of months my liver enzymes went up.  After discontinuing the use my liver enzymes came back down.  Make sure you check your liver enzymes after using.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but after just 30 days of use, I have new hair growth.  I used to spend so much time trying to style my hair to make it look thicker and now I am ready in 10 minutes.  My hair stylist who has been doing my hair for years said that I have at least 25% more hair than I had before!!</li>
    <li> I have used Women&#x27;s Rogaine for about 3 years for what my dermatologist says is hereditary pattern baldness: loss of hair on my temples and frontal thinning above my forehead. Rogaine produces a short fine fuzz that helps to hide bare skin, but that&#x27;s all. I stopped for a few months a year ago and the hair loss was more noticeable, so I returned to using Rogaine. Fuzz is better than nothing. My dermatologist said it was difficult to do anything about hereditary pattern baldness.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It works well for me and worth the money. I will recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> I use to purchase this product for my mother from a major retail chain for nearly double the price. I could not believe how much more affordable it is purchasing thru Amazon, I have set up reoccurring shipments, so the item is delivered every three months like clock work. As far as a review on the product, My Mother swears by it! I&#x27;m a very happy camper!</li>
    <li> Have not had the opportunity to us it for the the length of time  prescribed due to an injury.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my uncle who say it work for him, so i am taking his word for it, it work for him and he love it. i think i may have to renew his order.</li>
    <li> Alright, i&#x27;m only in week one but I just had to write down what already changed bc i am so amazed.&lt;br /&gt;This morning i brushed and washed my hair and i barely noticed any hair in the sink or shower.&lt;br /&gt;Usually i have to clean right afterwards bc everything is covered in my very thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only 26, noticing bald spots and a massive amount of hair falling out for about 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not just do i not see any hair laying around in the bathroom i also noticed that i don&#x27;t need to wash my hair&lt;br /&gt;everyday anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to very greasy hair and on some days i need to wash them twice. I have tried everything, nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;Although i&#x27;m not quite sure why but with rogaine i&#x27;m good to go without washing my hair for two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course i&#x27;ll keep my review updated but so far i&#x27;m already very impressed. No scalp irritation, no itching,&lt;br /&gt;no flaking or shedding.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a very mild headache two days ago but i threw in an aspirin and continued with my day.&lt;br /&gt;Only four stars so far bc i want to wait what&#x27;s happening next.&lt;br /&gt;See you in 7 weeks.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased the product, I read the reviews on Amazon.com. And I was skeptical, but still I bought it, after all nothing beats a try. So, when I got the product, I used it for 3 months, like it said, and it delivered. Now of course it did not grow a long mane of hair on my head, but I can see fuzz on the bald spots, so I figure if I continue to use it, the fuzz will thicken, and start to really fill in the bald spots. I am optimistic. I will continue to buy ROGAINE. And maybe one day, I will have my hair back again!</li>
    <li> Does not work for me, concentration of active principle too low. The 5% Rogaine works much better, but I guess one should consult a physician before using this product.</li>
    <li> My friend mentioned me I am loosing hair.  I was not old enough to lose hair yet.  I tried this product.  It took me a year to cover where I lost some hair.  Now I am in 5th year. I do use it every morning and evening but sometime I forget to use it.  It is does not matter just redoing again next day.  Now I have good hair and l look good.  I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It works for me.  Loosing less hair... and new hair growing in.  It even works to thicken eyebrows.  Just be verrrry careful putting it on eyebrows.  best to put it on a cotton ball first... then apply.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I tried to ignore it, but my hair had been thinning gradually for a number of years. Then, in August 2011, I had a fairly significant shed. My sister is a hairdresser, and she recommended Rogaine for Women. About six weeks after starting, I began to see results. Things went fine until I&#x27;d used the product for about five month, at which point I developed a severe scalp itch. I thought it might be because in the morning I applied Rogaine right after showering, when my pores were open. So I began using it just once a day, only in the evenings. Happy to report that a year later the results are still excellent. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the item a few days. It&#x27;s very greasy, it does dry, but it&#x27;s still greasy. This is a good value considering at my supermarket one bottle is $22.00 and here you get three for just a bit more.  The dropper sucks up exactly the amount needed. There is less liquid in the bottle than I expected. I do not expect one bottle to last a month but we shall see.</li>
    <li> Mom is 83 years old and has a large bald spot in the middle of her head.  This product has been helping her healthy hair grow; however, the spot remains.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day. It doesn&#x27;t grow back all or a lot of hair, but at least it&#x27;s enough to help. I did stop using this once for about 3 months and it is true that the hair that had grown in while using the product, all fall out when I stopped using it. There&#x27;s not much out there for Women when it come to hair regrowth, so any help is better than none.</li>
    <li> I am worried about the harm that might occur in my body so I am cautious about using this product.</li>
    <li> Rogaine has stimulated new growth in the area of my hair which was beginning to look very thin.  I am very pleased with the results I have seen since I started using Rogaine one year ago.</li>
    <li> Works great for me and have used it for years.  I used to have to have short short hair due to thinning and some bald spots but for at least 10 years now I have used this product and have hair and no bald spots and have shoulder length hair.  Love it and will continue to use it.  Quick and easy to apply and I HAVE HAIR!!  What more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> Bought a lot of times, the effect is very good, after the use of hair loss phenomenon is obviously improved, will insist on using</li>
    <li> It seems to be working for the wife.  There is fine hair coming in on her concerned areas.  It does require a little more time to see adequate results according to instructions.</li>
    <li> I like it better than the Foam!</li>
    <li> Here is a bit of a back-story on my hair loss, when I was in my teens I developed an allergy to an antibiotic I was prescribed, which resulted in an onset of drug-induced Lupus. The Lupus symptoms resolved after discontinuing the antibiotic, but subsequently I lost approximately 50% of my hair in the short time that I had symptoms. Only a portion of my hair grew back in the few of years after my Lupus resolved, so I went to see a dermatologist to see what the issue was (I thought that it was likely caused by an auto-immune issue). After taking samples of my hair follicles I was diagnosed with testosterone-induced female hair loss (both my mom and dad have thinning hair), which had been greatly accelerated by my Lupus. The dermatologist recommended that I start Minoxidil treatment right away, but being in my late teens it was fair to say that I was not interested in undertaking this twice-daily routine and did not adhere to the treatment for very long. Fast forward almost 10 years and I noticed that my hair continued to progressively thin out. My breaking point came three months ago when I noticed an incredible amount of hair &amp;#34;fall&amp;#34; on my bathroom floor every day, and my hairline was becoming wider and wider and under bright light I could clearly see my scalp through my thinning hair. I was devastated. I finally broke down and purchased Rogaine for Women because I knew that I had to address it now (I&#x27;m only 25!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began applying the topical solution as instructed, and within 3 days I noticed a significant reduction in hair fall on my bathroom floor. I&#x27;m not exaggerating when say that within the first week my hair fall had reduced by at least 75% if not more (please note that most people experience an increase in hair fall in the first few weeks of application, I&#x27;m not sure why my case was the opposite, so do not be discouraged if you experience an increase, it is entirely normal). Within a month I began seeing little &amp;#34;sprouts&amp;#34; of hair throughout my scalp, and two months in I seem to have grown a whole colony of baby hairs (so many that when I brushed the hairs forward it looked like I had short bangs!). Applying the solution only takes me about 30 seconds (I hold a piece of tissue on my forehead to catch any drips) and the solution dries within 5-10 minutes (I try to apply it after I shower and my hair is dry, or at least 4 hours before I expect to shower/exercise, as per the instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to side effects, in the beginning of my treatment I experienced occasional mild scalp itching about an hour or two after application, which did not last very long and I do not experience this any more. The most noticeable side effect was a strong, metallic taste that I experienced approximately 30 minutes after applying the solution. This almost made me discontinue treatment because nothing I ate could alleviate the taste, which was quite distressing. However I continued to use the medication and the metallic taste resolved after about a week. I have not experienced any ongoing side effects other than hair growth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am three months into treatment now, and I am so thrilled with my results. The baby hairs continue to grow longer and my hairline has become much narrower. My scalp is far less apparent under bright light and I have much more hair volume at my roots. And this is only being three months into treatment! I am so excited to see what results I will see 6 or 9 months into treatment (when most people start to see measurable results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a female with hair loss, try this product, there is hope! Only women who have experienced thinning hair can understand what an emotional toll it can take and how it can affect how you feel about yourself. My confidence has increased tremendously since using this product and I am no longer self-conscious about my hair. It is completely worth the minimal time and effort that it takes to see results, I could not recommend this product more! You just need to apply it twice a day consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, remember to take pictures of your scalp at the start of treatment and every couple of months after as your results progress, you may feel that you are seeing subtle results but nothing beats seeing how far you have come through pictures! It was a big eye-opener for me. So get out that camera and get ready to be amazed.</li>
    <li> I am waiting,I will tell you later,nothing yet ,I use only 4 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I think I do not lose so much hair how was before,I have patience to wait for finish 6 bottles to see new hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  treatment 6 month ,now after  few month hair is falling again.I am  not happy.</li>
    <li> I used it during chemo treatment- although it doesnt recommend using it for hair loss due to chemotheramy. But I did, and it worked, but you really have to do it religiously 2 times a day. I had hair already growing while I was going through chemo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hair loss problem for years but now I was losing a great amount of hair daily, not just in the shower.  It had gotten so bad that the top of my hair thinned out tremendously.  While I have used Rogaine on and off for years, I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for the last 4 months and it has stopped my hair from shedding but it has not replaced the hair I&#x27;ve lost.  I will keep using Rogaine and hopefully I will grow back most of my hair.</li>
    <li> It says you need three months before you see results.  I&#x27;m still in month two so nothing to report yet.</li>
    <li> Have been on Rogaine for six weeks and unfortunately have decided to stop. Not only was my hair falling out at a much higher rate but I noticed I have become forgetful (like where did I leave the shopping cart in the store). I am on no other medications so am going to stop taking it and see if indeed this forgetfulness is due to Rogaine. Easy to apply--just do not get it in your eye. Have a dry washcloth handy each time to stop the drip down your face.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother and after using this we observed great progress, it indeed helps regrowing and strengthening hairs</li>
    <li> seems to be doing well</li>
    <li> After i got this product, i started to use it for 3 months. However, this produce did not change my hair loss, and my hair seems as same as before.</li>
    <li> I am 61 with naturally curly, chin-length hair; I also color and straighten my hair. I have always had thin hair since my late forties. I used to avoid dressing rooms with two mirrors because I had to confront how bad my thinning hair looked in the back. I started using this product when I began to lose hair in the front two \\&quot;peaks\\&quot; and couldn&#x27;t be in denial anymore (I was having trouble covering this area with parts, combing over, etc.). I have been using the product for 10 months, and this is my first review. The front bald spots have filled in with enough hair so it is no longer an issue (after about 4 months), as has the thinning in the back (about 6 months). I no longer have big spaces that show little to no hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the dropper to the problem areas when I first get up in the morning; I don&#x27;t bother to rub it into the scalp. I only use one application a day; I use a terrycloth hair band to keep it from dripping onto my face or neck. If I wash my hair (I tend to do this in late afternoon or evening) I do not reapply until the usual first thing in the morning. I like the liquid since it gets onto the scalp easily. I tried the foam about 9 years ago and it was awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was thicker eyelashes - a nice perk. I began to notice facial hair growth after about 4-5 months. It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but I now use the Olay product once a month to take off hair. This side effect is minimal compared to my frustration with thinning hair. I thought I would just have to suck up another effect of aging, but Rogaine has help me to overcome this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and don&#x27;t plan to ever stop using it. Good luck to you.</li>
    <li> I stopped using this after a couple of weeks.  Felt slight burning sensation when applied, and also seemed to lose a few more hairs...</li>
    <li> I have used Rogaine for over 10 years. My dermatologist recommended it.  It keeps the hair I have and I think it reduces hair fallout.</li>
    <li> I normally never have time to write reviews, but felt like I had to get this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a super healthy women and never took any drugs in my life for more than 10 day (like antibiotics ones every 3-4 years). I run 30-40 miles per week and swim 10 months out of 12 in the ocean. When started using Rogaine, I experienced horrible problems with my heart. Basically, I almost had a stroke after using it for 3 weeks. Even before I noticed that when I apply Rogain at night it takes me hours to actually fall asleep because my heart would beat like crazy. Even after sleeping fro 11 hours I felt very dizzy and not well. Never happen to me before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I than read on Rogain website that cardio-related side effects are common and clinical studies showed permanent changes in heart structure in men using Rogain for over 6 months topical. This is horrible! I do not understand how this drug could possibly pass clinical trials and allowed to be used in humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the \\&quot;effectiveness\\&quot; clinical trials showed that it was only 12% better than placebo. Certainly not worth the risks. Better go with 100% natural \\&quot;Rene fortener\\&quot; that has very high rate of positive responses on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I stopped using Rogain all the symptoms went away. I really hope no permanent damage to my health was done at this point.</li>
    <li> its best product for hair regrowth, i used it before&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it for anyone have problem with his hair, but its price was high,</li>
    <li> These were remarkably less money than charged by CVS, As for the effectiveness, well, my wife has not gone bald.</li>
    <li> It says you have to give it 4 months to work.  I&#x27;ve only started using it a couple weeks ago.  Not sure if it has helped or not.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, yet.</li>
    <li> First of all let me tell you this preface:  I am white and my hair is too curly. When I arrived here two years ago I happened to experience massive hair loss because of the big change in the weather and water materials. I used to use minoxidil a while ago in my country so I wasn&#x27;t unfamiliar with the product but those that I used to use there didn&#x27;t show a considerable effect on my hair growth so I assumed it would be the same for this product. Despite these facts I ordered this product for the first time some months ago and I used it as instructed every morning and every night for more than 4 months and my hair grew back and is still growing. I had a haircut two months ago and my hair dresser told me so. My front hair is getting better and better. I love this product and I will use it again and again because I stop using minoxidil after some time it&#x27;ll cause the hair loss to return. tappering should be at least after 6 months. I should wait and give some time to my hair to get stronger and healthier. There is only one thing that I should add to the Side Effects of this drug : Minoxidil is a vasodilator and some times it causes headaches in particular cases but it&#x27;s not life threatening so don&#x27;t worry and enjoy seeing your hair growth with it.</li>
    <li> because it didnt work in my hair and i will really like a refund of my money thank you very much</li>
    <li> For me, it took 50 days of using it twice a day to see results. I&#x27;m a 39WF. I have a large balding spot on the crown of my head. Had it for 18yrs. Around the 50th day, I noticed tiny hair sprouting where there never were before. About to order my next box to hopefully continue to see results. Right now I&#x27;m on day 83.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for about 8 years. I would not even think of not replacing it when I&#x27;m running low. Without this, my hair would be GONE. Rogaine works, and I consider having a supply of it as necessary as toothpaste. It&#x27;s very easy to use and once you have used it for a few days, it becomes just part of your morning getting ready routine. If you have thinning hair, this is for you. Buying it online is the most cost effective way to get it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old female. I started losing my hair about 14 years ago, but this year, it started coming out in fistfuls. FISTFULS!!! Every shower, every hair brush, every time someone ran their hand thru my hair. It was awful. I felt embarrassed and depressed. I finally decided I had to do something. My hairdresser recommended Nioxin. I started taking those pills the same day I started using Rogaine. Nothing happened at first. Hair was still falling out at an alarming rate. After 2 weeks, I noticed my skin looked clearer. That was the Nioxin kicking in. After 2 months, I noticed that the hair that was growing was thicker. Again, the Nioxin. After about three and a half months... it happened. My hair stopped falling out. No fistfuls when I showered. No hairbrush full of hair after even the gentle-est hairbrushing. Then after 4 months, I noticed some of the little bald patches in front weren&#x27;t bald anymore. Ladies, I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how joyful this is. My hair looks great! It&#x27;s thick, lush, manageable. I will use the one-two punch of Nioxin &amp; Rogaine til the day I die. Be patient and you will have great results, too. Good luck, ladies!!!</li>
    <li> great and useful, hope it can directly ship to China</li>
    <li> I tried this product a few years ago so I thought I would try it again  also the price was right</li>
    <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My situation:&lt;br /&gt;African-American female mid-40s.  My hair was thinning in the front with a very noticeable bald spot forming on the right side.  I’ve always had really thick and healthy hair so I’m assuming the cause is the start of menopause and stress (work, home, etc.).  Having had a “head full of hair” all of my life starting to go bald was really distressing!!  It’s bad enough for men to lose their hair but for us women, our hair really is our crowning glory!  To start to lose it feels tragic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My expectations:&lt;br /&gt;I really wasn’t too optimistic about this working because it seems things like this never work for me and usually the test group for these sorts of things don’t include women of color – aren’t even designed for women of color!  But I thought I’d give it a try and what do you know?  It worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually works!&lt;br /&gt;It really worked!  But be aware; you must have patience.  This is not going to work over night and at first it will seem like nothing is happening.  Everybody’s body chemistry is different so for some you may see results sooner but I didn’t really see a difference until I was on the 4th bottle!  Each bottle last about a month so a lot of people aren’t going to have that much patience and needing three to four months to see results makes it very hard to ask for your money back if in fact it doesn’t work for you.  But, if you have patience and use it as directed (religiously, as if your life depends on it), I think most people should see results.  But, results will vary as they say.  For me it’s been worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end Result – it gave me back what I lost:&lt;br /&gt;It’s important to note that this is not some miracle cream.  If you are expecting a miracle snap out of it!  Be realistic.  If you are all but completely bald this product is not going to turn you into Rapunzel.  Okay?  But it will most likely stimulate hair growth.  How much depends on the individual.  As I said everyone’s body chemistry is different.  But for me it worked.  It gave me back what I lost.  It *did not* give me more than what I lost.  It *did not* give me better than what I lost.  But **it did** give me back what I lost.  I can now once again part my hair on the right-hand side (or anywhere I want).  I no longer have to part it only on the left in order to do a “comb over” to hide the bald spot on the right.  I can pull my hair straight back into a pony tail if I want without shiny skull showing through.  Blow drying and flat ironing my hair no longer makes it look thinner.  In fact it doesn’t look thin at all – natural or straighten!  ***It gave me back what I lost.***  And in the end that’s really all any of us can ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;There are two reasons why I’m only giving it five stars instead of six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the application.  It’s liquid and it’s runny!  You have to be very careful with the application and make sure it goes only where you want/need it to go otherwise you will see hair growth in places you don’t want it.  What first tipped me off that it was working was peach fuzz on my forehead!  As I mentioned my hair loss was mainly at the front hair line so that’s where I apply the product.  I soon realized that because I wasn’t being very careful about quickly wiping away any excess that roll down onto my forehead I was starting to grow hair there!  :-0  That’s not a good look to say the least.  LOL.  I really wish there was a foam (or a gel) version for women like there is for men!  So be careful when applying it or you’ll have hair growing in places you didn’t intend (I find lightly messaging it in with my fingertips helps prevent it from running).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it’s not permanent.  This is a lifelong commitment.  If you stop using it the hair growth will stop.  The thinning will return, the bald spot(s) will return.  Science needs to find a permanent solution for hair loss.  I’m just saying.  Even though you can hunt around for good pricing it’s still an expensive product relatively speaking and it has to be applied twice a day, every day, in order to be effective.  That’s a commitment and for most of us one more thing to add to an already busy schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An additional drawback or “side effect” if you will, is that if you color your hair you will probably have to touch up the roots more often.  I like to cover my grey and I’ve found that since I started using the Rogaine I have to do it more often.  Instead of the roots coming through after about three weeks or so they start showing through in about a week and half!  I guess it’s sort of a nice problem to have – faster growing hair – but I’m having to buy more hair color!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is it works.  It’s a commitment and for some us an expensive commitment but it works.  So, I would encourage anyone to at least give it a try – really you have nothing to lose except more hair.  :-)  I hope this review helps.  Good luck to you.r good pricing it’s still an expensive product relatively speaking and it has to be applied twice a day, every day, in order to be effective.

    <li> I am still using it, It seem to be helping I think I need to continue to use it a little while longer before I can really tell if it is working.</li>
    <li> I purchased a pack of 2-ounce of 3 bottles  of Rogain on Amazon. I am very happy with the purchase. The product is authentic and it costs  the price of just one or even less of Walgreens price.   I used just one bottle and now my hair in much better shape. Doubt not in Amazon. I will definitely come back again when I will need it. Thanks so much to who ever sold it.</li>
    <li> I am 1 month in and can tell it&#x27;s working on my temple area.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent. It totally works</li>
    <li> I like this product.  i&#x27;ve been using it for over 4 months not and have not seen a change in my hair but,&lt;br /&gt;i will stick with a few more months.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a family member experiencing hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a month, their hairline returned and the balding areas vanished! They became a chia pet!&lt;br /&gt;It did cause mild irritation when using it twice a day after a couple of months, So they began to use it less often and have maintained hair growth without issues. Great results!</li>
    <li> I have ultra fine hair. Since I couldn&#x27;t find Rogaine in my local WalMart, I tried their brand; no match at all. I&#x27;ll stick to Rogaine. I would like to see their pricing come down.</li>
    <li> Not gone lie it really does grow ur hair thicker but its a trap cause once u stop using it your hair will fall back out on the same spot where u were using it.  I used it on my edges cause my edges are very thin and have bald spots in the middle and when I started using it I seen results instantly but no bs like after 2-3 that I stopped using every spot on my hair that the rogaine touched my scalp my hair was completely gone and I had to restart the growing process all over. So in my opinion if u can afford to keep buying this every month then go for it cuz u will see and have good results but if u can&#x27;t beware cuz u will be back to square one even worse</li>
    <li> I am still on the first month of using this product, but i can tell there is a reduction in the hair loss, and some hair regrowth</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t optimistic but I have been pleasantly surprised.  The stuff is a little difficult to apply (it is like the consistency of water and takes some practice so it isn&#x27;t constantly running down your cheeks).  I have been using about a month and half and see a lot of healthy new hair growth.  I am very pleased and will definitely continue to use!</li>
    <li> It is easy to use although timing can be difficult with washing hair/sleeping.  I&#x27;ve used it only for 2 weeks and actually I do see new hairs now, but not sure if this is due to natural hormone changes or because of the product.  But I will keep at it.  One negative is it says if you stop using the product that the new hairs you&#x27;ve gained won&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to see any results.  Usually takes about 3 months to see any progress. I am hopeful!</li>
    <li> It definitely works!! I had to stop using it while pregnant but will continue later on :)</li>
    <li> Work great but kinda smell (1 star less for that).  It could smell better since it goes to your head.</li>
    <li> Halfway through, still not sure of effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.  It works.  but don&#x27;t expect hair growth where you didn&#x27;t have any in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got my hairline back !</li>
    <li> Been using Rogaine for women for almost 4 months now.  I&#x27;ve noticed some hair growing back but I still lose a lot from the medication I&#x27;m on.  Its clean and easy but you HAVE to use it twice a day.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or my scalp.  I&#x27;ve had NO side effects.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.  My male friend&#x27;s bald spot has almost grown in and it has taken him almost a year.  You have to be patient though and positive.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th month of using this treatment.  I still can&#x27;t tell if there has been any improvement.  I will continue to use it because I know regrowing hair cannot happen over night.  It does seem thicker in the area where I am applying the treatment but I can&#x27;t see the growth and don&#x27;t know how it will appear.  I keep looking for some fuzzy growth but don&#x27;t see it, although it does feel like that--I do see some short hairs (my hair is long and does grow very fast) and wonder if the new growth is already there and beginning to blend--only time and a lot of patience will tell.  My hair dresser said I would be surprised at the number of women who use the treatment--it is not something women are willing to discuss with other women.</li>
    <li> package was open, the pills dryed up and each had a different color</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this when I started loosing my hair and I can honestly say I have seen a huge difference. I have regrown my receeding hairline and my hair loss has greatly slowed down. I use it everyday before bed and that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s easy and relatively cheap compared to other products on the market. Since It is working well I do not use it twice a day. I did stop using it for awhile and I started loosing the hair I had regrown. You have to use this forever if you start so be prepared for that. To me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Product works so far.</li>
    <li> We have been getting this product through Amazon for about a year now using the Amazon automatic purchase program.  Amazon automatically sends a resupply every three months.  The product seems to work to some extent and my wife is satisfied with results so far.  The big problem is that prices have steadily increased. Now about 25% higher than our first purchase a little more than a year ago.  Quite a bit more than inflation - seems a little excessive.  We may quit using this product unless the price goes back down.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years.  My hair is thicker and more manageable,  This product has done alot to minimize any loss and actually has helped to regrow hair where it was thinning.  I follow the instructions every day and will continue to buy this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been losing my hair now for I&#x27;d say about 5 years, probably longer if I really think about it.  I used womens Rogaine for a little over a year back in 2009-2010. I had a TERRIBLE \\&quot;dread shed\\&quot; as they call it, when I first started, it then dropped to nothing after about a month, then kind of settled in at \\&quot;shedding, but not overly bad\\&quot;, I guess.  I quit it though, after about 14 months, because I guess I figured if I was going to squirt this chemical on to my head every night, I wanted a full head of hair and no shedding.  At the time, I still had a lot of hair, even though half of it was gone.  Fast forward to May 2012 and my hair loss continues.  I now find myself kind of arranging the front to hide what are becoming obviously thin areas (to me anyway....everyone else thinks I&#x27;m nuts :))  .  So, I&#x27;m giving Rogaine a go again.  Funny how you don&#x27;t care as much about dumping a chemical on your head every day when you start to see balding areas, with no end in sight.  I&#x27;m on week three and the shedding is AWFUL.  Really awful.  If you start, you should be prepared for that.  I&#x27;m losing handfuls, even on \\&quot;no wash\\&quot; days.  During the first week or two there was a definite tingling on my scalp too, a weird feeling, almost like the feeling you get when you&#x27;re upside down.  Thats nearly gone now.  You&#x27;re supposed to use it twice a day, which I found to be a pain in the butt to begin with.  It leaves your hair feeling like it&#x27;s got something greasy in it at the roots, but that dries and really, it&#x27;s not so bad.  It runs too, so I&#x27;m planning on looking for a headband, so I don&#x27;t end up with a hairy forehead. :) So, I&#x27;ll continue, and maybe post back after a few months.  The price on amazon, is decent, especially with no shipping.  Good luck if you try it!</li>
    <li> I used this because I have had hair damage and trying to speed up my hair growth. Seemed to help out.</li>
    <li> Waste of money for me. Did not grow any of my hair back.</li>
    <li> After multiple surgeries, my hair was literally falling out in clumps. After 6 weeks of using rogaine I started to notice new hair growth and less shedding. I haven&#x27;t had much unwanted hair growth elsewhere either.</li>
    <li> Let me say right off the bat that I only used this product for a month before discontinuing. The reason I discontinued use was because way too much hair (and I didn&#x27;t have much to begin with) was falling out in clumps! My dermatologist recommended Rogaine for women because my hair had been thinning over the last year, and she thought the product might help me regrow some hair. She mentioned to me that initially some extra hair would fall out but after a month of steady use, just too much was falling out and I can&#x27;t afford to lose anymore hair!  I guess it works for many women, and if you are one of these women, consider yourself lucky.  While I know products for hair regrowth can take months to work, I feel frustrated that I wasn&#x27;t able to give this product a real chance to be effective. Maybe if I had kept using it, I would have been able to grow a bunch of new hair, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to take the risk of serious hair loss!</li>
    <li> I have been using for almost a month now and it seems I have already had some improvements. Even thought it&#x27;s not obvious but I know it looks different from before. I am surprised this is actually working and I am happy with my current result and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have only used Rogaine hair growth for one month.  Not enough time to really tell a difference. It takes away the natural feel of my hair and makes it feel very harsh and dry but I have not given up on it until I use it for at least 3 months. No noticeable change other than the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> This product works very good and I will recommend it to others. I was able to see the improvment after four weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using rogaine for over a year and I see new hair but can&#x27;t tell if it is really working and filling in.  The last shipment I received, the box was not factory sealed and badly dented but the product seemed fine and in good shape.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical but after 2nd bottle noticed baby hairs. I&#x27;m on third bottle and see my scalp less. I&#x27;m impressed (and sad that I even need it! Was hoping it was just lack of sleep and stress). I&#x27;ve read if you stop using the product the hair loss will return. I haven&#x27;t tested that theory yet. I hope not. I will at some point try it. It does flake a little if you apply it when your hair is wet. I have curly hair and allow my hair to air dry but it looked flaky in some spots. I now put the product on my dry hair and don&#x27;t see any flakiness.</li>
    <li> Be sure to read the fine print, in particular results comparing the placebo group to the group using the product. The success rate is similar and poor. Also, be sure to peruse the blogs re thinning hair - I have yet to find one success story, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I love this product and this is my second order.</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical about trying this product, as my hair has fallen out along the edges from braiding, weaving, etc. However, I decided to include this product into my new natural hair care regimen as a last resort. IT WORKS! Where I was bald along the edges around my hair line, I now have hair. At the end of month 1, I noticed very fine, light colored \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot;. Month 2 the fuzz was darker and a bit more dense. Now, the end of month 3 there is a signifigant amount of growth and the hair has started to curl (like the kitchen). I&#x27;d been told many times by my hair care professionals that my type of hair loss, traction alopecia was irreversable. Now when I see my stylists, they too are amazed. Ladies, sistas, please try this product, it worked for me! The side effects are a tingly itchy sensation, dandruff (Nioxin system 6 works for this), and difficult application due to the site I applied the product (rather than on the top of my head). Also, when washing your hair, be gentle on the application site, try not to scratch! Good luck ladies.</li>
    <li> Be patience... You need at least 4 to 5 five months of continued use to start seeing result... But i can honestly say that it works and probably is the only thing in the market for hair-growing that actually makes a difference... 100% recommended..</li>
    <li> Great delivery, takes up to 4 months to work if it is going to. I am in my second month, nothing yet. Leaves roots a bit oily, but if it actually works, I can live with that.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;Every woman fears the time of her life when our precious hair falls out. I noticed more and more strands falling out around the time I turned 30. I&#x27;m 50 now (Ssh! Don&#x27;t tell anyone!) and I thought there was no hope left for my hair. Today, my hair is thick and just the way I like it. It&#x27;s my own hair, that I grew! I would recommend this product to anyone with progressing hair loss. It works!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first, as it took about 4 weeks for improvement to show, but two months later I&#x27;m loving my hair every single day!</li>
    <li> We ordered 2 boxes of Rogaine (total of 6 bottles). My mum started using Rogaine as instructed. A week later she started getting allergic reactions like rashes on her head and on her forehead, unbearable itching on her head, flaking of scalp and terrible hair fall etc. First we thought it was due to some food she ate but these symptoms started to disappear when she stopped using Rogaine. We called Rogaine and expalined the situation but neither Rogaine nor Amazon accepted to get the unopened bottles and boxes back. Therefore do not order large amounts before trying it with a small bottle.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone to try to see if it helps with their hair loss.  I have told others about it.</li>
    <li> I am definitely seeing some fuzz grow on my head. Is it luscious flowing hair? No, its not. But it is better than nothing. I started going bald at age 40 and ever since have been very self-consious.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for 2 years now and my hair just gets better and better.  Before using Rogaine I would spend an inordinate amount of time in the morning trying to camouflage the bald spots. I was quite despondent thinking that I was actually going bald!  I tried vitamins, minerals, hair products and had my thyroid tested.  Rogaine was my final hope and it did not disappoint!!  I will use it for the rest of my life.  People cannot believe the way my hair looks now since it had been extremely thin with portions of my scalp visible. You should know within 3 months if the product will work for you.  I HIGHLY recommend Rogaine, - it&#x27;s my salvation!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the effectiveness of the product, but felt desperate. The hair loss was increasingly alarming. I have been using the product since April (full 5 months) and see a surprising difference. The sun is not shining thru and showing my scalp like it was. That is exciting. I intend to continue to use the product and hope for even better results. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The package instructions tell you it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones and I&#x27;m so thankful to have it.  It says to give it 4 months to be sure if it will work.  Don&#x27;t give up too quickly.  It took 3 months of faithfully applying it twice a day before I started seeing a difference, 4 months before it was really noticeable.  I recommend taking a before and after picture.  The change is so gradual you may forget how bad it was before you started.</li>
    <li> I used this for about 2 weeks and just had to stop because I couldn&#x27;t deal with it anymore. The solution itself was fine, but after using it for 2 days I started to have dry skin/dandruff like it was going out of style. I couldn&#x27;t even leave my house without a hat or head band covering most of it. But even then I couldn&#x27;t get it all off. I never had an issue before with dandruff and this was to the extreme. I was so embarrassed to be seen by anyone. I thought maybe after I used it for so long my scalp would get use to it and stop ripping off my skin, but it never stopped. So I finally said the hell with it, I would rather have a little thinning hair then have dandruff everyday of my life. Wish I could return it since it was right around $40 and I only used 10% of the bottle :(</li>
    <li> I started using this product because several Doctor&#x27;s told me that it was the best thing that I could do to prevent losing my hair folicles for good.  I finally decided to use it, after a month using I had issues of headaches and blurred vision and EXTREAM hair loss.  I had to stop it because of medical reasons but I wish I never when on it to begin with.  PLEASE TAKE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION BEFORE YOU START THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Over the past five years, my hair has gotten quite thin, and the difference is especially noticeable in my ponytail, which is less than half the thickness it was only five years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanting to halt the hair loss I&#x27;ve been experiencing, I began using Rogaine for Women a few months ago.  I haven&#x27;t yet noticed any hair GROWTH (that can take many, many months), but I have noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t falling out at nearly the speed it had been.  That&#x27;s a very good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few \\&quot;side effects\\&quot; of the Rogaine that do bother me, but not enough to make me stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I religiously apply 1 ml of solution directly to my scalp twice per day.  I generally apply it about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower/bath, so my hair is damp, but not wet.  I am careful to measure out the solution and apply it to my SCALP, not my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... it still gets all over my hair and makes it ashy-looking.  My hair is dark auburn, but where I put the Rogaine is now an ashy whitish-gray.  That&#x27;s definitely not a look I am trying to acquire!  And, in addition to the ashy look, it also makes my hair flat.  Very flat.  It is supposed to have the consistency of water, but it acts more like oil when it hits my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read that Rogaine can change hair color and/or texture, and I am beginning to see that.  It seems to be making my hair much more \\&quot;wiry\\&quot; than it ever has been.  I&#x27;m needing to use much more product to control my hair now that I&#x27;m using Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue use for at least another five months to see if it helps my hair actually grow/thicken, but I&#x27;m hoping the ashy look and greasy feel will be temporary!</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews for this product prior to purchasing. Not sure it will work for African-American hair types and it is too expensive to purchase for the rest of my natural life.?????</li>
    <li> The product is easy to use, but you must be consistent in order to see results.  I was shocked to see \\&quot;baby fuzz\\&quot; hair growing on my face occassionally, but was able to resolve the facial growth by using a lady razor.  Overall it gets results.  Question - Are these treatments a lifetime committment?</li>
    <li> Rogaine is probably the only product on the market approved by the FDA which is why I was willing to try it in the first place. My poor diet as an adult hasn&#x27;t helped my physical appearance but I&#x27;m doing the best I can to correct it. My thinning and easily broken hair was very high on my list of things to correct. The rogaine seemed like an easy option to test since it was topical. Within the first few uses I could tell my hair seemed to feel fuller and had a healthy glow unlike before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to now, 6 months later my hair color is bolder, my hair is stronger, and I think it&#x27;s also sticker. I&#x27;ve stuck with the rogaine routine but also added in biotin and hair growth tablets ([[ASIN:B00B5OM58U Hair Growth Essentials + FREE Maximum Strength Biotin Tablets]]) which made a big difference in the speed of new hair growth. I&#x27;m happy to say between a change in my lifestyle and these supplements/additives, I&#x27;ve been able to correct my hair problems and more.</li>
    <li> did not work, burned my scalp, made my hair greasy, also made me feel nausea. would not recommend, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using rogain for a little while now because of some hair loss I experience and I feel like I am getting adequate results for the products price. I&#x27;m noticing new hair growth and I wish I would have used it sooner. But make sure you use it twice a day or it won&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m going to use this product for a year and take some photos will up date in a few months.</li>
    <li> I am 60 and noticed that my part was getting very wide, nearly a half inch. On closer examination, I shouted, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going bald!&amp;#34; As the owner of beautiful long white shiny hair, I was sad to say the least. I started using Rogaine and followed the instructions exactly for four months before taking photos and comparing the before and after. I had not expected it to work, but it worked very well. I now have a lot of new hair growth, and all the patches are fillling in. A nice side effect is that my eyebrows and eyelashes are also becoming thicker and longer. There have been a few new hairs on my chin, but I just pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have a problem: All the new hair growing in is dark brown, my color as a young person. I was very proud and pleased with my pure silver mane, and now it&#x27;s sort of slate gray. But what the heck, it&#x27;s so much better than going bald. I will continue to use Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try the Men&#x27;s Foam version, just once a day. The liquid does leave a sticky residue on your hair, which you can use as &amp;#34;styling gel&amp;#34; but I do not like it. I&#x27;ve read that the foam does not leave the same residue. Plus it&#x27;s much stronger and I&#x27;ll use it only once a day.</li>
    <li> So far this product is working well for me - I am seeing some regrowth and I love that so far</li>
    <li> had signed up for automatic re-send-but when it came time for my next shipment nothing happened-had to go on line to be told that there are not going to be any more automatic sends-thanks a lot for the heads-up</li>
    <li> Works good, but very slow.</li>
    <li> acturally I can see hair growth but very slowly. I worth to expect so much, keep using everyday and wait for.the result.</li>
    <li> First: I did not over apply this product.  I was being conservative I used less than recommended because I have sensitive skin.  After two days of use, I broke out with bad acne at the application site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say whether this works or not for hair regrowth since I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Takes time to evaluate the effects. So far, I believe it is working. I will continue to try it...come  on.</li>
    <li> Like many of you out there I really researched hair loss solutions before deciding on this one. I read tons of product reviews and concluded this was a safe bet.  It still very well might be but I will never know.  The reason is that once I got my package, there was a little booklet (not a piece of paper but a whole booklet) that says you need to read it before using Rogaine.  In it there is a whole list of criteria for those who MUST NOT take it. I am disqualified at least 3 times, according to that list... things like, &#x27;Do not take this product if: you have thyroid issues; if you don&#x27;t know why you are losing your hair; if your hair loss doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the one in the picture they provide -- which is at the top of the head, ONLY. (And this is stressed several times). Why isn&#x27;t that kind of information made available to potential buyers before we hold it in our hands?  Biiiiig mistake, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I naturally decided I need to return it.  I&#x27;m a steady customer of amazon and have never returned anything up to now.  So I clicked on the button to learn what I needed to do to return this thing. This is where I got my second surprise. Instead of info on how to return this merchandise, the paragraph that comes up says something about how, for safety reasons, liquids or gasses that are inflammable cannot be returned to amazon.  ??!!  This product falls under that category?  (Perhaps its the alcohol content in it???) In any event: I learn that I&#x27;m not allowed to return it.  \why isn&#x27;t THIS kind of information stated clearly somewhere on the ads for this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway you cut it its a lose lose situation.  I&#x27;m out 36$.  And amazon just went down 10 notches on my trust barometer.</li>
    <li> I like it for so far, but need more time to see the effect</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve either come here after quickly losing a lot of hair or after having unsuccessfully tried a bunch of other things. I am in the latter category. In my late 20&#x27;s I started noticing significant thinning and tried a bunch of remedies, from changing my diet, to taking prenatal vitamins, to using expensive shampoos for thinning hair. My aunt finally suggested Rogaine for Women and I tried it. Here is the thing;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It Does Work. As to how well, really depends on what is causing the hair loss and what your hair is like. For me, I found out my body is producing too much of a certain hormone and I also have very fine hair. So, I would suggest seeing a doctor first before using it, since there are other things that could work better than Rogaine, depending on the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto Using It. As other reviewers have said, Rogaine takes patience. It literally took 6 months for my very thin areas to feel like normal hair again. There are a couple downsides. I actually stopped taking it for a bit because of them.. First, is prolonged use can cause a lot of dandruff. Second, it causes some(me) to lose extra hair the first month trying it. And finally, you need to use it constantly for it to be effective. It truly works best when you also regularly take hair vitamins, eat right and use some sort of hair strengthening/stimulating shampoo. Hence, consider it only a part of your hair regrowth regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results. Like I said, it works. Your hair will never be as full and strong as it was, but you will have hair. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone dealing with similar problems, who is dedicated and aware of what Rogaine involves. I did stop, but began taking it again because in comparison to my prescripted pills, which take awhile to circulate through the body, Rogaine is directly applied to the scalp and is more immediately affective. All in all, I consider it a win.</li>
    <li> Have always had very fine hair.  Last 20 years I&#x27;ve had less and less of that fine hair. Thankfully, have never had to deal with hair falling out like other reviewers.  Just very gradually less and less on the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried a number of products over the years with no noticeable results.  But always avoided Rogaine cuz&#x27;, in addition to the mixed reviews, my trusted hairdresser told me to save my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But about 9 months ago - at age 69 - just couldn&#x27;t bear it any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Rogaine faithfully 2x/day, I started noticing results in about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only those of you who have dealt with thinning hair can appreciate how excited I was when I started seeing new growth.  Nothing has given me a greater lift in spirits regarding my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That lift got even bigger when I added Progaine to my regiment.  Progaine is the \\&quot;volumizing shampoo\\&quot; made by Rogaine.  Love the way my hair looks and feels.  Has bounce for the first time since I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my advice:  give it a try.  You won&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll work for you, til you try it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the icky residue on my hair when it&#x27;s applied twice a day - and waiting for hair to dry before applying styling products is a bit of a pain.  Jury is still out on this one.</li>
    <li> the iteam is as desribed.....it also arrived on time.......I would by fromthis vendor again for future products....very happy with iteam.</li>
    <li> This product  came very  fast the box was all bent up but my product  was OK will buy again  I would  recommend. ..</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING ROGAIN FOR FOUR MONTHS. HAVE NOT SEEN ANY NEW HAIR. WILL GIVE IT ONE MORE MONTH. IF NOTHING HAPPENS I WILL STOP USING IT.</li>
    <li> I Started Using Rogaine About A Year And A Half Ago..  The Results Were More Than I Expected..  You Must Use Twice A Day.. Once In The AM.. Again PM..  There Are No Short  Cuts.. I&#x27;m Very Happy With My Hair Now..  Marie</li>
    <li> It works, I wished it was not quite that expensive. I will continue using it. I do not find it dangerous to have  skin contact&lt;br /&gt;with Rogaine, it washes off easily.</li>
    <li> It does work but you must have patience as it doesn&#x27;t happen over night!  Have been using off and on for 10 years when a bare spot starts to appear and success occurs!</li>
    <li> I am happy I received the product I purchased in its entirety. Nothing was missing and I received the time sooner than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> this does work if you have thinning areas. im concerned about the chemicals, but i do believe with consistent and correct usage, you will see results. my mother has hair thinning, i think one of the prerequisites for using this product is that its heridatary. Also, i think it works for mild hair loss, as oppose to extreme- there are pictures that illustrate what your thinning should look like if your using this product. I ran out of my first bottle--def buying more, small bottle for the price, so for that drawback i rate with 4 stars!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product and helping my wife to stop loosing her hair.  It is safe and easy to use without any problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product for about 3 years and so far very satisfied. I use only half the dose and so far my hair is fuller enough to cover the thin hair.  Thanks for Rogaine.</li>
    <li> Tried it.  Messy.  No results after a month.  Just gave up after a while.</li>
    <li> The seller was fine but the product doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 months.  As the product information states it takes a few months before you can see regrowth, although the hair loss should stop quickly.  You have to be willing to commit to using it twice daily so it is best suited for someone who can keep that kind of daily regimen.  I am glad I decided to try it and wish I had thought of it sooner.</li>
    <li> My wife won&#x27;t give it up.</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of hair during my pregnancy. I bought this because i had a bold spot  in the front of my hair&lt;br /&gt;The hair started growning back after using 2 bottles only</li>
    <li> My wife suffers from Lupus and hair loss. We have been using it by recommendation of our dermatologist but the flyer says it may take up to four months to see results. It is expensive but if it works, it will be worth it. It may not have an affect if lupus is causing the hair loss.</li>
    <li> ...Definitely gave me an allergic reaction. I had to see the doctor because my scalp &amp; ears were itching like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I&#x27;m mad at myself for buying the 3 pack instead of the single.</li>
    <li> The item was received in a timely manner.  It is not an immediate sure for thinning hair and must be taken twice a day, permanently.  I&#x27;m hoping it will work, but have only been using for a month.  No noticeable change yet.</li>
    <li> I think it is okay I  am trying it and will get more when you have a special on it.  It probably needs a little time to be effective but am willing to use it.  Let me know if you have a special on it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine since 9 months-morning and evening and it does work. I have seen hair coming back on the crown area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) you get a lot of hair back after using it for 6-8 months(in my case it took that long).&lt;br /&gt;2) you start to see results in 3 months though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1)Have to use it for a lifetime now. Part of daily health and beauty regime! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this prosuct for a month now and it seems to be working..so glad. I love having my hair long and don&#x27;t want to be losing it.</li>
    <li> This review is about Minoxidil which works well in treating or reducing hair loss and Rogaine works because it contains minoxidil. Please test before you use on a little hidden patch of your skin, that&#x27;s all you need to know. Below is just my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thinning hair problem so I used Minoxidil products for years: Shampoos, and scalp treatment. And it works as long as you keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;Then all of a sudden I developed and allergy to minoxidil. My scalp was very itchy, burning and painful, I saw a dermatologist and she gave me steroids to heal.and I never used products that contain minoxidil ever since unless it&#x27;s in the ingredients and I just didn&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;An ex bf of mine was using rogaine ( I didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s minoxidle). All I did was touching his hair. The next morning whichever part of my body my hands touched was red and swollen with bumps:My face, my arms  and parts of my chest and legs. and it got worse the next day and worse the next day, my face was unlookable. It took a while for my skin to calm down and go back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;Please if you know something that works for thinning hair that does not contain minoxidel please let me know.</li>
    <li> Been using this along with Maxi- Hair,  the combination of the two is why my hair has grown so much.  I am 70 yrs young and I was completely  bald at my temple .  Now I have hair to brush and don&#x27;t see my scalp anymore...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, and for the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been losing more and more hair that wasn&#x27;t replaced by new hair growth.  My hair is very thin and patchy.  My dermatologist suggested that I use Rogaine for Women, and it took me a long time to decide whether I wanted a lifetime of commitment to Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using it for nearly two and a half months religiously and to my surprise, the large embarrassing openings in my hair are closing.  I hope the new hair growth will continue in the months ahead.</li>
    <li> I like it because it becomes to reinforce the folicule of the hair.  Also It helps to maintain my hair stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carmen Camilo&lt;br /&gt;D. R.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.. I have been using the product for over a month and the hair loss stopped I used to go crazy every time I take a shower or brush my hair and see that much of hair falling.. I guess if the hair stopped falling then some hair must be growing waiting to see the results in couple of months... And ladies watch your diets and use food supplements if u don&#x27;t have enough vitamins and fibers in ur food good luck everyone....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A happy customer</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t get a full head of hair with this product, but if you have drastically thinning hair, Rogaine will help. At one time, my hair was embarrassingly thin with a wide part on the top of my head. Now it isn&#x27;t noticeable. In my case, I had to use Rogaine faithfully twice a day for three months before I started to notice any change. (I had used it twice previously, but had given up too soon before seeing any results.) You must continue to use Rogaine regularly. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll lose your hair again.</li>
    <li> So far, nothing to report.  My understanding is that it takes a couple of months before growth will appear.  Ask again in a few months.  I&#x27;m not giving up yet!</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for over a month. no help rather hair loss has increased considerably&lt;br /&gt;it was soooooo scary, I lose a lot of my hair, which make me soooooooooooooooooooooooooo concern&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will not recommend you guys  using it&lt;br /&gt;noooooooo&lt;br /&gt;plz dont buy it</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and was as expected.</li>
    <li> I have now used the product for about six weeks and I am more than satisfied with what I see. It is however important to mention the fact that I did combine this with biotin tablets (maximum strenght). If you have hair regrowth issues like I do, this is the best solution to use, at least based on my experience BUT at the same time combine this with biotin maximum strenght. This is what I am doing right now and getting excellent results. You get both products at AMAZON markets place at excellent prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> There is nothing like Rogaine to regrow hair.  The other nonsense you see advertised is just that.  If you are losing your hair, this is the product to buy.  It works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had nice thick hair, so when I noticed I had some thinning up top i was horrified. I was like, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t i have enough insecurities?? now my HAIR has to be another one?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some stress going on. And to be honest, vegetables/fruits/water weren&#x27;t exactly my friends. So over the past month and a half, along with women&#x27;s rogaine, i&#x27;ve been eating healthier, exercising, and drinking water and taking biotin. I definitely notice new growth in the top of my head and it gives me confidence ! I know it&#x27;s the rogaine working and not just my change of lifestyle because i notice other hairs..on my face lol. But it&#x27;s okay i just tweeze them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update in another month. Right now at certain points i can see my scalp (when i&#x27;m staring at the mirror..im not sure others can see it..) and my hairline isn&#x27;t full straight. (Some parts have more hair than others)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update June and let you know if anything changes. so far, i&#x27;m happy! and i feel good that i have a sense of control with this hair loss thing. I also take biotin that i ordered from amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT: NOVEMBER 2013: I went off of it for a while because I wasn&#x27;t seeing much of a difference, and hair immediately thinned up again. I&#x27;m back on it and DEFINITELY have more hair on the crown area its not perfect you can still see my skin but also you can see more hairs and i&#x27;m happy. I also have been working out and taking biotin pills. It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s better. I came to a point where i reached a \\&quot;no fear\\&quot; spot. I decided, if it gets super thin iw ill get a hair topper or a wig. Once i let the fear go and have just been taking the rogaine i&#x27;m more patient and i see more hair. unfortunately my face is covered in hair so im always tweezing/threading/waxiing. but my hair is showing promise!!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT JANUARY 2014* I have stopped taking Rogaine for the past few months. Frankly, i was tired of having to put it on, and i didn&#x27;t see a huge difference. Also, my face was covered in hair and i looked older. There is a rumor going on the internet that Rogaine makes you look older, I look older i dont know if it&#x27;s just time or if it&#x27;s the rogaine. but anyways, im off of it. I didn&#x27;t want to put something on my body that wasn&#x27;t giving me A plus results. I started researching wigs/toppers. something that int he past i would have shuddered about but now i realize there are so many fantastic hair alternatives for women. There are wigs that can give women nicer hair than they would ever have been able to naturally! Or toppers which add that extra umph. I am now addicted to researching toppers and wigs and have some great toppers which make my hair look fuller. The best thing is that i don&#x27;t have to invest so much money into rogaine, nor do i have to put that stuff on my head anymore. Look into it ladies, now adays extensions are common . There is nothing wrong with wearing fake hair when we as women wear padded bras, makeup, and fake eyelashes. THere is nothing wrong with wanting fabulous hair ! no need to feel self conscious over hair loss anymore.older.

    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but I am sure I will. Easy purchase!</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect when using this product, but it does work. I have been using it for seven months and first noticed that when I wash my hair, I was not losing to much hair. It took about three months to really notice that new hair is growing in. Easy to use and has no bad smell. I recommend this to any of my friends that are complaining about thinning hair.</li>
    <li> So far looks good. I see new growth. To early to really be positive. Time will tell. I&#x27;ve only used it for thirty days.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for two days so can&#x27;t really write a review.  I would like to say that when the package arrived it was all crushed  as it wasn&#x27;t wrapped well.  The bottles were not damaged.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over 2 months now and have really started to see a difference. I was losing hair fast after going onto new medication, but Rogaine has not just halted the loss, it is getting my hair back.</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist and tell all of my customers that to use Rogaine for their hair.I tell them that if they start,they have to use it for the rest of thier lives.I think that is okay because one bottel last for 4 months</li>
    <li> It works for me! Been using it for years. My silk like hair is not bountiful and stronger than ever.</li>
    <li> i THOUGHT ITD BE A SHAMPOO TYPE OF THING BUT IT&#x27;S LIKE A MEDICINE YOU DROP ON THE BALD SPORT OF YOUR HEAD. IT SUCKS FOR ME TO BE HONEST, I DON&#x27;T HAVE BALD SPOTS I JUST WANTED MY HAIR TO GROW. PLUS YOU HAVE TO APPLY A HUNDRED TIMES A DAY(3 TIMES ACTUALLY) ITS ON WHAT U LIKE. I WILL PROBABLY NEVER USE IT AS I AM NOW, JUST SAYING.</li>
    <li> This product was used for 12 months and my hair did not stop falling out.  Were unable to figure out why it was.  I believe this product would help someone else.</li>
    <li> Used this for 20 years and my hair is full and thick, no bald spots.Sometimes it&#x27;s a nuisance to apply it but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Considering I am old (over 70) and gray, this stuff must do some good because I seem to have a lot more hair after one year of use. The price is good and you can&#x27;t beat the convenience of have it brought to your door, also NO SALES TAX!</li>
    <li> Saw the results my sis had with this and now I am trying it.  I think it&#x27;s a bargain for three bottles.</li>
    <li> I had a right side part that seemed to be widening and a slight recession of the hairline in the same area. I have reordered twice because it actually seemed to be filling in the hair growth in that area.</li>
    <li> It has been 3 months since I began using Rogaine for Women Hair Regrowth treatment.  I have not seen any noticeable growth but on the other hand, I have not lost any additional hair.  The instructions stated it may be 6 months before I notice anything.  I am going to order another 3 pack and see what happens in the next 3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months now and cannot tell if it&#x27;s working.  I have thin hair which is also fine.  Even if its it growing hair it makes my hair feel coarser. However, I don&#x27;t think I will keep using it as I don&#x27;t want to put chemicals on my head just to make my hair feel fuller.</li>
    <li> this women hair regrowth treatment is very good,,i use it everyday,,and this smile have less sweet,,very good..i decided to use it a long time ,,i want my hair can grown very fast and more...thx</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product, since I got sick and started to lose my hair from a change in diet. Will continue to use it until my hair grows back.</li>
    <li> But at least it&#x27;s keeping the hair that&#x27;s there - there!&lt;br /&gt;I keep using it and will continue as I&#x27;m afraid not to.</li>
    <li> Dear Rogaine women&#x27;s marketing: I just watched your ad on television  (conveniently prime time) and I have a problem with the slogan &amp;#34;More is Beautiful!&amp;#34; This statement ensenuates that less is ugly. Please tell the black woman who hears comments about how her hair is &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34; and can&#x27;t grow that more is beautiful. Please tell the mother who just lost her hair due to chemo that &amp;#34;more is beautiful &amp;#34;. Seriously, stop being part of the problem! All hair is Beautiful!  Lift up your audience, don&#x27;t beat them down into buying your products. This is a harmful ripple effect. BTW that was some free marketing advice . Your welcome.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Anderson</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month so I haven&#x27;t seen a big improvement, but I&#x27;m still hopeful that it will work :-)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review about this product but because of the bad reviews that I saw on it I will.&lt;br /&gt;First off this product works and there is no doubt about it period.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I started using it was after I had my baby (obviously also after I stopped breast feeding just in case).&lt;br /&gt;I lost a lot of hair and I started once in the morning and at night. My hair grow beautifully and fully. I was and still I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes also when I see that I am loosing more hair than usual I get this product again and I always get to control the loosing and I grow more hair. It works, no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;The people who is talking about side effects like head Aches, loosing more hair or whatever they must definitely have other health problems that they must find out what is going on with them. But it is not the product causing this. This is why I am writing this review, because nobody likes to loose hair and if you try you don&#x27;t have nothing to loose and definitely not more hair  You will be happy. And if you have other health problems get to know your body first before talking about something that you don&#x27;t have any idea. Love!!!</li>
    <li> Totally ineffective. I had to throw out all 3 bottles. I suspect there were no active ingredients in it. Total scam, money out the window.</li>
    <li> Really bad ,I lost more hair with this product!!!</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described. Shipped quickly and arrived promptly. Great buy</li>
    <li> This product really works! I started using it the first week of July and have been using it daily since then. After about a month, I could already see the thin area filling in. My only problem is making one bottle last an entire month. So, I just use it as directed and order a new supply when I start running low. Other than that, this product is nothing short of amazing!!</li>
    <li> THis  Rogaine  works and  after  2 months you will see  growth, Use  twice a  day 7 days a week. Might make your scalp  itchy so I  put oils  on my scalp about  2 to 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> keranique works much better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 47 year old who just had hair extensions removed after wearing them for 6 months.  My own highlighted hair was so thin it was embarrassing.  It would barely hold the weight of the pony tail holder.  I felt like crying every time I had to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has used Rogaine for years and he suggested that I try it. It has been a couple of months and I am experiencing hair growth like a pregnant woman.  I am in shock.  My sister is now starting to use Rogaine too.  It was a little itchy but nothing terrible.  My hair stylist said she has never seen my hair so thick and she has been &amp;#34;cutting&amp;#34; it for 8 years.  Not that there was ever much to cut, it was always more like trimming up broken edges.... I am very happy with the product, and when I am done with my 2% bottle I&#x27;m going to use the stronger 4% for men.</li>
    <li> Let me first explain that my hair is somewhat thin but has natural curl and good body. I have noticed that it has been getting thinner in the crown and at the temples and thought I would try the Rogaine remedy and see if it worked. This is my follow up purchase of Rogaine for Women and I have to say that I did see a slight improvement in hair growth. Although the hair that has been coming in is somewhat coarse and frizzy, I say it is better than a thin spot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using Rogaine two weeks ago, very easy to use.  I&#x27;m hoping I get good results like some of the reviews.  I&#x27;m thinking positively.</li>
    <li> I just finished my second month. I think I feel a difference so far. Possibly a little more thicker. I sit it on my bathroom sink so it reminds me to put it on. So far ive done good and havent missed a day (twice a day applications)&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars because I did notice that it makes me break out around the hairline. I normally dont break out at all so this was unusual for me. Im going to continue using it twice daily for the rest of the 3 months. I will update once the 3 months are up.</li>
    <li> This product is really worht of it. We have purchased it for my wife. Beleivne me you will see the effect in a month.</li>
    <li> i USED ROGAIN AND IT&#x27;S BEEN HELPING ME SLOWLY SO YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT AND CONSISTENT, USE IT TWICE A DAY, I HAVE HORMONAL HAIR LOSS AND IT HAS BEEN GREAT, ALSO FOR MY EYEBROWS.</li>
    <li> works for me... it has slowed my hair loss and I definitely have regrowth... my hairdresser says she sees a huge difference.  It&#x27;s a slow process but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Product definitely works! Unfortunately , after several months of using it,  i have developed a rush, so I can not continue anymore and will be looking for an alternative treatment..</li>
    <li> I was happy with result and stopped to use. Now I know it&#x27;s better to use constantly. I really recommend it! I reordered because it helped me not to loose more hair and regrow them  - it was about a year ago. I decided to restart the treatment. It really helps for a bold area of the head.  I used to have a very-very thick hair but started to loose a lot in some area, I think because of age. First time I used for 4 months following the instruction twice a day and saw the beautiful result - I was so happy! but stopped to use and it was a mistake. Now I know it&#x27;s better to use constantly. I really recommend it !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 4 months and do not see any growth of new hair.  Didn&#x27;t work at all!!</li>
    <li> Too early to rate this product; I have only used it for a month.  N changes as of yet.</li>
    <li> I have hair loss along the edges and at the crown of my head. Went to surgeon who suggested that I try Rogain. He said it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. Been using it for four months with no new hair growth. My doctor told me I should see a difference in three months. Will try for a total of six months, but do not expect success. Will consider one of the new surgical procedures.</li>
    <li> after 2 month i got baby hairs on my face everywhere and i don&#x27;t know what i should do...I have to find something for hair remover or wax its horrible ..</li>
    <li> This stuff worked miracles on my bald noggin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve got hair growing out of my nose. my ears and my eyebrows have long stiff wirey hairs now beginning to appear!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s to much trouble to use everyday. Gotta try something else.</li>
</ol>
