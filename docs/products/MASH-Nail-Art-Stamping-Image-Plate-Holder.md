      <li>Mash is a great product.</li>
      <li>Pleased with product!!</li>
      <li>Wonderful plate,love it:)it helps me to do my favorite nail art.</li>
      <li>Good plate holder.</li>
      <li>Best to use stamping plate on paper towel since you have to clean after each stamp.</li>
      <li>I need to use this more!</li>
      <li>It works great and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>But i am going to buy nail pens and draw my own designs instead.</li>
      <li>Great price and very useful product.</li>
      <li>I love love love love love this product.</li>
      <li>Love all of their items.</li>
      <li>Absolutlely LOVE the plates though.</li>
      <li>But that is my opinion you might have better luck.</li>
      <li>I love Mash products.</li>
      <li>Fits cheeky and konad cicle nail plates perfectly havent tried with other brand plates yet.  </li>
      <li>What better way to clean up nail polish than with nail polish remover?</li>
      <li>Easy to use and easy to follow instructions.</li>
      <li>the plate still moves while it&#x27;s put inside, stamping can easily work without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is just one more thing you have to clean.</li>
      <li>be fair to the plastic, I use pure acetone to clean plates.  </li>
      <li>Paper towels work just fine.</li>
      <li>The plate is light and easy to maneuver.</li>
      <li>Pure acetone does the best job by far at cleaning polish from plates quickly and thoroughly, so that&#x27;s what I use.  </li>
      <li>but it was cheap</li>
      <li>advise: save your money &amp; think about buying anything more useful.</li>
      <li>I like this image plate holder, cause all the residue stays on the holder and after it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Too cheap to return</li>
      <li>Scrapper slides across everything evenly and smoothly.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much because once you go to all the effort to paint your nails and get them looking nice</li>
      <li>Holds round nail plates perfectly so they don&#x27;t slip and slide around as you are trying to use them.  </li>
      <li>The item works great in holding the image plates but the only thing that i don&#x27;t like about this item is the clean up process.</li>
      <li>I clean my plates and stamper</li>
      <li>When you try to get polish off it also takes off the finish on the holder and everytime I clean it</li>
      <li>So you can scrape your plates on it, but you can&#x27;t actually clean the plates unless you take them out, and you can&#x27;t clean off the polish that gets on it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Placing the image plate on a paper towel is more effective at keeping it in a single spot and catches any excess polish as you scrape it off.</li>
      <li>Everything was quickly shipped and came just as the pictures showed.  </li>
      <li>I have talked to several people who have tried this as well and they struggle to get a nice clean stamp.  </li>
      <li>This thing is more hassle than it&#x27;s worth and stamping is far easier without it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect with these products, but i was pleasantly surprised with the  results.</li>
      <li>SO USEFUL</li>
      <li>Clean up is much easier this way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s possible that a more dilute solution wouldn&#x27;t damage it.)</li>
      <li>MY WIFE SAYS THAT THIS REALLY WASNT USEFUL FOR HER</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get nail polish remover (at least the kind with acetone in it) on it to clean the plate.</li>
      <li>They have a wide variety of designs that fit  a lot of different kinds of people for very reasonable prices and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
      <li>Good job in holding the nail plate in place, just still hard to place the stamp evenly (not the brands fault at all).</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s really</li>
      <li>but this does not hold the plate very well</li>
      <li>Very stable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really nonsense ...</li>
      <li>The stamping disk move around to much and will come out while scraping the polish</li>
      <li>It comes in handy espcially when I&#x27;m stamping on an uneven or soft surface.</li>
      <li>It gets really messy and you end up cleaning up more than you should have to.</li>
      <li>This is a great idea, but would be less of a waste if it was heavier material that didn&#x27;t dissolve in acetone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously, you&#x27;re better off using a little piece of blu-tack or museum putty or something on a piece of cardboard if you really need an extra hand to keep your plates still.  </li>
      <li>I am open to being corrected as this is the first image plate holder I have owned</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t fit too well, sliding around a little when you&#x27;re scraping the polish off, and then cleanup is a pain.  </li>
      <li>The plate holder works as far as holding the plate in place while painting / scraping / stamping.  </li>

<li> This is a pretty silly product, it hardly holds the plate and just isn&#x27;t worth spending ANY money on.  </li>

<li> This product is not needed and even makes the process harder!</li>
<li> I find it difficult to get a crisp looking stamp.  </li>
<li> You still have to hold the plate down with your fingers anyway</li>
<li> THE BLACK STARTED TO COME OFF ASWELL</li>
<li> my wipe is black from the holder.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> you don&#x27;t want to mess it up and have to start all over.</li>
<li> After purchasing it, i think I&#x27;ve wasted my money &amp;</li>
<li> For me the holder, stamp, stencils, and all are a waste of money.</li>
<li> well at least not my plates they keep slipping here there and everywhere.</li>
<li> I wonder if the people at MASH realized acetone would come into contact with the plate holder, because mine is slowly dissolving!  </li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s a useless pice of thing.</li>
<li> Wrong.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the stamp set though.  </li>
<li> A useless piece of plastic if you ask me!</li>
<li> Unfortunately, my plate holder is now in terrible condition because of it.  </li>
<li> hated this product and will never buy from MASH again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works. I am rough on it, so maybe it&#x27;s me but I wish it was bigger.</li>
    <li> I need to use this more! I totally forget to use this when I am stamping! I love Mash products. They have agreat stamper too.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect with these products, but i was pleasantly surprised with the  results. They have a wide variety of designs that fit  a lot of different kinds of people for very reasonable prices and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
    <li> Got it as a set. With a stamper, a scraper, and nail stencils. It all came great looked great, but it does not work well the stencils are smaller then the plate. And the stamppers ends pop off. The scrapper does not take off the extra, it takes it all off. For me the holder, stamp, stencils, and all are a waste of money. But that is my opinion you might have better luck. But i am going to buy nail pens and draw my own designs instead.</li>
    <li> Bought the mash plate holder for my stamping plates. Not really practical after watching tutorials. Best to use stamping plate on paper towel since you have to clean after each stamp. The holder was another item that I found needed cleaning and therefore not needed. The acetone I clean my plates and stamper with was problematic with the plastic plate holder.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me to use this while stamping. The stamping disk move around to much and will come out while scraping the polish</li>
    <li> The plate holder works as far as holding the plate in place while painting / scraping / stamping.  My problem with this product comes after, when I&#x27;m cleaning the polish off the plate.  I wonder if the people at MASH realized acetone would come into contact with the plate holder, because mine is slowly dissolving!  Pure acetone does the best job by far at cleaning polish from plates quickly and thoroughly, so that&#x27;s what I use.  Unfortunately, my plate holder is now in terrible condition because of it.  I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love love love love love this product. It works great and is easy to use. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will be happy to purchase more!</li>
    <li> Everything was quickly shipped and came just as the pictures showed.  I am very happy with this order. I can&#x27;t wait to get to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have found that the stamping image plate is not really neccesary.  I put the plate on a doubled over paper towel and find that is easier than dealing with the plate holder.  Absolutlely LOVE the plates though.</li>
    <li> Holds round nail plates perfectly so they don&#x27;t slip and slide around as you are trying to use them.  I use paper towel under it to catch any nail polish that I scrape off.</li>
    <li> MASH Nail Art Stamping Image Plate Holder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the product states...it&#x27;s a holder for the stamping plates...&lt;br /&gt;And the only way to remove polish from the plate and holder is nail polish remover. When you try to get polish off it also takes off the finish on the holder and everytime I clean it my wipe is black from the holder.&lt;br /&gt;I hated this product and will never buy from MASH again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful plate,love it:)it helps me to do my favorite nail art. So I suggest to buy because MASH Nail art Stamping image plate Holder is the best.</li>
    <li> Pleased with product!!</li>
    <li> Great tool to have at a home nail salon.  Easy to use and easy to follow instructions. The plate is light and easy to maneuver.</li>
    <li> This product is not needed and even makes the process harder! Just use a paper towel or napkin instead! This is just one more thing you have to clean.</li>
    <li> The MASH Plate Holder does just what it says- it holds the stamping plate in place. It comes in handy espcially when I&#x27;m stamping on an uneven or soft surface. Great price and very useful product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This thing is more hassle than it&#x27;s worth and stamping is far easier without it. The plates (and I bought the MASH ones) don&#x27;t fit too well, sliding around a little when you&#x27;re scraping the polish off, and then cleanup is a pain.  I use a paper towel layered over a manila envelope (because trust me, the nail polish WILL seep through the paper towel onto your table). Clean up is much easier this way. A useless piece of plastic if you ask me!</li>
    <li> After purchasing it, i think I&#x27;ve wasted my money &amp; time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really nonsense ... the plate still moves while it&#x27;s put inside, stamping can easily work without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advise: save your money &amp; think about buying anything more useful.</li>
    <li> Aside from holding the plate reasonably still, this is a waste of space in my nail kit.  It even gets gummy and starts to deteriorate on contact with acetone!  So you can scrape your plates on it, but you can&#x27;t actually clean the plates unless you take them out, and you can&#x27;t clean off the polish that gets on it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, you&#x27;re better off using a little piece of blu-tack or museum putty or something on a piece of cardboard if you really need an extra hand to keep your plates still.  This is a great idea, but would be less of a waste if it was heavier material that didn&#x27;t dissolve in acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(To be fair to the plastic, I use pure acetone to clean plates.  It&#x27;s possible that a more dilute solution wouldn&#x27;t damage it.)</li>
    <li> If you want the plate holder get it but it&#x27;s really not needed and I barely ever use it. Paper towels work just fine.</li>
    <li> The item works great in holding the image plates but the only thing that i don&#x27;t like about this item is the clean up process. When using the image plate you are bound to get nail polish onto the plate holder. What better way to clean up nail polish than with nail polish remover? Wrong. It makes an even bigger mess because not only does the polish remover remove the polish, it also removes the writing (M.A.S.H) at the bottom of the plate as well as the actual black color of the plate. It gets really messy and you end up cleaning up more than you should have to.</li>
    <li> I like this image plate holder, cause all the residue stays on the holder and after it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a useless pice of thing. You still have to hold the plate down with your fingers anyway so what&#x27;s the point of this? Too cheap to return (I guess that&#x27;s how they make, and keep, their money). Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it but there&#x27;s really only one way so....I would not recommend it. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get nail polish remover (at least the kind with acetone in it) on it to clean the plate. Oops! Bought a replacement and backup. Holds plate well and plate doesn&#x27;t spin like I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great item except for my mistake!!!</li>
    <li> Good plate holder. Very stable. Fits cheeky and konad cicle nail plates perfectly havent tried with other brand plates yet.  Scrapper slides across everything evenly and smoothly.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE SAYS THAT THIS REALLY WASNT USEFUL FOR HER BECAUSE THE NAIL POLISH FROM THE PLATE RUBBED OFF WITH SCRAPPER AND ENDED UP IN THE HOLDER. THEN WHEN SHE USED NAIL POLISH REMOVER THE BLACK STARTED TO COME OFF ASWELL SO THIS WASN&#x27;T SO USEFUL AS SHE&#x27;D HOPED FOR.</li>
    <li> I am open to being corrected as this is the first image plate holder I have owned but this does not hold the plate very well well at least not my plates they keep slipping here there and everywhere. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> The holder works well for the image plates.  It&#x27;s essential to hold the plates still. I&#x27;m not impressed with the stamp set though.  I find it difficult to get a crisp looking stamp.  I have talked to several people who have tried this as well and they struggle to get a nice clean stamp.  I haven&#x27;t used it much because once you go to all the effort to paint your nails and get them looking nice you don&#x27;t want to mess it up and have to start all over.</li>
    <li> It is what it is. Does what I need it to do. Mash is a great product. Love all of their items.</li>
    <li> I knew this was not really needed for stamping but it was cheap so I thought \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;.  My advice - don&#x27;t bother!  This is a pretty silly product, it hardly holds the plate and just isn&#x27;t worth spending ANY money on.  Placing the image plate on a paper towel is more effective at keeping it in a single spot and catches any excess polish as you scrape it off.</li>
    <li> Good job in holding the nail plate in place, just still hard to place the stamp evenly (not the brands fault at all).</li>
    <li> Got this for my niece as part of her nailart 2011 Christmas presents.  It holds the different discs that create designs on her nails.</li>
    <li> the nail polish gets all over it and it is a pain to take it off  I will not recommend it</li>
