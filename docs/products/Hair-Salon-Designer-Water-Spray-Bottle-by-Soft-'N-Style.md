### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I purchased these for use with my hair, but I also found that the stream spray is excellent for watering extingushing embers in the fireplace before you go to bed without flooding the fireplace.</li>

      <li>Happy!!</li>

      <li>Its a great water bottle.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>LOL...</li>
      <li>The mist size on this spray is adjustable, and I can get a perfect fine mist with this!</li>
      <li>I searched everywhere after my favorite spray bottle broke and was so happy when I found this one!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really good, though.</li>
      <li>Amazing spray bottle.</li>
      <li>Nice, adjustable spray for in-between touch-ups.</li>
      <li>The sprayer has held it&#x27;s own over time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for quickly wetting hair to restyle.</li>
      <li>The adjustment goes from stream to VERY fine mist.  </li>
      <li>The lever pull is very smooth as well.  </li>
      <li>This is the perfect size for occasional use.  </li>
      <li>Leaked while tipped over even while tightened appropriately.</li>
      <li>Even though this had a picture of scissors and a comb on them---these bottles are perfect spray for not only hair use</li>
      <li>We shoot at the embers to see who can extinguish the most.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of this sooner. :)</li>
      <li>Great for misting clothes while ironing, with a very even, fine mist.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ll be using it mostly to mist oil-infused water onto furniture to eliminate odors, so it&#x27;s perfectly fine for that, too.</li>
      <li>Shape of the bottle is great, doesn&#x27;t tip over, no sharp edges.</li>
      <li>It bought this because I needed a fine mist sprayer.</li>
      <li>I use as a mister and has a really fine mist spray.</li>
      <li>This one is really fine.</li>
      <li>Very pleased, and I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>spray cover and power is great.&lt;br /&gt;Was expecting cheap quality for price, but its not&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>You shoot, you get that singe sound, and</li>
      <li>You can adjust the mister, and it goes from super fine mist to a jet spray.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and am planning to order an extra one to use for cat discipline :)  Good fine but strong stream blasting power should get your cat or small dog&#x27;s attention without soaking them too much.</li>
      <li>its fun too!</li>
      <li>A pretty good spray bottle, would say that the handle for the spray is a little too far out to be perfect.</li>
      <li>Produces a strong, consistent spray, and so meets my needs when combing my hair in the morning.</li>
      <li>I love the high quality  of the plastic</li>
      <li>Other reviewers were right...works great, and boy does it sure shoot far.</li>
      <li>It holds much more than the other and, most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t tip over.  </li>
      <li>These spray bottles can be adjusted for either a fine mist all they way to a nice forceful stream which can be useful for a long squirt across a room.  </li>
      <li>This is a great little sprayer.  </li>
      <li>Great little bottles.</li>
      <li>Great spray bottle though it has started to leak a little after three months of use</li>
      <li>The mist is nice and the stream is solid.</li>
      <li>fantastic, fine broad spray.  </li>
      <li>I have used several different types of spray bottles and none of them hold up or spray a good strong even spray.  </li>
      <li>I use spray bottles for all sorts of things, we have them filled with water for wetting hair, we have one filled with water for the ironing board, I fill them with vinegar for cleaning, lemon juice for cooking and protecting apple slices for lunches, I fill them with dish soap to kill yellow jackets, I use them to put leave in conditioner that comes in a bottle without a sprayer.  </li>
      <li>Nice mist and hasn&#x27;t broken quickly like many others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I thought at first it wouldn&#x27;t shoot &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34;, so I cranked it way up and squeezed lightly...and shot the wall 20 feet away.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think that making a decent spray bottle would be easy, but I&#x27;ve bought cheap ones that you buy from the drug store or big box stores and had settled with what seemed to be the standard for what to expect (not spraying evenly, breaking easily, etc.).</li>
      <li>and he absolutely HATES to have water sprayed on his head first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>Water sprays out evenly, and it works perfectly for hair styling or hair cutting purposes.</li>
      <li>Works great to spray on kids hair to wet it down and style.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leak and is nice and small.  </li>
      <li>These sprayers are the right size but only shoot a straight stream but</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The trigger is well worth the prize as it actually works</li>
      <li>Spray to stream is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>Solid, cheap spray bottle to wet your hair or use it as you like</li>
      <li>It is a little smaller than bottles I&#x27;ve seen locally, but we just fill it up more often.  </li>
      <li>The spray mist adjustment, however, doesn&#x27;t allow for a fine mist, so it&#x27;s hard not to soak your hair.</li>
      <li>Barely puts out any water despite trying to adjust the nozzle.</li>
      <li>The spray width seems to be right for my son to do his hair in the morning and tame the cowlicks.</li>
      <li>My 6 year old son wakes up daily with his hair literally standing on end no matter how long it gets</li>

<li> This little bottle has great output and a choice of thin stream or wide heavy mist.</li>
<li> I use the just the base of this because the bottle of the sprayer whose top I needed wasn&#x27;t large enough.  </li>
<li> The spray radius is also very wide, which can be good or bad.</li>

<li> All the other bottles I&#x27;ve tried take so long to properly wet his head</li>
<li> It has a mist (somewhat heavy mist at close range) and stream setting (not clearly marked, but if you twist the nozzle, you&#x27;ll figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This size bottle is a bit small, and I would recommend it for personal use rather than for client use.</li>
<li> The pickup tube is angled to the side so it can be rotated and adjusted to provide maximum suction with no air, depending on the angle you typically hold it at.</li>
<li> then a little puff of smoke.</li>
<li> I should have studied carefully the negative reviews before buying.</li>
<li> however I didn&#x27;t realize how small it would be.  </li>
<li> This product is useless and has no difference with a tea pot or a garden hose, as  it pours water in one solid stream, no matter how the tip is adjusted.</li>
<li> My wife wanted a small sprayer to apply olive oil.</li>
<li> I like the small size</li>
<li> I resolved the problem of tipping by putting a small amount of fish tank decorative rocks in the bottom.  </li>
<li> Small size spray bottle for wetting my curly hair in the morning after bed hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> Its kinda like a game.</li>
<li> -- we bought it to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair in the mornings because she has curly hair that gets crazy when she sleeps.  </li>

    <li> simple product that does the job.  It is a little smaller than bottles I&#x27;ve seen locally, but we just fill it up more often.  The spray width seems to be right for my son to do his hair in the morning and tame the cowlicks.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think that making a decent spray bottle would be easy, but I&#x27;ve bought cheap ones that you buy from the drug store or big box stores and had settled with what seemed to be the standard for what to expect (not spraying evenly, breaking easily, etc.). Then I saw the reviews here, bought a couple, and was surprised to find the level of quality in a little ol&#x27; spray bottle. Great for misting clothes while ironing, with a very even, fine mist. In the second bottle, I have a water/vinegar mix for disinfecting. Shape of the bottle is great, doesn&#x27;t tip over, no sharp edges. Very pleased, and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great little bottles. The sprayer has held it&#x27;s own over time. The mist is nice and the stream is solid. I purchased these for use with my hair, but I also found that the stream spray is excellent for watering extingushing embers in the fireplace before you go to bed without flooding the fireplace. LOL...its fun too! Its kinda like a game. We shoot at the embers to see who can extinguish the most. You shoot, you get that singe sound, and then a little puff of smoke. It is addictive. You should try it.</li>
    <li> I use the just the base of this because the bottle of the sprayer whose top I needed wasn&#x27;t large enough.  It holds much more than the other and, most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t tip over.  I did not use the sprayer enough to comment on it.</li>
    <li> I should have studied carefully the negative reviews before buying. This product is useless and has no difference with a tea pot or a garden hose, as  it pours water in one solid stream, no matter how the tip is adjusted.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for home hair styling.  It has a mist (somewhat heavy mist at close range) and stream setting (not clearly marked, but if you twist the nozzle, you&#x27;ll figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and am planning to order an extra one to use for cat discipline :)  Good fine but strong stream blasting power should get your cat or small dog&#x27;s attention without soaking them too much.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old son wakes up daily with his hair literally standing on end no matter how long it gets and he absolutely HATES to have water sprayed on his head first thing in the morning. All the other bottles I&#x27;ve tried take so long to properly wet his head and it&#x27;s simply torturous. This little bottle has great output and a choice of thin stream or wide heavy mist. It properly soaks his head in seconds. Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of this sooner. :)</li>
    <li> Spray to stream is very sensitive. Leaked while tipped over even while tightened appropriately. The bottle is pliable and translucent.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted; works well.</li>
    <li> I use spray bottles for all sorts of things, we have them filled with water for wetting hair, we have one filled with water for the ironing board, I fill them with vinegar for cleaning, lemon juice for cooking and protecting apple slices for lunches, I fill them with dish soap to kill yellow jackets, I use them to put leave in conditioner that comes in a bottle without a sprayer.  I have used several different types of spray bottles and none of them hold up or spray a good strong even spray.  I had one of these bottles I had purchased years ago at the beauty supply house and just didn&#x27;t want to make a long trip to that store. I found this one here on Amazon and even though it was a little more expensive because of the shipping cost, it saved me the time and gass money.  I only wish they would combine shipping for multiples and I would order 12 of them.</li>
    <li> Great spray bottle though it has started to leak a little after three months of use</li>
    <li> Even though this had a picture of scissors and a comb on them---these bottles are perfect spray for not only hair use but we have 3 cats and every cat owner knows that when you need to let the cat know that when they need correction for jumping on something you keep off limits or whatever as spray of water is just the trick.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt them but sends enforcement of saying no to unwanted behavior.  These spray bottles can be adjusted for either a fine mist all they way to a nice forceful stream which can be useful for a long squirt across a room.  Really great product and would recommend for sure!!!</li>
    <li> Its a great water bottle. My son uses it to spray everything he can find.</li>
    <li> This is a great little sprayer.  The adjustment goes from stream to VERY fine mist.  The lever pull is very smooth as well.  It doesn&#x27;t leak and is nice and small.  The pickup tube is angled to the side so it can be rotated and adjusted to provide maximum suction with no air, depending on the angle you typically hold it at.</li>
    <li> This bottle sprays so well. It&#x27;s great for quickly wetting hair to restyle. It is very good quality and especially the spray mechanism seems like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for occasional use.  The spray mist adjustment, however, doesn&#x27;t allow for a fine mist, so it&#x27;s hard not to soak your hair.</li>
    <li> Solid, cheap spray bottle to wet your hair or use it as you like</li>
    <li> Perfect, has a really good non leak spray.  I use as a mister and has a really fine mist spray.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  Works great to spray on kids hair to wet it down and style.</li>
    <li> Small size spray bottle for wetting my curly hair in the morning after bed hair.&lt;br /&gt;The spray cover and power is great.&lt;br /&gt;Was expecting cheap quality for price, but its not&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy!!</li>
    <li> Other reviewers were right...works great, and boy does it sure shoot far. I thought at first it wouldn&#x27;t shoot &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34;, so I cranked it way up and squeezed lightly...and shot the wall 20 feet away. So, it has a wide range of variations on pressure and you could totally tag an errant pet from another room. But I&#x27;ll be using it mostly to mist oil-infused water onto furniture to eliminate odors, so it&#x27;s perfectly fine for that, too. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Works great -- we bought it to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair in the mornings because she has curly hair that gets crazy when she sleeps.  Nice mist and hasn&#x27;t broken quickly like many others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk. Used it for about 15 squirts and then it stopped pumping correctly. Barely puts out any water despite trying to adjust the nozzle.</li>
    <li> I searched everywhere after my favorite spray bottle broke and was so happy when I found this one! I use it to spray my son&#x27;s hair with water in the morning and it works great!</li>
    <li> A pretty good spray bottle, would say that the handle for the spray is a little too far out to be perfect. The spray radius is also very wide, which can be good or bad. Produces a strong, consistent spray, and so meets my needs when combing my hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> Nice, adjustable spray for in-between touch-ups.</li>
    <li> Amazing spray bottle. It bought this because I needed a fine mist sprayer. This one is really fine. You can adjust the mister, and it goes from super fine mist to a jet spray. It&#x27;s sturdy, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet.</li>
    <li> fantastic, fine broad spray.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a small sprayer to apply olive oil. Yes olive oil as a moisturizer. It works. These sprayers are the right size but only shoot a straight stream but that works. I even use it. She uses the second one for something else.</li>
    <li> Works well however I didn&#x27;t realize how small it would be.  Reminder to always check sizes and capacities!</li>
    <li> Ugh. Saw it at Sally Beauty Supply for $1.50. It&#x27;s really good, though.</li>
    <li> The mist size on this spray is adjustable, and I can get a perfect fine mist with this! Water sprays out evenly, and it works perfectly for hair styling or hair cutting purposes. Highly recommended. This size bottle is a bit small, and I would recommend it for personal use rather than for client use.</li>
    <li> I like the small size but It will tip over.  I resolved the problem of tipping by putting a small amount of fish tank decorative rocks in the bottom.  I love the high quality  of the plastic ask it is thicker than a lot of others.  The trigger is well worth the prize as it actually works and I have had this for several months and keep a homemade detangler in it and have had no problems</li>
