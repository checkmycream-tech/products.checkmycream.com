<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The wahl legend clippers are great! They are perfect for bald/skin fades. Shipping was fast and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Nice Clipper a shade better than the senior.</li>
    <li> Great clippers.  Much better than my cheap cordless unit.  build quality is great. Feels like it will last a lifetime.  Mine came with several guards ranging from 1/16&amp;#34;  up to #8 at least 8 gauards in total.</li>
    <li> After using another WAHL clipper for 10 years (for my husband). I found that this clipper is the best of the best!! This clipper is home used and it cuts more like a barber cut. The 1/2 &amp; 1 1/2 attachment is perfect for blending in fades. Some reviews stated that this clipper is noisy, I myself don&#x27;t find it to be so. But everyone is different and we all have different opinions. All I can say is, if you are looking for a clipper that cuts professionally, look no further and buy this! Give it a try! If you find this clipper to be to noisy for you, just loosen the motor screw a tad and that should do it for ya! Hope this review helps</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t do any better. Far better than any other at this mark. Andis Envy and beauty master are not nearly as good. The newer version is faster and gives off much less heat. Comes with more guides then any clippers I ever owned. Senior is better but 15-20 more. This is barber shop quality with a great motor and blades. Thanks Whal!</li>
    <li> Very good clipper... Am enjoying cuting my hair with this clipper.</li>
    <li> I gave this clipper a solid 5, because it cuts  buttery smooth in my opinion(very sharp out the box by the way) , does the job up to my expectations and then some. Also it doesn&#x27;t run hot as quickly as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the blades..cuts very nice and it&#x27;s powerful. ..only dislike is that it heats up after the first cut..If you&#x27;re doing fades for all afternoon I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my clippers, they are wonderful</li>
    <li> Great clippers! Im a barber and use these everyday! Not that great for cutting down hair but excellent for fading!</li>
    <li> Product came in looking used...the mechanism to make the blades run was bent and the clippers made a LOUD noise.  I adjusted as instructed but there wasn&#x27;t enough power to be effective.</li>
    <li> This hair Legend clipper is the best I ever purchased from the Wahl line. It is a barbershop professional clipper. Very fast &amp; smooth cut.</li>
    <li> Light, powerful, and cuts like butter.</li>
    <li> The wahl legends are great. The reviews are accurate. I would say that they give an effortless cut. It&#x27;s like the hair is melting away. The fade you get from these is beautiful. The long reach of the adjustment lever makes me think that I found the holy grail of fade clippers. I had to lightly sand the tips of the outer blade teeth to dull them due to it digging into my scalp and cutting me. After the sanding... Like butter.</li>
    <li> The Clippers work great. I am totally satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers, best set I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> These clippers are money nice fading effect lightweight. Came as stated in description.</li>
    <li> This thing is really sharp and powerful. Much better and faster that the rechargeable I was using. It is heavy but still has a good positive feel.</li>
    <li> i love the wahl legend im glad that wahl finally came to its senses and made a clipper that opens all the way to a 1 it cuts great its lightweight and doesnt get hot so all A+&#x27;s for me my only problem with this clipper is the fade blade  i would rather it come with a standard blade and wahl still hasnt improved those plastic levers that they put on every clipper other than that extremely great clipper  and is now my fav</li>
    <li> Very good clipper great for fades and tapers especially if you zero gap the blade it will make bald fades much easier</li>
    <li> excellent. very strong and good quality .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to blame Wahl for this one yet, but I have a problem with the screw in the adjustment lever backing out. Every cut I have to tighten  it up. That is an issue. Im not sure if its just that mine is a dud or if this is an universal problem. Another thing is that these clearly don&#x27;t  have the same power as the Icons have. Im gonna test another pair before i truly rate them. Why you may ask. Because Wahl has an excellent track record for great tools as well as great quality overall.</li>
    <li> Great Clippers.  enjoy the fact that they are also balding.</li>
    <li> This is the best wahl adjustable clipper ever created! Even better than the seniors and the masters by andis. The cutting power, the weight of the machine is just right. Kudos to wahl for finally getting their blades right. Highly recommend these to have in an arsenal...</li>
    <li> Best pair of clippers wahl has made.  Clean blends and fades.  Great price! Worth buying. This is a must purchase if u are a wahl guy!</li>
    <li> Mostly pleased with these clippers. First pair of Wahl&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve owned in my 26 years of barbering. Makes getting a 00000 bald fade line a breeze to get out. The powerful motor goes through thick, coarse hair fairly easy.</li>
    <li> This wahl is the best one in the market right now. Cut clean and smoth. Feels good overall. Great and lighter than before. Recommended</li>
    <li> Great tool very happy with my purchase. This clipper was def meant to improve your haircut outcome and time.  If this clipper doesn&#x27;t help improve your kutz in some way just give up cuttn.</li>
    <li> Good clippers. Strong motor. The only reason why I gave 4 stars is because they get pretty hot. Other than that they cut good and the fades are nice.</li>
    <li> My favorite pair of clippers. It blends very well and stays pretty cool. I use them everyday at the shop and the work great on all types of hair.</li>
    <li> I GAVE THIS ITEM TO MY SON WHO IS A BARBER AND HE SAYS IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> Work great a lot of power</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite clipper. I am a licensed barber and I own a lot of clippers by Wahl and Andis and this is by far the best purchase I&#x27;ve made. It&#x27;s quiet, powerful and a clean cut without being too heavy. My ONLY complaint is that I don&#x27;t like Wahl&#x27;s guards. They are all plastic and too lightweight in quality but, that is minor and it doesn&#x27;t reflect on the clippers at all.</li>
    <li> Do mens fades for a living, great clippers,will order again</li>
    <li> Cuts great, love the crunch sound it makes when cutting hair. Good clippers to fade and taper with. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Got these clippers for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day. These seem to work very well, no tugging or pulling. Worth the purchase to give him a good pair of clippers!</li>
    <li> Cuts great.....No pulling....Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Love em &#x27; check my cuts with them on Instagram @NicoVersace . Love that they have a long blad which helps transition a smoother fade.</li>
    <li> This works really well. My wife has used it 6-8 times and it works really well. Good sturdy quality. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> These clippers have easily replaced my masters. I will be buying a second pair soon.</li>
    <li> Love this clipper. I originally was gonna buy the senior or the master. After doing a bit of research i decided on the legend. Here&#x27;s why&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cost&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not get hot&lt;br /&gt;3. Weight&lt;br /&gt;4. Feel&lt;br /&gt;5. Ron Legend of Ronclassickuts</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Cuts better than the senior model. Thought I&#x27;d notice a difference in the motor speed but I don&#x27;t. It cuts clean probably because it is new too. I&#x27;ll keep you posted</li>
    <li> I have been doing hair for 31 years now and I now have 4 pair of Wahl clippers. All different models. And I have 7 Andis clippers. All different models. My worst Andis clippers (a Speedmaster)that were made in China for Andis are still better than the Wahl Legend Clipper which Wahl considers one of their best.  If you want the best a clipper has to offer which is quality and a clean cut don&#x27;t waste the money and buy Wahl. (I even worked at a salon that used Wahl clippers and they would throw away their Wahl  clippers and buy new clippers when the blade was dull.) My opinion just go buy an Andis Master clipper or the very best, an Andis clipper (like a bgrv) with all the individual detachable blades! Now those cut beautiful and crisp with the first swipe up the head, you won&#x27;t have to go back and clean up several times like you do with Wahl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Andis T-outliners, Edgers, Master&#x27;s and their Detachables for about 15 years.  About 4 years ago I bought the Wahl Detailers and I love them.  Next I bout the Wahl Hero and again excellent! I started cutting with the Wahl Tapers when I first became a barber.  When I switched to the Andis Master&#x27;s it was a big adjustment since the Wahl adjustables aren&#x27;t truly the length of a 1 it&#x27;s more like a 1/2.  With these Legends you don&#x27;t have that problem .  The package says that it goes from 000 to 1a however I zero gapped these and they are like a true 1. These are a great alternative to the Andis Masters.  They have just as much power, stay cool and are lighter since they aren&#x27;t metal.  I suppose if you have an old pair of Wahls you can just add this crunch blade to them.  Great purchase, shipping was very fast as well!</li>
    <li> Great clipper I use this often now I like the length of the blade open and how it cuts thru thick hair</li>
    <li> Works as described. Good assortment of attachments. Hope to be using this for many years.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Real powerful and precise, good for fades.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize at the time that five star products are made for ethnic hair but they work good on all types of hair</li>
    <li> Love these! Just wish it had came with a casE. But love them!</li>
    <li> The clipper produced very disturbing sound when I use it in Singapore. I had used the international electricity converter and the Frequency60Hz converter but the very loud sound persisted. Please advise what else I can do to solve the problem. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. They leave a clean sharp cut with no fuzzy hairs popping up. This clipper eats hair like a monster.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a few months now and I can honestly say these cut the best fade of all the clippers I&#x27;ve owned so far. Strong, quiet motor. Sharp, clean cut. I&#x27;d recommend &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> The clipper cuts good and fades well, the adjusting lever gives a better taper then the rest.The only bad thing is the clipper seems super cheaply made even more then the designer. Also when i recieved my clippers the blade was crooked, i had to take the blade of abd align them. Note: the clipper doesnt have a three hole blade so its a little more tricky to align and seems to unalign if not tighten enough</li>
    <li> Very good clippers if you are a barber i highly recommend these for your arsenal very smooth cut to me their beyter than the andis master and the price man i get hard just thinking about it</li>
    <li> This is decent versatile clipper. The only reason why it doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars is because it gets REALLY HOT if it takes you a long time to cut hair.</li>
    <li> lt overheats, does not cut evenly.</li>
    <li> I do about 100 haircuts a week and I love these.</li>
    <li> Great for all around cutting sharp, accurate and light weight.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers, def worth it.</li>
    <li> Highly reccomend this clippers for all around hair cutting. Gives a great cut and has a long adjustment blade to do  a fine touch up on fades</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper in June 2014.The motor and blades are excellent and work well. from the outset the cutting blade could not be evenly set. The bar that the cutting blade sets on and controls the fade is on an angle. This problem has increased over time. Now I am out return and warranty. Sadly I have never ben let down by Wahl . I can only inform others to be cautious and immediately return any Wahl product which does not meet a good quality standard.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these clippers.</li>
    <li> love these clippers! was looking for ones that you could use on wet hair. great for bobs!</li>
    <li> Cuts good., feels sharper, easier to fade, but not zero gapped. The teeth is still too sratchy when having no guards on.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as well as advertised.</li>
    <li> If you are not a licensed barber then you might have a different experience than me. Great product. I like to try different clippers. So far I have tried the Andis Master and Oster Fast Feeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Motor is incredible. Haircuts came out smooth and clean. The crunch blade in my opinion kind of looks like the Andis Fade Blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The guards/attachments that came with the clipper would be better if they are magnetic like how Andis has them. Hopefully Wahl steps up their game on that. Another thing about the package is that it states that it has 8 guards. Now if you thought the guards come in numerical order like I did then you might be a little bit confused. Basically the guards are numbered differently like there&#x27;s like a gap from guard 6 - guard 8 (I can be wrong based on what I remember)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Great Clipper under $50 including free shipping. It is packaged well. There are air bubbles protecting the shipment unlike some other sellers that are cheap and basically throw in the clippers into another box and then ship it without anything protecting it. I had a bad experience with another seller that basically packaged my Andis Masters into a box without any bubble wrap and the blade got chipped. I spend like $90 even though it was free shipping but I had to ship it back and get it fixed up. As for this seller, keep doing what you&#x27;re doing because I will definitely buy more products in the near future.</li>
    <li> MET ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BOX</li>
    <li> So far it has work GREAT. Feels like the real thing instead of the lightweight one I had previously used</li>
    <li> Great feel. Very smooth cutting clippers, much easier to fade with than most clippers. Doesnt get hot until abouta hour of constant use. Very happy with these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a real beauty. You can pretty much do anything with it, like doing the taper fade and all the latest designs. Lucky for you guys the price has dropped 30 bucks since I bought it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product.. Thx</li>
    <li> I was concerned that this clipper would be too advanced for a first timer, but I hate to buy the cheap stuff and figured that it was worth  a shot since the pro model cost little more than the home targeted clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade was slightly crooked upon arrival and I simply loosened the two screws and adjusted the blade per the instructions. I set the blade conservatively and did NOT zero gap the blade. I&#x27;ll leave that to the pros. Frankly zero gapping offers no benefit to me. I&#x27;ll use a foil shaver or have my wife do any clean up on the back with a normal double blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately gave myself a long overdue haircut with great results; this was the first ever haircut that I&#x27;ve ever performed myself. The combs worked well and were the newer style that are supposed to have better hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically wait two to 4 times longer than I should to get a haircut, so owning this tool will not only pay off quickly but will lead to more frequent clean up and less shaggyness.</li>
    <li> Excellent clipper. I get really good fades with it</li>
    <li> Hair stylist for 12 years. Had my share of clippers and trimmers. This one is of professional grade and works great.</li>
    <li> Good powerful clipper love the new longer blades. Only issue I have is that the screw that holds the adjustment arm get loose. Causing the teeth to go from all the way open to close while you are preforming a cut. If not careful you might end up with a awful blend of a fade</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  Sharp, accurate, and very solid.  All the attachments you could ever need.  I love it.</li>
