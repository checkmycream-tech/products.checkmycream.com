    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for YEARS, so there just might be something better out there. Findings a decent foundation dark enough for my skin color and with right thickness to hide any scar or imperfections isn&#x27;t easy. I like this because it doesn&#x27;t go on oily. I have also never used this product alone. To make the look complete, I have to use Bare Minerals loose powder on top of Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> This has my face popping</li>
    <li> This makeup is to dark I ordered from the book and I had BRONZE 2 this look like a 3 r 4 on my face stop selling this wrong color to people</li>
    <li> This product was very dry when it came and so I could not use it much still in my drawer...</li>
    <li> I love this make up, it is close to the color of my skin, applies very easily and blends in good with the concealer</li>
    <li> There was no question about the shade since I&#x27;ve used this product in the past. I was skeptical about ordering foundation online since a previous comment stated that theirs was dried up. My foundation was fresh and is still very smooth as I apply it. I love this option of ordering Mary Kay online! Local ordering can be a hassle and take time, but I placed my Amazon order on a Monday and received it on a Wednesday. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Love the shade go on so smooth for dark skin woman try it sure you love it worn Mark Kay for Twenty years or more.</li>
