      <li>this lotion smells amazing, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot f compliment on the smell</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, never have smelled a lotion like it.</li>
      <li>I got some nice color.</li>
      <li>It does also depend what kind of bed you lay in</li>
      <li>First off this tanning lotion smells so good!  </li>
      <li>By far the best smelling tanning lotion I have ever tried!</li>
      <li>Noticeably darker after one use for sure.</li>
      <li>*make sure you wipe hands after use or you&#x27;ll notice discoloration on your hands.</li>
      <li>Make sure u either wash ur hands after applying or wear latex gloves when applying or will eventually leave a brownish yellowish tint</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this product and it is probably what attracted me to it.</li>
      <li>but it is more like a chemical tanner.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this lotion, and the fact that I cannot feel it on my skin after tanning.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad she did.</li>
      <li>Both of the Ed Hardy tanning lotions that I own smell amazing, I can only imagine how good the rest of their products smell.  </li>
      <li>This is probably one of my favorite lotions and I highly recommend it if you like a gorgeous tan without the tingle.</li>
      <li>gets you really tan fast and can&#x27;t beat the price and smells amazing!!</li>
      <li>all the other lotions I bought work wonderfully</li>
      <li>Right Dark is a quick darkening tanner that works amazing and smells great!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this lotion compared to the first one they had me try.</li>
      <li>This lotion has a more gradual color build-up and looks more natural.</li>
      <li>You really can&#x27;t buy the authentic thing anywhere but a tanning salon.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to get dark fast and smell great!  </li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this lotion -- just make sure to wash your hands after you use it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair and don&#x27;t tan easily but just being in a level 2 stand up and using this, in less than 2 weeks&#x27; time</li>
      <li>Favorite lotion out there so far for myself 😊</li>
      <li>This lotion is definitely worth the buy.</li>
      <li>I prefer a tingle lotion, but this bronzer is worth the buy.</li>
      <li>This lotion is not greasy or wet feeling, it has a light bronzing effect, but most of all it smells GREAT without that funky after smell other lotions with a bronzer seem to get.</li>
      <li>It makes your hands orange even after washing right afrerwards.</li>
      <li>I go to, but wanted to share how much I adore it on here!  </li>
      <li>In fact my skin is becoming much softer (and it was soft from the start), and I don&#x27;t have any after smell.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this is the lotion the girl gave me to try the first time</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really fair skin and don&#x27;t usually tan in the sun.</li>
      <li>It is rather cheap compared to most lotions, but it holds up against its more expensive competitors.</li>
      <li>Ed Hardy makes amazing lotions so even if Down</li>
      <li>and it works very well.</li>
      <li>I go to for $20, so not that much of a difference than on here.  </li>
      <li>once you&#x27;re out of the tanning bed it seems like it peels off of your skin, legs mainly</li>
      <li>I am a manager at the salon a cutomer asked to see all the new edhardy lotions that went up in 2014</li>
      <li>and it definitely works fast!</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this lotion at my local tanning salon, they had just gotten it in (as it is one of the newer releases) and thought I would give it a shot.</li>
      <li>I guess ur better off using nothing there is no difference sucks</li>
      <li>This lotion has gotten me super dark.</li>
      <li>first lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and definitely the only!</li>
      <li>and I like trying new lotions regularly</li>
      <li>Right Dark is a bronzing lotion</li>
      <li>Right Dark isn&#x27;t for you, try something else</li>
      <li>Wow, this is dark and it will change your skin color fast!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this off Amazon but rather in the tanning salon…and though it was much more expensive, I know it was the real thing and not counterfeit.</li>

<li> Not really happy with this.</li>
<li> an excitement waiting for this :(</li>
<li> It leaves a horrible smell on your skin even after taking a shower.</li>

    <li> first lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and definitely the only! Ed hardy products are great anyhow- this lotion smells amazing, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot f compliment on the smell and it definitely works fast! I&#x27;m a slow tanner and with this product I tan fast, with no streaks! *make sure you wipe hands after use or you&#x27;ll notice discoloration on your hands. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is dark and it will change your skin color fast!</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I have ever tried. This is the only lotion I will use...from now on. Make sure u either wash ur hands after applying or wear latex gloves when applying or will eventually leave a brownish yellowish tint</li>
    <li> love this tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> I LOVEE this lotion!!! Down Right Dark is a quick darkening tanner that works amazing and smells great! Just don&#x27;t put it on thick or it will streak. Favorite lotion out there so far for myself 😊</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this lotion.  It does not leave your skin as dark as some other brands of bronzers, but you also don&#x27;t get that weird orange fake-tan look either.  This lotion has a more gradual color build-up and looks more natural.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the tanning salon I go to, but wanted to share how much I adore it on here!  First off this tanning lotion smells so good!  Both of the Ed Hardy tanning lotions that I own smell amazing, I can only imagine how good the rest of their products smell.  There is no burnt after tanning smell.  I must say I think this lotion has given me amazing color!  I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I am a lot darker than I was before.  I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to get dark fast and smell great!  I bought this product in the tanning salon I go to for $20, so not that much of a difference than on here.  Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives nice tan color and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Great product and I LOVE the smell. By far the best smelling tanning lotion I have ever tried! And great quality lotion as well!</li>
    <li> Not to happy found another brand 1/2 price that bronzes much better</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion! Smells amazing, never have smelled a lotion like it. Noticeably darker after one use for sure.</li>
    <li> Smells like mens cologne...</li>
    <li> this lotion was alright but I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again. once you&#x27;re out of the tanning bed it seems like it peels off of your skin, legs mainly and I exfoliate well I just wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and I like trying new lotions regularly and I tried this one and I love it! Down Right Dark is a bronzing lotion and it works very well. I prefer a tingle lotion, but this bronzer is worth the buy.It is rather cheap compared to most lotions, but it holds up against its more expensive competitors. This is probably one of my favorite lotions and I highly recommend it if you like a gorgeous tan without the tingle. I love the scent of this product and it is probably what attracted me to it. I use this on my face daily and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Ed Hardy makes amazing lotions so even if Down Right Dark isn&#x27;t for you, try something else Ed Hardy!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and tans well</li>
    <li> I am a manager at the salon a cutomer asked to see all the new edhardy lotions that went up in 2014 and she asked to try this lotion so we specialy orderd it for her and she LOVES the smell but, she has seen very little results she said that she would not reccomend it and will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is definitely worth the buy. The smell is absolutely wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave the after tanning smell. I&#x27;m really fair skin and don&#x27;t usually tan in the sun. I usually use Ed Hardy Butter Me Brown, but wanted to try something different this year. This lotion has gotten me super dark. Although I will say, one con to this lotion is that I didn&#x27;t notice extreme results using a regular tanning bed. I go to the biggest bed at my tanning salon and notice the difference of being darker as soon as I&#x27;m finished tanning Everytime.</li>
    <li> Great results great price</li>
    <li> Yes it smells good u dont get that after tan smell but it&#x27;s like rubbing glitter water all over your body it does not bronze or do anything and I tan a lot all the other lotions I bought work wonderfully just not the ed hardy I guess ur better off using nothing there is no difference sucks I wasted my money an excitement waiting for this :(</li>
    <li> Awesome fragrance, that everyone complimented me on. I loved the beautiful tan I got with this stuff, and would recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this lotion at my local tanning salon, they had just gotten it in (as it is one of the newer releases) and thought I would give it a shot. I LOVE this lotion compared to the first one they had me try. This lotion is not greasy or wet feeling, it has a light bronzing effect, but most of all it smells GREAT without that funky after smell other lotions with a bronzer seem to get. I love the smell of this lotion, and the fact that I cannot feel it on my skin after tanning. ALOT of times I have problems with moisturizers for that reason, even the ones that claim to be non-greasy. THIS tanning lotion delivers!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. I have frantic results with this. It does also depend what kind of bed you lay in but I would definantly recommend this</li>
    <li> This product is a little deceiving.. My wife thought it was tanning lotion but it is more like a chemical tanner.</li>
    <li> Best smelling tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever owned. Tanned everyday for two weeks straight and got soooo dark. Loved it!</li>
    <li> It leaves a horrible smell on your skin even after taking a shower.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this at all! It goes on dark...but didn&#x27;t help with tanning dark. It melts off your skin if you sweat &amp; stains/ruins $50 bras.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Smells great and provides a great tan!</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great and gives you the golden tan you want!!</li>
    <li> Really great bronze rat a great price!</li>
    <li> Not really happy with this. It makes your hands orange even after washing right afrerwards.</li>
    <li> I got this at my salon today. I have been tanning a mth twice a wk with australlian gold cupcake n it did nothing rly at all... Used this just once today n im dark!</li>
    <li> gets you really tan fast and can&#x27;t beat the price and smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> Ed Hardy makes a great product. If you like tanning and like lotions with a dark tint in them,&lt;br /&gt;then this would be a good one for you.</li>
    <li> Has a horrible perfumey smell after tanning and a strong self-tanner odor</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion. You smell better after putting it on than you do after a shower!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this off Amazon but rather in the tanning salon…and though it was much more expensive, I know it was the real thing and not counterfeit. You really can&#x27;t buy the authentic thing anywhere but a tanning salon. Anyway, this is the lotion the girl gave me to try the first time and I&#x27;m so glad she did. I&#x27;m pretty fair and don&#x27;t tan easily but just being in a level 2 stand up and using this, in less than 2 weeks&#x27; time I got some nice color. This has worked better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used, and doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell or feel. In fact my skin is becoming much softer (and it was soft from the start), and I don&#x27;t have any after smell. I definitely recommend this lotion -- just make sure to wash your hands after you use it!</li>
