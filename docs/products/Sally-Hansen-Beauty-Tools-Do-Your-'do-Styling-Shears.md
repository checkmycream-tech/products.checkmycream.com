      <li>overall happy with the product!</li>
      <li>These will do more damage than you already have if you&#x27;re using them to trim some bangs or length off your hair.</li>
      <li>Work way better than I thought they would.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I used a cheaper pair that came with my husbands clipper kit that worked better than these shears.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re doing your hair at home and not using them all day, every day I think this are pretty good scissors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works fine on humans.</li>
      <li>Good quality for a decent price!</li>
      <li>Is very handy to have this shears,  I use it between hair cuts, good product, well made, sharp an easy to handle.</li>
      <li>These things only cut good twice then they were trash!</li>
      <li>and they are easy to use.</li>
      <li>They are light, sharp and the perfect size for what I needed.</li>
      <li>Very sharp and perfect cut, easy to handle.</li>
      <li>These work just fine for my needs..</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really know what am looking for but they cut great and were pretty cheap</li>
      <li>is great for trimming up edges, but I have used them to reshape an entire haircut, and they work great!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>They fit comfortably in my hand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it to spend more on scissors that will maintain their quality.</li>
      <li>and I really enjoy them.</li>
      <li>These feel more like the scissors my kids used in elementary school.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good to have a nice sharp scissors on hand to trim my bangs when I don&#x27;t have time to make a hair appointment.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use and very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>but for the price, it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t cut the hair the first time, but I do feel like there is more resistance than there should be.</li>
      <li>I bought it after reading good reviews but it is not a very sharp pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>These are much better and they fit my hand really well</li>
      <li>I cut my bangs with them, and they cut cleanly and evenly.</li>
      <li>But that is par for the course with scissors, lefties need special scissors.</li>
      <li>I rated them 5 stars because I felt the quality was good for the very low price tag.</li>
      <li>Returned for a full refund.</li>
      <li>They do a great job and are quite sharp.</li>
      <li>For the first 10 cuts these were fine.</li>
      <li>The first time I cut my hair they were fine.</li>
      <li>These scissors are fine for trimming ends, but they weren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I use them to do quick bang trims or the like.</li>
      <li>I will spend more for a better pair next time.</li>
      <li>I gave them 4 stars because they seem like they may degrade quickly with the level of use</li>
      <li>Not very sharp or effective</li>
      <li>Scissor was exactly like the  picture - also easy to hold - just the right size to cut hair  </li>
      <li>They feel very solidly made (they are a surprising weight in your hand, in a good way) and are extremely sharp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, and it is still in great shape.</li>
      <li>So far it has lived up to its good reviews, sharp and easy for a man to use, these little hair shears are just what I was looking for, this is a good buy, definitely worth the money!!</li>
      <li>Arrived right on time.  </li>
      <li>The shears worked well the first couple of uses but dulled pretty quickly after that.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a bit tight to get a good grip...</li>
      <li>They cut very straight and do not give you a jagged look or split your ends.  </li>
      <li>they are a bit stiff at first, but the more I work with them the better they feel.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I had in mind.  </li>
      <li>I ditched them after the first try.</li>
      <li>You can do better with a pair of shears that are cheeper and meant for paper purchased at your local dollar store.</li>
      <li>Who knew there is really a difference in how scissors perform on hair?!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Nice and sharp.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure these would work great for cutting all types of hair and styles.</li>
      <li>Cuts very well for my daughter&#x27;s first hair cut.</li>
      <li>As the title suggests, I&#x27;m not super happy with these &amp;#34;shears.&amp;#34;  I would say most craft scissors would do a better job of cutting hair.  </li>
      <li>These are heavy, solid shears with a great blade.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I give myself haircuts at home with the Creaclip and opted for these scissors because I couldn&#x27;t see a real difference between them and the more expensive ones. I am thoroughly happy with these. They feel very solidly made (they are a surprising weight in your hand, in a good way) and are extremely sharp. My haircuts came out perfectly, they are sturdy, and they are cheap. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Bought these and use them to cut my toddler boy&#x27;s hair. Love them!</li>
    <li> Only use to trim hair...didn&#x27;t stay sharp very long, but good for the price.</li>
    <li> These things only cut good twice then they were trash! I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m no hair expert but i love these - convinced my bangs turn out MUCH better versus cutting with the regular scissors i was using before</li>
    <li> I got these shears mostly for trimming bangs so needed the points (end of shears) to be perfect.  They are bent and don&#x27;t connect for a sharp cut.  Threw them out.  My kitchen shears work much better.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Recently decided to start cutting my own hair and realized I needed a pair of hair scissors. Found these on here and thought I would give them a try. I got them today and used them and I really enjoy them. I have never purchased hair scissors before so I don&#x27;t really know what am looking for but they cut great and were pretty cheap so I will save tons on haircuts since all I really do is trim my ends but I&#x27;m sure these would work great for cutting all types of hair and styles. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I use these to trim split ends mostly, but it&#x27;s very sharp. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, and it is still in great shape.</li>
    <li> I normally cut my hair with sewing scissors and these definitely work better than those, but the screw that holds them together comes loose all the time and I keep having to tighten it mid-cut</li>
    <li> these are good.  am looking for a smaller tool as well.  thanks</li>
    <li> Awful!  First of all, these came opened - not even remotely in the packaging just sliding all over the box.  When I went to use them on my daughter&#x27;s hair they were the most dull scissors ever and wouldn&#x27;t cut - they just clipped her hair like a hairclip.  I saw some reviews of the scissors being dull upon arrival, but I decided to take a chance since so many other reviewers spoke highly of them.  Big mistake.  Already sent back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and it glides through my hair so easy.</li>
    <li> At last, I bought myself some hair trimming scissors....they are a bit stiff at first, but the more I work with them the better they feel. Very sharp and perfect cut, easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Good quality for a decent price!</li>
    <li> I finally have these hair shears.  Lightweight and very easy to use.  Great for a person like me who does their own hair.</li>
    <li> Did not cut hair properly.  I ditched them after the first try.</li>
    <li> These are great scissors I use to add layers to my hair and and it&#x27;s just perfect. I love all sally hansen products</li>
    <li> Openings for fingers are somewhat small, I had to get use to it and how to hold shears. They are pretty sharp and cut hair just as I want and like</li>
    <li> For the first 10 cuts these were fine. But someone who often cuts hair will need  a better, more durable pair. This shears began to dull after 5 uses but for my purposes these shears have held up fine through househould haircuts.</li>
    <li> With not much money to put toward the enterprise I needed hair shears that my husband could use to trim up my thick hair from time to time, I put in a search through amazon reviews for a quality product that stayed under my budget of $20, and came across the reviews for this item. So far it has lived up to its good reviews, sharp and easy for a man to use, these little hair shears are just what I was looking for, this is a good buy, definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Tried to trim my daughter&#x27;s hair with it but it&#x27;s not sharp enough. I bought it after reading good reviews but it is not a very sharp pair of scissors. They are ok to trims your bangs.</li>
    <li> I only used these shears 3 times before the center screw came out completely. We were able to put them back together but not without a gap that renders them useless. As far as how they cut prior, they did the trick but were becoming pretty dull by the 3rd use.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for... These were VERY dull when they arrived, and when I tried to cut hair, the blades just pushed the hair forward, rather than cutting it.  Returned for a full refund.</li>
    <li> Work way better than I thought they would. I use them for my beard and they give me a straight line every time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to have a nice sharp scissors on hand to trim my bangs when I don&#x27;t have time to make a hair appointment.  Saves me time and money.</li>
    <li> No problems as of yet with the scissors.  And shipping was extremly fast.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen is helpful.</li>
    <li> Sally Hanson always has good quality stuff</li>
    <li> Why spend at least twenty bucks to have someone else cut your hair when you can do it yourself? This scissors works great for the price.</li>
    <li> Sharp scissors ! a bit small to hold comfortably...my hand size is above average so it&#x27;s a bit tight to get a good grip...overall happy with the product!</li>
    <li> They are just OK. The scissors are not that tight seem sloppy so they don&#x27;t cut that well. I have some Scotch Scissors that put this pair to shame.</li>
    <li> I only used this once to trim my hair and it cut straight and they are easy to use. Size is good for my hands.</li>
    <li> I use them to cut my bangs all the time and boy are they sharp!! The shipping and product are as described. It&#x27;s a simple review, but you really can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing these shears. I&#x27;ve had these now for close to a year and I cut my bangs often. I&#x27;ve not had any problems and they&#x27;ve maintained quite well. Consider too: The price (currently $7.59) and the opportunity for free shipping. I would recommend these styling shears.</li>
    <li> Great scissors for trimming my beard.  They are light, sharp and the perfect size for what I needed. They are comfortable to hold and the little finger rest is definitely a plus.  I would definitely recommend these scissors for anyone who is looking for a small pair of hair scissors for their beard or mustache.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I had in mind.  Nice and sharp.  No cover, no oil.  Just basic hair scissors for home use.  I got a deal for what I paid.</li>
    <li> Sharp, and just what I needed for trimming my bangs in between hair appointments</li>
    <li> These work just fine for my needs.. I use them to do quick bang trims or the like. Nothing fancy but good for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought these to trim the ends of my hair - I&#x27;m not a hairstylist, just a mom, unfortunately this pair of scissors was dull, so I had to wear an up-do. I rocked it! lol!</li>
    <li> came in before it was supposed to, we are very pleased with how well the scissors work, excellent quality.</li>
    <li> These work great! They seem high quality.</li>
    <li> These are decent shears, I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to call them professional though. My stylist&#x27;s scissors are much nicer. :) But if you&#x27;re doing your hair at home and not using them all day, every day I think this are pretty good scissors. They cut without any real effort.. just don&#x27;t think you can switch hands. These are for right handers only. I tried using them with my left and and XD they cut nothing. But that is par for the course with scissors, lefties need special scissors. I rated them 5 stars because I felt the quality was good for the very low price tag.</li>
    <li> These shears are sharp and substantially weighted. They fit comfortably in my hand. I cut my bangs with them, and they cut cleanly and evenly. I would recommend these for those wanting to do between-appointment bang trims at home.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, I thought that this would be good value for the price. However, the shears were dull and was not adequate to cut my 3yr old&#x27;s hair. I also had difficulties with the company&#x27;s shipping department when I tried to make changes to the order. My experience is that the company&#x27;s communication between departments is unsatisfactory. I would not recommend this product or this company.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and very sturdy.  Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this for one of my house rabbits to remove tangles in her nether reagons. it does not work well for this job. I&#x27;m disappointed. But whatcha goana do? I&#x27;m sure it works fine on humans.</li>
    <li> I guess I am a bit biased because I have used professional scissors before...I tried to do a full haircut on my sister in law and they barely lasted.  If you are getting them just for bang touch ups at home then they are perfect..definetly not for salon use.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, lightweight, and (I don&#x27;t know how they do this) hair does not move and slip through the blades.</li>
    <li> Not very sharp or effective</li>
    <li> As the title suggests, I&#x27;m not super happy with these &amp;#34;shears.&amp;#34;  I would say most craft scissors would do a better job of cutting hair.  All in all, they get a smidge uder the &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; rating, for their small size and dull blades.</li>
    <li> Spend more for better hair trimming scissors. The blades are uneven at the tips.  I am going to keep them to cut wrapping paper, but will not use them to trim my hair.</li>
    <li> I have had these for maybe a year and I use them occasionally .I have had no issues with them.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades put clumsily on a long screw. The scissor moves in my fingers when I open and close them. That makes this a rather scary product to use. Many other reviewers have also complained about the same thing. I suggest you tighten the screws prior to using.Once done, it can be effective, but till then, its a useless product.</li>
    <li> The first time I cut my hair they were fine. A little hard to get through my hair but fine. The 2-3 times were kind of tough but by the 4th time they were almost un-useable.</li>
    <li> Is very handy to have this shears,  I use it between hair cuts, good product, well made, sharp an easy to handle.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I thought the handles would have a plastic or rubber coating. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m left handed and these scissors are for righties, I guess because when i try to use my left hand they won&#x27;t cut through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them twice (once on my 4B natural hair and once on my friends 3C hair). They definitely gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Instead of spending $30 every time I need to trim my bangs I bought these. They do a great job and are quite sharp. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t stabbed myself yet! Sharp and solid. I definitely won&#x27;t drop this pair on my feet.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately these do not cut well. I used a cheaper pair that came with my husbands clipper kit that worked better than these shears. Very disappointed and will be returning! As some of the other reviewers said these shears pulled my hair as I was trying to trim my bangs. They seem like they are made-well of stain-less steel, but are just NOT sharp!</li>
    <li> These scissors are made for very small fingers.  I can&#x27;t get my fingers through the loops.  I am a male with average hands.  I would say these are girl size.</li>
    <li> The blades appeared quite sharp out of the package, but they don&#x27;t cut because the blades are too loose The fulcrum screw seems welded in place and won&#x27;t turn. In fact, I injured my hand trying to turn the screw (yes, I know it goes counter-clockwise to loosen).</li>
    <li> holes for your fingers are too small. Otherwise works well as a shear</li>
    <li> I bought these scissors so I could cut my own hair at home. I was using regular Fiskars before. These are much better and they fit my hand really well (average female hand). They seem like a good quality for what I am using them for and the price was good.</li>
    <li> The shears themselves seem to be sturdy, but I do wish they had come a little bit sharper. It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t cut the hair the first time, but I do feel like there is more resistance than there should be. However, I think for the price, it was a good buy. They do what they are intended to do.</li>
    <li> These scissors are perfect for my children&#x27;s hair cuts. They are the perfect sharpness ,and are built well. They are also quite comfortable to hold, with a nice resting spot for your pinky. The price is low too, which is a plus. I would definitely recommend this to any at home barber.</li>
    <li> Scissor was exactly like the  picture - also easy to hold - just the right size to cut hair  -  maintainedn its sharpness</li>
    <li> These were reasonably sharp when I first purchased them, and worked fine. After a few months of bi-weekly bang trimmings, though, they got pretty dull. It&#x27;s worth it to spend more on scissors that will maintain their quality.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is some sharp scissors or if they are truly shears. I won&#x27;t be using them.</li>
    <li> actually created split ends while cutting.</li>
    <li> Dull as ever..don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> The tips of these couldn&#x27;t cut my hair at all, and the hair would merely fold between the blades, as many times as I wanted to try cutting with the tips.  These are worthless since you can only cut with the middle and bottom of the blades.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I opened the package to use these shears and they were already dull.  I will probably have to go out and get them sharpened.  Very dissappointed...</li>
    <li> These are wonderful, they work very well and I would definitely recommend these to anyone. I used them to cut my bangs and they did a great job. Great pricing too.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as a stocking stuffer for my wife.  Many years ago she had been a professional stylist, but these days she only cuts my hair, at least what I have left.  Her comment on the scissors, &amp;#34;These are great, razor sharp.&amp;#34;  Of course she made this comment as she edged around my ear.  :)</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair that I maintain at home. I am a \\&quot;search and destroy\\&quot; trimmer so I get a lot of use out of my shears. These are heavy, solid shears with a great blade. They are very sharp and comfortable to hold. I gave them 4 stars because they seem like they may degrade quickly with the level of use I typically have with my shears. Definitely worth it if you want a good pair of shears handy.</li>
    <li> I use these primarily for cutting my bangs. They&#x27;re sharp, but the blades are loose - they&#x27;re not tight and wiggle apart which prevents proper cutting. The hair just slides between the blades or gets pushed forward half the time. Trying to adjust the way I cut to prevent this issue results in crappy, uneven cuts... Of course, the screw is welded to prevent me from tightening it! I knew the price was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> Now that I cut my young daughter&#x27;s hair with these shears, people think she&#x27;s gone to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;This is great for trimming up edges, but I have used them to reshape an entire haircut, and they work great!&lt;br /&gt;My only comparison is using medical scissors, Hello Kitty scissors, and art scissors. Who knew there is really a difference in how scissors perform on hair?! Maybe I&#x27;ll get salon professional scissors next...but for the price, it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought this one to cut my bang. It works great. I have been using it a few times for over a year now. It saved me a lot of money for not coming to a salon $$$ .</li>
    <li> Cuts very well for my daughter&#x27;s first hair cut. Sticks a bit when you open it. The scissors are sharp.</li>
    <li> This saves a ton on hair cuts.  They cut very straight and do not give you a jagged look or split your ends.  I had no idea how much of a difference a decent pair of shears makes.  Also, they&#x27;re inexpensive!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> If your looking for a pair of scissors that will absolutely not cut anything then these are what your looking for. Total useless scissors. Do not buy !!!!!</li>
    <li> The shears worked well the first couple of uses but dulled pretty quickly after that. I will spend more for a better pair next time.</li>
    <li> These scissors are fine for trimming ends, but they weren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting. I was hoping for a sharper edged, larger, heavier weighted pair of shears. These feel more like the scissors my kids used in elementary school. I don&#x27;t hate them, but I can&#x27;t say that I highly recommend them. If you&#x27;re looking for a pair of shears for hair cuts and trims -- I&#x27;d keep looking around.</li>
    <li> MUST SMALL THAN I HAD PICTURED.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that I didn&#x27;t have to go get my bangs trimmed every 2 weeks. I have straight bangs, so trimming them is sort of a process. My kitchen shears were too scary to have near my eyeballs and my office scissors weren&#x27;t sharp enough. Maybe my hair is thick or something, but sometimes when I use these scissors, they fold my hair instead of cutting it, kind of like if the blade wasn&#x27;t sharp enough. I kind of find them useless if they aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut my hair. I still use them, because I would rather try than pay to get my bangs trimmed.</li>
    <li> These will do more damage than you already have if you&#x27;re using them to trim some bangs or length off your hair. They are good for opening up mail, that&#x27;s about it. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> Terrible as the tips broke and bent.  Shall never order again.  Not strong.</li>
    <li> I love this scissors.  I can do a little trim or snip off split ends without causing further damage.</li>
    <li> When I got these one side was warped or something. It had a wave in it so the blades don&#x27;t slide next to each other when closed. There is a slight gap because of that.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Arrived right on time.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> You can do better with a pair of shears that are cheeper and meant for paper purchased at your local dollar store. Please don&#x27;t waist your money on this.</li>
