      <li>Great natural feel..</li>
      <li>Great product natural ingredients you know what you are putting on your skin.</li>

      <li>I would love to leave a good review for this cream to go along with the others, but it simply does not work, although it smells nice</li>
      <li>I was really anticipating good results</li>
      <li>I love that this cream is natural and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the good fortune to have this cream for approximately 10 days, and am very impressed with the diminished appearance of my scar.  </li>
      <li>Good product for new stretch marks ...</li>
      <li>but I now that the huge weight gain is still coming.</li>
      <li>Maybe it would work better on fresh stretch marks?</li>
      <li>I think this will work great for any woman trying to  get rid of their stretch marks,  especially since summer is coming an bathing suit time.</li>
      <li>Such a great product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I have found such an amazing product that I will continue to purchase until I&#x27;m completely stretch mark free!</li>
      <li>Along with regular water consumption and this great cream...</li>
      <li>Your skin will feel smooth and silky after applying the cream.</li>
      <li>It did make my skin feel smooth to the touch, but I didn&#x27;t notice any change in the marks themselves.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH FOR SUCH AN AWESOME PRODUCT!!!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve written a review on anything I ever purchase!!</li>
      <li>It really works!!!</li>
      <li>Based on the reviews I was sooo excited to try this product.</li>
      <li>I have noticed the stretch marks lightening significantly since I started using it.</li>
      <li>This Cream is rich and creamy.</li>
      <li>that aside, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of lotions, Elicina snail cream, emu oil, and various body oils to see how well they worked on stretch marks, and this cream worked the best for me, although it didn&#x27;t eliminate my stretch marks completely.</li>
      <li>All Natural and absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>Been using this since I been pregnant</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super bummed that this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>I gained weight too quickly in my butt and ended up with stretch marks.</li>
      <li>and you really can&#x27;t see my stretch marks anymore!!</li>
      <li>Will be ordering another one pretty soon!</li>
      <li>Has a nice smell very thick and effective for what I used it for, I fact they should sell it for pregnant woman!</li>
      <li>they are much lighter and it leaves my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love how soft it makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>it hasn&#x27;t lighted my marks, maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for newer stretch marks , mine aren&#x27;t more than 3 months old.</li>
      <li>but I do massage it until fully absorbed.</li>
      <li>Its not at all worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I started off using it twice a day (morning and night) for the first couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>Noticed some fading after using up the first bottle.</li>
      <li>This really seems to be working!</li>
      <li>and I had a lot of stretch marks from my first one.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more in the future!</li>
      <li>When I first knew I was expecting I tried 2 creams before this one but either of them came close to Nicci Marie.  </li>
      <li>At this rate, I will be ready for bikini season!</li>
      <li>I really have faith that if I continue to use it they would be gone forever!</li>
      <li>My stretch marks are faded (white), but because there are so many, they are still very noticeable.</li>
      <li>it sinks right in and does not sit on top of my skin like some heavier creams and lotions do.</li>
      <li>bought this cream about a month ago after reading all the positive feedback for my shoulder&#x27;s growing stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had it for too long, but I am loving how soft it is making my skin!</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m in my 35th week and haven&#x27;t got any new stretch marks.</li>
      <li>The only thing it does it make my soft, and has a very light, lemon scent.</li>
      <li>Stretch marks are still very visible.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>My skin feels so different, smooth and stretchy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this cream!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Now i am really worried about my already problematic skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This cream is thick and smooth as Greek yogurt.  It&#x27;s very moisturing.  Unfortunately, a lot of mothers have told me there&#x27;s nothing you can do to prevent stretch marks.  I&#x27;m going to keep using this, and I haven&#x27;t seen one yet.</li>
    <li> Its not at all worth the cost. It didn&#x27;t work as its advertised. I used it for my postpartum stretch marks but this cream didn&#x27;t remove any of it. I believed that this product would help but now am unhappy when I look at the scars on my belly. I ll never suggest this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t smell as gracefully as described to me. Therefore I stopped using it because the fragrance irritates my allergies. I can&#x27;t speak on whether it actually works.</li>
    <li> Good product for new stretch marks ...it works</li>
    <li> Such a great product. My daughter has had several growth spurts that have left her with stretch marks on her legs. This cream actually works in diminishing their appearance. It&#x27;s a Godsend!</li>
    <li> Did not see any results with 30 day use. Great natural feel..light scent, very nice lotion.</li>
    <li> It really works!!! I saw a difference withing 2-3 weeks .the strrech marks are way lighter and skin is slowly tighting.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my skin feel very moisturized for hours. The lotion isnt watery at all. It is thick and stays on. The smell is great too (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> I did not really see much of a difference in terms of reducing the appearance of stretch marks on my stomach. However, it did have a pleasant scent and it made my skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks (maybe I missed a few days) and haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference. I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll see some change when I finish the bottle. If not I am trying Mederma Stretch Mark Cream next.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any results as of yet, will write back</li>
    <li> After having four kids I gave up thinking that the stretch marks would ever go away until I tried this stretch mark cream. I have noticed the stretch marks lightening significantly since I started using it. I really like that it does not make your skin feel greasy like other creams. Your skin will feel smooth and silky after applying the cream. I have also noticed that while using the cream on my stomach area that my scar from my surgery a year ago is lightening too!</li>
    <li> work great on stretch marks</li>
    <li> Right now I&#x27;m 5 and a half months pregnant. I didn&#x27;t know this cream before but decided to give a try after reading all the good reviews. I love it!!! My skin feels so different, smooth and stretchy. When I first knew I was expecting I tried 2 creams before this one but either of them came close to Nicci Marie.  It has a nice subtle smell and you don&#x27;t have to wait to get dress as it gets absorbed immediately. Right now I&#x27;m using my second tube and will be ordering before I run out. It can be a little bit pricey because (in my experience) it doesn&#x27;t last a whole month (I use it all over from my bust to my hips and back), but I really think its worth the price. As for now, I don&#x27;t have any new stretch marks (and I have grown a lot!) but I now that the huge weight gain is still coming. *UPDATE* I must clarify that I&#x27;ve gotten excellent results but I only use this cream in the mornings (as it gets absorbed that quickly) and I use Mother&#x27;s Special Blend All Natural Skin Toning Oil before going to bed, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve could get the same results if I were using only one of them (I started both on the same day). I decided to use both (this cream and the oil) as every mother I know recommended using oil to avoid the stretch marks. The oil is organic and lasts a lot more than the cream, one 8-Ounce Bottle lasts around 4 months (a lot less expensive), but doesn&#x27;t smell as good (smells as vitamin E) and again, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for using before getting dress to work as it takes a lot longer to get absorbed. For me, the Nicci Marie Skincare combined with the Mother&#x27;s Special Blend All Natural Skin Toning Oil its the perfect match. Right now I&#x27;m in my 35th week and haven&#x27;t got any new stretch marks.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. Makes the skin so soft and pliable that I can see how it would prevent stretch marks during pregnancy. I wish I had it around to use when having my kids.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make any difference in my strech marks, waste of money!</li>
    <li> Takes a little but does a good job of making stretch marks less noticeable</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to try,  she has a bunch of stretchmarks  from our last  child.  She has been using it 3 times a day and  the scars seem to be  dissipating and  becoming  lighter and lighter.  I think this will work great for any woman trying to  get rid of their stretch marks,  especially since summer is coming an bathing suit time.</li>
    <li> I have really bad old stretch marks from several large weight gains and losses over the course of the last 10 years. My stretch marks are faded (white), but because there are so many, they are still very noticeable. I love that this cream is natural and it has a pleasant smell. I used this cream religiously every day for many weeks, and unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do anything to improve the appearance of my old stretch marks. It did make my skin feel smooth to the touch, but I didn&#x27;t notice any change in the marks themselves. Maybe it would work better on fresh stretch marks?</li>
    <li> Great product natural ingredients you know what you are putting on your skin. Helps to aid in the disappearance of stretch marks and nourishes the skin very well. I would recommend this to any woman looking to improve the appearance of her skin without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> This yummy cream feels thick and rich when applied and not at all greasy.  I love how soft it makes my skin feel.  it sinks right in and does not sit on top of my skin like some heavier creams and lotions do. It does a great job of hydrating the skin.</li>
    <li> Just in time for summer use,really lovely cream smells great and moisturizing.will definately be stocking up on this one.love it</li>
    <li> A nice thick cream. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to be able to tell if it&#x27;s working. Product arrived on time in nice clean sealed packaging.</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent customer service. Speedy shipping. Cream has a great smell. I am using this cream to help conceal a very nasty scar on my upper chest. Have always been self -conscious of it . After using product for a few days I can see a big difference.</li>
    <li> I Love Love Love this stretch mark cream!  It is nice and thick going on, but does not leave a greasy feeling...which I hate about other creams.  I have noticed a big difference in my stretch marks...they are much lighter and it leaves my skin feeling smooth.  Makes me feel much better about putting on my bathing suit this summer!!  THANKS SO MUCH FOR SUCH AN AWESOME PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> It moisturizing but I dont feel that I have seen a difference in my stretch marks using this product. I also feel that it is pricey for how much you get and how much it doesnt work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple months now and it works amazing my stretch marks are practically gone!! (They were bright red and painful when I decided to purchase this product). The only issue I would say is the amount of product you get.  The bottle is really small for the price I ordered two just to be sure I would have enough to get rid of my stretch marks.  Product effectiveness 5 stars amount of product for price 3 stars</li>
    <li> Bought this to see if it actually works. I must say it DOES and its thick cream but not at all greasy. I have stretch marks from after having my baby ams this has actually lightened my marks I really have faith that if I continue to use it they would be gone forever!</li>
    <li> This Cream is rich and creamy. All Natural and absorbs nicely. AND it works. I have already noticed a difference in the redness of my stretch marks. I love it!</li>
    <li> My wife has been looking for a great stretch mark cream so I decided to test this for her. I have been using this for my small stretch marks on my thighs and sides. I have seen great improvement. All the smaller marks have faded away and are nearly impossible to see. All the larger ones have gotten lighter. We will be purchasing some more of this great cream for sure!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as the product description stated.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cream about a month ago after reading all the positive feedback for my shoulder&#x27;s growing stretch marks. I have been using as instructed, but yet those stretchmarks are extremely noticeable.</li>
    <li> It has only been a couple of days but my stretch marks seems to be getting lighter. The lotion feels really nice and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> non greasy.. too soon to call to see if it works.  I will let you know after my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I am a month in and almost gone through the bottle. I have used everyday for a month and not a single change has happened. The only thing it does it make my soft, and has a very light, lemon scent. For that it deserves one star.I will not be buying another bottle.</li>
    <li> the product has visibly removed the appearance of my stretch marks. Still have a ways to go def a head start. Only 4 weeks postpartum. Its great that there are natural products out there that work.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my body.  The stretch marks are smoother though still visible.</li>
    <li> This really seems to be working! Marks are really diminishing, I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle. Very Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other creams but this one actually worked within a week or two. My second pregnancy has done a number on me and I needed this kind of product badly at 6 months. Happy to report, this has helped to reverse the stretch marks and even remove them in some areas. Recommendation: start early applying and it may keep them away before they show.</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied as I started getting dark skin patches after applying this in my skin. Now i am really worried about my already problematic skin. Im not a happy customer :(</li>
    <li> Does not work.  I followed the instructions and after 2 months it still didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I was sooo excited to try this product. I&#x27;ve been using the cream on my upper arms for over 3 weeks now. I specifically choose to use the cream on my upper arms because the stretch marks on my upper arms are more minimal compared to other areas of my body, so I thought the cream would work really well there. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t seen any change in the appearance of them.....they look exactly the same. I&#x27;m super bummed that this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and already seeing results just after one week. My stretch marks are years old and I can already see the skin thickening and repairing in places I thought would never go away. I Will be purchasing more of this amazing cream because it works! I am just so happy that I chose to make this purchase and they are rated amongst the top when it comes to skin repair!</li>
    <li> Been using this since I been pregnant and I haven&#x27;t noticed any stretch marks yet and I am 35 weeks.  Along with regular water consumption and this great cream...I&#x27;m hopeful that I will be stretch mark free!</li>
    <li> Total waste of money, time and effort. I was hopeful due to the other postings stating positive results but have yet to see any. My post pregnancy stretch marks are exactly the same. I&#x27;m very disappointed! The cream itself isn&#x27;t all that moisturizing and you can&#x27;t even tell you put any on moisture-wise after about an hour. It has a very strong citrusy smell- almost like an orange creamsicle. This smell is extremely hard to wash off of your hands and clothing. I even think the smell grossed out my newborn! You are better off saving a heap of money and buying Palmer&#x27;s lotions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American didn&#x27;t work for me. I was a little disappointed. Trying to get rid of stretch marks that came months after pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 year old daughter, used it as directed on the bottle. unfortunately it did not work at all. Stretch marks are still very visible.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me..I used the entire bottle to decide about the product but no difference</li>
    <li> Great product but this picture made me think it was a 3pack. Pity...</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t remove my stretch marks</li>
    <li> After the birth of my fourth child I was left with significant stretch marks. A friend of mine recommended that I give Nicci Marie a try so I bought it on Amazon. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and my stretch marks are a lot lighter, some places they are hardly noticeable. The cream has a very pleasant fragrance and moisturizes really well as well. At this rate, I will be ready for bikini season! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let bad reviews scare you away.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been putting the cream on twice a day for a little over a week now. I was scared this wouldn&#x27;t work because I have a large amount of stretch marks and couldn&#x27;t even see a tiny change at first. But today, I was changing clothes and literally froze because half of my stretch marks are gone and the deeper ones are getting much lighter. I still have another bottle and I&#x27;m looking forward to losing 95% of these ugly things, if not all of them!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream to help minimize the appearance of a post-surgical scar I have had for quite some time.  I had gotten to the point where I just wouldn&#x27;t look at that area of my body, because of how upsetting the appearance of the scar was to me.  I&#x27;ve had the good fortune to have this cream for approximately 10 days, and am very impressed with the diminished appearance of my scar.  The texture of the cream is great, it has a pleasant scent, and I don&#x27;t feel an oily residue on my skin.  Two thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> I have stretch marks on my thighs and stomach from weight loss and have always been very self conscious about exposing them.  Not no more!  I&#x27;ve been using this Stretch Mark Cream for a few days and I can already see a difference, I can just imagine what it will do in a few weeks!  I&#x27;m so happy that I have found such an amazing product that I will continue to purchase until I&#x27;m completely stretch mark free!</li>
    <li> Works great for it for pregnancy and my tummy to prevent stretch marks and it worked great, my belly felt moisturized from the evening after my shower to the next evening! Has a nice smell very thick and effective for what I used it for, I fact they should sell it for pregnant woman!</li>
    <li> Cream surpassed our expectations especially for my wife who just recently gave birth to our first child. Will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> Feel safe using this cream! Vitamins &amp; natural oils to help prevent, repair &amp; remove stretch marks/scars. I like knowing it is made in the USA at FDA Approved/GMP laboratory. Nice 4 ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> I have not has the product long, but so for so good. I goes on smoothly and it&#x27;s a little thick which I like.</li>
    <li> I recently underwent a rather complex hernia repair which left me with a HUGE scar from one side of my stomach to the next. Being still rather young this was greatly bothering me. I had been using Mederma and I had not seen much of an improvment .. I know .. it will never disapear .. but I wanted to fade some of the horrific scaring and skin staining that I was seeing. I started using this product a week ago and I HAVE seen an improvement .. especially where the skin had darkened (site of staples and stiches). I don&#x27;t use a lot ... a little bit goes a long way .. but I do massage it until fully absorbed. Also, my stretch marks from having two babies ... one two years ago have dramatically improved! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using theis product fo about a week now on some problem areas and can already see a lightening of the scars. Great product, I am impressed by what I see already!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for too long, but I am loving how soft it is making my skin! I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing its progress.</li>
    <li> Noticed some fading after using up the first bottle. Going to buy more.</li>
    <li> I have been only using the cream for 3 days and I don&#x27;t see any results yet. I will continue to use it. This is my second pregnancy and I had a lot of stretch marks from my first one. I&#x27;m hoping to decrease the visibility of my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been heavy, but at some point in my 20s I gained weight too quickly in my butt and ended up with stretch marks. I&#x27;ve been using this cream off and on for about 6 months now. I started off using it twice a day (morning and night) for the first couple of weeks. It made a noticeable improvement in my stretch marks in that time. It was going so well that I thought they&#x27;d disappear entirely, but then progress slowed down and sort of leveled off somewhere around the month mark, leaving me with light stretch marks (which was definitely an improvement). If I stop using it the stretch marks get a little worse again, but now I can use it once a day, or take a break for several weeks entirely, and get back to around the same condition within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest negative I found with this cream is that it made my butt sweat in the summer. (I&#x27;ve never had that problem before!) Sometimes I couldn&#x27;t use it in the summer if I was going to do anything active. (As a side note: if you&#x27;re trying to improve your butt I would also highly recommend doing a butt workout like &amp;#34;8 Minute Buns&amp;#34; in addition to using a cream.) The other negative is the price, but all anti-stretch mark products seem to be expensive, so what can you do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that aside, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of lotions, Elicina snail cream, emu oil, and various body oils to see how well they worked on stretch marks, and this cream worked the best for me, although it didn&#x27;t eliminate my stretch marks completely.</li>
    <li> I would love to leave a good review for this cream to go along with the others, but it simply does not work, although it smells nice it hasn&#x27;t lighted my marks, maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for newer stretch marks , mine aren&#x27;t more than 3 months old. I was really anticipating good results unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get them . I&#x27;ve been using it since February 7th, 2015 no change at all in the color of my strech marks</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve written a review on anything I ever purchase!! I had really dark stretch marks I&#x27;ve tried every product out there, and this is the best yet!! Been using this cream for only a month and you really can&#x27;t see my stretch marks anymore!! Will be ordering another one pretty soon! Highly recommend this cream!</li>
