      <li>I love this product.</li>

      <li>Love the product, but not this overpriced rendition of it.</li>
      <li>Now I use this every day, love it with the mineral veil and primer.</li>
      <li>I think the medium color is lighter than &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;  -- it is more of a greyish-pale tone.  </li>

      <li>it was more shiny which is not what I&#x27;m going for.</li>

      <li>So easy to put on.</li>
      <li>Does not spread easy cakes up.</li>

      <li>Ok, it is a bit pricey, but I find it worth it.</li>
      <li>It feels so light, it&#x27;s like not having on any makeup.  </li>
      <li>I bought this thinking that it had natural ingredients and that it would be good for your skin</li>
      <li>Very unimpressed with this!!!</li>

      <li>I have used this product for a long time and it is just great.</li>
      <li>I was excited because of the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t break out, and it looks very natural and nice.</li>

      <li>However I felt that I got a sample product instead of the full size.</li>
      <li>I have never tried Bare Escentuals or any kind of bare minerals make up, but I had heard nothing but good things.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this product unfortunately it is slightly darker than my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day even though it is not the perfect shade I mix it with a shade lighter to make it perfect. I only have 1 regert and that is I totally need to learn about grams because I always get the 8 grams and thought for some random reason that the 2grams would be bigger but this was my fault and spent way too much for the size I choose!</li>
    <li> Great product, fair pricing, fast delivery</li>
    <li> The product came in a timely manner and was sealed and wrapped well. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Although the size is marked, I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was. I can get 4X the makeup for $5 more from retail stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great makeup but this was a much smaller than the other ones I&#x27;ve bought. Watch the size!!!</li>
    <li> Good transaction.  Will recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used it before but let it go.  I am glad to use it again.  Great product and save for the face.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with how well this works!  It covers very well and looks very natural.  However, one container does not last very long.  I was really happy with the retailer for this product also.  I got my order quickly and they even put in a small container of the Mineral Veil as a \\&quot;Thank You\\&quot; gift!  It was a wonderful added bonus since I had been considering ordering it, but was not sure if it would be any good.  Now I am able to try it out before committing to a big container.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I have tried many other similiar powders but nothing can compare to the Original BareMinerals.</li>
    <li> Covers like it&#x27;s supposed to :)</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it had natural ingredients and that it would be good for your skin, little did I know I was very wrong.  When I got this product I thought it look very nice on but it had horrible side effects it made my face really itchy and breakout with cystic acne in hard to cover areas. I had never had acne growing up, yeah an occasional zit like every 6 months or so, since I have been using this product I&#x27;ve had the worst acne ever.  I have tried everything to try to get rid of the acne, everything from proactive, scrubs, acne creams and gels from my doctor, but nothing works.  Worst of all I&#x27;m starting to get scars from having the acne.  This product contains an ingredient called Bismuth Oxychloride, Yes it is a a mineral, BUT - It is by-product of lead and copper. Since it is a heavy metal, it gets inside the skin pores and causes acne and such other skin disorders. Is this the type of mineral you want on your face? If your really interested in a mineral cosmetic look at Mineral Hygienics. Mineral Hygienics only contains 4 ingredients.  The Ingredients are: Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, Mica and Zinc Oxide.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize just how small this container would be until I received it.  And the holes in the cap are so micro-mini, that barely any foundation gets through even when you shake it hard.  It is too small for my regular foundation brushes.  I think the medium color is lighter than &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;  -- it is more of a greyish-pale tone.  Not really impressed.</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed with this product. It does not absorb oil at all... my face looks like an oil slick all day long. I will go back to my cheaper brand which also provides better coverage.</li>
    <li> I have always used bareminerals, but I have always bought it at the mall. Money got a little tight so I decided to look on Amazon and found it for half the price. I will never buy it from an expensive department store again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I will buy it again and again.  I might consider buying a larger one, did not realize how small it was....</li>
    <li> I am able to purchase an 8g container, rather than this 2g container, of the same product for less than $20.  I realized I ordered the wrong size upon receipt, and kept it only because I was completely out.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and it is just great. I does what it said it said it would do.</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals make up. It&#x27;s the only stuff I can use, that doesn&#x27;t make my face break out. Product was exactly as described, and was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> Light foundation. It is more light a tinted moisturizer. So easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I really like the ease of using Bare Escentials products.  This is a great product for just the right amount of color without looking sunburnt.  I like to use it after the Bare Ascentials Prime Time primer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this makeup for years - and love it!  Most recently I have started using a Kabuki Brush to apply it... and I love it even MORE!</li>
    <li> This powder works well.  I usually use a liquid foundation, and decided to try this instead.  Overall I would say I have been generally pleased.  In the wintertime when my skin is more pale and needs more coverage I tend to go back to the liquid foundation, but in the summertime with a little bit of natural color on the skin and not as much coverage needed I like to use this powder instead.  I like the fact that it feels like you are not wearing make-up and still provides decent coverage for imperfections.</li>
    <li> The product is good but the charge is way too high for the sample size. The full size is usually $26 at Sephora in JC Penneys</li>
    <li> Size of the product was surprising as I thought I was getting the full size product instead I received a much smaller container of the product for the same price.</li>
    <li> not for me as I have mature adult skin....great for younger generation but for older women I would suggest a cream foundation with moisturizer...as bareminerals is a powdery base...I gave to my granddaughter who likes this type of makeup</li>
    <li> This really is not that good. I have heard great things but very untrue. Does not cover well!! Make up blotches and makes you look horrible. Does not spread easy cakes up. Not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I really like the coverage with bareMinerals, but sometimes when even applying a small amount, it feels really cakey and heavy.</li>
    <li> Beware, this is a very tiny container of the foundation at basically the same price as others are charging for a container that is 4x as big.  Love the product, but not this overpriced rendition of it.</li>
    <li> I, Elizabeth Berger, love my new Bare Escentuals foundation because it is so quick and easy to use.  It covers all my blemishes without my skin looking overly made-up.</li>
    <li> My daughter order this and I ordered it a few weeks later and both are KNOCK OFFS.  Her face broke out in some kind of rash and she had to go the doctor. What the heck is in this product???  DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS IT COMES DIRECT FROM BARE MINERALS.</li>
    <li> As others have said (to which I obviously paid no attention until it was too late) - this is a teeny 2g package. Shame on them for selling it for the same price as the regular package which is 8g.  This will be returned.</li>
    <li> My first time to try and I love it, the color was a little darker than I wanted so went into the store to get the right color.  Now I use this every day, love it with the mineral veil and primer.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my daughter and she will never use another, it looks so natural on her face, very smooth.  I have purchased it several times because it does not come in a bigger container.</li>
    <li> I use bareMinerals and love it but I was bothered by the size of the container.  It was the same size as the blush.  I was thinking that ordering it would save me from having to go to the store and fight the traffic.  But, the size was much smaller than the ones I buy in the store.  I will have to buy it in the store in order to get a larger size container.  The extra money will not be as much of a problem to have some that last longer.  Other than the size I still love the foundation.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it feels like you&#x27;re not wearing make-up at all and it stays looking the&lt;br /&gt;same throughout the day without having to re-apply.</li>
    <li> Item was perfect. Super fast shipping. I am very happy with this transaction. BareMinerals always makes a great product. I have been using their products for about 8 years. Haven&#x27;t found one that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, not quite like the last container I bought from Ulta, so i have to wonder....  It was however the larger size, and not the tiny size many are discussing in reviews.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals and was happy to find it at a less expensive price. However, I did notice it is a smaller size than the one typically sold at the local retailer. Love it but I&#x27;m not sure it is less expensive.</li>
    <li> Have used for years.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but the container size is ridiculous. This is a TINY package for the same price as the regular sized package, which is 4x the size. Read carefully.</li>
    <li> This was not worth the price.  I didn&#x27;t know I was getting a sample size!  I&#x27;ll read more closely the next time!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with how well this works! It looks so natural and covers well. love this product because it feels like you&#x27;re not wearing make up</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals, and when I ordered this one from Amazon I was excited because of the price. However,when I got it and put it on,it looked completely different and not good at all. I had a little bit of bare minerals left over from my previous one,which I purchased from a well known makeup store that I trust gets their bare minerals products from the company that makes it,so I put that on and it looked so much different and better than what I ordered from Amazon. I will not be purchasing bare minerals from the seller again that I got this from on Amazon. It didn&#x27;t have the look,the feel or even the consistency that bare minerals has,I was very disappointed:(</li>
    <li> I like Bare Minerals but buyer beware - this is a much smaller size than you can get in the store for about the same price.  I normally get the 9g size and did not notice that this is only 2 g.</li>
    <li> I have tried Bareminerals before and didn&#x27;t like it. I do not like it on bare skin I like to use a tinted moisturizer such as Nars and then apply the bareminerals it hold up all day and looks great like i have nothing on!!</li>
    <li> I went to a Bare Minerals store in Mall of America to try it out. The gal working there chose a color that looked great and applied it. I told her I would buy it if after an hour it still looked great. I looked in a mirror in daylight rather than the mall lights and it looked awful! Color was matched great but it accentuated my pores and made my skin look pasty. People who have noticeable pores should never ever use a powder!</li>
    <li> My wife was dismayed at how small it was. We actually Laughed ....... she obviously won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> RIP OFF!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Way over priced for quantity!!!! Carefulle read description!!! I&#x27;m a stay at home mom of an infant and made this purchase in a rush.... Never again will I purchase from this seller and I will pay more attention to description next time!!!</li>
    <li> Not the original! Dont buy! Smaller than the original bareminerals!!!!!! Very unhappy with the product! Xo xi xo xo xo</li>
    <li> I assumed I would be getting a full size container for this price. I should have double checked. Ooops. This size is way overpriced so I will be purchasing from a local spa. Save your money and buy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Only wish that there was more in the jar. I really love this stuff. It gives me coverage and color.</li>
    <li> I tried Bare Minerals this weekend and today at work and was not happy with how it made my skin look at all. I really wanted to like this product.  After working with the gal at the cosmetic counter at Macy&#x27;s for quite a while, I settled on Medium for the color.  The next day in the light I realized it looked way too light and ghostly and chalky.  WhileI loved the feel of it on my skin, it seemed to magnify my pores, wrinkles around my eyes and have a ghostly look to it.  I do like the primer though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that Gabriel Cosmetics Duo Foundation Powder (which is also a mineral base) have great coverage and work much better on my sensitive skin and that the colors match my skin tone much better.</li>
    <li> Very little product for the money</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Why do I have to add 19 more words if I already raved about the product?&lt;br /&gt;And now you want 3 more words?</li>
    <li> best and i think best for skin, makes sense regarding purity.  makes skin look natural and conceals blemishes very well.  must use with their brand &#x27;prime time&#x27; primer, that really the winning product.</li>
    <li> It looks natural and covers flaws.  The SPF broad spectrum was an added plus!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation and it was priced good and quick delivery</li>
    <li> This is a rip-off; it is only 2g. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see this when I bought it otherwise I would have just bought the regular 6g for $27.&lt;br /&gt;Also, a rash broke out on one side of my face so I think this is fake stuff. I&#x27;ve used bare essentials for many years now and I&#x27;ve never had a rash break out.</li>
    <li> I love the way it goes on, so light and silky. A little goes such a long way!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, great product!</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I have previously ordered.</li>
    <li> This is not a value...this is the small size that comes in trial kits.  It is advertised as a big value but my failure to fully read the size has caused me to overpay for this product.  I am not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this product is similar to the tiny sample sizes.  Totally overpriced when the full sized container is only a few dollars more. It&#x27;s my fault for not closely reading the description or reviews.</li>
    <li> Not sure how I feel about this</li>
    <li> Shame on me for not paying attention! I.  have been using this great product for many years and love it. Pay attention to the company who is selling it. As other reviewers stated this is a 2g size not the average 8g size! Should be about  $25 for 8g.Wish I read reviews first. Great product, shady seller!</li>
    <li> misleading... not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> Not too happy with this product. I&#x27;m not sure if its my skin type but it was pretty cakey and the colour was weird. Probably more for pink undertones.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over 20 yrs. glad its on amazon.com. I would never use anything else on my face. its the best product ever for all women, i bought it for me and my daughter and my grand daughter. they all love it, and my froiends think I look younger using it.</li>
    <li> I should have paid closer attention to the size of the container.  This was not the full size you get when ordering direct from Bare Minerals.  Should have know the price was to good to be true. My fault, next time will order direct w/ bareMinerals.</li>
    <li> I have been buying BareMinerals foundation from Amazon for over 2 years and Bare Escentuals is the only company that sells authentic Bare Minerals. There are a lot of impostors. Be safe go with Bare Escentuals, they have always exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love this product and thought I was saving money purchasing it this way.  The product I received was sample size and considerably more expensive than purchasing regular size in a retail store.</li>
    <li> Hot, cold, doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s light and works great! I love that I can craft it to match my specific skin tone, too.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals foundation is a wonderful product.  I have used it for years.  My issue is that this particular seller is overcharging for this 2 gm size of product.  The size normally purchased in a store is 8 gm for $25 to $27.  I got burned because I didn&#x27;t read the description carefully enough.  Lesson learned !</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and love it.</li>
    <li> The make up is fine but the size of this make up is extremely small!!! It definitely will not last you long so be sure to pay attention to the size of this before purchasing!</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals - says it all</li>
    <li> It takes quite awhile to &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; in so it doesn&#x27;t look caked on. My daughter loves it but I prefer the &amp;#34;ready foundation&amp;#34; in the compact .</li>
    <li> Ok, it is a bit pricey, but I find it worth it. I typically break out with other foundations. I tried bare minerals about two years ago, and I haven&#x27;t went astray since. Sure you could get something for half the cost and in a bigger container. But,  you get what you pay for, I found this foundation has been very gentle and giving to my skin. I don&#x27;t break out, and it looks very natural and nice. It does last me a while too, I don&#x27;t cake it on but I do wear it every day. Whether or not this product is for you, I think depends on your skin, (if yours is sensitive or not) and how you apply make up, (heavy or light). :)</li>
    <li> I like the product.  However I felt that I got a sample product instead of the full size. For just a few dollars more I could of got the full size which will last me longer. I shop online because I live on a rural areA</li>
    <li> Use this all the time best makeup</li>
    <li> Have been using this product once 1991 and I love a good deal on it. Coverage is excellent yet it feels like there isn&#x27;t anything on your face. It last all day and well into the evening. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Sheesh, I didn&#x27;t realize it would be so small. The other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ordered were much bigger. This didn&#x27;t give me much of a matte look... it was more shiny which is not what I&#x27;m going for.</li>
    <li> A little messy. It is very important that you use a primer with this foundation and the correct brush. Otherwise the coverage is blotchy.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  Would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> This foundation is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It feels so light, it&#x27;s like not having on any makeup.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Have been using bareMinerals makeup for over ten years. Would not use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have never tried Bare Escentuals or any kind of bare minerals make up, but I had heard nothing but good things. I got it and realized that it&#x27;s nothing like I&#x27;ve heard about. The coverage is terrible. They say it&#x27;ll cover up scarring or anything else that you want to cover up but it doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is for the bareMinerals ORIGINAL Foundation in Medium. I usually use Medium Beige, and accidentally ordered this color by mistake. But what I great mistake to make! This color actually matches my skin much better than the other; it seems to have slightly more pink undertones maybe and be a touch lighter. They are very very close in color, but, for my winter skin that is far from anything close to a tan, this is perfect. How nice when a mistake works out so well! I recommend using either the Mineral Veil with the foundation to help hold it in place throughout the day, but I am generally happy with the wear-ability. I had briefly switched to a higher-end liquid foundation and have come back to this recently, and am much happier. I think it looks much more natural, and is easy to apply and blend.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but the size is redicilous! Very unimpressed with this!!! Don&#x27;t buy it.  Rip off.</li>
    <li> I just scoped out the wrong color, be careful of that, maybe do a face match at a store.  Otherwise--great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It provides great coverage.</li>
    <li> I love the way it stays on and does not rub off. I always use a dusting brush after using it to make use it will stay in place,</li>
    <li> Small container, too expensive, rip off</li>
    <li> Gift for a friend.  She really likes Bre Minerals as it is light with good coverage and good for your skin</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is very nice, will buy it again! love it !love it !love it !love it !</li>
