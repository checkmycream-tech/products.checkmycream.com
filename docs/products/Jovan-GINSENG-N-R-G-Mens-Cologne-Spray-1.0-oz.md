<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> the shipment was sent out really fast! it was in the mail the next day! there was nothing hiden about the item either he said new and it was, it had not even been used to sample the scent. awesome amazon user!</li>
    <li> Smells great!  My son likes it very much.  I think it smells better than very expensive colognes.  The smell lasts too.</li>
    <li> This cologne has a wonderful scent.  I love it and my husband likes it too.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It never fails to get compliments from the women.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Lots of positive comments from the ladies.  Will keep purchasing this product as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> The ladies love this scent.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this cologne at Wal-Mart. However, they do not carry this fragrance anymore. I love the smell as it&#x27;s light and not very strong. It&#x27;s a great price for nice smelling cologne. I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Been wearing it since I was a kid. Don&#x27;t care how cheap it is, I love it. Best scent ever!</li>
    <li> I have yet to find another Cologne that I like so when I seen these at this price...I had to buy.. Keep up the good prices. :) Satisfied customer</li>
    <li> I was so happy you were able to find it for me.  I got used to finding it at Wal-Mart...then they stopped carrying it.  I looked around at other stores with no luck.  So I finally started looking on-line.  To my surprise, it wasn&#x27;t that easy to find it there either.  Well, my friends at Amazon came through.  Jovan Ginseng is a nice cologne, not overpowering, but it stays with you.  Best of all, its my wife&#x27;s favorite!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> My husband only uses this scent &amp; we both love it. We were completely satisfied &amp; happy with this purchase.We just wish we could find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent. A couple reviewers have said it doesn&#x27;t last. It&#x27;s not an expensive Macy&#x27;s product, and is not expected to last all day as an Eau DeToilette would. It&#x27;s cheap enough to re-apply as needed.</li>
    <li> Fast, efficient service. I used to purchase this cologne for my husband at a local store; however, they quit selling it. I was so pleased to find it and at a super price too!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I buy these for a friend every year as a gift. He used to by the at Walmart but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore. He loves it.</li>
    <li> My best friend has been wearing this since we dated 10 years ago. Brings back a lot of memories. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this cologne on my husband. He&#x27;s not a guy who likes musky kind of colognes, so if you think that is what this is-- it definitely is not. However, I know certain body chemistry can vary with perfumes and colognes, but this stuff is great. Not bad for the price, and I&#x27;m glad I found it here because I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t wear very long (maybe a few hours) before you&#x27;d need to reapply.</li>
    <li> I like this scent.  I normally would buy at walmart.  I needed more product to get free shipping.  this is a good product and I get lots of compliments on the smell.</li>
    <li> In spite of reviews that said this was nothing like the &amp;#34;Ginseng For Men&amp;#34; from the 70&#x27;s, I was hoping for a &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; factor that this product lacks........it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s just not for me. Some really like it, but I think Coty fumbled the ball on this one.</li>
    <li> I am really happy to see this was sold online!  I used this a lot back in high school (late 90&#x27;s), and was bummed out that it was no longer being sold in stores.  I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s back, at least online!  This fragrance is great.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Wish the bottle would be available in a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that this is a very small spray size</li>
    <li> bought this perfume for y wife she loves it she remembers this as a child her used to put it on her arm</li>
    <li> My husband really likes it and uses it on the weekends. Good price and value.  Light smell that&#x27;s not overpowering</li>
    <li> I love this cologne for my husband and we&#x27;re very glad we can still find it.</li>
    <li> Getting harder and harder to find and it is a good daily fragrance for my chemistry, hope it is still available for more years.</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne that I&#x27;ve ever smelled on my husband or my sons. Highly recommend. I hope that I will be able to find more in the future.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful and unique smell</li>
    <li> I like this one particularly becase both men and women can wear it&lt;br /&gt;Sweet, a little sassy, a little smooth, stirs the senses&lt;br /&gt;always turns heads</li>
    <li> Rivals colognes costing 5 times as much</li>
    <li> We really like this cologne. Very nice scent! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> husband just loves this, I have to buy a couple of bottles everytime just to make&lt;br /&gt;sure he doesnt run out</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great and my wife loves it, which is an obvious bonus. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Favorite smell so glad I can still find it.</li>
    <li> I been using this scent since i was in 9th grade , i love it.</li>
    <li> it definately met my expectations i just wish they made a bigger bottle so i wont have to keep buying this lil 1oz bottles, but it still smells how it did back then&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is one of the most underated colognes out Plus it last a long time for the price</li>
    <li> I love this men&#x27;s cologne!!!! It is very difficult to find and seems only available through mailorder, ahum, internet shopping (lost my head in all this excitement). The problem is the expense. Most sites are charging 30+ dollars for the one oz. spray bottle. It is worth that much for me. But when I found a site that is only charging 10, ten, 10, ten, dollars , 10 usa dollars; I went into shock (and still am) I received my heavenly Jovan NRG three days later. I can not be more pleased (so pleased I got 2)........... well with a product, anyway. It came from PERFUME CITY. I stongly recommend PERFUME CITY to anyone looking for Colognes Perfumes or stuff of than nature. Tell them the NRG lover sent you.</li>
    <li> She licks it off of me...nuff said</li>
    <li> This is a hard-to-find but great cologne that I&#x27;ve been using for years. A clean, but still masculine smell. I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  Especially from the ladies!  :)</li>
    <li> I was given Jovan GINSENG as a gift back in 2001 and became really attached to this scent. I recently have had a hard time finding this in stores now that Jovan seems to be pushing their MUSK scents. Thanks to amazon, I have been able to stock up! This bottle has a spray top for quick application. You cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> Item came just as described!</li>
    <li> I have used the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; version of this product for a long time, this is not it. I realize the product has been discontinued yet still remains very popular and was my motivation to stock up and then let the product die a natural death and move on to something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, someone has seen an opportunity to cash in and have watered this product down dramatically. It is not even close to the formulation of the last bottle I emptied prior to this order. Big flag on that play! Former Jovan customer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I got turned onto this stuff, but it has a really unique character smell. You can&#x27;t quite put your finger on it and that&#x27;s what makes it awesome. And there&#x27;s no way you can beat the price. I hope they never stop making this. It&#x27;s got a cool, fresh smell that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. Buyer beware, people are going to try to get you to tell them what your scent is. Don&#x27;t give them your secret!</li>
    <li> No complaints, as advertised.</li>
    <li> My husband had been searching for this cologne, he was ecstatic when he found it here. The price was affordable and he received the items in good time. He uses it on special occasions, it smells really great on him. Thank you for making his day.</li>
    <li> I JUST AWAYS LIKED THE SMILE</li>
    <li> This cologne has a mild, pleasant citrus smell, but not overpowering. I buy a couple at a time, once a year.</li>
    <li> It still smells nice BUT, as with most Colones and After Shave it does lose it punch with time! I guess its time to move on....</li>
    <li> Price is great. Scent is exactly the one i remember.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Meant as a daytime scent but I use it day and night. Keeps its scent all day!</li>
    <li> I love the scent........awsome........but.........no staying power.  Even the musk is good but I think even that is beint watered down--dosen&#x27;t last like it used to.  I use Sex Appeal and Musk by Jovan/Cotey.  I like this but if it dosen&#x27;t have staying power, women won&#x27;t want it on you!!!</li>
    <li> They got here early and you gotta love the price.....I ordered 4 but I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more....soon.</li>
    <li> Why was this discontinued? This smells amazing... A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I have gotten so many compliments when wearing this. I will admit, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, however, it&#x27;s long enough. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Nice light scent, but has a over powering alcohol smell.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quick. I absolutely love this cologne. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a light smelling scent. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> i think this is a nice smell for a man,the girls love it</li>
    <li> I dont like this item and dont want to suggest to everyone before buy it.</li>
    <li> Jovan does it again!!! Best smelling stuff on the market! Could come in bigger bottles but a small amount will stay with through out the day!</li>
    <li> Bought for Brother who had loved the scent for Christmas. Don&#x27;t have a clue how it smells personally, but he was excited to get it.</li>
    <li> For some reason I find this cologne hard to find locally. One of my favorites. Excellent value for the money.</li>
