      <li>Quantity is the best way to buy light weight disposables.  </li>
      <li>This is a good price on the Glide Tape.  </li>
      <li>This is the good stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rather instead this is simply a good design.</li>

      <li>I am very picky about my dental floss / tape and this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>She is an older patient without Internet access and was very happy that I offered to make this purchase for her!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it on-line (from Amazon, of course) and it&#x27;s a great way to find it instead of driving all over town.  </li>
      <li>It is a good product at a decent price, but probably best suited for people like me without much space between each tooth.</li>
      <li>This is simply the best product!  </li>
      <li>The floss is great for getting in between teeth that are very close together.  </li>
      <li>Most drug stores don&#x27;t even stock Glide Tape</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can still get it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>: flossing with this stuff is much better for your teeth than NOT flossing with anything.  </li>
      <li>I wish I could find it locally,but since I can&#x27;t I&#x27;m glad to find it here.</li>
      <li>does anyone really LOVE floss?</li>
      <li>It probably deserves 5 stars, but love????</li>
      <li>Ok so it&#x27;s 5 am.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t find it in stores most of the time, for some reason, so I get it on Amazon in bulk.  </li>
      <li>I love this tape and have been dismayed that I can no longer buy it in stores.</li>
      <li>Makes flossing much more enjoyable err...tolerable.    </li>
      <li>The one that comes in the blue/green packaging works better for me</li>
      <li>This works so much better and quicker than Dental Floss and doesn&#x27;t cut into my gums.</li>
      <li>Even if you don&#x27;t I&#x27;m sure this is still better than the string stuff.</li>
      <li>Love the tape format.</li>
      <li>I believe it does a much better job than any floss out there.</li>
      <li>If more people had access to Glide Tape Floss, more people would floss their teeth.  </li>
      <li>I love the thickness and strength of this floss.  </li>
      <li>This is better for you if you have gaps in your teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it otherwise deserves 5 stars if it works for you.</li>
      <li>so you have to keep buying more and more.  </li>
      <li>Better than floss in my opinion, assuming that the thicker dental tape fits between your teeth.</li>
      <li>Mint makes me sneeze for several minutes, so this is perfect!</li>
      <li>He has not been able to find it at any local store for many years, so we are very happy to find it at amazon.  </li>
      <li>This product is no longer carried in most Bay Area drug stores.  </li>
      <li>This is a tape product and gives more coverage than Floss.  </li>
      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>I have read in a health magazine that flossing is more efficient if you move the floss horizontally rather than vertically.</li>
      <li>Like others, I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores any more.  </li>
      <li>While I know that there may be some debate over the efficacy of monofilament vs. multifilament floss, I think everyone would agree that any amount of flossing is better than none.</li>
      <li>The extra width of the product is excellent for covering more area while you are flossing.</li>
      <li>What more is there to say?  </li>
      <li>This works much better than dental floss because it is thicker and doesn&#x27;t break as easily.  </li>
      <li>It ain&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s much cheaper (and, I&#x27;m quite sure, much more pleasant) than gum disease.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are some other tape brands, but I&#x27;ve found this the best for my use.</li>
      <li>Glad to find this original version online.  </li>
      <li>That defeats the purpose of ordering Glide, since it supposed to &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; easily between your teeth.</li>
      <li>It also glides between teeth easily.</li>
      <li>This item is vastly different from and superior to any kind of floss or floss tape in terms of smoothness, strength and width.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard my friends talk a lot about whether this kind of floss is not as good for you as traditional floss.  </li>
      <li>For those who have little room between their teeth, this dental floss tape is excellent.  </li>
      <li>This floss tape is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>comes free</li>
      <li>This is a strong, \\&quot;ribbon-type\\&quot; floss that enables me to clean between all my teeth without breaking.  </li>
      <li>He says it is far more effective than floss.  </li>
      <li>For whatever reason, our local drugstore no longer carries this particular floss so this six pack is perfect for two people for about six months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other Oral B Pro-Health dental tapes, and none are this incredibly diffcult to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean and free of &#x27;flavors&#x27; and it just WORKS.</li>
      <li>I prefer the original floss to the tape.  </li>
      <li>I started using Oral-B Glide Original Tape upon the reccomendation of my dentist.  </li>
      <li>However, the product listing should be changed to, \\&quot;Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Tape\\&quot;.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best floss because it never shreds and really cleans between teeth. I just hope the company keeps making it.</li>
    <li> Best gloss - none compares</li>
    <li> I remember years ago when this stuff came out and suddenly I was flossing - much easier on the gums and slides easily between the teeth. I keep one in my briefcase, car, shaving kit and my wife and son take the other two.</li>
    <li> I have been using Glide for years, and I like the wider tape; it seems to get out the food particles better than regular tape.  Also it has a very slick coating that allows it to fit between tight teeth more easily.  I think it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  You can&#x27;t find it in stores most of the time, for some reason, so I get it on Amazon in bulk.  It&#x27;s cheaper and I never have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> I am an office manager in a dental office and we recommend Glide Dental Floss and tape and it has become impossible for our patients to find the tape in our local drug stores.  I purchased this product for a patient as she was unable to find the tape at Long&#x27;s/CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, Rite-Aid, Albertson&#x27;s, Von&#x27;s or K-mart!  She is an older patient without Internet access and was very happy that I offered to make this purchase for her!</li>
    <li> The best product for those of us with special needs; hard (or impossible) to find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be the cadillac of floss.  I could not use it.  It is so slippery. I wrapped it around my fingers several times and still could not hold it.  I tried the satin, it was not as slick, but too slick for me.  Went back to the reach woven floss.  I want something to scrub my teeth, not glide over it.  [[ASIN:B000GGHS1C Reach Gentle Gum Care with Fluoride Mint Woven Dental Floss, Mint 50 yd (45.7 m)]]</li>
    <li> This hard to find in stores dental tape is excellent.  I just had dental work that shredded all the other floss I&#x27;ve tried.  It seems to fit through tight and wide spaces with ease.</li>
    <li> I have a standing order for Glide by flossing tape by Crest.  It does all the things I want from a floss, gets between my teeth, seldom gets stuck but is wide enough and thick enough to do a great cleaning job.  This tape definitely works better than any regular floss I&#x27;ve tried and better than any tape as well.</li>
    <li> Glide dental tape is worth the experience!  It&#x27;s thicker than the competition. Does not shred.  No artificial sweeter or flavouring.     When I ran out, I tried several competitors&#x27; brands with dissatisfying results.  Other&#x27;s shred. Have artificial flavouring.  Are not thick enough even for tape(which I solve by doubling the floss).  This product is no longer carried in most Bay Area drug stores.  So on-line purchasing is worth the added effort.  Free shipping for quantity purchasing was great!  But not currently offered.</li>
    <li> I bought this locally for many years and now can&#x27;t find it. The packaging has changed but this is still the wide dental tape that I prefer. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> If more people had access to Glide Tape Floss, more people would floss their teeth.  It is head and shoulders above the non-tape floss that is sold at Walgreens, Wal-Mart, etc.  They used to carry Glide Tape.  Whoever decided not to carry it did not make a real quality decision.</li>
    <li> very nice product.I shopped online &amp; could not find this anywhere else. i was not crazy about the price, but with free shipping kinda made up for part of that.I&#x27;m happy &amp; will buy again.</li>
    <li> too thick I jam into my gums need to get thinner film</li>
    <li> This floss is super THICK.  I really like it because it gets all of the debris out from your teeth.  The only down side is you have to be more careful flossing if you have dental work between your teeth, at least in my experience.</li>
    <li> It probably deserves 5 stars, but love???? does anyone really LOVE floss?</li>
    <li> This is the only floss I use.  It&#x27;s just thick enough to get in between my teeth properly, but never breaks.</li>
    <li> This dental tape is only one that works for me. Hard to find in stores and cannot figure out why. Amazon price is competitive and sent right to my house.</li>
    <li> The floss is great for getting in between teeth that are very close together.  Does not break.</li>
    <li> Perfect TAPE for the bigger tougher food particles and those tight spots where regular floss breaks and tape does not.  I use floss and tape, but mostly the floss daily.</li>
    <li> Ok so it&#x27;s 5 am. you&#x27;ve washed your face, done the whole contact thing, you&#x27;re dressed and it&#x27;s minutes to &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; to whatever you need to do at 5 am. Brush the teeth and whip out the floss. As you&#x27;re pulling out a piece you feel the plastic box come apart. You snap it back together, attempt to sever the floss on that little cutting mechanism on the top and not only does the box come apart again but it leaves your floss half cut, dangling by a few strands. After a few pulls and snaps you finally have your frayed floss ready for action but notice it&#x27;s now 7 am. The floss mishap has sent you into some unknown time warp, you get fired for being late, you lose your car, your house and your wife divorces you. I mean, the stuff does its job but does the act of flossing have to be so involved? Moral of story. Fix the box.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best product!  Delighted to find it!</li>
    <li> Okay folks, it&#x27;s a simple thing, but I LOVE this dental floss. It&#x27;s clean and free of &#x27;flavors&#x27; and it just WORKS. I&#x27;m so glad I can still get it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard my friends talk a lot about whether this kind of floss is not as good for you as traditional floss.  Some have quoted dentists saying as such.  Hey, it could be, I don&#x27;t know.  Here&#x27;s what I know: flossing with this stuff is much better for your teeth than NOT flossing with anything.  And, if you hate flossing like most people do, you&#x27;re probably not flossing every day.  Glide floss makes flossing quicker and less painful, which makes you more likely to actually do it.  I&#x27;ve been flossing every day (with rare exception) with this stuff since I found out about it, and my dentists have been complimenting my hygiene ever since.  I don&#x27;t do anything special, but I do brush and floss every day.  I recommend this stuff highly.  I find it cheaper through Amazon than our local stores, too.  It ain&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s much cheaper (and, I&#x27;m quite sure, much more pleasant) than gum disease.</li>
    <li> Makes flossing much more enjoyable err...tolerable.    No one likes to floss I&#x27;d think, but if you&#x27;re going to go through the trouble: use this!  Seems to get my teeth much cleaner, and the ribbon-like texture is easy on my gums.</li>
    <li> This is the only dental tape that I can use for my teeth as my teeth are so close together, I am worried that this tape will not be available in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Doesn&#x27;t shred between my very tight teeth.</li>
    <li> Not glide tape, received original floss. Product not as advertised.</li>
    <li> Been using Glide Tape for years and find it does a much better flossing job any other floss on the market today.</li>
    <li> This is a strong, \\&quot;ribbon-type\\&quot; floss that enables me to clean between all my teeth without breaking.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife @ Amazon.com because we could not find it in the store.  She needs the tape because her teeth are very tightly spaced and this works much better for her.</li>
    <li> I have some wide gaps and narrow spaces between my teeth and I find the Glide tape to do the best job with both.</li>
    <li> My husband introduced me to tape floss 8 years ago. I can&#x27;t believe I ever used standard floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use standard floss it sticks in my teeth every single time. I have to yank it out &amp; it starts to shred. I gave up flossing for years because I hated it so much! When I met my husband he introduced me to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It slides in &amp; out of my teeth with ease! I have never had this floss stick in my teeth. It never shreds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We invest the extra money into this quality floss because it works so much better than standard floss. We are regular flossers because of this floss!</li>
    <li> For my use Glide tape actually works much better than floss. We use it every day and love it! Thanks Oral-B!</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, our local drugstore no longer carries this particular floss so this six pack is perfect for two people for about six months.</li>
    <li> This is the best – unflavored – oral tape that I have found on the market.  Great quality wide version that was made for those of us that do not want the small floss that can sometime hurt your gums.  Hard to find in the stores, so I have taken to Amazon to provide.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Glide exclusively for a few years and have ordered them online several times.  This time, the product is floss tape is extra thick for some reason.  It feels like you&#x27;re flossing with rope.  That defeats the purpose of ordering Glide, since it supposed to &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; easily between your teeth.</li>
    <li> The Glide tape appears to be made of the same basic material as the original but is thicker.  This makes it difficult to use between teeth that are close together.  It is far superior than what is currently being sold in retail stores.  I would highly recommend this product but would prefer a thinner variety such as I had previously purchased in those retail stores.  The price is high and the original containers had 300 yards of floss, this is the reason for only a 4 star rating.  JRG3RD</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find this on Amazon!  It is far better than the. Floss tapes I had been buying.  I used it a long time ago and then could no longer find it retail in drug stores, etc.  Much stronger than the newer ones and does not break!</li>
    <li> My teeth typically shred floss.  Glide oral tape doesn&#x27;t shred and it keeps my gums healthy!  I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of food stuck in between my teeth.  I fix that problem with Glide.  Keep one in my purse so I never have to suffer with that uncomfortable tightness in between my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for flossing your teeth. It is tough enough to stand up to tight or sharp (within reason) spaces around your teeth. The extra width of the product is excellent for covering more area while you are flossing. I have read in a health magazine that flossing is more efficient if you move the floss horizontally rather than vertically. I tried this and it worked for me.</li>
    <li> This is a tape product and gives more coverage than Floss.  Better than other brands.</li>
    <li> In my area it seems stores only carry mint flavored Glide.  Mint makes me sneeze for several minutes, so this is perfect!</li>
    <li> I have VERY tightly-spaced teeth, so I&#x27;ve been using tape since it first came out. They USED TO make a heavy duty version of this tape, but I guess they realized that a better business model was to sell the flimsy version that breaks easily so you have to keep buying more and more.  It&#x27;s a good product for normal teeth, way comfier than traditional floss, and it doesn&#x27;t shred.  But if your teeth are spaced tight, expect it to snap after 3-4 teeth, so you have to pull more out a few times before you&#x27;re done. I&#x27;m desperate to find a better product, but so far everything else I try is either too thick or just as flimsy.</li>
    <li> This works much better than dental floss because it is thicker and doesn&#x27;t break as easily.  It also glides between teeth easily.</li>
    <li> Glide Tape (not to be confused with regular glide floss).  Glide Tape is thicker, breaks less, and does a better job flossing teeth.  I buy (2) 6-count packages (12 dispensers total) to supplies my wife and I for about 1 year.  Quantity is the best way to buy light weight disposables.  Most drug stores don&#x27;t even stock Glide Tape so I use Amazon and always buy in bulk to diffuse shipping charges over the total quantity ordered.</li>
    <li> This product is impossible to find in local retail stores, so glad to have it available on-line.  We&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> The floss was much thicker than the &amp;#34;original floss&amp;#34; that I used to use. This box contains only 25m. The one with &amp;#62; 50 m or yards was the one I prefer.</li>
    <li> Great product, I received it as advertised and it works to my satisfaction.  I am very picky about my dental floss / tape and this is perfect.  I can&#x27;t find this in any store so I but 6 - 12 at a time now.</li>
    <li> I love the thickness and strength of this floss.  It never breaks and makes getting into the hard to reach spots possible.</li>
    <li> My teeth are relatively tight so using regular floss means regularly breaking off pieces in my teeth. (That makes me crazy!) This floss has the coating that helps it, well, glide well between my teeth so they get a serious flossing without any hassle. It is a good product at a decent price, but probably best suited for people like me without much space between each tooth.</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff. When I first opened the lid and pulled some tape out, I noticed how smooth the pulling action was compared to other brands. With other brands, it always felt like the wheel inside the container was rattling around, and although it doesn&#x27;t matter too much, I appreciated how sturdy and smooth it felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape itself is also very high-quality. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used floss that felt so durable and thick. It takes a little while to get used to the thickness, but that shouldn&#x27;t deter you from trying this product. I have some teeth that are very close together and somewhat difficult to get floss in between, regardless of thickness, and while that caused most other brands I&#x27;ve tried to shred, the Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Floss Tape does not shred. I will most likely be buying this product for as long as they have it available, as it&#x27;s worth the extra few dollars to have dental floss that does not shred.</li>
    <li> The stores don&#x27;t seem to be carrying this product.  I like the tape.  The floss is too skinny.</li>
    <li> This is the only product my husband loves for flossing his teeth.  He has not been able to find it at any local store for many years, so we are very happy to find it at amazon.  However, the product listing should be changed to, \\&quot;Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Tape\\&quot;.  The word \\&quot;Floss\\&quot; should be removed.  It is not in the name of the item and may confuse customers who are looking specifically for \\&quot;Glide Tape\\&quot;.  This item is vastly different from and superior to any kind of floss or floss tape in terms of smoothness, strength and width.</li>
    <li> Great for tight spots, does not easily break or shred.  This is difficult to find in my area, so Amazon to the rescue once again!</li>
    <li> Floss for major league flossers</li>
    <li> Could not find a good unflavored dental tape in town- so I ordered this. It is great, fits in between my tight teeth</li>
    <li> Once I used this product I honestly feel that nothing else will work as well. Have tried numerous floss and tape products and this one beats them all.</li>
    <li> My dentist is emphatic in his recommendation of Glide dental tape and does not understand why all dentists don&#x27;t encourage their patients to use it.  He says it is far more effective than floss.  The problem I have encountered is that it has become more and more difficult to find in local drugstores.  So I turned to Amazon, which seems to carry almost every product.  What more is there to say?  It works like the dentist promised and Amazon is a good source.</li>
    <li> Nothing else matches Glide&#x27;s effectiveness and ease of use.  Why retail stores are so reluctant to carry this product is a mystery to me.  Why would anyone use anything else?  Since it is hard to find, buy a dozen and store them away.</li>
    <li> One star for getting in tight places and that&#x27;s it. Glide really does just glide past your plaque and does not work. Unfortunately I went to the dentist after flossing with Glide for six months in between my cleanings. My gum numbers had gotten deeper. I asked the hygienist how that could have been possible since I&#x27;ve been flossing much more daily. She asked me what floss I had been using and I told her Glide. She said, \\&quot;Yep that&#x27;s why. The Glide floss does not remove all of the plaque. I&#x27;ve even gone and talked to a Glide representative *who was handing out samples, at the grocery store about it. His response was, I know it doesn&#x27;t work.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve even tossed the rest of my glide floss in the garbage and bought reach instead.</li>
    <li> Too thick.  My teeth must be closer together than normal, making it difficult to squeeze this tape between.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommends this type as the one most frequently used by her dentist friends.  Good deal with a pack of 6.</li>
    <li> I previously used the Glide that was sold in cylindrical containers (from 2010). The tape was thin and fit between my teeth without getting stuck. This tape, while sporting the same Glide name (and purporting to be &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;), is mysteriously thicker and almost 50% wider. The extra width is OK - it offers more of a working surface I guess, but the extra thickness makes it more difficult to floss with.</li>
    <li> what&#x27;s not to love, glide &amp;#34;glides&amp;#34; between teeth removing all the junk, keeping me from having to go to the dentist as often, and keeping my gums from bleeding which is no good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve abandoned conventional floss for this stuff.  It gets the job done and is much easier to fit between one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
    <li> For some people flossing is a blood war. If you are one of them you may want to give this floss a try. It isn&#x27;t a circular rope like a lot of flosses, rather it is a thin, flat tape. On top of that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of wax, flavoring, and sweetener to cover up a bad design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather instead this is simply a good design. It fits nicely between bunched up teeth without shearing in half like other flosses. Again, give it a try and see what you think. Now that I have this I am flossing each and every day, and along with a tongue scraper it provides me with a good oral hygiene throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I find it hard to believe that the reviews associated with this product are legitimate. The prices listed here are TWICE the price of WallyMart. Who would pay such outrageous prices. Every one of the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Glide floss prices are grossly inflated. I have used this product for years (going back to the large, cylindrical containers).</li>
    <li> These floss is very thick, something I didn&#x27;t realize when buying it. I can hardly push it in between my teeth and certainly won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> The best dental tape. No flavoring, which I appreciate. Better than floss in my opinion, assuming that the thicker dental tape fits between your teeth.</li>
    <li> I just want people to know this seems exactly the same as the Crest Glide Tape floss I used to purchase and can no longer find.  I highly recommend tape floss in general (and so does my dentist and it has helped tremendously) and the Glide Tape floss is the best I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands).  It really does glide, does not stick, does not shred, and feels like it really cleans well.  I will be regularly purchasing this.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t string, it&#x27;s tape. This is better for you if you have gaps in your teeth. Even if you don&#x27;t I&#x27;m sure this is still better than the string stuff.</li>
    <li> Irks great. Doesn&#x27;t shred</li>
    <li> we preper tape and can no longer buy it in the liocal drugstores.</li>
    <li> Ever since my dentist first yelled at me for not flossing when I was 8 years old, I&#x27;ve had a mild-like / hate relationship with floss. The old multifilament floss (the stuff that looks like yarn) that my parents used to buy never quite encouraged me to floss frequently and never made it an enjoyable experience. Monofilament dental floss, like the Oral-B Glide though, has changed all of that. The thin strands of Teflon that make up this floss actually make flossing an almost enjoyable experience, so much so that I&#x27;m finally flossing every day, and sometimes more than once a day. While I know that there may be some debate over the efficacy of monofilament vs. multifilament floss, I think everyone would agree that any amount of flossing is better than none. I&#x27;ve even won a few converts over in my office, particularly when the popcorn comes out. I&#x27;ve used a few different types of the Oral-B Glide, and though I don&#x27;t have any conclusive evidence, the original floss tape in the white container seems to be a little tougher than the other monofilament flosses I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I prefer the original floss to the tape.  This stuff is harder to get between tight teeth. Wish I would have realized this before buying bulk tape model.  lol.  oh well.</li>
    <li> For close teeth, this can not be beat. It rarely frays or tears.</li>
    <li> This floss tape is fabulous.  It really cleans your teeth much better than regular floss and seems to be a bit thicker as well.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it on-line (from Amazon, of course) and it&#x27;s a great way to find it instead of driving all over town.  I&#x27;ve only found it in one store and when someone spies it on the rack, they buy it all.  First come, first served.  So, if you are a fan, order it from Amazon.  No muss, no fuss. I believe it does a much better job than any floss out there.</li>
    <li> My favorite floss at a great price!</li>
    <li> I like Glide because it is easier to use between teeth that are tight together. I prefer the wider Glide tape as less likely to dig into my fingers, but I seldom find it in local stores.</li>
    <li> Thick, platicky ,sticks and splits into thin fibers that you would have to remove from your gums. Horrible cheap tape designed for one purpose to increase the margins while screwing their customers.</li>
    <li> I love this tape and have been dismayed that I can no longer buy it in stores. Thankfully, I&#x27;ve found it online! The tape is easier on the fingers than floss, and Glide never gets shredded between my teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floss for years.  It doesn&#x27;t shred or break.  I&#x27;ve tried other flosses but always come back to the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and Amazon doesn&#x27;t always carry it.</li>
    <li> I bought this based upon some recommendations I read online about improving gum issues. I have to admit that when it first arrived, I was shocked about how thick this is - it is really like flossing with a ribbon! But it gets the gunk out at least twice as good as regular floss and has really improved my gums. The dentist and hygienist have both commented on the improvement since I started using this product, so that is a good endorsement in my book!</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I can no longer find my favorite brands of dental tape in stores.  I used to buy the tape from two different very large national stores, but no longer.  This fact is very confusing to me. I took the reviewers advice and ordered a 6-pack of the Glide.  Must say that the \\&quot;glide\\&quot; of the tape took some getting used to, but now I love it and don&#x27;t miss my other brands too much.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this tape. It is WAY too thick. Painful to use. I&#x27;ve used other Oral B Pro-Health dental tapes, and none are this incredibly diffcult to use. I am incredibly sorry I bought 6. I thought I was saving money, but I will have to throw out the rest of the rolls. I have literally bought thousands of dollars worth of products on Amazon and this is the first time I have been moved to write a review, because the product is really THAT BAD !!! My fiancee and I agree that this is the worst dental tape we have used in our lives. If I could rate this product with negative reviews, I would give it (-283924) stars. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the tape format.</li>
    <li> Great product but it is getting hard to find.</li>
    <li> No more floss getting stuck!</li>
    <li> Bargain and a half! All 6 were as-advertised and worked out great, never buying floss at the store again!</li>
    <li> This dental tape does not shred or fray. It&#x27;s thicker than conventional floss and is not made out of fibers. It would seem to be some kind of plastic or rubber material. It is a superior cleaning floss!</li>
    <li> this is one of worst misuses of the word &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; i&#x27;ve ever seen: many of us buy glide because it fits between tight or sharp teeth. this is not the original glide, it is over two times larger. it only says this on the back of the packaging after you buy it; &amp;#34;stronger and wider than Glide Original&amp;#34;. it is a struggle to pull through my teeth: &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; only in that it is made of the same chemical formula (PTFE telfa goretex, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;please let the company know how confusing and disappointing this is.</li>
    <li> mercy, yes, genuine glide dental tape is much harder to find opposed to dental tape but my wife absolutely prefers these</li>
    <li> I am very appreciative to Amazon for carrying this dental tape as Target and CVS do not carry this product in their stores. It works the best for cleaning my teeth than the other regular dental floss on the market.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand that does not shred when I floss - it is grrreat!  Have not found this in drugstores in a long time.</li>
    <li> I ordered and paid for one box which should have 6 packs, but only 5 inside.  Don&#x27;t know why this was happening...</li>
    <li> We like this product because it doesn&#x27;t shred.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Floss Tape does a very good job. I would have given it 5 stars except on occasion a fine string of floss hardly visible comes free and I can feel it with my tongue or lips but can&#x27;t see it and it is hard to grasp to remove from being hung on a tooth. I really think that one of my teeth some how snags it with a sharp edge and pulls it out of the floss (no, I am not snaggle-toothed).</li>
    <li> This is a good price on the Glide Tape.  For those who have little room between their teeth, this dental floss tape is excellent.  It doesn&#x27;t get stuck between your teeth or rip into shreds.</li>
    <li> Great delivery time.  Item as expected.</li>
    <li> The floss does tend to shred occasionally. We are a dental office, and when this happens we have to take extra care to asure the shredded floss has not been imbedded in our restorations.  Always have to be sure we have removed all shreds prior to starting our restorations.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of these feeders over the years and the quality and value are always the same--excellent.</li>
    <li> My teeth have wider gaps at the base, but are quite tight at the caps, which makes flossing no fun.  I hate trying to get strands of floss bits out from between my teeth.  But this stuff does the trick.  I lost track of it for awhile, and tried many other brands, which now sit in my bathroom drawer.  Glad to find this original version online.  Sometimes the first try is the best.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this has a tendency to occasionally shred when I use it.  The one that comes in the blue/green packaging works better for me</li>
    <li> Be aware.  This is not the usual thin Glide Floss.  This Floss is much wider and therefore if you have little or no gaps between your teeth it may be very difficult getting this floss to slide smoothly.  I&#x27;m going to try and return this floss if I can</li>
    <li> I have tight contacts and regular floss will shred. This product is the best for me as I don&#x27;t have the shredding problem with it.</li>
    <li> The tape is too thick to get into many teeth. Get the &amp;#34;Original Floss,&amp;#34; NOT the &amp;#34;Original Tape&amp;#34; to avoid this problem!</li>
    <li> I bought this before and it was original tape, when I re-ordered the same item it came as floss, not what I ordered.sorry</li>
    <li> Flat shape makes flossing easier. Great product</li>
    <li> I started using Oral-B Glide Original Tape upon the reccomendation of my dentist.  It is softer and easier on your gums which helps prevent gum disease.  I would hate to know I had to go back to floss again.</li>
    <li> My wife and I normally use this product but this latest batch was ultra thick, bordering on unusable.  My hope is this is just an aberration as we have really like the product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different types of floss. This is by far the best, and the only floss I will use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way regular dental floss feels,so when I saw this dental tape I tried it. It is gentler on your gums. I wish I could find it locally,but since I can&#x27;t I&#x27;m glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> Glide is the ne plus ultra of dental floss.  There are none better and there are surprisingly few competitors.  The only drawback, and a not unexpected one, is that the product can be pricey.  So search around for deals and sales.</li>
    <li> Good product ! Have been using it for over ten yrs.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a wonder product - it somehow manages to be extremely effective at cleaning between teeth and around the gums, while at the same time sliding between close teeth and avoiding snagging.  Once you get used to using this, having to use regular floss is like pulling teeth.</li>
    <li> Wide and flat without wax.  Works great!!! We have been buying this product for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;We would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking it was the same as the Oral B Glide Tape which is getting harder to find but the Oral B Glide Tape &amp;#34;Pro Health&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t the same. It stretches too much which makes it difficult to use with a floss wand. It&#x27;s also thicker which makes it harder and also stretch more. I have to keep looking for the Oral B Glide Tape or be forced to switch to floss.</li>
    <li> Too thick for me. More importantly, Amazon failed to notice that this wasn&#x27;t what I purchased in 2012, even though the first 6 words are identical to &amp;#34;Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Floss&amp;#34;. Needs to have a &amp;#34;did you mean this product you bought X months ago&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star is for Amazon not disambiguating clearly enough. I&#x27;m sure it otherwise deserves 5 stars if it works for you.</li>
    <li> OK. I buy Glide Dental FLOSS every month, but yet again, amazon seems to think &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; are the SAME. They are NOT THE SAME. ARRGH.</li>
    <li> Like others, I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores any more.  My teeth are tightly spaced and sharp.  Floss just breaks, other tapes fray &amp; leave strings between my teeth.  This is the only stuff that works.</li>
    <li> I prefer this product to any other dental tape and to any dental floss. However, I cannot find it at retail.  It is available here at Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Tape floss is superior to fiber floss because it doesn&#x27;t fray and leave strands stuck between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The Glide brand comes in two thicknesses. This is the heavy-duty variety (27 yds).  The light-duty comes in a 54 yd package.  My teeth are old and ragged, so the heavy-duty size works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same package is used for both varieties and several fiber varieties as well, so you have to read the label carefully.  Some pharmacies don&#x27;t stock the tape versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some other tape brands, but I&#x27;ve found this the best for my use.</li>
    <li> best floss i have found for people with close together teeth.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers had noted, this is the original Glide that is strong and doesn&#x27;t tear or shred. Sure it&#x27;s more expensive than the also-rans (i.e. DON&#x27;T buy the so-called Glide from Crest!), but when it comes to my dental health, I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more on this preventive tool than face the prospect of cavities or gum disease!</li>
    <li> Since I cannot find Dental Tape in stores any longer, I am very grateful to be able to find it and order it on Amazon. This works so much better and quicker than Dental Floss and doesn&#x27;t cut into my gums. My husband has bridgework in his mouth and it is better to have the tape to clean under that bridge than to use regular floss. Even with the feeders, it doesn&#x27;t work as well. This is great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Sometimes hard to find in stores.  This is the only tape that works well with caps.  It absolutely does not tear or shred.</li>
