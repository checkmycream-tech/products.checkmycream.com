      <li>I used this product and it was a huge mistake!!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s somewhat remarkable that the product remains on the market.</li>
      <li>Well, I ignored her advice and went with Crest Pro Health, as I was wooed by the advertising and loved that it is alcohol-free.  </li>
      <li>&quot; I would like to clarify that STAINING WILL OCCUR EVEN WITH GOOD ORAL HYGIENE.  </li>

      <li>like I do.arify that STAINING WILL OCCUR EVEN WITH GOOD ORAL HYGIENE.  </li>
      <li>product would probably be good for dieters...</li>
      <li>I thought this mouthwash might be good.  </li>
      <li>It Doesn&#x27;t burn which is good but don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>Your teeth will love you !</li>
      <li>Looking at most of these reviews I would say, DO NOT USE this mouthwash!</li>
      <li>As an adult, I&#x27;ve always taken excellent care of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Used it one day and haven&#x27;t been able to taste anything for 3 days since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will pass</li>
      <li>but it sure looks</li>
      <li>I check every dental product now to make sure it does not have this ingredient.</li>
      <li>gums inflamation, blood on 2 spots, was ok before using crest    5.</li>
      <li>THIS SHOULD BE PULLED from the MARKET because the harm it causes it greater than the problems it is supposed to solve.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t taste so well any more.</li>
      <li>None of this happened to me, i actually love the way the mouthwash tasted and the food I eat</li>
      <li>but it sure looks like I do.</li>
      <li>It hurts and swells more when I eat.</li>
      <li>Anything that has this many immediate side effects should NOT be in an over the counter mouthwash.</li>
      <li>and I must say WOW, my mouth feels so good!</li>
      <li>a Dentist one should note that he says, \\&quot;Be aware that staining can occur even with good oral hygiene.\\</li>
      <li>Be aware that staining can occur even with good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My teeth stay clean and feeling great throughout the whole day after using this!</li>
      <li>I have not been able to tastefully enjoy my food after usage</li>
      <li>I will never, EVER buy another Crest product and as far as I&#x27;m concerned Procter and Gamble can go fly as well.</li>
      <li>In short, do not buy this for yourself or your loved ones!  </li>
      <li>Many others had experienced the same thing that I did.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using mouthwash of any kind.</li>
      <li>and I am in fine health.</li>
      <li>after was fine.  </li>
      <li>and my food tastes just fine.  </li>
      <li>That was three years ago and everything has been fine since then.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather tolerate the quick burning than not taste my food!</li>
      <li>I made a huge mistake using this mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>Maybe your dentist has free samples?</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s alcohol free, but I can deal with whatever burning sensation Listerine might deliver if it doesn&#x27;t do this to me.</li>
      <li>I keep reading about all the blue staining, I&#x27;m happy to say I don&#x27;t have that problem.  </li>
      <li>My dentist examined me and confirmed that my salivary parotid glands were inflamed which was causing my face to swell.</li>
      <li>Proctor &amp; Gamble has been sued over this, and yet dentists and hygienists are still bribed to distribute free samples of this poison in Crest goodie bags, without warning people of its dangers.</li>
      <li>The stain tends to appear between the teeth, and at the gum-tooth interface, as this is where bacteria primarily reside.  </li>
      <li>ENOUGH said.. use it at your own peril!</li>
      <li>So apparently Crest thinks it is good to put Splenda and Saccharin in this stuff?</li>
      <li>DON&#x27;T USE IT if you want to have a pretty or handsome smile!</li>
      <li>I was able to pay for an additional cleaning to remove the stains, but I could easily see a situation where someone would want to use the product as promoted to assure dental health for themselves or the family members only to have the adverse outcome and not be able to afford to fix it.</li>
      <li>They sent me a bunch of paperwork to fill out and said that they sometimes pay for a special cleaning.</li>
      <li>Its true.  </li>
      <li>I floss and brush religiously and have good teeth.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still mostly full.</li>
      <li>It really should be publicized more, this stuff needs to be taken off the market immediately.</li>
      <li>This product ought to be recalled immediately, and everyone who has suffered pain or discomfort from using it should be reimbursed in full.     </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>Everything is just slightly sweet, like others have said.</li>
      <li>Even water tastes sweet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true what they say:</li>
      <li>It is a good, safe, and effective product; however, one must carefully consider if the required motivation for oral hygiene is present before purchasing the rinse.  </li>
      <li>Jim Koenig, DDSis a good, safe, and effective product; however, one must carefully consider if the required motivation for oral hygiene is present before purchasing the rinse.  </li>
      <li>My teeth were very clean and bright before this, after previously having them bleached.</li>
      <li>Luckily it looks like I just have to stop taking this and it should go away.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure Listerine does just as good of a job without destroying my taste buds.</li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;The active ingredient in Crest Pro-Health Rinse has been recognized as safe and effective by an FDA advisory panel.</li>
      <li>, this is a good product, (it is quite effective) but it is not for everyone - staining can be a serious drawback with some people.</li>
      <li>(My dentist removed most of the staining with considerable difficulty, and time eventually wore away the rest)    </li>
      <li>So my family got this, thinking that it&#x27;ll be just as good as alcohol-based mouthwashes minus the sting.  </li>
      <li>This mouthwash leaves a fresh and minty coolness that keeps my breath fresh.</li>
      <li>My dental hygienist is thrilled that she doesn&#x27;t have to deal with constant staining.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re one of the folks that gets affected this way, you&#x27;ll know right away.  </li>
      <li>Two days after my visit, I had severe jaw pain and swelling on my right jaw below my ear and under the jawbone.  </li>
      <li>I had a burning sensation in my tongue that started right after I started using this mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>I, on the other hand, have experienced a strong metallic taste that lingers for hours, or disappears in the morning to reappear later in the day.  </li>
      <li>He has experienced mysterious staining which I only just have connected to this mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>and I was not producing very much saliva.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, I began to experience burning sensation on my gums and inner lips that lasted most of the day.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using it for a couple of weeks thinking that I might have burned my tongue drinking hot coffee.  </li>
      <li>most of the stains went away in several weeks.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, when CPC kills bacteria, and the bacteria are not removed from the teeth, they eventually stain brown.  </li>
      <li>The Crest stains need to be removed with an ultrasonic scaler, a baking soda air polisher, and then the traditional polish that most people get at the end of their cleaning appointment.</li>
      <li>and now I know why I haven&#x27;t been able to taste my food properly.</li>
      <li>My husband and I have been using this mouthwash for a couple years (buying the two packs from costco consistently)</li>
      <li>I used it first before going to bed, and by the time I woke up, everything tasted like metal, including water.  </li>
      <li>On my next visit the dentist said that my gums were healthy and what ever I was doing to continue to do it.</li>
      <li>They all worked perfectly, my favorite being the glamorous white hydrogen peroxide one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very tempted to post some pictures of the stains on here for you all to see for yourselves!  </li>
      <li>First I thought I had a health problem.  </li>
      <li>significant other will love that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very tempted to post some pictures of the stains on here for you all to see for yourselves!  </li>
      <li>Many of the stained areas cannot be totally removed, which is a shame.</li>
      <li>I should have read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>you guessed it - the purple Listerne that my friend told me to buy in the first place.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Put awful brown stains on 4 of my front teeth!</li>
    <li> Pure awful. Everything I eat for hours after use has a bad metallic chemical flavor that overrides the taste of the food almost completely. While not eating may somehow benefit your teeth I&#x27;m not sure this is a good solution. It&#x27;s somewhat remarkable that the product remains on the market.</li>
    <li> If your kids dont like the food you make for dinner make them rinse their mouths with this first, as then it will be highly unlikely that they will taste it anyway. Then you have to worry about their teeth looking like they just starred in 2 girls 1 cup but thats besides the point.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;Google\\&quot; this before I purchased it. It has effectively killed my tastebuds and it took me 2 weeks to figure out that the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash was the culprit. Everything tastes like rubber now and I&#x27;m not surprised that a company such as Proctor &amp; Gamble put another poisonous FDA-approved product on the market for the unaware consumer.      Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this... it is simply not worth it, as there are many alternatives to this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff left a -terrible- metallic taste in my mouth, I would give it zero stars if I could.  What amazes me is that this product has been getting this type of review for over 5 years and it is still on the market.  STAY AWAY</li>
    <li> Like so many others report, after a few times of use, I noticed my teeth showing brown around gums and margins - tried avoiding coffee, tea, brushing more, using baking soda - until I Googled \\&quot;sudden teeth stains\\&quot; and got hits on Crest Pro Health rinse.  Six weeks later, after tossing bottle of CPH, my teeth are slowly looking better.  Can&#x27;t say what it might do for or to others but don&#x27;t want it in my medicine cabinet again!</li>
    <li> I generally have a hard time with plaque build-up, and so I always brush and floss my teeth twice a day.    On the plus side, when I used this product, I had almost no visible plaque. However, even with diligent brushing (with crest tartar protection toothpaste) and flossing PRIOR to use, I noticed significant staining between my teeth within a week. (My dentist removed most of the staining with considerable difficulty, and time eventually wore away the rest)    Perhaps for most people, this mouthwash is a viable option given proper brushing and flossing, but it certainly isn&#x27;t for me. I can&#x27;t recommend it if you have a problem with plaque.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was on sale, and I am sensitive to the burn of alcohol in other mouthwashes. I immediately noticed that it altered the way food tasted (it caused a bitter, chemical, almost metallic taste with everything I ate), so I tried to use it only in the evenings.  The alteration in taste was not as bad if I avoided using it in the morning, but it was still present.  I figured I would just use the rest of the bottle and get my old wash after it was gone.  But before I even got through the whole bottle, I noticed dark brown stains forming on my teeth, especially in between them and close to the gum.      I have good oral hygiene.  I floss at least once every day, sometimes twice a day.  I brush my teeth every day in the morning and evening, and sometimes I also brush midday after lunch. I also had my teeth cleaned by a dentist only a little over a month before I got this mouthwash. It still turned my teeth brown.</li>
    <li> I just got this a few days ago because my gums have gotten worse and there were a few sores in my mouth. This was my first time using mouthwash of any kind. Unfortunately I made the bad decision of choosing this one just because the packaging looked nice and it said it was alcohol free and recommended by ADA to fight gingivitis. I should have read the reviews first. If it weren&#x27;t for the negative side effects, I might actually like this product. It seems to kill the germs well, as my gums did heal somewhat with just a couple uses. The problem is what it&#x27;s done to my taste buds. My tongue feels numb and tingly and I can barely taste anything. Everything is just slightly sweet, like others have said. Even water tastes sweet. I can only taste salt on the very back of my tongue, probably because I don&#x27;t gargle my mouthwash like some people, so the taste seems intact back there. Overall though, eating is now a horrible experience, everything tastes like crap. As I&#x27;m writing this, I don&#x27;t even know how long it will be before my taste returns to normal (it&#x27;s been just a little past 12 hours since I last used it). Maybe it&#x27;s alcohol free, but I can deal with whatever burning sensation Listerine might deliver if it doesn&#x27;t do this to me. I&#x27;m sure Listerine does just as good of a job without destroying my taste buds.</li>
    <li> Causes swelling of salivary glands (resembling mumps), and teeth stains. Pain is so bad I cannot swallow or sleep. Generic brands cause identical symptoms which last several days. Do not buy this product. Class action lawsuit?</li>
    <li> I keep reading about all the blue staining, I&#x27;m happy to say I don&#x27;t have that problem.  I will point out that the whole \\&quot;Alcohol Free\\&quot; marketing is misleading. That was the reason I decided to buy it over Listerine, because Listerine practically had me in tears.    Crest still stings (not as bad as Listerine) but if it&#x27;s still going to burn, I would rather use Listerine.    I agree with others about the taste and the side effects.  After you&#x27;re done rinsing, there is this very obvious odd taste in your mouth, most mouthwashes are not enjoyable, however, this one LINGERS on for quite a while and even hours later food does not taste the same.    Not sure if it&#x27;s actually helping with my dental health as it claims, but at this point I will not buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read these reviews earlier... Never again. Teeth browned and worse... Parotitis. This shouldn&#x27;t be used at all.</li>
    <li> The last dentist I went to recommended this mouthwash when I complained that I can&#x27;t use Listerine because it burns my mouth pretty badly making it very hard to use. He said Crest Pro-Health doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol.     Yes, it&#x27;s easier to tolerate while you&#x27;re using it, but it makes my sense of taste disappear! I guess I&#x27;ll have to switch to Listerine after all. I&#x27;d rather tolerate the quick burning than not taste my food!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this over the last few months and haven&#x27;t really paid close attention to my teeth, I guess I&#x27;ve been too busy to go for my regular cleaning too. Well tonight I took a close look in the mirror and noticed severe dark brown staining in between my teeth and around some of the gum line. It seriously looks like I smoke three packs a day, I&#x27;ve never experienced such bad staining. My teeth were very clean and bright before this, after previously having them bleached. They certainly had no brown stains. I don&#x27;t smoke, I don&#x27;t drink and I drink maybe two cups of coffee a day and rinse after drinking them. The only thing I&#x27;ve been doing differently is using this horrible toxic staining mouthwash. I feel like Crest owes me the cost of a professional dental cleaning and I&#x27;m going to look into making the claim against them. Doing research it seems that thousands of people have reported severe staining with this product. It really should be publicized more, this stuff needs to be taken off the market immediately.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had a $2.00 coupon. Boy, what a mistake. Yes, it does not burn your mouth but I got ugly brown stains on &amp; between my teeth. My dentist polished it off and said it contained ingredients that was for prescription only. Crest admits the product can cause brown stains but no warning on product. BAD CREST BAD</li>
    <li> So my family got this, thinking that it&#x27;ll be just as good as alcohol-based mouthwashes minus the sting.  It&#x27;s true what they say: No pain, no gain.    I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and I noticed my teeth have these grey-brown stains on them.  First I thought I had a health problem.  Then I checked all the new foods and drinks I&#x27;ve been consuming lately, wondering if tea and soda could&#x27;ve done it. Nope.  I quit soda and the stain got worse.  I was so freaked out that I had some enamel problem.    Well, last night I took a bigger swig of the mouthwash than I usually did, and the next day I woke up with this disgusting taste in my mouth that hasn&#x27;t entirely gone away (23 hours ago). So I thought how weird that it happened. I google this mouthwash and find dozens of websites filled with similar tooth-stain complaints.  I am so relieved that I don&#x27;t have a health problem!    In short, do not buy this for yourself or your loved ones!  You&#x27;ll have all these stains on your teeth and make you self-conscious about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this mouthwash for about 5 days and now I know why I haven&#x27;t been able to taste my food properly. Almost everything I&#x27;ve eaten after using this product has tasted pretty much like nothing; even salty foods. I&#x27;ll stick to Act and maybe Listerine for my husband. What sucks is that we just bought the bottle and it&#x27;s still mostly full. What a waste of money! There&#x27;s no real way to tell if you will experience an allergic reaction other than using it, so I would recommend you just spend the money on a tried a true mouthwash. I wouldn&#x27;t even try the toothpaste, either!</li>
    <li> Yesterday I did 4 things in the morning: Brushed my teeth, used my new mouthwash, ate a banana, and ate an orange. All the sudden, both of my cheeks swelled up as if someone punched me in my face.  I went to see my doctor. Since both my cheeks swelled up, my doctor said the most likely culprit is my new mouthwash! My condition is called Parotitis - A swelling of parotid (salivary) glands located between the ear and jaw. I now have to take antibiotic for the next 10 days :-(  The active ingredient in Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection alcohol-free mouthwash is 0.07% of Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC). I googled a bit and found out CPC is a rather new chemical in use in mouthwash since 2005.  Please avoid mouthwash with CPC as the active ingredient.</li>
    <li> I experienced really bad brown staining on my teeth from this horrible product. My dentist was appalled and couldn&#x27;t get it all off. This highly promoted \\&quot;alcohol-free\\&quot; mouthwash is TOXIC and the FDA is a worthless protector if they don&#x27;t pull this from store shelves immediately. It is disgusting that this is allowed to be pushed to the public with no warning. I have always taken good care of my teeth, and by buying a product supposed to be good for dental health I now have teeth several shades darker - gross!  Buyers, don&#x27;t take the chance that you&#x27;ll be next.  Beware!</li>
    <li> This stuff should be illegal, period. It will destroy your taste buds and leave a disgustingly bitter taste in your mouth for days, even after a single use. It may also stain your teeth. Proctor &amp; Gamble has been sued over this, and yet dentists and hygienists are still bribed to distribute free samples of this poison in Crest goodie bags, without warning people of its dangers. This product ought to be recalled immediately, and everyone who has suffered pain or discomfort from using it should be reimbursed in full.     THIS IS SOMETHING YOU WILL WANT TO AVOID. Take it from me. Don&#x27;t do this to yourself.</li>
    <li> After using Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash for 3+ years, I finally found the source of the brown staining on my teeth, Crest Pro-Health mouthwash!  My dentist had been yelling at me for drinking cola, even though I don&#x27;t drink that much.  I was baffled by these brown stains????  Then just the other day I read about a lawsuit claiming Crest mouthwash caused brown stains on this persons teeth.  How can a Blue mouthwash cause Brown stains????  Its true.  I immediately stopped using the product and dumped out a brand new bottle.  Bye bye embarrasing stains!</li>
    <li> I used it for two days and now my left jaw is swollen as if a softball was under my skin. It hurts and swells more when I eat.</li>
    <li> Crest markets a plainly defective product as evidenced by all the reviews here.  I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the product and using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned my teeth a hideous brown color (I&#x27;m going to try to share a customer photo in the product page if possible to demonstrate).  Upon researching Crest acknowledges this defect in their product as proving it kills germs.  What??  Great there&#x27;s no germs but my teeth now just *look* like they&#x27;re rotten.  FANTASTIC:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also assert on their product pages that they don&#x27;t need to label warning users it&#x27;ll disfigure them because the disfigurement isn&#x27;t actually harmful.&lt;br /&gt;From their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The active ingredient in Crest Pro-Health Rinse has been recognized as safe and effective by an FDA advisory panel. The label meets current FDA standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other mouthwashes that effectively fight plaque and gingivitis, and have the potential to contribute to temporary brown tooth discoloration, have been on the market for years, and do not carry a stain label.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are class action lawsuits being proposed and I&#x27;ve read stories of people spending thousands of dollars to no avail on cleanings and whatnot.  I&#x27;m sick to my stomach and embarrassed to smile any more.  I&#x27;m trying brushing with baking soda and using hydrogen peroxide gargle to see if that relieves some of the disgusting staining.  It&#x27;s been days of scrubbing and no relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID THIS PRODUCT AND ALL CREST PRODUCTS!  If Crest is willing to play fast and loose with your appearance and considers disfiguring it&#x27;s customers acceptable in at least one product, why would you trust them to not release other harmful products?</li>
    <li> I used this mouthwash two days in a row and after the first, it felt numb and I couldn&#x27;t taste anything which I thought was weird but figured it might have just been a one time thing and that my mouth would get used to it. The morning after the second night of using it, my entire tongue was so damaged that it hurt just to move it, if it touched the top of mouth or my teeth, and eating was the WORST. I couldn&#x27;t eat for days. I only could eat soft foods and even that was painful enough. If I curled my tongue, I would feel immense pain. It was as if there were canker sores all over my tongue but instead if you looked at my tongue there were red spots as if my taste buds were destroyed. Eating was so painful that i lost my appetite for the first three days and then I would move to eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which the un-toasted bread being already soft, the slight texture of the bread scraped against my tongue painfully that I would throw it away instead of eating it. It has been an entire week later and my tongue finally feels healed enough for me to eat actual meals. The tip of my tongue still hurts but at least I can finally eat again! I will never use this mouthwash ever again!</li>
    <li> My dentist persuaded me to try this stuff after a regular cleaning--said it would prevent plaque, and had me swish with it for 30 seconds. It BURNED! While I was swishing, he said, approvingly, that this stuff \\&quot;kills germs in your mouth for 12 hours!\\&quot; Well no wonder, it probably kills anything in its vicinity. When I left and for the rest of the night, I had terrible strong metallic taste in my mouth, and when I tried to eat, everything tasted just mildly sweet--no other flavor at all. Strong, rich coffee with half-and-half and NO sugar tasted like weak sugar-water. Dinner tasted slightly of library paste and nothing else. Salt placed directly on my tongue was not detected. Why would ANYONE choose this stuff? It tastes awful, contains as its active ingredient a chlorinated compound that&#x27;s used for pesticides, and many other non-health-enhancing substances like sucralose (\\&quot;Splenda\\&quot;) and artificial color, and it destroys your enjoyment of food. That single dose of cellular POISON still has my taste sensation impaired after FIVE DAYS, and still the metallic taste is there too--from a SINGLE use!  I wouldn&#x27;t give this sludge to my worst enemy. Get a CLUE, Crest...</li>
    <li> I got this on sale the other day, it came with the whitening rinse too... so I thought that was a decent deal. I&#x27;d only been using Listerine and it burns a lot, so this sounded a lot more gentle.   Anyways, I had been using it in the mornings and I noticed that I can&#x27;t really taste my food? Which is a problem? Also, my tongue feels sore? I haven&#x27;t had any change in teeth color like some other people... but I dont want to keep using it and find out. I&#x27;m just going to go back to Listerine.   I would not suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do anything but reiterate some of the issues the other reviewers have complained of.  My husband and I both use this.  He has experienced mysterious staining which I only just have connected to this mouthwash.  I, on the other hand, have experienced a strong metallic taste that lingers for hours, or disappears in the morning to reappear later in the day.  I&#x27;m fortunate in that I can still taste food normally, but the nasty taste in my mouth is tiresome.  I will not be continuing my use of this product.  The results are not worth the side effects.</li>
    <li> I am a Dental Hygienist and have been trying to tell my patients for ten years now, to stop using Crest ProHealth products! They  form a brownish stain that cannot be removed by simply brushing. The Crest stains need to be removed with an ultrasonic scaler, a baking soda air polisher, and then the traditional polish that most people get at the end of their cleaning appointment. Many of the stained areas cannot be totally removed, which is a shame. So please, use these products, only if you don&#x27;t mind having brown teeth!</li>
    <li> This product caused brown stains on my teeth!!! I cannot fathom how there is a known MOUTHWASH that causes BROWN TEETH that is STILL on the market, goes to show you how uneducated some of us consumers are: NOW there is a very disclaimer on the back of the bottle saying it may stain your teeth, now who in the heck would buy this knowing it can stain your teeth?! They must not see the tiny print on back, shame on CREST. I will never use ANY crest product again. EVER. This also kills all your taste buds too. WORST PRODUCT on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on crest for selling \\&quot;brown tooth\\&quot; mouth wash as we now refer to it!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 3 days since I stop using it from the point I find out that I can&#x27;t taste anything. And STILL, I can NOT Taste anything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Used this for about 5 days. I can&#x27;t taste so well any more. It&#x27;s the only thing I changed recently. Then I saw the reviews online about the taste alteration. It&#x27;s true. It happens. When does taste return? I want to cry. Never got to the point to brown teeth though.</li>
    <li> I only used this product for two days before experiencing a side effect. They should really put side effects on the label. The first day of use, my mouth felt numb the entire day, which I assumed was normal. The second day, I experienced a painful sensation in my jaw. It was as if I had been clenching my teeth for several hours and it was sore. It hurt for me to open my mouth wide and chew food. When I went to the bathroom, I noticed in the mirror that my glands were swollen and were so big that it was noticeable. I immediately stopped using the product and the swelling went down today. So many people have been experiencing the same problem with the glands, this should be illegal.</li>
    <li> I tried this product out for 2-3 days and I started to notice that my gums were very uncomfortable.  Upon closer inspection, I realized that the product had caused the skin on the inside of my mouth to start peeling off.  It basically caused the same effect that you get when eating an extremely hot pizza, except using the mouthwash resulted in skin peeling from the bottom of my mouth instead of the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed the loss of taste that others have been complaining about, but melting the skin off of my mouth was of a little more concern!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. I wish I could give it negative stars. This mouthwash caused brown stains on my lower teeth along the gum line for years. I didn&#x27;t know what was causing it and had to visit my dental hygienist 4 times a year to have the stains removed using a cavitron. I worked with my hygienist to try and determine the cause but she couldn&#x27;t figure to out either. Started looking at Amazon to purchase all my hygiene needs and came across the reviews for this product. I then realized that this product was the cause of this issue that had plagued me for several years. I switched to Act and the stains haven&#x27;t come back. I now visit my dental hygienist 2 times a year instead of 4. My dental hygienist is thrilled that she doesn&#x27;t have to deal with constant staining. I can&#x27;t believe Crest sells a product like this. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> I agree with all of the other reviews. My tastebuds are very messed up and tongue is a bit numb. I thought I was crazy but after a few days I decided to \\&quot;google\\&quot; my issues and found that many other people have had this problem! Looking at most of these reviews I would say, DO NOT USE this mouthwash! Sorry Crest!</li>
    <li> I used this mouthwash twice and now I can&#x27;t taste anything. For the past few days it&#x27;s like my mouth has been coated in a metallic ash. I&#x27;m never buying another Crest product again.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews before buying this product.  After a visit to the dentist, I was told I should start using mouthwash to help with some gum related issues.  I found this at Costco.  I started using it the day of my dentist visit.  Two days after my visit, I had severe jaw pain and swelling on my right jaw below my ear and under the jawbone.  I also felt a burning sensation in my cheek several hours after using the wash.  After a week of using the product twice daily, I had a noticeable decrease in my taste and smell sensations.  Now I know that all of these issues were related to my use of this product.  I stopped using it immediately after reading the other reviews.  I hope to have my senses back in a few days.</li>
    <li> As an adult, I&#x27;ve always taken excellent care of my teeth.  But too my shock and dismay, two dentists in the past year (on seperate occasions) said that I was showing signs of gum disease and recommended I have a scaling and root planing done [otherwise known as a \\&quot;deep cleaning\\&quot;].  It&#x27;s a common procedure in which the hygenist goes below the gumline to remove plaque and resurface the root of the teeth to prevent further build up.  After I had it done, a friend recommended I start using Listerne Tooth Defense [in the purple bottle], as this is what her dentist told her to use after having the same procedure.      Well, I ignored her advice and went with Crest Pro Health, as I was wooed by the advertising and loved that it is alcohol-free.  The Pro Health tastes great, leaves my mouth feeling super-clean and I had none of the reported side affects [staining,taste issues] that others mentioned.  I faithfully and happily used it for several months, but when I went back to the dentist, they said my gums [in some areas] had gotten even WORSE!  They then recommended that I use - you guessed it - the purple Listerne that my friend told me to buy in the first place.  So I&#x27;m back to using Listerene, even though is burns like hard liquor and I can barely stand to keep it in my mouth for the full required minute.      Guess we&#x27;ll see if I made the right choice at my next dentist visit in a couple months!</li>
    <li> I have used this product since it&#x27;s inception.  I have never had an issue with stains nor had any taste issues.    As a diabetic, the last thing I need is an alcohol based mouth wash eating away my gum tissue.      If you brush your teeth on a regualr basis, you will not have stain problems. and my food tastes just fine.  It could also be what you are eating.  I stick to a low fat, low carb and low sugar diet. I also limit my intake of artificial sweetners such as Aspartame. It is very possible that people who notice this taste change are eating foods high in fat, carbs and sugar.    All I can say is that this product has worked very well for me and my wife with no issues at all.</li>
    <li> I am 55 years old, and after my last visit to the dentist I was told that I was beginning to show signs of periodontal disease.  Naturally, I panic and decided to take positive steps to improve the health of my teeth and gums.  This is why I decided to purchase toothpaste that (1) is highly recommended by Dentists and (2) is designed to aggressively attack all major diseases of the mouth leading to periodontal disease; I have always opted for the less expensive and more gentle to the mouth.  Needless to say I purchase a large tube of Crest Pro-Health, believing I found the fountain of youth for my teeth.  However, the very first time I used it, and within minutes later, the skin inside my lips and gums starting to peel away.  I though that because the past was so great, it was already peeling away all the bad junk out of my mouth.  Curiously, the same thing continues to happen every time I brushed my teeth (three times a day) and for the next three days.  Additionally, I began to experience burning sensation on my gums and inner lips that lasted most of the day.  Well I am not a dentist, but common sense lead me to believe that such reaction is not normal.  This is when I decided to do some research on the subject.  The strangest fact is that there are no professional comments on this issue, by Crest Company, or by any major Dental Associations.  Conclusively, my the large amount of reports I have found, in websites like this one, I am lead to believe that #1 Crest Pro-Health in Dangerous, #2 Crest products are potentially unsafe, #3 Crest most be providing substantial bonuses/compensations to Dentist/Dentist Association throughout America not to comment on the issue.  I will never use Crest products ever again, and I will never put 100% of my trust on any product my Dentist, or any Dentist recommends.</li>
    <li> I just started using this and have already had jaw pain, headaches, and my taste impaired. By the looks of the other reviews, I am not alone.</li>
    <li> Crest Pro-Health is a mouthrinse that has no alcohol (less burning, less drying of mouth), which is rare in a mouthwash, as most mouthwashes are at least 50% or more alcohol (alcohol is a good disinfectant).  To replace the antibacterial effect of the alcohol, Crest has added the agent CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride).  This is a positively charged molecule that is drawn to the negatively charged bacteria in one&#x27;s mouth.  CPC causes death of the bacteria through destroying the cell&#x27;s membrane.  Thus, it does indeed kill bacteria and bacteria is what causes bad breath, gingivitis, and cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of CPC does not come without drawbacks however.  There are two main side effects that may cause consumers to avoid this product.  First and foremost, when CPC kills bacteria, and the bacteria are not removed from the teeth, they eventually stain brown.  Staining seems to be a problem for some people and not others.  The stain tends to appear between the teeth, and at the gum-tooth interface, as this is where bacteria primarily reside.  The stain is not permanent, and can be removed, but it can be unsightly.  According to Crest, the presence of brown stain means the product is working - bonding to the bacteria and killing the bacteria.  To limit staining, one must thoroughly brush one&#x27;s teeth and floss BEFORE rinsing for one minute with Crest Pro-Health.  Since the recommendation is to rinse twice a day (as CPC lasts 12 hours), the thorough cleaning should be done each time to avoid staining.  Be aware that staining can occur even with good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second side-effect is a possible taste alteration associated with CPC.  Food may have a slightly metalic taste.  This is not reported by all users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a dentist&#x27;s perspective, this is a good product, (it is quite effective) but it is not for everyone - staining can be a serious drawback with some people. This product requires much of the user in terms of oral hygiene and pocket-book cost.  It is a good, safe, and effective product; however, one must carefully consider if the required motivation for oral hygiene is present before purchasing the rinse.  It is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a two-bottle purchase, and as pointed out by an altert commenter, each bottle is 1 liter in size.  It is cheaper to buy in bulk if you like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jim Koenig, DDSis a good, safe, and effective product; however, one must carefully consider if the required motivation for oral hygiene is present before purchasing the rinse.

    <li> I Cant taste anything just bought it last night only used it twice and i couldnt taste anything all day my teeth are starting to hurt which i never had happen this is horrible</li>
    <li> One day, I was eating lunch with my co-worker, and when I took the first bite of food noticed something was not right. My left check was on fire and I could not chew. About five minutes later my entire left side of the face from below to the ear to the lower lip started swelling. Nothing like this had ever happened to me before and I am not allergic to anything. I had to go to an urgent care facility immediately because of the pain, discomfort and swelling. I had no idea what was going on. After racking my brain, I remembered I had just started using this product. I called the number on the back and reached a product safety consultant and told her my symptoms. She immediately asked me if the active ingredient listed on the bottle was &amp;#34;CPC&amp;#34; and I told her it was. She returned with a lot of information for me such as that CPC is a newer ingredient as of 2005. She explained that it can clog the salivary glands which can lead to pain in the inner checks, difficulty chewing and low and behold SWELLING OF THE FACE. She advised me to stop using the product and is sending a refund. She advised that I call my dentist. When I called the office, they told me to come in immediately. My dentist examined me and confirmed that my salivary parotid glands were inflamed which was causing my face to swell. Him and his staff kept the mouthwash bottle to warn their other patients not to use it. For three days I have been unable to eat any solid foods as I can barely still chew. The swelling went down after discontinuing the product and being on ibuprofen. I have lost wages from work and medical bills from this are over $500. This product should NOT be sold. I am amazed that so many people have had the same issues as me, among other ones. I am so grateful I discovered it was this product as I would have continued to use it and would have suffered even further. I work for a law firm and after witnessing my experience, the attorneys I work for are going to help me recover lost wages and medical bills. We should band together and file a class action lawsuit.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother. My mouth has swelled and i had a PAINFUL eating experience. I have not been able to tastefully enjoy my food after usage and I&#x27;ve had to skip meals today because of the unbearable pain due to the swelling. DONT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Used it one day and haven&#x27;t been able to taste anything for 3 days since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very least, this product should have a warning on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you even consider buying it, Google \\&quot;Crest Complete Taste Buds\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll see the thousands of complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a litigious person, but if there is ever a justifiable case for a class action lawsuit, this is it.</li>
    <li> Worse than worthless.  Caused a metallic taste that has ruined my taste buds. Also has given me a sore throat and swollen glands. It&#x27;s going in the garbage. My tastebuds are starting to come back and the sore throat symptoms are starting to clear up after discontinuing for two days.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll have my tastebuds back and won&#x27;t experience the sore throat eventually.</li>
    <li> In short, this product may well stain your teeth.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of weeks and already I have darkened areas between teeth which make it appear that I am a smoker (I&#x27;m not).  It may work great, but what good is it if you have pretty gums but ugly teeth?  This product probably should be removed from the market, in my opinion.  Avoid!</li>
    <li> AFter second use :     1. bad metalic taste last for 6 hours  2. loss of smell and bad taste   3. weird sticky film in the mouth  4. gums inflamation, blood on 2 spots, was ok before using crest    5. i dont know if these will get worst or better tomorrow !!!    6. help me take the f,&#x27;&#x27; down</li>
    <li> I had a burning sensation in my tongue that started right after I started using this mouthwash.  I looked it up online and apparently I&#x27;m not the only person who had this problem with the product.  I stopped using it for a couple of weeks thinking that I might have burned my tongue drinking hot coffee.  After several weeks, I tried it again and then got the burning sensation back in my tongue.  I would stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> This mouth wash sucks, it doesn&#x27;t taste all that great, and the after taste is HORRIBLE. Just buy Listerine. It might be a little more expensive, but its worth it. I dont know why I bothered buying it since Crests products arent that great to begin with.</li>
    <li> Terrible and dangerous product. Turns your teeth black. Expensive to have the black patches removed. The active ingredient is TOXIC. Don&#x27;t use!</li>
    <li> Rinsing with this stuff will make your mouth taste like you&#x27;ve been sucking on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your significant other will love that.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely disgusting and will now also cause me future humiliation until I can remove the repulsive stains from my teeth. I was simply researching to find someone who has the same dark brown splotchy surface stains that I now have on my teeth and low and behold-- All of a sudden I find 20 people in the first couple minutes complaining about what the same bottle of mouth rinse that I had just finished, had done to their teeth!   I thought the stuff was repulsive before, as I was using it and almost considered throwing it out immediately, however, for what reason, I don&#x27;t know, I decided to use the rest of it.  This was all before I actually looked at the rest of the ingredients in the mouth wash ( I routinely read everything in my food and beverages). So apparently Crest thinks it is good to put Splenda and Saccharin in this stuff? Why not some Aspartame as well? I suppose that this is the reason that it tastes horrible and leaves your mouth dryer than a burnt boot in the morning? Of course, anyone that actually looked up Cetylpyridinium Chloride would immediately realize that they might not want to use this product.   I&#x27;m sick and tired and far too fed up with it now though. I will never, EVER buy another Crest product and as far as I&#x27;m concerned Procter and Gamble can go fly as well. It&#x27;s about time for everyone in this country to stand up and say that we&#x27;re not going to tolerate corporations poisoning us with their toxic chemicals and from here on out I&#x27;m going to do just that and get everyone I know to do the same.</li>
    <li> my lips were fine prior to using this product, but afterward using it, they become super dry for hours. My brother had the same problem except it was worse for him. his skin started peeling.</li>
    <li> I used Crest Pro-Health last night.  I tried it out since my sister has been using it with no complaints.  I tried it and went to sleep.  I woke up in the morning, and though I had no breakfast, once I bit into the bologna I was having for lunch, I realized someone was wrong.  I could not taste the bologna!  It didn&#x27;t taste like anything, unless I left it on my tongue for a few seconds, then it tasted like something metallic.  I drank Iced Tea, and that tasted metallic too.  Everything had a metallic taste to it and when I ate garlic bread, I couldn&#x27;t even taste the garlic!  This is a serious problem since I only used the mouthwash once and it already had that affect on me.  I told my other sister in Ohio about this and she had the same problem.  Crest says only a small percentage of people are affected like this, but they should still have a warning on the bottle!  Especially for someone who is a professional chef and needs to taste food every day.  I am waiting for someone to sue.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this mouthwash for a couple years (buying the two packs from costco consistently) We are both in customer contact professions and care about the appearance of our smiles (who doesn&#x27;t?).  Around the time we started using this wash I started noticing rather dark staining between my teeth and on the back side of my top front teeth.  I went in for a cleaning and they could not remove the staining with the normal polishing.  We both signed up for a professional whitening which whitened the surface of the front of the teeth but not the DARK brown stains between the teeth.  I asked what to do and the hygienist told me to soak my floss in the whitening gel and they should eventually go away.  We&#x27;ve been flossing and using our home kits for teeth whitening with the professionally made molded teeth trays and high strength whitening gel we got from the dentist and I feel that I&#x27;m barely keeping up with the staining this wash has caused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time I went in for my regular cleaning the dentist asked if I was a heavy smoker or coffee drinker.  I&#x27;m not, I never have been; I used to drink a bit of red wine but I had already stopped.  I freaked out and cut out the only colored drink I was still drinking regularly- Crystal light.  I don&#x27;t smoke nor drink coffee at all (nor have I ever)- We are both in our 20&#x27;s and have the teeth of elderly crack addicts (even with the maintenance and whitening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I noticed a dark BLACK stain between my top front teeth and in between the tooth next to it.  I had remembered reading that the fluoride in pro health toothpaste caused staining- but we use Colgate Total.  Just on a whim I googled the main ingredient in Crest&#x27;s pro health wash: Cetylpyridinium Chloride and found many credible sources stating that it is commonly known to stain teeth.  After reading the review by James Koenig- a Dentist one should note that he says, \\&quot;Be aware that staining can occur even with good oral hygiene.\\&quot; I would like to clarify that STAINING WILL OCCUR EVEN WITH GOOD ORAL HYGIENE.  I brush and floss my teeth twice a day.  I&#x27;m very tempted to post some pictures of the stains on here for you all to see for yourselves!  Buyer beware! I wish I had known this before using it for TWO YEARS!!! I don&#x27;t have any cavities or decay but it sure looks like I do.arify that STAINING WILL OCCUR EVEN WITH GOOD ORAL HYGIENE.  I brush and floss my teeth twice a day.  I&#x27;m very tempted to post some pictures of the stains on here for you all to see for yourselves!  Buyer beware! I wish I had known this before using it for TWO YEARS!!! I don&#x27;t have any cavities or decay but it sure looks like I do.</li>
    <li> Same Review as others. I can&#x27;t taste anything. I&#x27;m eating lunch now and can&#x27;t taste anything but a bit of metal. Going to stop using for a few days and see if that helps... It Doesn&#x27;t burn which is good but don&#x27;t buy it. I guess I was taking taste for granted. Oh boy do I wish I could taste this food!!!!</li>
    <li> Like others have mentioned, this mouthwash has stained my teeth as well. I just got back from the dentist, where it took the hygenist nearly a half hour to scrape and descale my teeth. I had no idea what was causing the staining to my teeth - I floss and brush religiously and have good teeth. AFter three weeks of using the rinse, my teeth look awful. I will never use this again and will warn people!</li>
    <li> I received this product in a bzzagent kit in order to try it out and say what I thought about it. After trying it for almost two months, it makes my mouth feel amazingly fresh, especially compared to other brands! The usual mouthwash just tries to make your breath smell good, but leaves a sugary feel. This mouthwash leaves a fresh and minty coolness that keeps my breath fresh. My teeth stay clean and feeling great throughout the whole day after using this! There is no alcohol burn and I have not noticed anything bad that comes with some mouth washes, such as staining or mildly sore gums, this works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Ignore the advertisements about this product. The side effects are not worth your money. I don&#x27;t have brown stains but I did lose my sense of taste for a while and I hated it. Everything tasted like water and its no fun when you try to eat and you can&#x27;t enjoy it. If only I had looked up reviews online I could have saved myself from any trouble. I&#x27;m starting to get my sense of taste back but I will never use this product again.</li>
    <li> Yup.  It happened to me too.  I thought that something was wrong with my taste buds and smell.  So I skipped it for 2 days.  My senses returned to normal so I tried it again.  When I woke up my parotid (salivary) glands located between the ear and jaw were swollen.  It got better half way through the day, but it sounds like others have had the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll throw the rest away tonight.</li>
    <li> Every single one of these reviews are true. I started using this product 4 days ago and my mouth is completely numb and my tongue has huge bumps on it. I didn&#x27;t realize it was the mouth wash until  I stopped using it for a few days. Also, my gums hurt and are very swollen and red. DO NOT TRY THIS PRODUCT! NOT WORTH THE PAIN, MONEY, OR MEDICAL BILLS YOU MAY ENCOUNTER!!!</li>
    <li> This rinse turned my teeth dark, dark brown. My dentist was able to clean the stains off, but it was frankly a bit scary to see my teeth turn almost black overnight. Apparently, this is known to happen for some people and my dentist was well aware of the problem (and has reported it to Crest). This product should be removed from the market. I was able to pay for an additional cleaning to remove the stains, but I could easily see a situation where someone would want to use the product as promoted to assure dental health for themselves or the family members only to have the adverse outcome and not be able to afford to fix it. Terrible, terrible product.</li>
    <li> I used this over 3 days, and now I can&#x27;t taste anything. I returned it to the store yesterday, and I did have some taste as well, but when I woke up this morning, I can&#x27;t taste anything. I really hope my sense of taste comes back.</li>
    <li> Wish I had read reviews before using.... Needless, used product daily for 2 months and began noticing brown staining along my gum line.  After a couple quick google searches to investigate potential causes (never with an inkling it may be my mouthwash), it was readily apparent that this product is the common denominator in brown teeth staining cases.  STAY AWAY, AWFUL PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GRRRR</li>
    <li> So I started using this product only 3 or 4 days ago and I am dumping it as soon as I get home!  Do not use, you will regret it.  Not only do I have a little canker sore on my inner gum but the side of my face between my left ear and jaw just swelled up.  I googled it and found out it was parotitis, the swelling of the saliva glads in this region.  Normally I would just say this was nothing but there are dozens of reviews of people with the same problem.  Luckily it looks like I just have to stop taking this and it should go away.  I repeat, do not buy this product and if you have, return or trash it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also one of the users who experienced a metallic or soapy aftertaste, continuing in the morning after washing the night before.  Sense of taste is very diminished.  Highly unpleasant experience.  Back to Listerine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is not affected and likes pro-health.  If you&#x27;re feeling lucky, start with a small bottle.  Maybe your dentist has free samples?</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of days and I must say WOW, my mouth feels so good! Not only my teeth but my breath as well. My hubby loves it too! Lol.  I am a stay at home mom with three busy, busy kids and although brushing should be on the top on my list it isn&#x27;t. I can tell after a day, it makes a deference!</li>
    <li> I am a hygienist and I can&#x27;t tell you how many of my patients have come in with horrible brown stain as a result of using this mouthwash. Some have had to return for a second visit to get it off. This stain is tenacious and very difficult to get off!&lt;br /&gt;It is especially difficult to get of root surfaces so people with gum recession have an even worse result. I think they should be required to at least place a noticeable warning on the label instead of suggesting that it will whiten the teeth. People with porous tooth surfaces and older restorations get it intrinsically in which case it is impossible to get out with instrumentation and polish.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I am now hearing it is being added to some store-brand mouthwashes!</li>
    <li> I used the Crest pro health original flavor, winter green and glamorous white kind that contains hydrogen peroxide.  They all worked perfectly, my favorite being the glamorous white hydrogen peroxide one.  If there is anything that is horrible it&#x27;s Listerine which doesn&#x27;t do anything for your breath in the long run. I have been using crest pro health for 7 years more than twice a day everyday.  However, i did have a co-worker who used it and he tasted metal and the subsequent food he eat had no taste.  None of this happened to me, i actually love the way the mouthwash tasted and the food I eat after was fine.  One thing I would recommend to people is if Crest-Pro health doesn&#x27;t work for you, just mix a little bit of hydrogen peroxide with water and gargle with that for 2 minutes.  It&#x27;ll work just as good as any mouthwash.</li>
    <li> If I could rate it a zero I would. TURNS YOUR TEETH BROWN. DO NOT USE!!!! had no idea why my teeth were brown! Floss everyday and I have a sonicare tooth brush. Didn&#x27;t make sense then one day it clicked! Then looked at all these reviews and wow! It&#x27;s a common occurrence. F u crest! I am no longer your customer!!</li>
    <li> I understand this product kills bacteria... So would a blow torch to the mouth... I would not recommend either. I finally did some searching around after having used this product for over 2 months now and thinking &amp;#34;no way would they market a product like this with the type of side effects I am experiencing&amp;#34;. I thought maybe it was something in my diet and then the brown stains really started to build up rapidly. Not to mention the oddly metallic taste in my mouth that has lasted to the NEXT MORNING! I thought I was experiencing health problems! Lo and behold there are several people making similar claims to mine. I have switched back to Listerine.</li>
    <li> I agree with similar 1 star reviews.  After two days of use I determined that the culprit was the mouthwash.  I woke up with an inflamed mouth along with pinhead hives on the inside cheeks.  Taste of salt etc. totally disappeared for about half a day.  The active ingredient, CPC in this mouthwash is too dangerous for use.  It is clever marketing considering there is a need for the product but unsafe for short term and especially long term use.  I will not recommend this product and others like it to others.</li>
    <li> I used this oral rinse and toothpaste for two weeks and noticed my tongue turned green and my teeth were becoming discolored.  My mouth tasted like a tin can and I could not taste foods. I was shocked when I Google searched this product and You tubed it.  Many others had experienced the same thing that I did. It was a disaster in progress if I had continued to use it.  I immediately stopped using it and threw all Crest Pro Health products that I purchased for myself and my elderly mother in the garbage can.  THIS SHOULD BE PULLED from the MARKET because the harm it causes it greater than the problems it is supposed to solve. DON&#x27;T USE IT if you want to have a pretty or handsome smile! I have used Crest since I was a young child.  I am 55 and had been using Arm and Hammer in recent years.  I just happened upon this product because the label indicated for 50+ adults oral care issues. I will never use a Crest product again because they are telling the public about the problems of staining in a very very understated way!  The impairment of the cosmetic appearance of their teeth is serious.  ENOUGH said.. use it at your own peril! I give it one star for what Crest brand use to represent as a trusted Brand. Thankfully, I read information before it was too late to cause me a real problem.</li>
    <li> After trying this product for two days I am done.  Not only did it leave a horrible bitter taste it completely altered my taste of food.  For example, I had peanut m&amp;m&#x27;s a few hours after rinsing with the product and had to spit out the chocolate it tasted so bad.  That&#x27;s when you know!</li>
    <li> I simply cannot contain my anger right now.  All I wanted was a simple mouthwash, as a college student with no dental insurance I thought this mouthwash might be good.  HOWEVER, after using less than a quarter of the bottle, MY TEETH ARE BROWN.  I CAN&#x27;T AFFORD TO GET MY TEETH PROFESSIONALLY WHITENED AND I ACT SO MY FACE AND MOUTH ARE LITERALLY ALL I CAN USE TO MAKE MONEY.  I do NOT know what to do.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this product unless you want people to think youare a chronic tobacco chewer and six pack a day smoker. Or you enjoy spending a painful and expensive hour having your teeth professionally cleaned every month. This product needs to be taken off shelves immediately.</li>
    <li> My teeth started turning brown and awful looking. At my annual cleaning, my dental hygienist could not get the stains off and asked if I was drinking a lot of red wine, coffee or tea. I said not much and certainly no more that I ever had before. I could not understand why my teeth looked so bad because I brush and floss religiously ... and I use a fluoride rinse. I searched online for &amp;#34;brown stains on teeth&amp;#34; and found all these results about Crest Pro-Heath. Holy Crap!  I had just switched to this product before my staining started! I wrote to Crest and they wrote back saying that when cetylpyridinium chloride kills certain bacteria, the dead bacteria collect on the teeth and stain them.  They had the nerve to say that this shows it is &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;!!!  They sent me a bunch of paperwork to fill out and said that they sometimes pay for a special cleaning. I did not do the paperwork because they required my dentist fill it out and he would not do it unless I paid for another visit.  Instead I brushed, flossed and used whitening rinses like crazy and most of the stains went away in several weeks. I still have one place between two teeth that is dark, but I am hoping it will eventually go away. I really can&#x27;t believe this product is still on the market. I check every dental product now to make sure it does not have this ingredient. I use Listerine with fluoride now.</li>
    <li> I made a huge mistake using this mouthwash.  It was recommended to me by dentists, so I bought some.  Now, everything I taste is metallic, and I am having to apply topical steroids and lidocaine to deal with the ulcer breakout that this seems to exacerbate.  Mind you, I historically have gotten ulcers in my mouth, so if you are not prone to ulcers, this might not cause any for you.  However, for me, the ulcers seemed to get much, much worse after using this just once.  I have not used this mouthwash in days and all I can taste is metal, with the metallic taste especially concentrated around where my ulcers are.  It is a horrendous sensation and I cannot wait until I can taste things again.  Given the exceptionally negative reviews this mouthwash has, I have to wonder why Gillette hasn&#x27;t investigated the side effects of this product.  Am I missing something here?</li>
    <li> OMG, I thought I was losing my mind, but everything taste wierd after I started on this mouth wash. My wife has no issues so just thought it was me. I&#x27;m never using this mouthwash again!</li>
    <li> This will do the trick. Use daily, A deep, brown dental tan will be yours in less than a month.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually purchase this through amazon, I bought it at costco. I am just trying to prevent other people from buying this though. I went to eat lunch (I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2-3 days at this point) and I felt immense pain behind my ear in the jaw area. Basicallly every time I tried to put a bite of food in my mouth my salivary gland on on my left side of my face would cause me immense pain. I was previously using Listerine and I am in fine health. So when this happened I was like, what is the only thing that has changed in my life? Sure enough, after reading other reviews of this product this is a common problem. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible. Like everyone else who posted reviews, I too developed stains on my teeth within just a few days of using this. It also impaired my sense of taste - it has now been a few days since I stopped using it, and I still can&#x27;t taste much. Finally, while using this, I developed pain in my mouth and tongue (it felt like I had burned my mouth on hot food), and now I&#x27;m left with a weird sense of numbness in my tongue. I&#x27;m hoping everything will return to normal soon, and I will never be using this product again!</li>
    <li> Bought this poison on sale in CVS. HAD NO IDEA about the side effects, till I woke feeling nauseas and with metal taste in my mouth.  Like a Dumb Ass i used it again. This time I rinsed really well and was mindful to not swallow any. All day I had horrible stomach pains and bloating. This crap Is going back. I am horrified at the other reviews, I hope there is no permanent damage!!!</li>
    <li> So my husband was told to start using this and after 2 months is teeth have starting turning brown. His teeth look worse than my mothers who has been smoking for 40 years.  Wish I would have known this.</li>
    <li> I used this product and it was a huge mistake!!!  About a half hour after using it my mouth started feeling strange and I had a very strong metallic taste.  I also woke up during that night with a dry mouth and I was not producing very much saliva.  My mouth has still not recovered after 3 days of this happening.  I cannot believe this product is being sold!!!</li>
    <li> I have no clue why this product was approved for the market.  I bought this instead of my usual Listerine last week because it was 50 cents cheaper and I&#x27;m on a budget, but after 3 uses it&#x27;s clear that I wasted my money.  I&#x27;ve barely gone through any of the bottle, but everything I eat has a sickening metallic taste, it&#x27;s the same with everything from salsa to plain water. I have not noticed the staining that some people have, but I&#x27;ve barely used any of it.  I&#x27;m really, really hoping the loss of taste does not linger too long (I last used the product 12 hours ago and still have metal-mouth, despite trying to scrub my tongue with toothpaste (NON Crest toothpaste), eating acidic foods to try and somehow remove the chemical from my tissue, etc.    This product uses a chemical that is also used in pesticides, and is known to destroy tastebuds and turn people&#x27;s teeth black or brown, READ THE REVIEW BELOW before you put this into your mouth. I wish I had known these things before I wasted my money and one of my five senses on it.  [...]</li>
    <li> Your teeth will love you !</li>
    <li> I used it first before going to bed, and by the time I woke up, everything tasted like metal, including water.  I didn&#x27;t think it was the mouthwash, so I used it again in the morning, and now it&#x27;s lunchtime and everything I put in my mouth tastes like metal.  I THEN found out about cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and its side-effects, a little late, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re one of the folks that gets affected this way, you&#x27;ll know right away.  I&#x27;m dumping the bottle the minute I get home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would probably be good for dieters...</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended it to fight cavities. I have used it for two days (just once per day) and I can&#x27;t taste any food anymore. Everything tastes the same! I&#x27;m sure it will pass but I am not using this again!!! It also really burns my mouth when I am swishing it around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the others are complaining about but if they say they had bad luck with it they must have. My experience has been different. I was at the dentist for a cleaning when he informed me that I needed a &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34;. He said that it would be done over two visits and would be very painful and expensive. I told him that I wanted to hold off until my next visit. Having heard a commercial for Crest Pro Health having the ability to repair gums in as little as two weeks I decided to give it a try. On my next visit the dentist said that my gums were healthy and what ever I was doing to continue to do it. That was three years ago and everything has been fine since then. I came to Amazon in hopes of finding it in the gallon size to save some money.</li>
    <li> I just started using this two nights ago.  Yesterday (after first use the night before) my mouth felt strange all day as if I had eaten hot food and burned my tongue and gums.  I assumed that maybe I wasn&#x27;t paying attention while drinking my tea, so maybe I did burn myself.  My mouth was really sensitive to hot foods at lunch and dinner.  I used Crest Pro-Health rinse again last night (second use).  When I got up this morning, my mouth felt even weirder, like I had burned it again last night.  I was also losing the abilty to taste anything.  My eggs had absolutely no taste to them at breakfast.  I finally looked this stuff up and now I understand what is going on.  I am going to go back to ACT - I was using it for years, but my regular grocery store was out, so I switched to this product.&lt;br /&gt;Another weird thing I noticed was that both times I used the rinse, when I spit it out, there were large blue chunks in the sink and in my mouth.  I had to pick them out of my mouth since it says to not drink anything for 30 minutes after rinsing.  I looked at the expiration date on the bottle thinking maybe it was just old product, but the date is still 2 years out.  I am tossing this junk out.</li>
    <li> Worse mouthwash ever! I usually just rinse with hydrogen peroxide, but decided to change it up with this disgusting, toxic chemic rinse instead thinking it would somehow be better. Immediately had a metalic burning taste in my mouth, my throat felt swollen and numb, I felt slightly nauseous, the tip of my tongue feels dry, my ear canal is aching and I lost my sense of taste. I still have all of these symptoms over 6 hours after use with my sense of taste just starting to reappear, though other things seeming to get worse like the ear pain and mouth dryness. I actually called Crest because I was so freaked out by the loss of taste and they offered to send me some pro-health toothpaste... um, no thanks. They assured me loss of taste was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; due to the CPC and it would return eventually. uh huh, so if it&#x27;s so normal-- which it appears to be from the other 78 one-star reviews here-- shouldnt they list that on the bottle? As far as I&#x27;m concerned CPC is not safe and should not be used. Anything that has this many immediate side effects should NOT be in an over the counter mouthwash. Never using this product again and I highly recommend no one else does either unless you hate food, love the taste of copper and have a thing for drymouth and burning sensations.</li>
</ol>
