<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice stand. Looks great and hopefully will stay that way with routine cleaning.</li>
    <li> Excellent stand for razor and brush! Appears well made and the price was fair!</li>
    <li> Looks great in my bathroom, and surprisingly matches my Merkur Futur and silver brush quite well. I was a bit worried that the different finishes would be an ugly mismatch, but I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments on it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> It looks great, very classic and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hold my brush or razor 100% perfect but 90% is good enough for something designed for all razors and brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bottom is felt, which is a weird choice for a bathroom accessories, I would think rubber would of made a better option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Looks very nice. Have been using for almost 3 months now--- no issues with rust, good quality.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Perfect! Does exactly what was needed. Highly recommend! Will order again when a similar gift is needed.</li>
    <li> beautiful finish, and very sturdy. does it&#x27;s job well, thanks!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, functional, and hasn&#x27;t rusted.&lt;br /&gt;A good buy! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Wonderfully designed and sharp looking. It work just as it is described.</li>
    <li> Beautiful item but the openings were slightly too small for my shaving brush and way too small for my Gillette Sensor razor. Given that the latter has been the most popular razor on the market for years, that&#x27;s a significant issue.</li>
    <li> My brush is too wide for the holder.  Stand is beautifully made and very high quality. Seem like the opening should accommodate the biggest brush bases,</li>
    <li> Decent quality, works with the Taylor of Old Bond Street Pure Badger shaving brush &amp; sandalwood soap set.  The razor holder is too big to securely hold a gillette mach 3 razor - it will fit but precariously &amp; if the handle rotates at all then it falls out of the holder.  Too bad because I was wanting something that could help clear the vanity of items.  My son keeps his razor in the old flat plastic holder since it falls out the moment is gets bumped with this stand.</li>
    <li> Big fan of this! Holds my straight razor and brush very well. Looks great in the bathroom- nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> Purchasing a razor/brush stand was the last step in my transition from shaving with disposable razors to a single-blade safety razor.  I simply was tired of resting my shaving brush on its side to dry and putting my razor in an old jewelry bag.  The SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL DELUXE RAZOR AND BRUSH STAND (chrome) proved to be a much better alternative for my brush and razor storage; it also looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I pulled the stand out of the box, I was surprised at how solid it was.  The stand has a weighted base attached to a post with a twin-forked attachment at the top for holding most standard safety razors and shaving brushes.  The design of the stand is simple, but seeing and handling the stand proved that the picture of it does it no justice.  The weighted base has a foam rubber disk underneath that keeps the stand in place.  The forks for holding the brush and razor are tilted up at the ends to keep the items in place.  I use a long handled Merkur razor and an Escali brush … the stand holds both like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see that using a stand is the best way for letting the brush dry (as you aren’t supposed to let it dry by sitting it with the bristles facing up).  Aside from its function, I really like how the stand looks and I’m impressed with its solid construction.  The knurling in the middle and top of the post provide nice accents to the overall appearance and the chrome really shines.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> The bottom would get wet and rust would stain the counter. Had to put a small towel under it to use.</li>
    <li> Its beautiful and very useful! It seems to be weighted properly and is sturdy. It also hasn&#x27;t faded or lost its shine. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Update: After about 15 mo. Still like it, but the chrome has &amp;#34;yellowed&amp;#34; just a touch. NOT a huge issue, particularly due to the great price, but due to the higher quality of my razor which is still that beautiful high quality shining chrome, they now do NOT really match so perfectly as they did when it first arrived. Still, for the price it is worth it. I have an Edwin Jagger medium sized brush and an EJ double edged safety razor in the pinstripe pattern, and they fit great.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t necessarily fit all brushes or razors but I know it does fit the Edwin Jagger DE89LBL and a plain Escali Brush well. Makes my bathroom counter look a little more refined.</li>
    <li> I like the weight of the stand, stays where I put it.  The finish was great, works well in my bathroom.  The razor I bought fits perfectly on the stand.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations, looks bright and shiny and holds my double edge razor and shaving brush.</li>
    <li> Nice.  Doesn&#x27;t hold my beard brush like it should because it&#x27;s a bit too far for it but nice piece.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice and good quality stand. the finish looks very nice and the stand is quite sturdy. it looks great in my bathroom with my merkur 34c hd razor. i received an e-mail from simplybeautiful asking me politely to please leave feedback if i was satisfied with the service and razor stand, and i am very pleased. i am happy to buy quality products sold by small family businesses and i will certainly be a repeat customer of simplybeautiful.</li>
    <li> Nice little stand and has a nicely weighted base. good quality.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I did have to somewhat pry the open end that holds the brush slightly to get my Art of shaving brush to easily slide in and out but hey for the price you cannot beat it!!</li>
    <li> This stand is hefty, sturdy, and attractive. Holds my EJ razor and FS brush perfectly. Just be sure you knot size falls into the descibes range, which I beleive is 20-25 mm. Cant beat this one for under twenty bucks shipped.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty, and practical!</li>
    <li> Not made of cheap material. Looks and feels legit.</li>
    <li> Just what it looks like, fits all my brushes</li>
    <li> Unfortunately,  my brush was to big to fit In the brush holder.  Other than that,  it is very a  very nice  addition to my wet  shave  products.</li>
    <li> We got this for my dad for father&#x27;s day.  He really loves it. The chrome finish goes  wonderfully with the rest if the bathroom decor and  it holds his razor and brush perfectly.</li>
    <li> It is not bad..I now have a expensive toothbrush stand..that I keep in the cabinet..lol..only because my razor did not fit</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, well made, good looking and fits my razor and brush perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t leave your brush on its side or inverted - use this stand to let the brush rest the correct way to ensure long life …</li>
    <li> Looks very classy in my bathroom. Have had it for longer than 4 months and even though I get it pretty wet most days I shave it has yet to get rusty. Great for the price!</li>
    <li> I got this for my grandfather to replace his old one. he claims it is tall and holds his safety razor quite nicely. however the brush side of it is very narrow and want hold any of the brushes he has.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this purchase.  It seems like a good quality piece, shockingly to me as it was made in China.  Normally I return anything made there, and won&#x27;t buy a thing manufactured from China.  This is a huge exception for me.</li>
    <li> Nice finish, nice weight, little expensive but oh well seems like every razor/brush stand is within $5 of this one. Does its job</li>
    <li> holds a brush well.  if your razor is a throw away with a rounded back, the razor won&#x27;t stay in the rack without work, it will turn sideways and fall out.</li>
    <li> This stand is simple and elegant and does exactly what it is designed for.  It has good weight and makes a great addition to my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Looks nice with the Merkur razor and holds the razor and brush well.  It it nice to keep both from sitting in puddles of water, which inevitably happens without a stand.</li>
    <li> This razor and brush stand easily hold my SimplyBeautiful Brush and Merkur razor and looks good doing it. It isn&#x27;t fancy and doesn&#x27;t make any kind of exciting design statement (the knurls on the stand are about it).  The price was reasonable and I would recommend to a friend if they were looking for something similar.</li>
    <li> Nice chrome.  Fits my Merkur razor and my brush perfectly.  Some of the other ones have neater designs, but cost a LOT more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and purchasing this stand was one of my best investments. My wife loves the look of it. Your brush will love it also being stored upside down as it should be.</li>
    <li> Very nice, works well for me and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Holds my Edwin Jagger as well as my tweezerman brush.  Looks sharp on my sink and was delivered quickly.  You can easily make your own &#x27;gift set&#x27; by buying this and picking out your own razor and brush.</li>
    <li> It holds, but it gets water spots easy, can be polished well. but later i always find something on it very study. works great for the Merker razors, matches too.</li>
    <li> -holds my brush well&lt;br /&gt;-allows enough space for my bowl to slide under and catch drips&lt;br /&gt;-secures my Gillette safety razor as desired&lt;br /&gt;-looks nice on my bathroom counter&lt;br /&gt;-price was fair&lt;br /&gt;-sturdy build leaves no doubt it&#x27;ll last longer than I do</li>
    <li> This is a very nice chrome plated stand.  It is sturdy, stylish, practical, and has a weighted base to keep it upright even with heavy brushes and safety razors.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll like the stand and it has been very useful.  However it is starting to spot rust stains on the top.  That is what keeps it from getting better marks.</li>
    <li> Holds both my brush and my razor securely and doesn&#x27;t wobble.  The finish looks nice and it was the best price around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen other brush and razor stands like this that hold the shaving brush by the handle so that the brush can air dry.  I have several brushes and only one will fit in this by the handle.  Even that one does not fit well.  If you hang the brush at the point the bristles enter the handle then the brush is to high and not stable.</li>
    <li> Not as elegant as I had hoped but sturdy and well balanced.  The razor portion is made for the modern multiblade razors.  If you are planning to use it for a DE razor, it works, but is a little less stable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband who had recently taken to using a shaving brush and soap.  The item was PERFECT!  It is stylish - well designed and well made!  I - and my husband - would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Wow!! This stand looks great and is well built! It looks great in my bathroom with my razor and brush hanging on it. Now i can make sure my brush and razor air dry properly!! A great buy!</li>
    <li> This stand is a great buy. It is perfectly functional and it looks just as good as the very expensive stand you have seen in the high end shave shop.</li>
    <li> This stand works perfectly. My wife says it even looks great on the sink. Allows everything to dry out before the next shave.</li>
    <li> Nice weight and base will not tip over very easy. Feels like it will last along time. Good buy for  a razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for his birthday and he was not disappointed! The solid construction and weight are a welcome change from other, cheap, flimsy stands.</li>
    <li> Nice and simple stand, fits my razor and brush nicely.  Nothing fancy needed.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, elegant, practical with an outstanding build quality.</li>
    <li> The item was just as advertised and looks great on my bathroom countertop.  The item is attrative and exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> This shaving stand is well worth the price listed and is very solid. The shaving stand is very easy to clean and when you clean it, the silver looks like a pristine mirror</li>
    <li> I opened the Amazon box and was very surprised to see the stand was already assembled, and I was also surprised at the weight of the stand. It looks really good setting on my counter top, with my brush and Parker 99r. It is very well balanced and the weight is at the bottom, so has never tipped over. Like some other reviewers have said they do not match exactly, the Parker 99r (and most razors) are nickel plated, and the stand is chrome plated. The nickel plated razor looks a little blue in comparison to the chrome, but it still looks very nice. I highly recommend this stand!</li>
    <li> Nice quality and sharp looking.  Goes in well with the rest of the bathroom fixtures in chrome.  Holds both my Merkur HD  anjd Parker silver tipped badger brush.  Quite sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, exactly what I needed. Razor hangs, what else is it supposed to do? Brush hangs, what else is it supposed to do. Arrived in 2 days because of Prime and company emailed me to make sure I was satisfied :)&lt;br /&gt;Price was less than many others and well that&#x27;s fair since they&#x27;re all pretty much the same other than looks.  I suppose if you need something Gold Plated you should spend more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this with the Edwin Jagger De89lbl and &amp;#34;Parker Safety Razor 100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush&amp;#34; the brush side was a little narrow but with a little bending I was able to have it fit. The finish on this stand is nice and matches the quality of my DE. It has a good weight to it and holds well even if only one item is on it.</li>
    <li> I really like the design of this product.  However, there were some issues that displeased me.  First, the description calls it chrome at the beginning.  Then at the summary of the details, it stated it was of high grade stainless steel.  I preferred it to be just the stainless steel, but it did have a chrome finish.  The other problem I had/have with it is the base is slightly rounded on the bottom, causing it to teeter when touched.  This hump on the middle of the bottom of the base is annoying in that it is not balanced flat and stable.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a consistent problem with all of items like this, or if I just got \\&quot;the one lemon\\&quot; from a batch.  Since I really needed to use the product immediately, I felt it was too much trouble to go through the process of returning it for a replacement.  Also, I think the item details should state whether it is stainless steel with chrome overlay or coating, because it is confusing the way this information was presented. The link for this item is :  [[ASIN:B00BFCV5JM B00BFCV5JM]]</li>
    <li> No problem transaction.  Delivered as described.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;un-sturdy&amp;#34; reviews I&#x27;ve seen here.  This thing looks great and holds my razor and brush solidly on the counter.  My wife particularly likes it because it doesn&#x27;t take up much real estate in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I got tired om my razor and brush getting knocked all over the place. It&#x27;s simple well made and compared to some other stands I looked at reasonably priced. It also matches my Merkur long handle perfectly. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Bought this despite the negative review about it falling over due to a weightless bottom. It held the brush and the razor without tipping. If it tips while holding your razor, your razor weighs too much for this stand.</li>
    <li> Still going strong!  No rust.  Only had to dust it off once.  Looks great on a Bamboo or wood top.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, solid and substantial. Just what I needed. The chrome plating is beautiful. The weight is appropriate. This is an attractive and stable platform for my razor and brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent basic stand for brush and razor!  Does what its supposed to do and looks good doing it.  What more do I need to say?</li>
    <li> Super item.  Now my son wants one and I think I&#x27;m going to have to buy one for him too.  Lucky we don&#x27;t share a bathroom.</li>
    <li> Looks great and works well for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t be happier with my choices.&lt;br /&gt;Simply Beautiful Deluxe Chrome Razor &amp; Brush Stand - *</li>
    <li> The stand is of nice weight .  The brush loop is small for some brushes . I rest the handle of the brush above the loop.</li>
    <li> This is a simple product that does its job.  If you need a shaving stand this is a good one to buy.</li>
    <li> Looked great but wobbled due to uneven base. went back.</li>
    <li> I compared this model to the Simply Beautiful and Deluxe Stainless Steel 4 Prong, all similarly priced and sold by Amazon.  Main differences is this is a better quality, stainless steel (non-magnetic as it should be).  The pronged holders have ends that are slightly bent up preventing the brush or razor from sliding out.  It does what is suppose to do.  I am happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> This stand has a heavy base so tip-over is not an issue. The rubber base insert is a good feature and it looks good on the vanity. I would be happy to buy this as a gift for anyone. I have only used this stand for two weeks and wipe excess water from both the razor and brush. How long will keep it&#x27;s good appearance, I can&#x27;t say.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I was tired of dealing with light weight stands for my brush and razor.  This one is sturdy and has a heavy base, so it meets my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> My kids loved the stands.  They liked there sleek designs.  The brush and razor fit great.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34; I have used it for a week 5 stars&amp;#34; I got it with an Escali brush and a Murker 34C. They both fit perfectly. The stand holds them with about 1.5 inch clearance so a long handle razor would be accommodated also. It is very well balanced. I have no trouble leaving the brush or the razor on the stand by itself. , no tipping at all</li>
    <li> love it, it was just what i was looking for, it matches the razor and the brush. thank you very much</li>
    <li> the product fit my needs and the item was as described and the shipping was fast. uhh you are thinking of buying this item go for it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Nice shaving stand. Keeps all in order and lets your shaving brush dry properly. A Shaving Stand is a Necessity as if you don&#x27;t have one and sit the shaving brush on it heel on the surface of the sink/bench the water drains down from the tip of the brush into the knot of hairs inside the base of the brush and fouls them and mildew sets in and the knot rots and the hairs of the shaving brush fall out as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy a fancy shaving brush and not have a stand for it as you are just wasting your money and in a few months you will be cursing the brush and its manufacture. It&#x27;s not the brush; it&#x27;s the fact that you did NOT let it dry properly with the brushes hair in a downward position. Buy a stand and do it right.............</li>
    <li> It turned out great.  I was wondering if it would be too short or not balanced enough but it has a nice base for the stand and it is tall enough for the longer handled razors.</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother for christmas. He seems to love it. I walk into his house and it&#x27;s the only thing on his counter along with the razor of course. Can&#x27;t get it engraved or anything though. Not the right type of material.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I also bought the Brush made by Simply Beautiful. Fits perfectly with the brush and to be honest, it was actually made of decent material and finish compared to the photo. It&#x27;s bigger than it looks and actually looks good in the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Started shaving with a safety razor a year ago and wanted something to keep my brush vertical so it would dry. This is simple and looks cool .</li>
    <li> Heavy, distinguished, but spendier than I wanted.... but I use both a brush on safety razor, so you got to have it. Hated always having it on it&#x27;s side, etc. Problems solved.</li>
    <li> Love the stand and how it matches the Razor I have.  Recommended for style and quality for those needing a nice stand.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my father and I have one just like it.  It holds my razor and brush nicely.  Aside from it being sleek, it is simple so it does not take up too much space on my bathroom counter and it is sturdy.  This will not be knocked over unless you really try.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband. He loves it!  His safety razor and shaving brush fit nicely in it. The finish is beautiful. It is balanced, and it looks nice on his vanity.</li>
    <li> This stand is made out of a nice metal, but the base is very wobbly.  Also, the color isn&#x27;t quite right.  I ordered it to go with a Merkur razor in chrome, but the two chromes don&#x27;t match.  The stand is much more brown/yellow than the bright silver color of a chrome safety razor.  The design element alone, though, wouldn&#x27;t have been such a big deal if the stand wasn&#x27;t so wobbly.  It has this weird bottom to the base that reduces the amount of the stand that&#x27;s connected to the ground, so it tends to roll and tip side-to-side.  I promptly returned it.</li>
    <li> Shockingly hefty, fantastic looking design/finish, and easily accommodates my Merkur 20C (LONG HANDLE) safety razor in beautiful style &amp; with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being on the cheaper end of the razor &amp; brush stand spectrum, I was a little nervous that the quality would not be up to par, but that was definitely a misguided notion. Once I received it, the first thing I noticed was the unexpected weight, quality, and solidity of the item. It doesn&#x27;t rattle or move about - it feels like one, solid piece. (As it should.) Its weight is more than enough to support my heavy Merkur 20C safety razor and it is very sturdy - not at all flimsy or easy to knock over. It&#x27;s exactly what you would want and expect it to be. The design is perfect and the chrome is very nice - no scuffs, scratches, or dings. It looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another major concern I had was whether or not it would be tall enough for my Merkur 20C (long handle) razor - which it handles just fine. (No pun intended.) It leaves PLENTY of room for long handled safety razors to comfortably and aesthetically fit, with no compromise in stability or functionality. Fantastic purchase - I&#x27;m very happy with this stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: I purchased this in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B00B1TKY8C SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] without realizing they were made by the same company, so naturally the fit was perfect - a relatively economy brush, but I quite like it. Surprisingly great bang for your buck if you&#x27;re still undecided in the brush department and want to ensure that it fits this stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this company has REALLY impressed me with their shocking product quality at such reasonable and great prices. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from \\&quot;SimplyBeautiful\\&quot; in the future.</li>
    <li> Works well and looks nice.  Had to make a small adjustment so the razor would fit without falling off.</li>
    <li> Stand is designed for 2 edge razors. I use a multi blade Gillette razor that does not sit well in the cradle.</li>
    <li> Razor falls off stand. Use now for toothbrush. Shave Cream brush - doesnt fit well either. Without adjustable width, not very practical.</li>
    <li> sturdy and enough weight to not get knocked over all the time.  great organizer</li>
    <li> Solid stand.  Holds my Escali brush and Merkur razor great.  Only way this gets five stars if it was stainless.  The little water marks left over are the only flaw.  Great for the price though!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a simple stand to protect both your razor and brush, this is the purchase to make. The stand fits all three of my DE razors and both of my brushes (one of each at a time, of course), so I assume it will fit most of the other brands out there as well! The chrome finish fits in with any bathroom decor and really makes your shaving kit look professional and classy. I find it to be of better quality and look nicer than the stands sold at some of the shaving retail stores, many of which sell for around $100! Make the smart choice and buy this stand, then take the $80 you saved and treat yourself to something nice for making such a smart purchase.</li>
    <li> delivered on time and looks great</li>
    <li> Super sturdy, super sleek. This is a great addition to my bathroom. If you want to display your brush and razor and you want to do it in a stylish way, this is for you. The bottom is really heavy, so I&#x27;m not worried about it tipping over. The fork for the brush can fit multiple sized brushes and it&#x27;s tall enough that the brush doesn&#x27;t touch the base. Could not be more happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This stand is very stable, easy to move with wet soapy hands thanks to the knurled post (above and below the arms).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It supports my Parker 26C and Pure Badger Brush (BLACKCHRPB) very well. It holds the Parker just below the head. Looks very sharp in the bathroom and very handy when having to apply more lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds the Parker brush from the handle away from the hairs, which I find will keep the brush from wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will follow-up after I use it more to determine how the shine holds up.</li>
    <li> This stand is pretty, and does exactly as it says. I have been happy with and recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my shaving brush and razor.  If you keep it clean and wiped off, there is little chance for it to rust as some have complained about.</li>
    <li> Classy, sturdy, and heavier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;My persnickety son loves it.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice stand for the price.&lt;br /&gt;We got ours through Amazon via SimplyBeautiful.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my needs and compliments my chromed safety razor very well</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with it.  The Brush he has doesn&#x27;t fit when hanging it be the handle, so instead it hangs where the bristles and handle meet.  Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Looks wonderful, easy to clean when you slash a bit of shaving soap on it, and it holds just about any razor that I&#x27;ve tried without a problem.</li>
    <li> This is not a chrome color stand.  The stand I received has gold or yellow tint to it.  It seems to be nickel plated and not chrome plated.  The color is fine and nice, but it won’t match any razor that I have ever seen.  All my double edge razors are chrome plated color, and I can tell a very obvious color mismatch when I put a razor in this stand.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box, the bottom pad had fallen off and it was loose in the box.  I put it back in its place, and it seems to be fine since then.  The pad may have been cut a bit too small for the bottom opening.&lt;br /&gt;Other than these two issues, it is like any other basic razor/brush stand.  It does the job it was designed for.  It does not look cheaply made, and it looks nice.  It has enough weight and balance to support a razor and a brush securely.  Some reviews indicate that stand falls over when accessed.  I guess it all depends on how you handle it.  If you hit it and get rough with it, yes, it will fall over but what doesn’t? The opening for the brush is standard size.  So, some brushes fit from the base of the bristles, and some other brushes may fit the stand from the curve of their handle.  It depends on the design of the brush you have.&lt;br /&gt;All shaving accessories are overpriced, including this item.</li>
    <li> Looks good, came in the mail quickly and it was the perfect gift to go with the brush. I like it.</li>
    <li> Love this item. I bought this for myself, glad I did.  My old stand vanished some years back.The stand is ideal for my razor &amp; brush after a little modification to the end of my brush.  My order arrived on the date scheduled in an unopened undamaged carton.</li>
    <li> This is a great looking and well made Razor and Brush Stand&lt;br /&gt;I like the weight of it.  My 1965 slim Gillette and brush look great on this stand&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product !</li>
    <li> If you are a DE (double edge) blade shaver like myself, then you will enjoy this clean looking &amp; practical stand.  Keeps your shaving brush elevated and able to dry properly and your razor at the ready.  Fine product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really in competition with my wife&#x27;s collection of make up brushes and hair products that adorn our bathroom, but this stand looks very nice holding my razor and shaving brush. This was offered at a great price and it arrived assembled. The only drawback is the foam insert used to fill in the hollow base. I guess I was expecting a little more weight in the base, and that it would be covered with a rubberized bottom. It works fine but the foam insert isn&#x27;t quite flat. Either it will conform through use or I&#x27;ll have to do something about it. Not a deal breaker. My shaving gear now has a nice display stand, and if you&#x27;re looking for a bargain this might be what you want.</li>
    <li> This stand performs as advertised, it has a good finish and is heavy enough to not fall over when using, the only problem I had with this is the rubber pad in the base was not permanently attached however two spots of super glue took care of that!</li>
    <li> This product does what it&#x27;s suppose to do while adding a nice touch of class in the bathroom. No problems with it at all, nice \\&quot;solid\\&quot; feel to it.</li>
    <li> The stand is as described...a beautiful polished chrome plated stand. Holds a Merkur 34C very nicely and the brush sits in nicely too</li>
    <li> What is there to say?  It holds my razor and my brush without falling over.  It is solid in build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
    <li> the simply beautiful deluxe razor and brush stand is nicely weighted and has a great finish</li>
    <li> Got this for the boyfriend, he loved it and it looks very nice and classy on our bathroom sink. Bought it along with the Edwin Jagger faux ebony double edge safety razor and the Omega boar brush with the white handle. They match up really nicely.</li>
    <li> This stand is well made and very pretty. It matches my husbands chrome brush and razor perfectly.  It has held up well over the past year and still going strong. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas, along with a new soap brush, and he loves it.  I asked him to rate it for me, and he gave it a 10/10!  Nice, heavy stand that looks very nice and classy, holds the soap brush nicely along with the razor.  Looks better, in my opinion, &amp;#34;in person&amp;#34; than in the picture on the computer.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I needed a stand for my shaving brush.  This one was well within my budget.  When it arrived, I was very impressed with the heft of the item.  It is well balanced and holds my brush as well as my old safety razor (which I keep &#x27;out&#x27; for touching up around my nose when I am in too much of a hurry with my regular straight razor.)  The chroming looks to be heavy and it is so attractive that my wife doesn&#x27;t mind it on HER sink!  The rubber pad on the bottom is a plus as well--it won;t mar the porcelain. I would highly recommend this stand and Simply Beautiful for a good price, a great product and speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take long to get to me but when it did the box was completely torn up and had obviously been taped back together. The prongs that hold the brush were bent and I had to bend them back. It wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble sending it back and I will not order from them again.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a way to hang my shave brush.  This was a great investment.  Solid, stable, looks nice, and holds my brush and razor.  Very happy with it indeed.</li>
    <li> Beautifully crafted from stainless steel. Polished chrome &amp; nice knurling on the stem. Heavy duty base stays put. Holds my Merkur 34C razor and The Art of Shaving Black Pure Badger brush. Looks awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor opening: 12.5mm&lt;br /&gt;Brush opening: 25.5mm</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for our bathroom! It looks clean and works great for drying both the brush and razor. Was a must for my husbands shaving needs.</li>
    <li> Good looking stand for the money. My Van Der Hagen brush handle doesn&#x27;t fit into the prongs, but that&#x27;s easily solved by just putting the brush bristle base above the prongs and letting it rest on the rim. Does a nice job doing what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Nice little stand..very sturdy holds all kinds of razors and brushes though the way they are held are different.  For instance my ej de89 has to be held by top head while handle dangles whereas my merkur HD barber pole can hang by tip of handle.  Some brushes require that you place the point where bristles meet plastic handle in holding spot while others you can slide handle into grooves on stand.  Either way a very nice looking and well made stand for the price!</li>
    <li> Great stand! Nice heavily chromed stand with weighted bottom. What more can you ask for!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my brush.  I have to insert it via the bristles and not the actual handle.  Plus, it looks like it&#x27;s tarnishing already, after like 4 months of use.  Not super happy but not terribly upset either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavy and attractive. It is a Nice stand that is worthy the money. If you are picky about everything matching, the finish on this does not match a chrome finished razor. That is not important to me though.</li>
    <li> Well built, manly product, looks good, does it job and doesn&#x27;t require much space, I recommend this to for anyone</li>
    <li> The razor and brush stand add to the ambience of a quality shaving experience.</li>
    <li> nice item,looks good and it&#x27;s handy...Worth the price.would  be nice addition to any shavers bathroom.I&#x27;ll probably get one for my son.</li>
    <li> Hate the damn thing.  The razor and brush don&#x27;t fit!!!  Poor quality, not happy with it at all. ! !</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item for the price I paid. I would highly recommend this stand.</li>
    <li> Stands like this tend to lose their luster when they get water spots leaving them to become a eyesore rather than a piece to hold your products. I purchased this in tandem with a chrome soap lather bowl, as i have limited cabinet space I wanted them to be something that could stay out and add manly charm to my bathroom. I was worried that like my toothbrush holder that it would just have to be cleaned all the time to get rid of water spots, however it seems to be quite resistant and can last to my weekly bathroom cleaning.</li>
    <li> Bought this stand because my brush is pretty thick at the knot. Works excellent, and doesn&#x27;t fall over. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Performs well; and I&#x27;ve had some which did not.&lt;br /&gt;I use an old, &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; handle Gillette safety razor.  This stand holds that and my brush nicely.</li>
    <li> This is a very good-looking brush and razor stand.  Unfortunately, a Mach III razor will not fit unless it&#x27;s precariously balanced on the razor side of the holder.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Functional, looks good on the counter - everything I was looking for. Only down side is it water marks easy, but they come right off just something to remember. Sits fine and is well balance.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. Solid stand. Fits my Merkur 38C and Omega brush just fine.</li>
    <li> Solid stand that works flawlessly with my Merkur long razor and Simply Beautiful badger brush, both of which are also fantastic products.</li>
    <li> Holds my Merkur 34HD with no trouble. I don&#x27;t have a brush, but the stand stays upright with only the razor. Feels sturdy and looks good on the counter. Good price and good design make this easy to recommend.</li>
    <li> It is a great stand for the money.  It&#x27;s quality is excellent.  I would recommend this to a friend. Buy and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Great stand for the money. Works well.</li>
    <li> Holds my Mercur razor and Parker Safety Razor badger brush perfectly. Looks great too!</li>
    <li> Sturdy, quality made, great price and looks great too.</li>
    <li> Love that way it matches with my Merkur 34c HD, looks very nice and simple. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> It looks nice.......  works fine...  Nice heavy base.  I mean come ON..  You can hang  your brush, and your razor on it.&lt;br /&gt;What do  you WANT it to do??  I think &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; means well made and shiny.</li>
    <li> Works we&#x27;ll could be better if the brush hook was a little larger.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item to clear up my sink area. Nothing better than a little organization in the morning! Works well, looks good.</li>
    <li> Simply love this stand, get so many compliments on it. It fits my brush perfectly and a Gillette Mach 3 razor fits as well. Make sure your brush handle is the right size so it&#x27;ll fit</li>
    <li> The product holds my brush and razor, and it looks good doing it. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. Item was as I expected-- no surprises!</li>
    <li> Great stand works very well stable, shipped fast received when it said. Keep two razors on this stand have another for razor &amp; brush</li>
    <li> This stand is perfect.  The bottom is weighted so as to hold itself upright with either the brush or razor installed, or both.  Has a great look to it and matches perfectly the custom razor I bought from Harry&#x27;s.  Quality look and feel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use with my Edwin Jagger 89lbl Razor along with the Simply Beautiful Chrome pure badger brush.  This holds both items well enough.  The razor fits tightly and doesn&#x27;t have a great deal of room for error, so you have to place it on there with some attention, but it stays on there.  The Brush (same brand) fits  well and all three together make a nice chrome set for much less $$ than purchasing the pre assembled razor kits with comparable razor and brush.  Make sure to check the diameter of your brush handle, as others reviewers have stated, this stand will not take a larger brush handle than 25mm.  The Brush I ordered is 25mm and fits nicely.  I&#x27;ve had this item for over a month and I don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space in my bathroom. It works well and has not dropped either razor or brush yet nor has it tipped over. Looks nice too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this stand a couple of weeks and it&#x27;s already RUSTY.  It&#x27;s leaving rust stains in my shower (where I shave), and even on the counter next to the sink.  It&#x27;s simply a cheap product and I would not recommend to anyone .. even if you don&#x27;t shave in the shower the stand is going to be exposed to water and rust.  The last rust stain this thing will leave in my house is at the bottom of the trash can.</li>
    <li> Decent little shave stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::Pros&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a shave stand, holds my brush and razor&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s simple and has a small footprint&lt;br /&gt;-It has a rubbery-foam pad in the bottom, preventing scratches and rust rings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::Cons&lt;br /&gt;-None so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a momentarily confused when I first got it. I was expecting a couple pieces to put together but it came out of the box assembled but wobbly. I tried all manner of twisting it before I figured out that you have to pop out the little rubber pad in the base and tighten down a screw. Now it&#x27;s nice and solid.</li>
    <li> The brush side of the stand works fine but the arms which hold the razor side are very shirt and often time the razor will just simply slip off. Razor I bought was the Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w/ Nonslip Metal Handle by Rosallini.</li>
    <li> Does what it was intended to do. Nice heavy base with a good finish. Not sure how long finish will last but impressive thus far.</li>
    <li> This handle is beautiful and heavy, perfect combination, I intend to buy another for a set that I am building for my brother.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my teenage son who is a true believer of a traditional razor.  I have seen the difference.  Having this stand to hold his razor is a great way to display it and keep it clean.</li>
    <li> Either the stand has in fact been improved or the other reviewers and I received different products. Mine looks exactly as pictured and *is* weighted at the base. It stands firm and even my very heavy DE Merkur razor doesn&#x27;t cause it to budge. My badger brush fits perfectly. No complaints on that count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the the downside, if you use a Gillette Proglide, it doesn&#x27;t fit easily because of the handle&#x27;s design, but it can easily be slid onto one of the two prongs, rather than going in the slot. Overall, a really good stand at a reasonable price (labeled \\&quot;introductory\\&quot; when I bought it).</li>
    <li> its a stand that holds a DB razor and a brush.  If you want want this thing to tell you a bed time story or use it a nut cracker than this isn&#x27;t the product for you..... IT IS A STAND.... nuff said</li>
    <li> Love the quality look and feel of this stand. Just a little problem, the shaving brush I bought doesn&#x27;t fit well, but is passable.</li>
    <li> Very good choice to hold a double edge safety razor and shaving brush out of the way. And at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to dry my boar bristle brush with the bristles down. Just as important to dry the razor opened up so blades can be kept dry. This gadget is perfect. It is easy to keep clean and the knurled pedestal makes it easy to lift when your hands are wet. Doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 Months of use I am glad to have purchased it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and looks great doing it! It&#x27;s got some heft as well so it doesn&#x27;t try and topple over or anything silly.</li>
    <li> Works like it should.</li>
    <li> Although nothing really fancy, this looks sharp sitting on my sink holding my brush and razor. The brush I purchased doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly but after etching a groove in the wooden handle from continuously pushing the brush in and out of the holder, it fits snugly.  Every now and then the stem loosens from the base but this is no big deal and doesn&#x27;t reflect in my rating.  Pretty good starter stand.</li>
    <li> Worked out great. Sturdy.</li>
    <li> fits my merkur 34 and parker brush my semogue bruch is too big</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> My husband has to shave for work, so it&#x27;s important he has good tools to use.  Looks great in his cabinet and worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, Hubby loves this shaving  stand. It is by his part of the sink, He loves it.</li>
    <li> This stand fits with my safety razor and badger brush. It works just fine and has a good amount of weight to it. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Well made stand, nice weight to it. Smaller than anticipated, which is good as it takes up less shelf space. Was very pleased with how it looks.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Nice and heavy so doesn&#x27;t wobble or tilt.</li>
    <li> Works and looks great in the bath room. The finish is holding up perfectly also. IF you need a stand this one will work great for you.</li>
    <li> Looks great. It also has substantial weight, giving it an overall solid appeal. However, it&#x27;s narrow brush holder did not accommodate my new sliver tip GBS brush. It also doesn&#x27;t accomodate my old boar hair brush. So I attempted to slightly bend the arms a bit, and one snapped right off. It is my own fault for trying to alter it, but this thing is made of cheap, brittle metal. It is impossible to know it&#x27;ll it will fit your specific brush model, so buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Fits my Merkur 43 and smaller diameter brush.  It does not fit my older bushy Crabtree brush.</li>
    <li> Great quality stand for the money.</li>
    <li> I really like this stand. It feels solid and the finish quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;Complements perfectly my Merkur razor.</li>
    <li> This stand is beautiful and well structured. My boyfriend literally said it was &amp;#34;the best gift ever.&amp;#34; This is not an alternative to a grossly overpriced stand, this is better.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I mainly use it to dry my brush since I use a shavette, but its good to have in case a person uses a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Holds my Merkur and badger brush with no problems. Looks great on my sink and doesn&#x27;t look like it will degrade over time.</li>
    <li> Great product, very happy. Feels sturdy and seems like its made of good quality. Looks great on my bathroom counter</li>
    <li> Works and looks great! A little on the flimsy side though.</li>
    <li> The base started rusting immediately after receipt. Maybe it was defective but it was a poor experience with this stand. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a stand for a while now, but it was a combo toothbrush and shaver stand. It worked well when I had a couple brushes and my old Mach 3. But since moving up to a safety razor, which has some top heavy heft, it just wasn&#x27;t doing the job. Due to the unit moving around, I managed to cut kyself twice. Not what you want in a razor stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well have no worries with the Simply Beautiful Razor and Brush stand. It securely holds your razor and makes it safer to reach for the handle instead of the head of the razor. It seemed a little off balance when I pulled it from the box. But it&#x27;s only a slight tilt which evens up after you put the brush and razor into the correct slots. It will fit most standard sized brushes. My old cheap brush was a tight fit, but the new Parker brush is a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there is a new version of this product as I don&#x27;t see a way for rust to appear on the base. There is a foam pad between it and the counter. I&#x27;ve tested it by spilling some water on the counter and setting the stand in it. The water does not absorb into the foam. So hopefully we will see less of those comments in reviews. The power of reviewers to change a product, amazing.</li>
    <li> A little over a year in, it is rusting.</li>
    <li> This brush and razor holder looks sharp on the shelf, allows the brush to drip and dry fully between shaves, and was priced far more reasonably than other similar holders.  Made of chrome and knurled for easy grasp, this thing will last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s functional as a stand, but the metal used seems to be cheap. Mine is rusting at the bottom and it is leaving rust marks all over my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough (something I was worried about). Looks great and fits the look of my shaving gear.</li>
    <li> This stand has been great so far. Looks very elegant and well built. My Merkur fits nicely in the holder. I would recommend this to all Double Edge razors users.</li>
    <li> This elegant shaving brush and razor stand offers high-quality at a value price. Its base is nicely weighted and the prongs fit a variety of implements. I currently rotate a couple different medium-size English brushes and both fit the larger attachment perfectly, one held by the handle, the other at the top of the bristle structure, just below the handle--and most standard razors fit, as well. This is the ideal budget stand for persons unwilling to sacrifice good taste and style!</li>
    <li> My husband was wanting a stand for his safety razor and brush and this worked perfectly for his shaving things. He was even happy that it matched his razor handle... Lol, guess its the little things that make them smile!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a new safety razor because I was tired of sinking so much into the new crap on the market.  I love the new razor and this stand is fantastic.  Works great and looks beautiful.</li>
    <li> really nice accent for my shaving equipment. Nice craftsmanship. You might have to play around with the &amp;#34;fork&amp;#34; to make sure that your brush stay in place. After that you should not have any issues.</li>
    <li> What can I say...it does what it claims and it does look good on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;Has a good weight to it so you don&#x27;t knock it over when you use it.</li>
    <li> Unlike some other reviews, I think this Simply Beautiful Chrome Razor and Brush Stand has a very nice heft to it. It stays in its place on the counter quite well with its heavy base that has a nice felt lined bottom. Its chrome is as shinny as my best razors. It holds my Merkur long handle slant razor on the razor side and my EJ89 razor and Escali brush on the other side together in the one slot for brushes. I admit that there is barely room for the brush and razor in the one slot and if you bump it the brush will fall out as it is put in last and sits on the edge, but it works well enough to hold two items when that side was only designed to hold a brush. After my brush dries and if I happen to think about it, I&#x27;ll put the brush in my vanity drawer and just leave the two razors and stand shining away. Its the best price for any similar chrome stand that I found on Amazon and I am very pleased with the quality which I wasn&#x27;t expecting for that price. P.S. This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on anything.</li>
    <li> After 6 months of daily use, I feel qualified to say that this is a quality stand. It holds both my Edwin Jagger DE89 and Merkur 39c flawlessly, and I see no corrosion or pitting anywhere. As mentioned by another reviewer, the stand also seems fairly resistant to water spots. The finish is gorgeous, and I&#x27;ve received comments on how great the stand looks. It still looks as great as the day I received it with only a weekly wipe down with a damp cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about purchasing this stand, you should definitely buy it.</li>
    <li> Just as the name implies, this razor and brush stand is \\&quot;simply beautiful\\&quot;. However, since I am a guy, I hope the company will allow me to take poetic license and say that this is a SIMPLY HANDSOME deluxe chrome razor and brush stand.  It looks great, will go with any bathroom decor and stores my Gillette adjustable razor and my shaving brush perfectly.  TO KIDS OR LADIES:  If your Dad or man is into the proper way to shave, this would make an excellent gift.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband who is really into using the shaving mug and brush. It is good quality and holds his razor and the shave brush very nicely. And it looks good on the counter.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband to go with his safety razor and brush. Everything fits perfe and now it is off the counter top.</li>
    <li> I bought this stand along with a Merkur long handle safety razor and the Tweezerman brush, and both fit nicely on the stand.  Mine feels sturdy, and I haven&#x27;t had any wobbling issues.  I haven&#x27;t noticed the rusting issue mentioned by other reviewers either, but I&#x27;ve only had mine for about 3 weeks.  So far though, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.  It looks great, feels solid, and my shaving tools fit perfectly on there.</li>
    <li> The main purpose for a stand like this is so you can hang the brush and let it drip dry into the sink or a bowl. The base however is wide enough that it catches a lot of the drips itself (if trying to use the sink) or it blocks most bowls from getting close enough. It looks good and seems durable, but ends up just being a pretty storage spot for the brush.</li>
    <li> Says chrome-- the color I got was not chrome-- but looks kind of yellow-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t a big enough problem to return-- it does the job.</li>
    <li> This little stand compliments my bathroom count. Brush and razor look great in it! Thanks for a nice product!</li>
    <li> The stand works perfectly.  It is very stable and doesn&#x27;t tip over if just the brush or the razor on there.  Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t notice any rusting.  I don&#x27;t leave a soaking wet brush or razor on it so maybe that&#x27;s the reason.  I only wish the stand base, stem and opening hooks could be unscrewed so traveling with it is easier.</li>
    <li> Chrome color is slightly different than the Merkur razor it was featured with. Also neither of my brushes seem to fit unless I set them where the bristles attach to the handle which perches it kind of high. I guess it will do.</li>
    <li> I use this to hold a Westor Razor Co. safety razor and an Omega #10048 shaving brush. It works perfectly. I have to hold the brush below the handle due to the brush handle being so big but it still works. The razor fits perfetly and the styling matches perfectly on both of them. No complaints and looks great on my counter.</li>
    <li> This is a nice stand.  I was supprised on how well mad and sturdy it is.  It is a good deal.  I would recommend this stand to any one.</li>
    <li> Love the stand, keeps the counter clean.&lt;br /&gt;Quality construction with heavy base.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to any one.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the product.</li>
    <li> I loves the little stand. It holds razor and brush really well. Makes bath room really classy and I like the way it looks.</li>
    <li> Looks well made-sturdy. Useful for my purposes. I do not like adding more words because I am being forced to. I already said what I thought.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Merkur Safety Razor &amp; Parker Brush! The Stand is sturdy and the perfect weight to sustain my safety razor and brush. Its simple design is pleasing to the eye and gets the job done. Well worth the $20 for this stand!</li>
    <li> Works and looks great!  Simple and sleek to add to the shaving essentials.  A must for any man (and looks great in a feminine bathroom).</li>
    <li> Adequate. Not overly exciting. Your badger brush needs to be held upside down and this does the job. I I</li>
    <li> It is good price and can do the work. But it is not very stable on the table, needs improvements.</li>
    <li> The stand does its job and looks good doing it. A handy necessity for storing razor and brush between shaves. Recommended for all DE blade shavers.</li>
    <li> Got this as a companion gift to the Col Ichabod Conk 5 piece shave set, and it just works. Nice and heavy chrome finish matches my safety razor.</li>
    <li> Got this to put my safety razor and my Savile Row 2124 brush on. The brush is a little too wide and doesn&#x27;t quite fit on the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is great quality and fairly hefty.</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Sleek and simple, yet solid and of good quality, design goes with any bathroom decor.  Keeps things tidy in the bathroom and goes well with his razor.</li>
    <li> Simple design that&#x27;s perfect for my life.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, works well with my vintage Gillette adjustable razor and Simpson #59 Best Badger brush.  Was concerned about fit with brush but is perfect.  Matches chrome faucet fixtures and is complementary.  Well made, good weight and has cushioned bottom.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this when it arrived. It&#x27;s substantial and heavy and sturdy. It looks great with a Murker razor--the little crosshatched pattern matches nicely. Holds my Parker shave brush just, though it tips a bit.</li>
    <li> It was heavier than expected. It stands there on my bathroom counter, a lone shaving sentinel. It patiently holds my razor and shaving brush awaiting the next time we do battle against errant whiskers.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stand looks on my sink with brush and razor stationed. I brings a sense of nostalgia, like the old timer&#x27;s style.</li>
    <li> High enough for a long handle razor. Nice simple styling. Base needed to be a tad bit heavier for single hand removal and replacement. of the brush.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, nicely finished. Holds razor (Merkur long handle) well without wobbling. I was hoping the brush side would fit the indentation in the handle of the my badger hair brush but it was too narrow. It fits just fine where the handle meets the bristles and I&#x27;m good with that. Recommend.</li>
    <li> This stand looks good on my bathroom counter holding my Parker 60R butterfly DE safety razor and Van der Hagen boars bristle brush.  Great value and looks nice while it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Simple, stylish, good quality.  Has a nice heavy base and won&#x27;t tip over.  All solid metal from what I can tell.  Had it for about 6 months so far and hasn&#x27;t chipped, or faded or anything.</li>
    <li> The base is not weighted and wobbles especially when you remove the razor or brush.  Pretty much what I expected tor the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, good price and fast shipping.  Exactly what I was looking for. Keeps my Bluebeard Scimitar and shaving brush high and dry between shaves. Gleaming steel sits pretty on the counter, too!</li>
    <li> This razor stand is not made of entirely stainless steal. I have had it for over six months and the chrome finish has started to peel off, revealing some kind of non-stainless-steel compound underneath. Something that will be in contact with water should not be advertised as stainless steel if it really is just a chrome finish.</li>
    <li> Stand looks great and works very well. I own an Edwin Jagger DE89lbl and a Parker Hurley Pure badger hair brush and both fit perfectly on this stand. I had read a few reviews that said they were concerned about the stand itself rusting, I have had this stand sitting next to the sink for a few months now and have had no problems with or signs of rusting. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Husband is new to straight razor shaving and bought this with the badger hair soap brush and some Ogallala products.  Everything is great.  Even despite the cats&#x27; initial obsession with the brush, they never knocked over the stand.  Shines up easily.</li>
    <li> My husband finally has a place to hang his brush and razor. Would have been nice to have a place for a bowl as well, but this is working fine for him.</li>
    <li> GOOD QUALITY ITEM AND THE PRIZE IS VERY LOW CONSIDERING THE REGULAR PRIZE IN THE MARKET.&lt;br /&gt;FIT PERFECTLY WELL WITH THE MERKUR RAZOR.</li>
    <li> I am just starting to use DE razors and wanted a basic stand, mostly for the shaving brush.  This stand seems very well built.  It is solid and heavy with no loose parts that you might find on &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; items.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to hang my newly-acquired shaving things and it is adequate. It seems fairly solid and well balanced - I haven&#x27;t had it tip over and I&#x27;m pleased with the product. My brush doesn&#x27;t quite fit in the brush holder portion, and I have to angle it a little to make it stay, but it works well.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, good-looking and very functional for both my razor and my brush.  It&#x27;s everything I wanted at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Mach razor doesn&#x27;t stay on the stand... Only good for holding the shave brush.</li>
    <li> Stand is attractive and sturdy, but the opening for the brush holder is narrow. The brush I bought won&#x27;t fit. The price of this Razor and Brush Stand makes for a good deal, but if you get it, make sure you buy a brush with a narrow taper in the handle.</li>
    <li> My Simply Beautiful Razor and Brush Stand exceded my expectations. It is a quality item that should last a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s high quality, but the brush side opening is not large enough for a &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34; brush.</li>
    <li> It looks fine and its sturdy but my Van Der Hagen brush doesn&#x27;t fit into it so I sit the brush on top with the bristles sitting in the fork of the unit. My razor would not sit properly either but my Parker razor has a detail on the handle that luckily is the right size to slide it onto the fork</li>
    <li> I finally moved from using an improvised brush holder made out of a wire hanger to something more solid and this set represented the best value for the money.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with purchase. It looks very nice and is quite sturdy. I have no issues with it being wobbly and it fits my brush and safety razor (Feather) perfectly. There&#x27;s some heft to the base which is very nice.</li>
    <li> Really nice on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Simple, and not expensive.</li>
    <li> Solid and nice looking stand. Heavy weight which is great. My only observation is that the bottom plate has a rubber gasket to avoid slippage, this rubber gasket is not retained properly and came off. I&#x27;l glue it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it needs to</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It was delivered on time &amp; met all expectations.</li>
    <li> not as heavy or as sturdy as i&#x27;d like it to be but its nice and shiny</li>
    <li> Better than expected! I&#x27;ve bee into wet shaving for about 10 yrs now and have about 30 DE razors. With several stands..  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with the weight and quality of this stand!</li>
    <li> The SimplyBeautiful Deluxe Chrome Razor &amp; Brush Stand is really a great stand.  It is probably one of the most affordable shaving stands you can get.  My shaving brush fits it just right, and my Mach 3 razor fits it good too.</li>
    <li> this thing is pretty good. the foam padding on the bottom doesn&#x27;t fit quite flush and it moves a little empty. But, once you add the razor and stuff, it stays put.</li>
    <li> Works great, solid built, and does what it needs to.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much due to its price.  What I received; however, far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well-finished and constructed, and functional shaving stand.  This is chrome plated, NOT stainless steel, so I do expect, at some point in future, it will start to rust.  If you are considering purchase, just keep that in mind and remember what you paid for this item.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is pretty heavy, so it&#x27;s stable.  When I remove or place razor or brush, it won&#x27;t try to tilt over.  The top flat piece is pretty thick, so it&#x27;s not flimsy.  (it&#x27;s very study as a matter of fact)  Openings are well sized, so my DE shaver and brush fit nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first and only purchase of this type of item, so I am not able to do any comparison.  But I am very pleased with the appearance, value, and function of this item.</li>
    <li> Good stand and does the job! Looks good on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Started rusting a little so..... It should have better rust protection seeing as how it sits in the bathroom.  Otherwise, it looks good and seems well made.</li>
    <li> Looks great in my bathroom; understated yet elegant.</li>
    <li> Does not fit all razors.</li>
    <li> Nice stand, looks good, great balance, good price</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and functional.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a few months now and it is holding up great! Looks as good as it did when I bough it.</li>
    <li> along with the brush and razor it looks realy good, but these three should be sold as a set.</li>
    <li> This stand is quite simply the best stand of its kind that I have ever purchased or seen.  It is large, very&lt;br /&gt;well made, and is suitable for holding just about any size razor and/or brush.  My big boar shaving brush&lt;br /&gt;would not fit, but that hardly breaks my heart.  I have two badger brushes that will, and I like badger better&lt;br /&gt;anyway for shaving.  Grab one the next time it becomes available before someone else does.</li>
    <li> love and great price  just what i needed</li>
</ol>
