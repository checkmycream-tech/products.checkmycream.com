      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love using this, and don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the way it helps reduce the puffiness below my eyes</li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promply.</li>
      <li>Liquid foundation works better, but I put IA over my make-up.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to use their moisturizer and let it dry before applying the facelift serum.</li>
      <li>Still love it, just have to scoop it out and use saline solution to keep it smooth.</li>
      <li>So it is best used on clean dry skin after lotion has been applied but not before.</li>
      <li>dries out very quickly</li>
      <li>The fine lines disappeared and even helped with the deeper lines on my forehead.</li>
      <li>They say if you get the powdery film, to wipe it off lightly with water.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product as a result of a demonstration at a trade show.  </li>
      <li>I happen to have gotten lucky when a friend bought it and put it on my face.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best kept secret</li>
      <li>This works instantly and produces fabulous results!  </li>
      <li>and I have to open the top even though I&#x27;ve followed all the instructions I have NEVER had a bottle work beyond 1/2 way.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, have been using it for several years.  </li>
      <li>I first saw this at a convention I was working and the salesmen and saleswomen were both using it on one side of their faces.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for anyone that has seen more  birthdays than they would like to admit and their eyes are beginning to look a little tired.  </li>
      <li>It is very important that you never get the area which I.A. is applied wet.</li>
      <li>You will get it if you really want to.</li>
      <li>You have to be cautious how to use it, following the directions precisely.</li>
      <li>Gently tap it in --do not rub.</li>
      <li>I found this stuff at a women&#x27;s show and while I really like it and use it every day (under my eyes), it does have its faults.  </li>
      <li>I would only use this for special occasions .</li>
      <li>It sometimes leaves traces of white residue -- just tap a tiny dot of moisture (eye cream) over the top and the white disappears.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than similar products I&#x27;ve tryed before, but still turns white later in the day.</li>
      <li>The formula is gritty and if you use to much it looks flaky.</li>
      <li>this seller had discounted the price because the product was old.  </li>
      <li>The puffy skin under my eyes was completely gone within 3 minutes of application.  </li>
      <li>Worth trying, but carefully</li>
      <li>Make sure the bottle is always turned upside down so that the little hole on the bottom is always showing.  </li>
      <li>I found that it&#x27;s better to start with little drops and to add a little at a time if necessary.</li>
      <li>That keeps the product from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, only use a tiny, tiny drop under your eye and pat it gently with your ring finger until almost dry.  </li>
      <li>I use it and it rates about the same as all the other ones i have that lift... really haven&#x27;t found any product that is a miracle</li>
      <li>So I think this price rise might be due to the high demand of hte product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I originally purchased this product as a result of a demonstration at a trade show.  The demonstration was done on me and the friend I went to the trade show with said, &amp;#34;You have got to buy this product&amp;#34; as a result of the demonstration.  The puffy skin under my eyes was completely gone within 3 minutes of application.  It was amazing!  I was planning to go back to the trade show the next time it was in town to replenish my supply but the show was not scheduled at a convenient time for me.  That is when I looked on line to see if I could find it.  I was delighted when I found it and it was the same price I paid at the show.  This product is perfect for anyone that has seen more  birthdays than they would like to admit and their eyes are beginning to look a little tired.  It takes some practice to learn how to apply the product and then your makeup but you will get the knack.  Great product and Amazing results!</li>
    <li> Works great for my under eye puffiness.  Firms and tightens!  You have to use a very small amount and pat it on. Practice Practice and Practice. You will get it if you really want to.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and can&#x27;t imagine my days without it. I have never used anything like this before. Lots of puffy eye creams and serums tell you they work, but they never do. Well, at least not for me they don&#x27;t. I.A. immediately firms and tightens the skin/bags under the eye. It takes only a few minutes to take effect. One minute the eye is puffy and then it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s really amazing how the bags disappear. I found that it&#x27;s better to start with little drops and to add a little at a time if necessary. It all depends how bad the puffiness is. The only thing I wonder is if there are long term benefits or risks with I.A. It hasn&#x27;t been long enough for me to notice either way. Sometimes the skin under my eyes feel a little extra sensitive but that&#x27;s about it. It is very important that you never get the area which I.A. is applied wet. Makeup and moisturizer will lessen the effect. So it is best used on clean dry skin after lotion has been applied but not before.</li>
    <li> It works real good and I love it. I wish it would last longer. I love using this, and don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, have been using it for several years.  I am disappointed that the bottles never last through the use of the pricy and I have to open the top even though I&#x27;ve followed all the instructions I have NEVER had a bottle work beyond 1/2 way. Still love it, just have to scoop it out and use saline solution to keep it smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just great!  Just wanted to say that I bought this product at USD49 and now it costs USD71!, I guess this happened because the product patent was bought by Jeunesse Global (a company that distributies its products to 104 countries) and this company has widely promoted this product, So I think this price rise might be due to the high demand of hte product. Jeunesse sells this produt at USD 61 plus shipping</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of Instantly Ageless that I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m pleased with the way it helps reduce the puffiness below my eyes (of course surgery would be best, but I have to plan for that).  However, the pump on both bottles stopped working almost immediately.  At first it would squirt random amounts, then stop altogether.  So I have to unscrew the top and shake out the product. Also, there are tiny particles in the product that, if on the skin, will dry to a white color that is hard to scrape off the skin.  Just be careful to wipe them off when the product is still wet.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed. The formula is gritty and if you use to much it looks flaky. It just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle.  I have learned some tricks with this product.  Make sure the bottle is always turned upside down so that the little hole on the bottom is always showing.  That keeps the product from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, only use a tiny, tiny drop under your eye and pat it gently with your ring finger until almost dry.  Lay down and don&#x27;t move for about 2 minute and fan it with your hand to dry completely.</li>
    <li> I found this stuff at a women&#x27;s show and while I really like it and use it every day (under my eyes), it does have its faults.  It can appear chalky and flaky, especially if you use powder foundation.  Liquid foundation works better, but I put IA over my make-up.  Pat it on, do not wipe.  It takes a bit of &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; with it for best results.  So, until I  have cosmetic surgery, I&#x27;ll continue to use IA.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa E.</li>
    <li> Too chalky, does make puffiness go down due to it tighting skin in that area but if you try to wipe it off the puffiness will come back.</li>
    <li> I use it and it rates about the same as all the other ones i have that lift... really haven&#x27;t found any product that is a miracle</li>
    <li> I do not like the sachets...product is good but the new packaging is horrible...</li>
    <li> does not work at all, leave s a residue , looks terrible after it drys, old product, bottle clogs easy</li>
    <li> The product does work. It definitely hides wrinkles without looking fake. I would only use this for special occasions . It is costly for such a small amount. The price on Amazon was $50.00 cheaper than what my salon was selling it for. Wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> Good product at a fantastic price</li>
    <li> You have to be cautious how to use it, following the directions precisely. I first saw this at a convention I was working and the salesmen and saleswomen were both using it on one side of their faces. Amazing. It&#x27;s best to use their moisturizer and let it dry before applying the facelift serum. You have to apply it sparingly - excess leaves a white chalky residue.  Do not rub it in! It takes some practice but it makes a difference!</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with this product. I tried to use it multiple times, each time using less product so I didn&#x27;t get the white powdery effect on my face. They say if you get the powdery film, to wipe it off lightly with water. When I did this, the product wasn&#x27;t doing anything.  I even put just a little bit on my face and laid down so that my face would relax but it still got the powdery film and water just removed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I requested a refund from the product maker but they won&#x27;t take it back because I opened it. It&#x27;s really hard to try a product without opening it and when you do then they won&#x27;t redfund your money on a product that doesn&#x27;t perform as they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even if it says its guaranteed, don&#x27;t bother because they won&#x27;t give you a refund anyway.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than similar products I&#x27;ve tryed before, but still turns white later in the day. Worth trying, but carefully</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promply.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. I will recommend that you moisturize heavily before applying a single tiny dot under each eye area and over lid. Gently tap it in --do not rub. It sometimes leaves traces of white residue -- just tap a tiny dot of moisture (eye cream) over the top and the white disappears. This product does support my under and upper eye areas by tightening a little. It&#x27;s my choice until I can afford a surgeon! You just need a tiny amount!</li>
    <li> It is very thick and has to have water added to it periodically.  I apply it under my eyes after using the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> dries out very quickly</li>
    <li> This stuff is difficult to apply and make the skin look chalky and dry. Not what I thought it would be. :(</li>
    <li> The pump stops working half way thru the use if this product, it has happened with the last 6 bottles. Manufacturer needs to do something about this.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market!  I happen to have gotten lucky when a friend bought it and put it on my face.  This works instantly and produces fabulous results!  It&#x27;s the best kept secret and I&#x27;m thrilled to have found it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Will not be without this again</li>
    <li> Have used it before, but this bottle was different.  Not as good as before.  Used just a little as before, but was more chalky and made the skin around my eyes a little pink which made them look tired.  Weird.</li>
    <li> I just tried my sample and it worked almost instantly!  The fine lines disappeared and even helped with the deeper lines on my forehead.</li>
    <li> the shelf life of this product is limited.  this seller had discounted the price because the product was old.  total waste of money...unable to use it at all.  when the product is fresh, it works great.</li>
