      <li>great item, shipped quickly</li>
      <li>So I was very happy to find that there&#x27;s still some &amp;#34;new old stock&amp;#34; on warehouse shelves out there.  </li>
      <li>This putty doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of grease or grit and is really easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair product ever, bar none.  </li>
      <li>I  have used this product for many years.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this.</li>
      <li>it would or wouldn&#x27;t work for their hair, but as a guy, I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Buying it in bulk on Amazon indisputably provided a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This really was great</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most hair care products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I will be back for more!!!</li>
      <li>Loved this product when I first used it, as soon as garnier reformulated the putty and the rest of their products, it didnt hold well and contained 3 oz instead of 5oz for more money.</li>
      <li>Good thing I came to amazon and not only do they still have this stuff, but in a 6 pk which will be good for years to come.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product but really, $200 for a 6-pack?!?!?!</li>
      <li>Was so excited to find the gel here, it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite gel</li>
      <li>It holds my style and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair looking greasy like other putties, and it smells great too!  </li>
      <li>Was excited to find a replacement to my favorite product just to have this one discontinued as well.  </li>
      <li>it is strong.</li>
      <li>To have the best effect, I rinse my hair under water, towel-dry it until it&#x27;s just slightly damp, brush it to get the frizz out, and then I add the putty.</li>
      <li>Luckily I was able to buy in bulk on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for any guy that uses gel for this hair, this stuff is much, much better!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe they have discontinued such an amazing product!  </li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s much better</li>
      <li>Garnier now has a zillion other hair products out there, but they may sound great</li>
      <li>just so I know I have a good supply of this that will last me awhile.</li>
      <li>Have ordered it twice and both times came in extremely quick.  </li>
      <li>Great product not too heavy.</li>
      <li>tain&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
      <li>(not stiffly!)and is just right for a shag cut.  </li>
      <li>but it has a very strong, manly type, scent (think Axe) that I was not at all a fan of (I am female).</li>
      <li>I too have found that this product was discontinued and found that the new product does smell to much like a man&#x27;s product so glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I use this when my hair is short, because it makes it more manageable.</li>
      <li>Just add a couple drops of water in your hand as you grab the goop out and it makes application so much easier!</li>
      <li>then the new product they rolled out with a different name &amp;#34;fiber spikes power putty&amp;#34;... You get much more in this jar then you would in that other stuff, smells great, and using just a little bit, maybe a quarter size amount, allows my hair to be styled and &amp;#34;molded&amp;#34; as I wish, with the strength to hold up all day, even in some light to strong wind.</li>
      <li>I have curly thick hair and this works amazing!</li>
      <li>I have straight limpy hair and usiing</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I ordered this because my husband loves it so much and this way it was cheaper then at the store</li>
      <li>thanks for having this product</li>
      <li>I have really fine and flat hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely easier to use when the hair is wet, but for touch ups, adding the few drops of water is the best!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, Garnier Fructis saw fit to discontinue it a couple of years ago, and neither of the two different products they replaced it with are quite as good.  </li>
      <li>Without this, my hair would just be frizzy and out of control, so this now helps me tame my hair and make the curls more</li>
      <li>The new AXE clone they sell for twice the price</li>
      <li>I had purchased their new Power Putty Fiber Spikes because it was the closest I could find to this product.</li>
      <li>The price is great, the product is still viable (honestly, I don&#x27;t know whether this stuff actually CAN go bad, as long as the jar is sealed), shipping was prompt.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s old / out of date!</li>
      <li>But this Garnier fiber gum putty goes on, stays in, and stays clear.</li>
      <li>This product does not give me nasal congestion, holds my hair softly</li>
      <li>Highly recommended (actually, NO!  </li>
      <li>This is the only product that actually helps me get a high, sleek ponytail!</li>
      <li>My flat hair actually gets volume and it stays for the whole day.</li>
      <li>this product makes it look thick  and full .</li>
      <li>The new packaging in stores now gives you less product (I think it&#x27;s a little over 3oz versus this old packaging with 5oz), and my store sells the newly packaged product at $6.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  Couldn&#x27;t find it in the local stores anywhere.  I use this when my hair is short, because it makes it more manageable. I have straight limpy hair and usiing this product makes it look thick  and full . It holds my style and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair looking greasy like other putties, and it smells great too!  I have used this product off and on over 11 years. Whenever I decide to go to a shorter hair style, this is my number 1 choice in hair putties!  I will be back for more!!!</li>
    <li> Our local store had stopped carrying this so I was happy to find it on line..good stuff..it is strong. thanks</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product ever, bar none.  It smells nice, it holds well, it dries non-greasy and yet doesn&#x27;t flake.  Unfortunately, Garnier Fructis saw fit to discontinue it a couple of years ago, and neither of the two different products they replaced it with are quite as good.  So I was very happy to find that there&#x27;s still some &amp;#34;new old stock&amp;#34; on warehouse shelves out there.  The price is great, the product is still viable (honestly, I don&#x27;t know whether this stuff actually CAN go bad, as long as the jar is sealed), shipping was prompt.  Highly recommended (actually, NO!  Don&#x27;t buy this!  I&#x27;ll be needing to replenish my supply in another year or so!)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product but really, $200 for a 6-pack?!?!?! INSANE!! I&#x27;m soo sad...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Was very disappointed when my local stores stopped selling it so was so happy to find it on Amazon.  Have ordered it twice and both times came in extremely quick.  Hope they keep supplies forever because this stuff works great and I have used it for YEARS!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product...It&#x27;s old / out of date! Newer stuff out there for much less</li>
    <li> ordered and delivered as expected......sad thing is now the product is discontinued and impossible to find for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my husband loves it so much and this way it was cheaper then at the store and now we are set for a while.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I found this product on Amazon! I haven&#x27;t seen it in stores for years. I have curly thick hair and this works amazing! I know some ppl might be put off by the texture. There&#x27;s a simple fix for that. Just add a couple drops of water in your hand as you grab the goop out and it makes application so much easier! It&#x27;s definitely easier to use when the hair is wet, but for touch ups, adding the few drops of water is the best!</li>
    <li> Bring it back!  The new AXE clone they sell for twice the price tain&#x27;t worth it.  To dopy, AXE wearing frat boys and the Garnier marketing department, a pox on you both!</li>
    <li> Loved this product when I first used it, as soon as garnier reformulated the putty and the rest of their products, it didnt hold well and contained 3 oz instead of 5oz for more money. Good thing I came to amazon and not only do they still have this stuff, but in a 6 pk which will be good for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is no longer sold in stores and I panicked when I couldn&#x27;t find it. I have used it for years to give my air volume and to style. Luckily I was able to buy in bulk on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the only putty that I&#x27;ve found over the years to work for my hair type. I have really fine and flat hair. To have the best effect, I rinse my hair under water, towel-dry it until it&#x27;s just slightly damp, brush it to get the frizz out, and then I add the putty. My flat hair actually gets volume and it stays for the whole day. This putty doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of grease or grit and is really easy to wash out. Plus it has a very light but pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> I noticed a lot of people saying this, so I&#x27;d like to point it out -this product is NOT discontinued. The stores that used to carry them still do; they&#x27;re just in a different package. The new packaging in stores now gives you less product (I think it&#x27;s a little over 3oz versus this old packaging with 5oz), and my store sells the newly packaged product at $6. Buying it in bulk on Amazon indisputably provided a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only hair product that truly gives the &amp;#34;all day hold&amp;#34; on my hair. I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen products from various different brands before I found this. At first I thought the consistency was too thick and was worried it might leave some white flakes when it dries and parts like a previous product I used. But this Garnier fiber gum putty goes on, stays in, and stays clear. All day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used to spike my hair with this product, my mom accused me of almost poking her eye out. Friends always joked about popping balloons on my hair -and it happened, once!  I&#x27;ve let my hair grow longer since and permed it. Without this, my hair would just be frizzy and out of control, so this now helps me tame my hair and make the curls more accentuated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always smelled really nice, too -I think it smells like green apples.</li>
    <li> Well, Garnier has decided to do away with this........and bring in some other junk.  This really was great and I can tell by reviews that others that the same thing.  Garnier now has a zillion other hair products out there, but they may sound great but they don&#x27;t work like this.  Too bad for Garnier......and the rest of us.........thanks for having this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not female so can&#x27;t say how well it would or wouldn&#x27;t work for their hair, but as a guy, I love this stuff. First, it&#x27;s much better then the new product they rolled out with a different name &amp;#34;fiber spikes power putty&amp;#34;... You get much more in this jar then you would in that other stuff, smells great, and using just a little bit, maybe a quarter size amount, allows my hair to be styled and &amp;#34;molded&amp;#34; as I wish, with the strength to hold up all day, even in some light to strong wind. No dry white mess as other gel&#x27;s leave. Highly recommended for any guy that uses gel for this hair, this stuff is much, much better!</li>
    <li> Great product and received quickly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this. It was discontinued and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. This is the only product that actually helps me get a high, sleek ponytail!</li>
    <li> Was so excited to find the gel here, it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite gel</li>
    <li> Great product not too heavy. Tames down the frizzies</li>
    <li> I  have used this product for many years. The amount of product for the money was to good to pass up.</li>
    <li> Was excited to find a replacement to my favorite product just to have this one discontinued as well.  Such a shame Garnier.  Buy this product before it is gone</li>
    <li> I too have found that this product was discontinued and found that the new product does smell to much like a man&#x27;s product so glad to find it on Amazon.  I bought 2 cases so should not run out anytime to soon.</li>
    <li> Fructis is the best hair styling product ever!  Can&#x27;t believe they have discontinued such an amazing product!  Fructis please bring it back!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair product for well over 5 years now, and I haven&#x27;t found anything to match it. I have very curly hair, and it takes some serious product to tame it- this does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> great item, shipped quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and recently found out it has been discontinued. I had purchased their new Power Putty Fiber Spikes because it was the closest I could find to this product. It worked fairly similar to this but it has a very strong, manly type, scent (think Axe) that I was not at all a fan of (I am female). So I purchased this 6 pack and might even purchase another one just so I know I have a good supply of this that will last me awhile. I hope I will be able to find this on Amazon for years to come!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most hair care products.  Hairspray and mousse makes me stuffy and cough.  This product does not give me nasal congestion, holds my hair softly (not stiffly!)and is just right for a shag cut.  I am sorry Garnier has discontinued this product.</li>
