      <li>Very good value for standardized tubing.</li>
      <li>Great product..will continue to order from here when I need to replace these.</li>
      <li>however I have experienced no problem with the Bantex and consider it a good value.  </li>
      <li>Good quality, good price.</li>
      <li>But fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Good quality at a good price</li>
      <li>Love when I get what I expect to receive!</li>
      <li>Perfect and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Fit and works great</li>
      <li>Nice and flexible but doesn&#x27;t kink.</li>
      <li>These are much better quality than what my pulmonary service sends to me</li>
      <li>Amazon said be more wordy</li>
      <li>Was worried if would fit.</li>
      <li>Can move around freely.  </li>
      <li>These make awesome straws for when you&#x27;re laying in bed and you&#x27;re too lazy to lift a finger</li>
      <li>So glad I bought this needed new tubing</li>
      <li>Just the right size to get the correct oxygen to the cannula.  </li>
      <li>and this was right on time.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered and needed.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I ordered several brands to compare and Bantex was the best - it just feels more solid (bigger in diameter and harder to sqeeze) and does not kink at all.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good for the little girl&#x27;s room without the call light or fear of passing out because my O2 sats drop too low..</li>
      <li>Was as durable as expected for disposable medical tubing and the most economical choice at the time.</li>
      <li>It replaced a 10 foot tubing which had a larger diameter, tighter connections and was a nice green color</li>
      <li>End Fixture for attachment are firm and tight making the delivery of nebulizer treatment efficient and effective</li>

    <li> the connector ends where too stiff and I had difficulty attaching and releasing devices.  Not much more to say... did not work for my application.</li>
    <li> End Fixture for attachment are firm and tight making the delivery of nebulizer treatment efficient and effective</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Love when I get what I expect to receive!</li>
    <li> Just the right size to get the correct oxygen to the cannula.  Can move around freely.  I use it on my portable concentrator.</li>
    <li> Perfect and exactly what I was looking for. These are much better quality than what my pulmonary service sends to me</li>
    <li> Very good value for standardized tubing. Was as durable as expected for disposable medical tubing and the most economical choice at the time.</li>
    <li> These make awesome straws for when you&#x27;re laying in bed and you&#x27;re too lazy to lift a finger</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hose goes from where I want to where I want. Connections are standard and seem to seal well. Amazon said be more wordy I say get some one else to write them then.</li>
    <li> Was worried if would fit. But fit perfectly. Good product. Good quality, good price. Will recommend to others: family, friends.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and needed. Great product..will continue to order from here when I need to replace these.</li>
    <li> Very long which was needed. But it tore after a week.  So im back in the same boat</li>
    <li> Arrived and was just as it was described. Fit and works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on Oxygen 24/7 due to lung disease and hate when I in hospital confined to bed not my by doctor&#x27;s orders, but, by a 7 foot long nasal cannula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I get this length of tubing with a swivel connector to connect to the cannula and I&#x27;m good for the little girl&#x27;s room without the call light or fear of passing out because my O2 sats drop too low..</li>
    <li> Tubing arrived promptly and I used it immediately.  It replaced a 10 foot tubing which had a larger diameter, tighter connections and was a nice green color however I have experienced no problem with the Bantex and consider it a good value.  The reason for purchasing the 14 ft tubing was I needed the additional 4 feet to position the machine where it needed to be.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with my kid&#x27;s nebulizer thingy.</li>
    <li> I was using the 25&#x27; tube but the cord kept getting tangled up. Just to long so I took a suggestion from another review. Bought 2 14&#x27; tubes and put a swivel connector in the middle. Now I have fewer tangles and easier to untangle when I need to.</li>
    <li> I ordered several brands to compare and Bantex was the best - it just feels more solid (bigger in diameter and harder to sqeeze) and does not kink at all.</li>
    <li> Oxygen Tubing seems to be all the same in my experience ...just different lengths. Oh, some are lighter than others but that doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
    <li> This hose is unlike others I have purchased. It has not collapsed after being connected or when being snaked around and under furniture. It is sturdy and seems likely to be subject to interim sterilization before replacement. Previously I have had to cobble together hoses of various lengths through the use of connectors. This is unsanitary and provides additional places for germs to multiply.</li>
    <li> Nice and flexible but doesn&#x27;t kink. Good quality at a good price</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this needed new tubing and this was right on time.</li>
