    <li> Ok, soft skin but not a bleach, buy it is a nice product but they should put more in the  bottle</li>
    <li> Very very messy and insignificant amount in each jar. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and I was also offered one free new cream. So far it did change my skin tone and also skin texture.</li>
    <li> First off,I am a lighter skinned African American female. I decided to give Mena a try after a positive review on youtube. Let me tell you...it has worked for me in as little as 10 days. Almost two weeks into using this product on my face every night and I am about a whole shade lighter. Will continue using and will return to report my results! I absolutely recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t see no difference in my skin, i used it day and night for about a month and just stopped because nothing was being done. Was hoping for it to actually work!!</li>
    <li> i stopped using it. it could be great for other skin. great customer service.</li>
    <li> i help my friend brought this acne dark spot , she told me it work well , she happy to have it .than we buy on amazon cheap than other shop</li>
    <li> This is very good whitening cream and helps the pimples to dry out and heal... I used it for few weeks and i gave some to my mom and now she wants more.. I strongly recommend this product who has acne or pimples..</li>
    <li> This really has lightened up my acne scars and brightened and cleared my skin. The jars are small but they last.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing except leave a white film on my face. I will not be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> It does lighten acne scars, it doesn&#x27;t stop my face from breaking, however it does keep it under control. It doesn&#x27;t lighten my skin that I&#x27;ve notice.</li>
    <li> Thank you I loved it and loved the pictures too :)) and thank you for the other cream :)) it came in like it said too :)</li>
    <li> Was a great experience I got my product sooner than I thought I would</li>
    <li> I just got it today. I order it last week so it came fast. I&#x27;ve done my fair share of research on mena,  and heard nothing but great results.  Just so you know the amount is very small portion. So I do say go with bulk when buying this. Its cheap enough where that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  The smell is fresh I love everything about it so far.</li>
    <li> Saw improvements a little, but I think I&#x27;m gonna stop using it. Around 4th or 5th day causes dryness to skin, made my skin rough, and my skin started to itch. So I&#x27;m not gonna use it anymore. Hard to remove those white flakes/cream that was still on my skin in the morning as well.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible, doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I have light brown skin and the only thing it did for me is make me look like Casper the ghost. The cream is so thick like vampire makeup did absolutely nothing for dark spots. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I loved the product. I am still using it in the morning and at night. It not only helps get rid of the scars but I feel like it is a great moisturizer. Lots of people are writing negative reviews for the product saying it is hard to use and that it causes white blobs on their faces and so on. I would just like to state that if you warm up your finger tips a little and then spread the cream, it spreads very well.</li>
    <li> love it thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It WORKS!  I have notice visible results in 1 week.  I will be ordering more.  I have tried many products from ($-$$$) with no avail.  My dark spots are on my chin and lips.  I am so presently surprise to find a product that REALLY work at a reasonable price.  Small jar but a just a Dab will do.</li>
    <li> very happy with this product used on my knees, daughters used on pimple scars, under the arm spots and blemishes.  it works wonders.  thanks. very please.</li>
