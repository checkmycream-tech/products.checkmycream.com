<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have wavy frizzy hair that is color treated. When I lightened my hair it became very dry, brittle and damaged. The hydrating oil mask worked wonders, making my hair soft again. I received this package as a promotional offer, and having already had great results with the mask I was excited to try their other products. I am not a big spender on shampoo and conditioner, always thinking that it&#x27;s my other hair products that will really make the difference. This product has changed my tune. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for over a month. I stopped using the mask, just because I finished the one that was already in my shower and have yet to replace it with the one that came with this package - and the shampoo and conditioner alone has kept my hair managable and soft. I was happy to see that they sell the shampoo and conditioner separately because I will definately be purchasing these products again. I continue to use the mask after a color treatment, but for regular maintance the shampoo and conditioner work great on their own.</li>
    <li> I think this is a very fair price for such a great product. Although I have been a loyal user of Pureology hair products, I can stand behind this line of hair care products as I used them for one month before coloring my hair blond again. Due to the poor water quality at my home, I have to use a platinum shampoo to keep the brassiness out. I went back to Pureology&#x27;s platinum shampoo for this. Had I not colored my hair so light and need a whitening shampoo, I&#x27;d have stuck with this line. It worked wonders on my over processed hair and brought it back to life!</li>
    <li> Seems like it is working as it should so far.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair looks so much better. And I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
    <li> I have long and very fine hair but somehow with wave as well. My hair generally looks terrible down since its flat (from being fine) and yet messy (from my refusal to bother with a straight iron). Anyway, this is close to the holy grail of hair products for me. It makes my hair really super soft and shiny (like i just want to touch it alot) but somehow doesn&#x27;t make it any flatter or stringy than it already was - and maybe even makes it a bit less flat and stringy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time.  I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t dry up my hair/scalp as much as other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Have been coloring my brown hair blonde for years. Usually leaves it dry and brittle. This shampoo has really added shine and softness to my hair! Have recommended it to a ton of people! Will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I have my hair died and highlighted blonde.  It gets really dry.  I love this product.  My hair is oily and has an S curl, and I can easily wear it curly or straight.  Most moisturizing shampoo and conditioners are too heavy, and I lose my curl.  This product is totally awesome. My hair is curly or straight depending how I style it.  I also tried the curly hair creme and it is also awesome.  I quit using the 3 other cremes and gels I had used previously.  Also my hair isn&#x27;t falling out either.  Going through the change and was having trouble with my hair falling out.</li>
    <li> So I ordered the shampoo, but there was a miscommunication or an error in the supply count between Amazon and Lyfe Style Goods. This resulted in me receiving the Conditioner as opposed to the Shampoo. At first I was fairly upset and messaged the seller something along the lines of &amp;#34;grr, do I return this for my proper item?&amp;#34; Within two hours and twenty-three minutes I received a response letter that illustrated the problem which I explained in the first sentence. For those concerned about customer service, the letter was written efficiently and in a caring manner, so I&#x27;m appreciative of that and is why I&#x27;m writing this review. You&#x27;re a great representative Leslie Andrews! Am I allowed to use names?? Meh, anyway: I didn&#x27;t know I was receiving the shampoo in compensation, but I just now received it, so &amp;#34;hooray!&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll use it tomorrow.  Currently, what I can say pertains to the conditioner- It&#x27;s pretty awesome. Granted it&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used conditioner, as I don&#x27;t believe men should be using it too often, or at least people with thin hair like mine. That may actually be an unfair statement as although my hair is &amp;#34;thin,&amp;#34; I have a fairly decent amount of it. Thank you testosterone, until you turn on me someday soon and make me bald. I digress: I do enjoy the conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using it after my Nizoral shampoo, and while the Nizoral dries out my hair, thus making it look fuller, this conditioner gives me the sense that moisture is returning back to the follicles. My hair doesn&#x27;t look as full, as how could it when moisture is present, but I honestly believe my hair is healthier while still retaining fullness, even if not as much. I also believe my natural blonde color is being restored after many years of sun damage, although that may just be coincidence? So all in all it&#x27;s a worthy trade-off I must say! I fail to see the fullness as an issue for any women that are interested in the conditioner, as women usually have longer hair, layer their hair, and do not lose it as fast or as soon as men. However, this might be another unfair statement as, in general, women do much more to their hair than I do to mine, or other men, or perhaps any sensible human being. The smell is also pretty great.  If you&#x27;re some weird fruit fanatic and need to smell like an artificial strawberry garden, or you haven&#x27;t graduated high school and have terrible taste in not only &amp;#34;men,&amp;#34; but music and role-models, then this isn&#x27;t your product. If, however, you&#x27;re a considerate person and want to smell good while not making your loved ones or male friends gag, cough, or gasp for air as I often do when a girl-friend throws their hair in my face, sprays their perfume, or sprays half a bottle worth of hair-spray on themselves, then this is the product for you.  Lastly, for the less mentally capable out there, or for those that take packaging into serious consideration, neither of my bottles had holes or leaks. The only thing they had was a protective seal underneath the bottle-cap, of which you must twist COUNTER-CLOCKWISE to open. That&#x27;s when you rotate left, instead of right. Having successfully removed the bottle-cap, you must remove the seal on the container, perhaps with your finger or a pencil, not a knife as if you need me to explain this then you cannot be trusted with any sharp object, except for the aforementioned pencil. Once the seal is removed, place the bottle-cap back onto the container, spin CLOCK-WISE, and you&#x27;re good to go about squeezing the bottle for juicy shampoo/conditioner goodness.</li>
    <li> I am a long time fan of Arvazallia (if you haven&#x27;t tried their products, you absolutely HAVE to because you are seriously missing out, I recommend the trying the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner By Arvazallia for Dry or Damaged Hair as well, it has literally saved my hair!!).&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw this set, I knew I had to have these beauties.&lt;br /&gt;I have had horribly damaged hair due to coloring in the past, so my hair isn&#x27;t 100% healthy yet, but it&#x27;s getting there (mostly due to the mask I mentioned earlier)!&lt;br /&gt;So, since I have colored hair, it has always been a struggle to find something that will repair my hair while being sulfate free!  When I saw that these would be safe for my colored hair, I knew I had to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to receive this in the mail, the moment I got it, I knew I had to try it that very moment (I&#x27;m seriously like a little kid when it comes to beauty products, don&#x27;t judge me.)  First of all, these products smell AMAZING (but that wasn&#x27;t a surprise, Arvazallia always has yummy scented products).  Secondly, my hair has literally been reborn.  After rinsing out my hair, I instantly felt the difference.  My hair is a million times softer seconds after rinsing.  After drying my hair... well... it literally felt like silk!!  Okay, so at this point, I&#x27;m literally crying because I&#x27;ve never been so happy with my hair.. it&#x27;s like all of those years of bleaching and flat ironing never happened!!  Just, I am so thankful for this product and Arvazallia... they have saved the day once again!  Don&#x27;t think twice about buying, this little set will seriously make you cry in joy like I did!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Arvazallia products for some time now! I had tried the argan oil mask before and it did wonder to my damaged hair - it brought it back to life, so I was super excited to receive this set complementary for testing and review purposes. Let me just tell you, if you have dry damaged hair you definitely should consider this set! This is a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, so it won&#x27;t strip your hair from it&#x27;s natural oils, but it definitely cleanses and repairs! Argain oil have been so good for my hair so this set is awesome. The deep conditioning mask is pure goodness and it smells good too, I use it 2-3 times a week and definitely see improvement in my hair: not only it feels soft it looks so much healthier. Great set!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know my hair could be so soft. I have naturally curly and unfortunately frizzy hair, but this shampoo, conditioner and mask works wonders! My hair is soft, manageable and shiny. Excellent products!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy of this purchase since I have seen the difference from the first use of the product. My hair is softer and shinier and so easy to comb. No more tangles!</li>
    <li> Great product.  You can feel the effect it has on damaged hair right away.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner based on the great reviews and I&#x27;ve not been disappointed. I have fine, highlighted hair which has a tendency to get split ends. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement since using the products and the color hasn&#x27;t faded either. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the products (shampoo &amp; conditioner) for just a few weeks and have been pleased.  I use less than I normally did with other shampoos and conditioners.  If you&#x27;re thinking of trying these products, I&#x27;d urge you to do so.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It smells good and hydrates your hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing Products. We definitely purchase again&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo is thick and it does not take much, it left my hair feeling so soft BEFORE I conditioned it. I have thick, naturally curly hair so it can be temperamental. But this shampoo and conditioner works really well on it, keeps it very manageable. Will keep purchasing!</li>
    <li> I admit, I was curious, but I hesitated buying this thinking, how can it possibly revive something that&#x27;s basically dead? But I thought, what the hell. I&#x27;ll try it. My hair is colored and highlighted, and isn&#x27;t in too bad shape, but hasn&#x27;t had much in the way of shine for some time. Lately I&#x27;ve been trying different ways to give it shine, like a spray shine, and other hair treatment, so what&#x27;s one more product. Well, it&#x27;s day 3 and my fine color treated hair has shine! It behaves in all the right ways, and yes, smells terrific. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that mention a buildup, but I&#x27;m experiencing the opposite. It behaves more like a clarifying shampoo and leaves no residue. I was told by the seller via email not to expect much lather, but I get a lot of lather, so I don&#x27;t use much. I&#x27;ve used other sulfate free shampoos that don&#x27;t lather much. This one is really great. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent. I had just about given up on &amp;#34;hair-repair&amp;#34; shampoos and conditioners. This one actually works. My very coloring-damaged hair is getting a little better with each shampoo. Plus, this one seems to lather a little better than other &amp;#34;non-detergent/non-soap&amp;#34; shampoos, so you really get a sense of having freshly washed hair. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Kit because my hair is damaged and color treated. Since my hair needs all the help it can get, with being frizzy and unmanageable, I was hopeful that this would help and repair some of the damage. I have been using this product for about two weeks now and it seems to be working really well. My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy like it use to be and is very soft and more manageable. I love the weekly conditioning cream, it makes my hair so, very soft and it smells great. The other reason why I ordered this was because if it didn&#x27;t work for my hair, I could send it back because it is a 100%money back guarantee, so I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the Arvazallia makes my hair look healthy,beautiful and manageable with hardly any frizz at all. Give it a try, you have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product as with all of the other Users and certainly did not want to be a part of the 6 people for whom it didn&#x27;t work.  I guess I am number 7.  The shampoo made my hair feel like straw and the conditioner was hard to wash out.  The deep conditioner started making my hair shed a lot.  My hair is naturally curly 3C, 4A and 4B (yes all of those textures) and I usually wear a wash and go but these products were a no go for me.</li>
    <li> Wow, I was skeptically about this product but figured it wasn&#x27;t much more expensive compared to the salon products I purchase from my Ayurveda salon. This product works!! I noticed an instant difference in my hair in shine, and manageability. As I get older I&#x27;ve noticed the texture of my hair changing. This product makes my hair glossier, softer, and less fly away.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel great at first but seemed to have a build up after I used it 4 times.  I could tell there was a build up because my hair wasn&#x27;t as silky and got tangled more easily.  I think I&#x27;ll continue to use but only once a week</li>
    <li> I have been skeptical about purchasing hair products on Amazon after my last purchased product was completely different from the previous order of the same product, not to mention the scathing reviews of knock offs.  So I get it!  I know many don&#x27;t promote amazon shopping for hair products, but I have to say this product is pretty darn amazing!  I rarely take time to write reviews, but since I used reviews to make my decision, I kinda felt I needed to pay my dues!  I have very curly, dry hair &amp; had my hair lightened for the summer and trimmed on Friday &amp; didn&#x27;t wash until Monday.  My hair felt wrecked after my first wash with my other color care shampoo &amp; conditioner.  My ends were so bad I thought I was going back for a 3 inch trim!  😭. But, thankfully, my order arrived Monday afternoon and Tuesday I used the reg conditioner and Wednesday I used the mask conditioner (this is not as recommended, but I was short on time yesterday) and my hair feels a million times better!!!!!  I&#x27;m so surprised and so happy!! So if you have hair that is dry and damaged, I totally recommend this!!  They even email you a schedule of how/when to use the product.  😃</li>
    <li> The hair mask is the BOMB.COM!  I am never able to detangle my extremely coily, color-treated type 3C/4A curly hair.  After shampooing twice with the shampoo which left my hair and scalp cleansed but not stripped (it was actually very soft but I have to disagree that it is low-lathering - it was suds galore but I love it!), I towel dried my hair and applied the hair mask in 4 sections.  Upon application I instantly was able to finger detangle my hair.  I&#x27;m sold!  After setting and drying my hair it was super soft and shiny and I definitely would/will repurchase!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because both the hair mask and conditioner contain silicones.  I&#x27;m not super picky on ingredients but I know for curly girls this can be  deal breaker.  It still didn&#x27;t and wouldn&#x27;t stop me from using them and I still love how they worked in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I want to thank Arvazallia for giving me the opportunity to try these products!</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair, and I have been looking for something moisturizing enough.  While this works better than other products I have been using lately, it is still a touch too light. However, I have only used it a couple of times so far, so I may update, but so far it&#x27;s better than most products, and my hair feels healthy and smells great.</li>
    <li> I was one of the lucky participants picked to try out the Advanced Hair Shampoo and Conditioner along with the mask. I absolutely love the products from this company. Everything they come out with is fantastic. I have latina hair which is course, wavy and dry. I also like to do keratin treatments on my hair. I washed my hair on Wednesday and as of today, Friday my hair is soft and still has body. The norm for my hair is to fall flat by the second day after washing. The mask is wonderful. I like to leave it on for hours if time allows, and my hair is left shiny without frizz I also have the serum which did not come with this package, that too is another amazing product Last but not least I bought the cream for curly hair, again another 5 star product, I&#x27;m able to use the cream when I&#x27;m blowing drying my hair straight</li>
    <li> My hair was in dire need for help. It had been bleached, Yuko&#x27;d, Brazillian&#x27;d and keratin&#x27;d for YEARS...oh and not to mention too much heat from tools. I have strong hair but it finally has caught up with me. I came across these products and the packaging vibe caught my attention. It just really looked like it worked. I ordered it, was excited when it arrived (BTW, it comes in beautiful packing) and couldn&#x27;t wait to put it to the test. My hair is getting so much healthier. It is remaining soft and I feel feminine and healthy again. I am a believer of Arvazallia! So glad I found their products!</li>
    <li> My hair felt and looked like I had been to a top salon!  This is a top notch product!</li>
    <li> This is the Holy Grail hair kit. First off the box is gorgeous. As for the products, they are everything I need to keep my hair moisturized and healthy. The shampoo, and conditioner and mask used together made my hair soft, manageable, moisturized, healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always use these products, they are a staple for me.</li>
    <li> 5 stars simply amazing</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! My hair was so completely fried from bleaching. Right after the first use, my hair was sooo soft! Saved me from having to get my hair cut off!! Absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Advanced Hair Repair Shampoo and Conditioner along with the Deep Conditioner and Argan Oil. These products are amazing! Best hair product on the market. Does what it says it will do. Smells absolutely wonderful. This is the first time I tried Arvazallia hair products and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have color treated, naturally curly hair that tends to get get dry and frizzy very easily. I absolutely LOVE the Deep Conditioner by Arvazallia for Dry or Damaged Hair, so I was super excited to see if my hair results after using the Advanced Hair Repair Shampoo and Conditioner could be even better. After using this terrific combo, WOW, even my husband noticed my hair felt silky to the touch and smelled so good! I will be an Arvazallia customer for life!</li>
    <li> Love this kit! The shampoo and conditioner along with the deep conditioner provide superior moisturizing in my dry environment. I had already used the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner and loved that, but using all three gives my hair a further moisturizing boost! When I  style it, it honestly looks smoother!! That&#x27;s a big bonus for me!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use after I had a Keratin &amp;#34;blow-out&amp;#34; treatment. Works great! Love the fragrance. Will continue to purchase and use as long as I have Keratin treatments on my hair.</li>
    <li> Tried for the first time last night.  I have long &amp;#34;S wave&amp;#34; hair to the bottom of my shoulder blades cut with some layering.  I do not have the beautiful curly hair that allows me to &amp;#34;wash and go&amp;#34; or not wash my hair for a couple of days.  Some of the luxuries most curly haired girls enjoy (sigh).  My hair is fine, on the thinner side, and prone to frizz.  I have to use heavy amounts of extra hold hairspray for any hold due to the length and unruliness (when my hair is much shorter, not very flattering and curl gets even more odd).  The other issue I have is product weighing my hair down.  I used the shampoo and conditioner last night (haven&#x27;t tried the mask yet). Then, added some Arvazallia Curl Cream.  Left it wet.  Went to bed.  Normally, I have to quick shower to saturate my hair in the morning (before being able to do anything with it) and then I need to diffuse it to get a heavier wave/curl.  My hair is usually soft to the touch but because I use so much hairspray, it gets hard and crunchy.  This morning, I used a spray bottle to dampen the curl, lightly diffused, and was able to use half the hairspray I normally do! I have waited a few hours to see if the volume and body fell and it hasn&#x27;t!  While I did put a headband in because the front of my hair wouldn&#x27;t quite cooperate, for the first time in many years, I was able to spend 15 minutes on my hair instead of over an hour!!  I&#x27;m beginning to love my curly hair again.  Will try the mask and report on that soon.  Concerned it will weigh my hair down but willing to try it since I have had incredible results with just one use.  Thank you for these incredible products !!</li>
    <li> Made some highlights and burnt my hair. Thank you Arvazallia for giving me a chance to repair it for 5-6 uses!</li>
    <li> This one of favorite shampoo and conditioner!!! I also, love the mask that came with it!!</li>
    <li> my hair is definately softer.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product,I have shoulder length hair and this makes it manageable,and has returned its shine..I would also recommend their Hydrating Argan Oil Mask Deep Conditioner.Impressed with their  products that I have tried so far.. Definite buy..</li>
    <li> Sooo in love, makes my hair feel even softer and shiner definitely one of the best if not the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Amazing products! I have curly/wavy hair that has a mind of its own, and it gets very (and I mean VERY) frizzy during the humid months of Summer. This product kit (plus the leave-in, Ultra Curl Defining Cream) is the best thing I have tried in the past few years (and I feel I have tried everything for curly hair)! Plus is sulfate and paragon free, which is always a big plus!</li>
    <li> Best product ever leaves my hair so soft ans silky,  I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and products but nothing too expensive...this product is totally worth the price,, im  almost out so better order some more ..</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this amazing product! I received a full head of highlights from a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; stylist and my hair ended up fried and damaged. It felt and looked like straw.  I thought for sure I was going to have to cut my hair off. The layers around my face were burned so bad they were crispy and singed. I found this product on amazon and decided to try it. Let me just say it has brought my hair back to life. It took a few weeks, but the more I use this product the healthier, softer and shinier my hair becomes. I will never use anything else going forward. I initially bought the 3 pack of the shampoo, conditioner, and mask. The mask was so wonderful. I used it a few times a week to soften my fried hair. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and the fragrance smells so good! My fiance is always telling me my hair smells great. I also think this product has helped my hair to grow a lot longer because it&#x27;s so healthy. Try this product. You will be happy you did! :)  I posted a pic of my hair from this past weekend.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product, excellent service though</li>
    <li> I loved it thank you!</li>
    <li> Due to stress, my hair has become scarey dry.  At my doctor&#x27;s suggestion, I am  taking Seleniium and have only been using a large-toothed comb..  I felt there had to be something I could do since nothing seemed to be working.  I tried the Arvazallia Shampoo/Conditioner/Mask treatment in a desperate attempt to stop my hair loss, get moisture back and improve the dullness.  It&#x27;s working!  I&#x27;ve used this treatment  only 4 times and I can actually notice an improvement each time.  I&#x27;m brushing my hair again (feels soooo good).  My hair is no longer cracking off and absolutely has more shine and moisture.  I am hoping for continued improvement.</li>
    <li> No lie,  after the first use I was like whaaaaaaat! When you can run your fingers through your hair while shampooing..thumbs up!  Then this deep conditioner....omg moisturized my hair like no other conditioner has (and I&#x27;m a product junkie). And it smelled deeeelish and left my hair super soft and bouncy. These products are definitely will definitely stay a part of my hair care routine. I&#x27;m in love!!!! Thank Arvazallia!</li>
    <li> These are the most amazing hair products ever!!!!!  Love, love these hair products!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thick and curly and I recently got really blonde highlights and my hair got so dry and fried.  These products literally saved my hair as I thought I would need to cut my hair really short. My very first use of the shampoo and the  hair mask made my hair so soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe it..I was in shock, literally!&lt;br /&gt;These will definitely be my new hair products!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well, as promised.</li>
    <li> This product is literally god sent!! I have been looking for almost a year for fixes for my hair.  I&#x27;ve had serious hair breakage, pieces were constantly falling out of my hair whenever I even touched my hair. It got to the point where I considered getting a boy cut to just start over. It was incredibly frustrating. The deep conditioning in this box has saved my hair.  I use the shampoo and deep conditioner about twice a week, and I&#x27;ve just recently added coconut oil and castor oil to my hair regime as well.  I&#x27;ve switched to products that are mostly natural and this product with the argan oil is amazing.  I put the oils on about two hours before I shower and then wash it out with the shampoo and conditioner from this box, and my broken hair looks better than it&#x27;s looked in months!!!  I hope this helps save someone else&#x27;s hair!! My hair breakage was caused by a bad dye job and over-processing.</li>
    <li> As always I love this product! I buy it every 3-4 months and use it religiously!</li>
    <li> My hair was more damaged than I thought I guess. The product was shipped in a timely manner. The product was well packaged.  The product smelled great.  It just didn&#x27;t do what I needed it to.</li>
    <li> Using this product has brought my long grey hair as close to the model&#x27;s in magazines as I&#x27;ve ever experienced. My hair is normally bouyant, curly and frizzy. With this product my hairs flows into its cut in wonderful cascades using only a blow dryer and hot rollers as usual. I love it!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!! I used it for the first time and WOW!!! My hair has never looked this good (when I am the one styling it!! lol) but I am just amazed. Their customer service is also amazing. I was happy to receive an email from their customer service advising me the best way to use the product. Thank you SO much! I will be buying again in the future!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo to use in conjunction with my keratin treatment as I was finding they weren&#x27;t lasting as long with the store brand sulfate free shampoo. I purchased voththe shampoo and the hair mask and has certainly improved the frizziness of my hair even in Florida humidity.</li>
    <li> After only two uses I already see and feel a difference! I color my hair and it dries my hair out.... But these products are fantastic! I&#x27;m hooked😍</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product, it&#x27;s been 2 weeks and my hair still feels soft. Not to mention my hair does not feel as dry as it did!!! I will definitely be purchasing more of this product...</li>
    <li> This is ok stuff. i dont have a very thick hair, and when i use this, it makes it even more flat and lifless. It doea mak it shiny, but i cant use it every day- may be once a week to just give a shine to my hair. I dont think i will ever spend that much on something not as good. ( if i new i would spend the $ on a better shampoo like Nexxus or Redken)</li>
    <li> I actually tried the treatment my hair looks so beautiful&lt;br /&gt;I love these products and I recommend them if your hair dry and colored treated</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find so much of what is listed in the ingredients as &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; in the conditioner and conditioning pack.  I thought it was overkill on the strong fragrance so much so that I cant use it.  I hadnt expected that since most of the reviews said they liked the fragrance.  Sorry</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife who was having hair breakage issues. they use to tangle and were hard to manage. with the use of this product there visible results within 2 weeks. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo and conditioner.  Haven&#x27;t tried the hair mask with will soon.</li>
    <li> Leaves my extremely thick, somewhat-coarse wavy hair feeling softer and far less frizzy! Have used a few times and I am able to style my hair more easily.</li>
    <li> i really enjoyed this hair repair kit ive used it a couple of times and it has left my hair very moisturized and smooth i love the way that it smelled when i opened and the packaging was excellent !</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and overall feel of the products. All the products are VERY effective at making my hair feel soft and feels super hydrated, however, I don&#x27;t think I am going to be able to use this all the time on a regular basis since it&#x27;s almost TOO moisturizing for my scalp. lol I can only use the mask on my ends and if I use too much or put it up too high, it weighs down my hair, but it definitely will help with split ends. It took some time getting used to sulfate-free shampoo, but now I love it and helps my color stay longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they come out with a line similar to this but not weighing my hair down any and maybe for a little bit better price... Oh, and the packaging was beautiful!! But it was a huge box for what was inside.</li>
    <li> This is the most moisturizing sulfate free shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used. For the first time, my hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped after washing. My color treated, dry and brittle hair is loving this 3 piece system! I use the Deep Conditioning mask about once a week. Smells great, leaves my hair soft and not stripped, doesn&#x27;t weight it down either.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner for your hair, very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me left my hair feeling dried out.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it a lot and definitely will order again</li>
    <li> This product is unbelievable fantastic great for all hair types after using so many products this is the first time that l am really happy with my hair l am 50 and l  am an African american l highly recommend this product to all my sisters and l will continue to use it thanks Arvazallia</li>
    <li> My hair is feeling great! I would recommended this product.</li>
    <li> Definitely moisturizes but does not fix damaged hair</li>
    <li> I loved the shampoo and hair mask, and noticed a visible softness, luster and strength in my hair from my first usage. My hair is falling less, and feels smooth. I have used multiple products in the past, and none have delivered these type of results. This hair care system is just wonderful, and delivers the results you have always dreamt of!</li>
    <li> Great product, makes hair really soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very very happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen from using Arvazallia&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner regimen.  I&#x27;ve used them for about two weeks now, every other day, and they work great as advertised.  The customer service folks seem genuinely interested in hearing about the results obtained, and I&#x27;ll be a long-term user of both the shampoo and conditioner!  I&#x27;m an older guy (still a boomer lol) and I don&#x27;t talk about hair repair and stuff, but I absolutely recommend both products to folks who want to help improve the feel and the texture, and more importantly, improve what we put in our hair!  Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> I was going to try and wait a month before writing a review on this, but I couldn&#x27;t wait. I&#x27;ve used it for four treatments now and my results are extremely noticeable. My hair is silkier and smoother; I can&#x27;t stop touching it! My frizz has tamed down and my curls have relaxed a lot. My split ends are also being repaired. This product truly delivers exactly what is promised. I have recommended it to my coworkers, family members, friends, and even hair stylist sister. If you want to repair your hair, this is the right product for you.</li>
    <li> Great hair product. My hair was dry &amp; damaged. Now it is smooth &amp; silky, like you see on TV advertisements. I am very impressed and recommend to all my friends! By the way it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Product received for testing and review purposes.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo - my scalp is much healthier and my hair doesn&#x27;t get so oily between cleanings.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice before undergoing surgery. My hair looked great,  was shiny and no after wash tangles.  But what surprises me most was that a week later it still looks clean. That&#x27;s a big deal when you are recovering from surgery.  This is my new go to line!</li>
    <li> very good results!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my hair! Softened my hair and definitely worked in just a couple uses.. and love the smell!</li>
    <li> My hair quality has changed a lot ,since its now gray. Keep hoping for a product that lives up to its expectations. This may work for someone else, but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I loved these products.  They worked together as well as I expected.  Love, them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what everyone sees in this product.  I actually thought it made my hair feel more dry and stripped my color out.  I will not order again and I will not use what I have, which is practically two full bottles.</li>
    <li> I have been faithfully using the Arvazalia Hair Mask, which I love and will continue to use; however, I did not care for the shampoo and conditioner.  They didn&#x27;t come out of the bottles easily, there was hardly any fragrance, and it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  I don&#x27;t recommend the kit as it is not worth it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good lather.  Smells light and clean.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair. I love the smell!</li>
    <li> My hair has been processed for many years and gets lots of abuse from sun, boating, etc in the summer. After reading other reviews on many products, I chose this. The shampoo is amazing! Dry hair is moisturized and smoother. I used it along with the deep conditioner (twice weekly on the deep conditioner) and my hair looks and feels great. Be aware the shampoo does not lather as much as some but you still only need to use a small amount. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Love,love,love.Shampoo and conditioner good ,mask great!!!Hair feels soft and shiney,many compliments on hairargie</li>
    <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner are very gentle but deeply moisturizing.  I am very pleased with these two products at bringing my hair back from overbleaching.</li>
    <li> I love it! The absence of sulfates is apparent immediately when using. I have fairly long hair but work outside all day in all sorts of elements, and this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for complimenting my lifestyle thus far.</li>
    <li> I loved it, I just got it a short while ago and used it a couple of times so far but still I could see some difference. My hair became even smoother :D&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase :D</li>
    <li> This stuff isnt worth the amount i spent. Smells too strong, and works like regular shampoo and condtioner.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few natural shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried that lathers and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. It has a pleasant odor and works great.</li>
    <li> All three are great! I just had a keratin treatment on my hair and these products are perfect for it. Hair is shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Such a fabulous hair repair set! My hair looks and feels so much better. You couldn&#x27;t ask for any better ingredients Moroccan Premium Grade Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil.&lt;br /&gt;– Restores shine and softness to dry, damaged or brittle hair&lt;br /&gt;– Quickly absorbed into the hair, with no greasy residue&lt;br /&gt;– Increases the strength and elasticity of hair from root to tip&lt;br /&gt;– Improves overall hair and scalp health&lt;br /&gt;– Leaves your hair feeling silky smooth and enhances the natural shine&lt;br /&gt;– Tames frizz and fly-aways&lt;br /&gt;– Protects your hair from harmful UV rays and environmental damage&lt;br /&gt;– Protects your hair from chemicals and heat styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in the Advanced Hair Repair System:&lt;br /&gt;• 1 Repair Moisturizing Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;• 1 Repair Daily Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;• 1 Hydrating Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Love the product it is medicine to my hair</li>
    <li> I have a very dry  hair bcoz of frequent styling and dye and i have been looking for shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair to go back to the way it was. Finally, I found these products and in 3 days of using it, I found the best result I never seen in others products I used in the past. These products gave softness,  glow and no split ends anymore.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a sample for a review. This shampoo and conditioner is amazing. It will leave your hair smelling light and fresh. You will not be disappointed!!! Enjoy Thank you again Arvazallia</li>
    <li> Does what it says it&#x27;ll do. These are my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; hair care products.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this set. It is made with top quality ingredients and makes your hair very soft an manageable. I have extremely oily hair, so I am always hesitant to try new products. *I was offered to review this product for free, and I am so happy with the outcome. I have already purchased a second set to give to my sister to try. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff does wonders! The shampoo takes some getting use to because it is sulfate free but that is not an issue. Plus it smells AMAZING!! They argan oil hydrating mask smells so nice and it moisturized my hair with the first use! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The day I received the product I decided to try it out immediately. I purchased with the oil. After following the instruction my hair felt softer, silkier, bouncier and lighter than it has ever felt before. I cant keep my hands out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I just love it. And it smells so nice too</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to love this. I wanted it to smooth and soften my dry, brittle hair. It did NOT. Try Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Mousture line instead. It improved the look and texture of my hair after just 1 use!</li>
    <li> Hair smells nice, is silky and hydrated! Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i use this product i really like how since the first day i used it my hair felt to different. I have been using it for a month now and my hair looks more healthy, soft and easier to comb it. I have also notice my hair stop falling. I love it n will keep buying it</li>
    <li> arrived on time packaging was. dry good product works great</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair care products! I love the way my hair felt afterward, also this stuff smells oh so good!</li>
    <li> This whole system makes my hair so soft shiny and frizz free. If you have never tried Arvazallia product I highly recommend you to try once.Absolutely recommend this product. I have used these product for about two weeks. I cannot believe the difference my hair is, It is soft and shinier and more manageable. I like how my hair feels with this product! I will be an Arvazallia customer for life!</li>
    <li> I am totally impressed with the results after using these Products only TWO times! My hair has always been healthy but I am 60 years old now &amp; was noticing that my hair, which I color once a month, was very dry &amp; actually frizzy. I&#x27;m just in a financial condition to be spending $200 on a Keratin treatment right now so I was intrigued by the reviews I saw for these Arvazallia products. NOT AN EXAGGERATION IN ANY WAY!! After only using the shampoo &amp; conditioner 2X I saw an amazing difference in my hair. SO silky and manageable. I feel like I had a hair transplant! Only it&#x27;s really my hair, only much healthier. I haven&#x27;t even tried the Mask yet but I am confident it will only enhance what the shampoo &amp; conditioner do. I also recently purchased the leave-in oil treatment...next wash I&#x27;ll try that. Totally recommend these products!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after a Keratin treatment and wanted a sulfate free shampoo.  I read all the reviews which were very positive.  I have used it a few times and am very satisfied with the product.  My hair is shiny and it does not require so much rinsing as some of the other SF shampoos.  I would recommend this shampoo for anyone who wants a natural product and needs a SF shampoo.</li>
    <li> Just  started  using  Advance Hair repair  treatment  my 2nd  week  I  love  how  my hair  feels  very  soft and shiny and manageable. Haven&#x27;t  used  long enough  to  see any growth  as of yet  but very  excited  of results  I have  gotten  so far</li>
    <li> My hair is much less frizzy and more manageable and I am very happy that I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I have been coloring my hair for years, so it had become quite dry.  This product has helped it to feel soft again and more shiny.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Shampoo! Since using it, my scalp is no longer itchy and flaky; what a relief. Arvazallia has a lovely, fresh scent and leaves my hair very shiny.</li>
    <li> I absolutely believe this kit has changed and helped my hair! It looks and feels healthier and I&#x27;m not  lossing  hair like I was.</li>
    <li> Please note: I did not receive any product, compensation or otherwise for this review.  That would have been nice to get this free but it&#x27;s still worth the $$.  Just wanted to state that upfront for those that are wondering...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to post reviews shortly after using a product...while I am always hopeful, I am very skeptical when a product claims to make your hair &#x27;instantly&#x27; anything after the first use.  They have a 100% money back guarantee so figured at the very least they stand behind their product.  With hope, I purchased this kit and I am SO happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is quite damaged/processed.  I get Japanese Thermal reconditioning, and on top of that generally they throw on the Brazillian/Keratin treatment.  I had just gotten it done last month over highlights (very risky and did have breakage) and they colored it as well so my hair is NOT happy :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair if I let it dry naturally without the help of a blow dryer or flat iron is broom-like. Right now a month after the straightening its even more straw-like,  probably the worst its been in a while.  I have a kazillion products I use, oils, balms, etc.  After using this system ONCE I noticed a difference in my hair from the minute I got out of the shower.  Before I get to that part, IN the shower the shampoo while lower sudsing did produce a decent suds (it&#x27;s not WEN ;) and has a nice smell.  Left my hair feeling smooth after rinse.  The regular conditioner also smells nice and for those that detangle in the shower, while it&#x27;s not a TON of slip, it was easy to detangle my hair without too much resistance.  When rinsed, it also left a nice feel in my hair.  The Mask is by far the richest, VERY thick and also leaves the hair feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shower: Normally after taking the towel off my hair my ends are already dry.  When I did towel dry and after putting in the Arvazallia oil I bought separately, my hair was dripping on the ends, and kept doing so.  Good sign....&lt;br /&gt;(I did use a touch of &amp;#34;its a 10 Miracle&amp;#34; leave in as well just to be fair and while I do swear by this stuff also, it was not the variable here as I have ALWAYS used it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a test, let my hair air dry....it was drying soft and pliable- did I say pliable?! YES! It actually moved....I let it dry to about 70% naturally then followed up with the blow dryer.  I used more oil to finish it up.  My hair felt great! Soft and silky :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2, I repeated the same thing I did the first time, and used all 3 products- shampoo, conditioner- rinsed then towel dried and then used the masque. My hair is in dire straights so figured it needed the extra care. Repeated the after shower steps.  Hair is even better than the first time! It is super silky soft, skinnier and it MOVES!&lt;br /&gt;My test is to grab my hair and I hold it horizontally to see what the ends of my hair do.  Do they stick out straight like a dry broom or do they actually droop down as the law of gravity dictates and nature intended??  They&#x27;re drooping!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is I have found my Holy Grail of products.  I have tried EVERY product imaginable -low end high end. Loreal, Kerastase, Alterna, Bumble and Bumble, WEN,  Kevin Murphy, Milbon ER Crede (for Japanese Thermal treated hair) CRACK shampoo/conditioner, Joico, The Brazilian Blow out products etc...the list goes ON and on..I have by no choice of my own become a product junkie as nothing quite works the way I need it to.  This does and only after 2 uses.  I am so happy I randomly came across this in desperation when I started googling the best shampoos for Keratin treated/damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep on making this stuff!  LOVE IT!!gn....&lt;br /&gt;(I did use a touch of &amp;#34;its a 10 Miracle&amp;#34; leave in as well just to be fair and while I do swear by this stuff also, it was not the variable here as I have ALWAYS used it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a test, let my hair air dry....it was drying soft and pliable- did I say pliable?!

    <li> My hair has never felt softer. I am so happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good. It&#x27;s super lathery, and I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner because it moisturizes so much.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used this shampoo twice. It cleans my hair without stripping the moisture from it and the fragrance is light and captivating. I&#x27;d try other products from this line.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working or not; however at least it&#x27;s not making things worse. Also, it does not make my hair dry. Moreover the conditioner acts like the way it should be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently made the switch to sulfate free shampoo and after trying a couple other brands this is definitely the best. Makes my hair so soft and smells amazing</li>
    <li> My hair was so damaged took a couple times to see improvement, I let the product people know and they was so sweet and sent me a leave in oil treatment to help improve my results!  They really care.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well so far! Lathers great!&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it a 5 stars if it had a cleaner scent. It&#x27;s a neutral scent not a perfume scent. Just a bit blah .</li>
    <li> Iv only been using this product maybe two weeks.. So far so good.  My hair is soft, silky and I can see where it&#x27;s actually starting to grow back.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it ends up doing for me!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner that was good but also affordable. I love this set, leaves my hair soft. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Very nice set. It comees really nicely packaged. The smell is fantastic. The shampoo lathered well and the condition easily detangled. The mask though! Oh the mask. It is divine! My hair was soft, smooth and looked a hundred times better than before! The ends looked so much better, noticable breakage and split ends practically disappeared! I love this set! I am happy to get it during a promotion! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Only used the conditioner so far and it&#x27;s awesome.  As I mentioned before I have the worst dry tangled, Brillo pad like hair is the world and this conditioner is the BOMB!  Can&#x27;t wait to try the shampoo and mask.  Please, please make the advanced hair repair conditioner available for sale.  Also love the old formula mask and have ordered 20 items.  Thank you for making such great products that are effective!!</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast! I&#x27;ve used the shampoo and conditioner three times so far and the mask once. I think it&#x27;s making a difference but need to use it more to really know yet.</li>
    <li> this product is not that great. it leaves your hair feeling heavy and a little oily. i prefer the 10 shampoo and conditioner. will not use this again.</li>
    <li> Great Value. Every single product worked awesome and the is well worth the money to buy the entire system. If your wondering how this treatment is used or the results check out this quick tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5s7qmHOIdYs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even on color treated and heat damaged hair it worked awesome!</li>
    <li> I have dry, coarse hair so keeping moisture in it is an absolute MUST for me, especially during the cold winter months.  This set of shampoo, conditioner and argan oil mask are exactly what my hair needed to feel manageable and full of life.  This set is sulfate free which has become a must for me to combat dry scalp and frizzy hair days.  After using this specific brand I noticed that where my hair used to typically lack body it now popped  my natural curl and revived my blah hair back to life.  The shampoo is clear which speaks to keeping it free of dyes and it as well as the conditioner have a nice fresh scent that rinse out cleanly and easily.  If you are looking for a premium hair care system this is one I would highly recommend to you!  I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair repair set. It is one of the best hair repair shampoo, conditioner and hair mask I&#x27;ve ever had. My scalp is very sensitive nd prone to dandruff, so I have to be very careful when choosing a shampoo or conditioner. This set is very gentle and does not irritate my scalp. It does all you want it to do and it&#x27;s sulfate and paraben free which is great considering that most hair products have both of them in their ingredients. All of these products smell amazing and make you feel like you just stepped out of a salon. It leaves your hair silky and smooth, easy to style and very soft . Combined with the Argan oil treatment, it makes your hair feel amazing. What I like the most is that it leaves my hair smelling great for days without fading and I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo or conditioner that could do that. This is my number 1 and from now on I will be using it regularly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE ALL OF THE ARVAZALLIA PRODUCTS! THEY SMELL WONDERFUL AND HELP YOUR HAIR TO FEEL INCREDIBLE! THEY LAST TOO, I AM ALWAYS EXCITED TO SEE A NEW ARVAZALLIA PRODUCT COME OUT BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS WOW ME. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND &amp; I HAVE VERY LONG WAVY HAIR (TO MY LOWER BACK) ARVAZALLIA HELPS ME KEEP IT HEALTHY &amp; BEAUTIFUL.</li>
    <li> good product arrived on time,pleased!</li>
    <li> hair mask is great BUT the shampoo could be more moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;perfect combo is FC5 shampoo and hair mask that is part of this combo</li>
    <li> I have been using Arvazallia for about a week now and my hair has improved so much.  I had damaged it when I colored it and no matter what deep conditioner I put in it, it wasn&#x27;t getting better.  In the week that I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner it&#x27;s like the damage never happened.</li>
    <li> These products were so moisturizing. If you have dry hair or use products that dry out your hair, then these are for you. I have thick natural hair and these really helped with my dry scalp. These products work well together. I can really tell a difference using these products compared to others. These really work!</li>
    <li> I have waist length, naturally curly, 59 year old hair.  This is the very best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  My hair stays nice and soft between shampoos (which are only twice a week) and tangles far less than it ever has. I have never had to use so little conditioner to achieve such GREAT results.  I have found my new forever hair care products.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this stuff!  It&#x27;s the only product I use on my hair...</li>
    <li> These are all sulfate free and paraben free, which is a huge plus. They also have great ingredients in them, like argan oil and macadamia oil. The bottles also feel really nice in your hands, almost like plastic velvet. And all 3 items smell amazing (like what you&#x27;d get in a salon). I&#x27;m sure all 3 items would be good on their own, but they&#x27;re great together. They really have helped thicken and strengthen my hair and all produce a nice shine. My hair is also easier to comb after using the conditioner and deep conditioner, which is always a plus. All of the items are ideal for dry, damaged, weak, and processed hair, which I definitely need. I saw a difference immediately after using the products and everytime I use them, my hair feels softer, bouncier, more manageable, and less brittle. Great stuff and super beneficial to the hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product.</li>
    <li> Shipping was incredibly fast and this product is AMAZING!!! You can see results from the first time you use it and it just keeps getting better. My hair was in really bad shape from being over processed and this is really fixing it. I&#x27;m so happy I have not had to cut all of my hair off and start over with growing it back out.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be chosen as a participant in a giveaway promotion from Arvazallia for their Professional Series Advanced Hair Repair System and I am SO happy that I was!  This stuff is AMAZING!!  I am a 44 year old woman who has very damaged, dry and breaking hair and have been searching for a solution and with this I have found it!  I alternate every couple of times of shampooing and conditioning with the argan oil mask instead of using the conditioner and I can honestly say that I have been losing only a few strands of hair compared to about a nickel size (all rolled up) since I have started using this system and my hair is so soft and I am not pulling any hairs out with the comb afterwards either!  The shampoo, conditioner and mask all smell amazing!  I will definitely be purchasing a kit when this one is running low because I love it so much! Thank you so much Arvazallia for making such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I use regularly Arvazallia&#x27;s Argan hair oil, which is a MUST have.  Then I tried this kit,  it&#x27;s like going to a professional Salon in your own house.  This kit works and made my hair looks fantastic.  I have curly hair and after I used these 3 products I air dried my hair and it left it with no frizz, soft and with a great smell.  I love this trio.  Packaging is luxurious, so this kit can be a perfect gift.  Thanks Arvazallia!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this set! I was given this to try for myself and it is wonderful! I have long hair that is prone to super-frizz and this is a huge help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried their mask before, but not the shampoo and conditioner. It arrived in a really nice hard-sided gift box. The products all smell wonderful, and leave my hair silky and shiny. I&#x27;m a big believer in Argan Oil, and if you&#x27;ve used other Argan Oil products, you should really try these.</li>
    <li> Amazing set! These three items are all you need to achieve your best looking hair! I have tried multiple shampoos and conditioners and none never gave me the results they claimed. This advanced hair repair system from Arazallia actually worked! After a couple days of using the hair care products I noticed a huge difference! My hair felt so much softer and looked smoother and shinier! I am impressed with the quality of these products and they are well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time. My daughter and I both started using products and we love it!!! Shampoo and conditioner work great and smell good, left hair so soft and healthy. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a couple weeks ago, and so far I am liking the results.</li>
    <li> Look no further, this product is fantastic, you will see a difference after the first use.</li>
    <li> As a woman who has done many many things to her hair over the years I can confidently say that I look for things that will help me get my hair back to it&#x27;s former healthy condition. I jumped eagerly at the chance to sample this haircare system because it is full of amazing ingredients that are known to improve the health of one&#x27;s hair.

I have some damage caused from bleach, color &amp; styling. My hair is long  &amp; that makes it more susceptible to damage &amp; weakness. I have found that my hair has been not holding the color as well either because of the damage. I noticed a marked difference after the first use in the way my hair felt. I used the entire system for a total of 3 times &amp; then I was amazed at how silky my hair was starting to feel. My hair was beginning to look smoother &amp; then the frizziness began to go away as well. After 2 weeks of use people began to ask me what I was doing different.
