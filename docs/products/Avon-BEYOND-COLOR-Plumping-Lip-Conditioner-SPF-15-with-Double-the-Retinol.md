      <li>the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent lip plumping product-</li>
      <li>it makes great lip moisterizer, and a great sunblock... smells wonderful!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>It feels great</li>
      <li>giving it the benefit of the doubt, trying to judge fairly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good, UNgreasy emollient that has a touch of flesh tone added.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no nasty tingle, just feels great.  </li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>The color I purchased was called \\&quot;Lilac Shimmer\\&quot;, which is a pale-medium cool mauve with gold shimmer, which works great with my fair neutral skin tone.</li>
      <li>was shipped quickly, good moisterizer for lips, but not too sure about the plumping part.</li>
      <li>I ordered one tube of Beyond Color on the basis of the good reviews, and fell in love with this product.  </li>
      <li>, so your man won&#x27;t really notice except to want to kiss you more :) Very good value considering the price!</li>
      <li>You will love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a plumper in the sense that many people think of, like that of DuWop Venom where it gives noticeable results.  </li>
      <li>this is an excellent lip balm, it is similar to nars sabrina....</li>
      <li>I love this lip conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>REALLY MAKES YOUR LIPS FEEL GREAT</li>
      <li>But I got on line and ordered three more, just to ensure I&#x27;ll have one at hand and a couple to spare.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure why.  </li>
      <li>cause I wanted to make sure that I always have one in stock just in</li>
      <li>We both love it.</li>
      <li>I love that it has a sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and will definetly be repurchasing it, as it is a great value for the price.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find that this really plumped my lips, but it sure does make them feel good.  </li>
      <li>It is a great neutral color, conditions well, and is overall nice.</li>
      <li>Definately worth more than the $8.00!</li>
      <li>I think its the smooth, matte finish, which looks as if you&#x27;re not wearing lipstick, but better.</li>
      <li>The majority of the reviews would lead the average buyer to believe that this product is the best thing ever.  </li>
      <li>I tend to stock up when it goes on sale for a dollar ninety-nine on Avon&#x27;s website periodically, so in my personal opinion it is a great bargain for what it does.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say I noticed any plumping going on, but I like this regardless because it has so much more going for it, not to mention the price is right.  </li>
      <li>&quot; up my lips significantly, the lipstick felt great on and lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>Not at all slimy or stick, not a bad taste either</li>
      <li>no plumping or other advertised effects experienced.</li>
      <li>...or...\\&quot;lasts super long\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>, if you are looking for a great base that works well with colored lipsticks and helps keep your lips moist, then GREAT!!!  </li>
      <li>There is the slightest nude tint, probably because the product is naturally whitish, but even a man could wear this and no one would have the slightest idea that he was wearing anything more than Chapstick.  </li>
      <li>At 62 and one who lives in a very dry climate, I am well satisfied with this conditioner!  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for something to give you bee stung lips, this is nowhere near that strong.</li>
      <li>This was my first lipstick purchase from Avon.</li>
      <li>My lips feel so smooth and soft after applying it.</li>
      <li>My next purchase will be more than one</li>
      <li>there is no tingling, no weird taste, just softer, fuller lips.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for the most fantastic lip moisturizer, this is the one to have hands down.</li>
      <li>I had bought it once before and noticed how fast it worked.</li>
      <li>Keeps my lips very conditioned/moisturized.</li>
      <li>As a lip plumper, don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>As for the plumping, I do get a tingle when I apply, but I don&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
      <li>except that it is not pink, its more of a nude and its a bit sheer.</li>
      <li>I really use it most of all for the SPF 15, so all the other benefits are extra!</li>
      <li>it started to plump quite well, not too tingly, looks nice on, very pale and sheer, works well under other colors and you sort of miss it if you don&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>I gave it four stars because it does sometimes cake up in my already dry lips, but that really isn&#x27;t the products fault its mine for not using a lip protectant on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>It does plump lips from the standpoint that lips will look fuller because they are not dry, cracked or flaky.  </li>

<li> This conditioner definitely improves the texture of my lips and stays on for a long time.  </li>
<li> None of them seem to last very long.  </li>
<li> and the lipstick product itself (not the container) is a bit thin compared to other lipsticks and looked like it was cheaply manufactured not the container but the product itself</li>
<li> This is my second serving of this product, so I&#x27;m not sure if the \\&quot;double retinol\\&quot; will be an improvement, since I&#x27;ve only had this tube since Christmas.  </li>
<li> It has helped my dry lips like nothing else ever has.  </li>
<li> My lips always felt dry.</li>
<li> The retinol works to moisturize away the dry feeling.  </li>
<li> I typically use lip balm several times each day.  </li>
<li> I have very dry lips.</li>
<li> So, I am really not understandying the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I often have chapped lips, &amp; the tingling sensation from other lip plumpers have always hurt my lips.</li>
<li> You can wear it alone, under the other Avon plumping lip colors for even FULLER lips, or under any brand lipcolor or gloss.</li>
<li> I feel like my lips look slightly fuller, and I haven&#x27;t been chapped once this winter.  </li>
<li> Not your usual  lipstick, not really a gloss</li>
<li> But it glides on, and leaves me feeling a little prettier.</li>
<li> Winter always dries out my skin and lips and this has been helping fix that little problem.</li>
<li> A LITTLE,</li>
<li> This does soften the lips and actually makes for a decent base for lipstick.</li>
<li> but this is NOT a plumper... not even a little!!</li>
<li> I just wanted to give my lips a subtle boost.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s subtle, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed plumper lips.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t take the \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; thing seriously.  </li>
<li> Which is silly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps my lips very conditioned/moisturized. Not having to reapply and reapply. I take medication that has side effects of dying your mouth. My lips always felt dry. Not with this Avon Plumping conditioner. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> The majority of the reviews would lead the average buyer to believe that this product is the best thing ever.  IT&#x27;S NOT.  If you read all of the reviews....everyone says the same, \\&quot;the moisture is wonderful\\&quot;...or...\\&quot;lasts super long\\&quot;.  But you read NOTHING about the plumping factor.  News:  This is called a \\&quot;Plumping lip conditioner\\&quot;.  I agree....it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  But, I get the same effect if I put on carmex under my lipstick.  So, I am really not understandying the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through 2 tubes already.....giving it the benefit of the doubt, trying to judge fairly.  I notice no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking for a great base that works well with colored lipsticks and helps keep your lips moist, then GREAT!!!  You will love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t take the \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; thing seriously.  It doesn&#x27;t work that way.</li>
    <li> I love this lip conditioner.  I typically use lip balm several times each day.  None of them seem to last very long.  This conditioner definitely improves the texture of my lips and stays on for a long time.  When I use it at night, I can still feel it in the morning.  When I apply it during the day, I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it nearly as often as other products.  Definitely a must-have for me.</li>
    <li> This does soften the lips and actually makes for a decent base for lipstick. As a lip plumper, don&#x27;t expect too much. I do use every morning and before bed.....makes for kissable lips.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is a great neutral color, conditions well, and is overall nice. I definetly recommend giving this a try. I tend to stock up when it goes on sale for a dollar ninety-nine on Avon&#x27;s website periodically, so in my personal opinion it is a great bargain for what it does. I gave it four stars because it does sometimes cake up in my already dry lips, but that really isn&#x27;t the products fault its mine for not using a lip protectant on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> this is not all its hyped up to be its just a chapstick with color....no plumping or other advertised effects experienced. and the lipstick product itself (not the container) is a bit thin compared to other lipsticks and looked like it was cheaply manufactured not the container but the product itself</li>
    <li> it started to plump quite well, not too tingly, looks nice on, very pale and sheer, works well under other colors and you sort of miss it if you don&#x27;t use it. Not at all slimy or stick, not a bad taste either, so your man won&#x27;t really notice except to want to kiss you more :) Very good value considering the price! and the non-allergic properties.</li>
    <li> I bought this lip conditioner for myself and my teenage daughter. We both love it. Winter always dries out my skin and lips and this has been helping fix that little problem. My lips feel so smooth and soft after applying it. I love it.</li>
    <li> At 62 and one who lives in a very dry climate, I am well satisfied with this conditioner!  Way to go Avon!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent lip plumping product- the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I often have chapped lips, &amp; the tingling sensation from other lip plumpers have always hurt my lips. Not this one-- there is no tingling, no weird taste, just softer, fuller lips. You can wear it alone, under the other Avon plumping lip colors for even FULLER lips, or under any brand lipcolor or gloss. My mom loves this product, as well; she buys about 4 tubes each time it goes on sale!! Definately worth more than the $8.00!</li>
    <li> I ordered one tube of Beyond Color on the basis of the good reviews, and fell in love with this product.  I&#x27;m not even sure why.  I think its the smooth, matte finish, which looks as if you&#x27;re not wearing lipstick, but better. Not your usual  lipstick, not really a gloss It&#x27;s subtle, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed plumper lips. But it glides on, and leaves me feeling a little prettier. When I went to put some on this morning, the tube was gone! The cats, no doubt.  I was crawling around looking under furniture and truly distressed. Which is silly. But I got on line and ordered three more, just to ensure I&#x27;ll have one at hand and a couple to spare.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this really plumped my lips, but it sure does make them feel good.  My next purchase will be more than one and I will be buying some for my friends to try!</li>
    <li> was shipped quickly, good moisterizer for lips, but not too sure about the plumping part. Definitely recommended as a lip conditioner.</li>
    <li> I feel like my lips look slightly fuller, and I haven&#x27;t been chapped once this winter.  This is my second serving of this product, so I&#x27;m not sure if the \\&quot;double retinol\\&quot; will be an improvement, since I&#x27;ve only had this tube since Christmas.  There is the slightest nude tint, probably because the product is naturally whitish, but even a man could wear this and no one would have the slightest idea that he was wearing anything more than Chapstick.  There is not a noticeable tingle to me, unless I have just gotten used to it, but I have some of the products with cinnamon in them, and they still tingle to me, they are also sticky and glossy, which is not my look.  I really use it most of all for the SPF 15, so all the other benefits are extra!</li>
    <li> this is an excellent lip balm, it is similar to nars sabrina....except that it is not pink, its more of a nude and its a bit sheer. It feels great, it makes my lips feel bigger, it smells and tastes like strawberries! love it!</li>
    <li> it makes great lip moisterizer, and a great sunblock... smells wonderful!! but this is NOT a plumper... not even a little!! nNO plumping effect at all!!</li>
    <li> This product is terrific. I had bought it once before and noticed how fast it worked. I just wanted to give my lips a subtle boost. Once I applied it, I immediately felt my lips tingling. I have very dry lips. But, I noticed that not only did the lipstick make my lips look plumper, but it also looked rejuvenated! I bought 5 of them this time cause I wanted to make sure that I always have one in stock just in case I run out.</li>
    <li> THIS AVON BEYOND COLOR PLUMPING LIP CONDITIONER REALLY MAKES YOUR LIPS FEEL GREAT, IT PLUMPS A LITTLE, BUT THE FEELING MY LIPS GET FROM IT EARNS 5 STARS, I WILL BE ORDERING IT IN THE FUTURE, IT IS A KEEPER PRODUCT, DONNA</li>
    <li> This works as an excellent lip moisturizer.  It has helped my dry lips like nothing else ever has.  As for the plumping, I do get a tingle when I apply, but I don&#x27;t notice much difference.  I don&#x27;t think this is a plumper in the sense that many people think of, like that of DuWop Venom where it gives noticeable results.  It does plump lips from the standpoint that lips will look fuller because they are not dry, cracked or flaky.  If you are looking for something to give you bee stung lips, this is nowhere near that strong. If you are looking for the most fantastic lip moisturizer, this is the one to have hands down.</li>
    <li> Ordered this never having tried a \\&quot;plumper\\&quot;.  Can&#x27;t say I noticed any plumping going on, but I like this regardless because it has so much more going for it, not to mention the price is right.  It&#x27;s a good, UNgreasy emollient that has a touch of flesh tone added.  The retinol works to moisturize away the dry feeling.  There&#x27;s no nasty tingle, just feels great.  I love that it has a sunscreen.  Sometimes you just can&#x27;t beat AVON!</li>
    <li> This was my first lipstick purchase from Avon. While I did not feel that the lipstick \\&quot;plumped\\&quot; up my lips significantly, the lipstick felt great on and lasted a long time. The color I purchased was called \\&quot;Lilac Shimmer\\&quot;, which is a pale-medium cool mauve with gold shimmer, which works great with my fair neutral skin tone. I highly recommend this product and will definetly be repurchasing it, as it is a great value for the price.</li>
