      <li>Whatever relaxing benefit they may have had was more than counter balanced by having to scrub the tub.  </li>
      <li>Great bath salts, super relaxing and the Siberian Fir Oil opens the pores right up!  </li>

    <li> Awesome product. It smells great and helps make bath time a spa like experience in the comfort of your home. I highly recommend this product. Enjoy :)</li>
    <li> I enjoy putting this in my bath after a long day at work or when my muscles are sore. Works great! I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 8 years!</li>
    <li> I love my hot baths with BATHTHERAPY.  It really does help my older body!</li>
    <li> I have fibromyalgia and these bath salts are the only thing I use when soaking in a nice hot bath for my aches and pains!</li>
    <li> Great bath salts, super relaxing and the Siberian Fir Oil opens the pores right up!  Super relaxing!  Only use a cup, that&#x27;s more than enough.</li>
    <li> Got it.  As described.</li>
    <li> Received some time ago. Love product</li>
    <li> Bought it for my ex&#x27;s back pain and he loves it. I tried it and I love it and now my new boyfriend loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, feels good. Worth trying. Great price. Paid this price for something 1/5 the size at whole foods when they were selling it.</li>
    <li> After years of putting up with artificial scents during my relaxing soaks, I gave up on any scent at all and stuck to plain Epsom salts. When my massage therapist gave me a sample of these salts I was skeptical. But then I tried it and the next day I bought this mega tub of it! Heaven. But it is deceiving on how much you pour in so I recommend some kind of scoop to keep it consistent. If there is too much in the water it feels like water with too much water softener salts - you cannot get the soap out of your hair.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this product will put a film on your bathtub.  It was almost impossible to get the &#x27;green&#x27; out.  I&#x27;d read that another reviewer had this issue but no one else mentioned it.  I have a new acrylic tub and while I like the product I will not buy again due to it&#x27;s propensity to leave a stain.</li>
    <li> Fantastic...have been using this for years.</li>
    <li> These salts dyed my white bathtub green.  Whatever relaxing benefit they may have had was more than counter balanced by having to scrub the tub.  Gross - threw out the rest.</li>
    <li> The ingredients listed on the jar do not all match what is in the description.  The description says, &amp;#34;INGREDIENTS: SODIUM SESQUICARBONATE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM LAURYL SULFATE, FRAGRANCE, WATER, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, LITHIUM CHLORIDE, SULFUR, POTASSIUM IODIDE, CHLOROPHYLLIN.  Whereas the label on the container says: INGREDIENTS:  SODIUM SESQUICARBONATE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, ABIES SIBIRICA OIL, WATER, GLYCERIN, POTASSIUM IODIDE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM LAURYL SULFATE, SULFER, CHLORPHYLLIN-COPPER COMPLEX (CI 78510).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the actual product is missing some of the ingredients in the description and contains ingredients that aren&#x27;t listed in the description.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking baths with it for years.  Hope to continue.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> My sister introduced me to this product and I love soaking in a hot bath with these bath salts.</li>
    <li> My favorite bath accompiant!  I&#x27;ve been using this for years!  Love the scent that lingers even after the bath.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m hooked on this stuff..i buy it by the barrel now....good and cheap</li>
    <li> We love this stuff. We do take daily baths and adding a cap full of this salt makes them so much more enjoyable. I dont know if it actually reduces pains and aches, but the &#x27;spa like&#x27; fragrance sure makes you feel great. Wouldnt bath without it! the only reason I didnt give it five stars is because it is inconsistent from shipment to shipment. sometimes its nice and free flowing, and other times its lumpy and wont dissolve quickly.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula but it still provides great relief from a good soak.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!  IT WORKS WONDERS!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. THE SMELL IS AMAZING!  I rated the product a 3 because I found it at my local grocery store for $12 less! Same exact size and product.</li>
    <li> The best mineral salt I&#x27;ve used, it will may your body feel good and relax, and take away muscle pain and stiffness. I used this for years and I&#x27;m glad its sold on amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Works great!  When I&#x27;m done in the bath my muscles feel so relaxed, like I just had a massage!</li>
