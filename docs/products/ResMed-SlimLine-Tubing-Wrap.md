      <li>use this cover with a Resmed Slimline tube and the fit is just right.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly the slimline tubing wrap arrived.  </li>
      <li>Since this is made by Resmed and is designed to fit a Resmed Slimline tube, it does exactly that.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily and works very well.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>Like I said, way better than having to feel the bare plastic.</li>
      <li>Product is grey so it blends into the bedding which is a nice plus.</li>
      <li>The description indicates 2 velcro closures, it only has one, which is OK.  </li>
      <li>but I wanted something that looked more refined and would last a while.  </li>
      <li>and you go higher than 4</li>
      <li>While not cozy and fleecy like those i used on my full size tubing, it feels much better than the bare tube.</li>
      <li>Could be a little softer and more comfortable..</li>
      <li>The full-length zipper is convenient and easy to operate, when weekly cleaning of the air tubing is required.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, pretty easy to install, and fits the standard hose that my CPAP came with (ResMed).  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s easy to compress a little to make it fit</li>
      <li>Good quality construction but made the hose very stiff.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be well made and the zipper works great, however the material is too thin and does nothing to stop the &amp;#34;rain-out&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>This hose is MEANT TO FIT the standard or slimline hose--whichever you have--buy that type.</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>The ResNed Slimline Tubing Wrap makes cpap slimline tubing quiet and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Really keeps the moisture out of my CPAP hose.  </li>
      <li>You fold the zipper back under the wrap, secure it</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh much and thus doesn&#x27;t tug on the mask and annoy or cause leaks for me.  </li>
      <li>Very unassuming product.</li>
      <li>The cover helps the tubing from making so much noise when I turn.</li>
      <li>There are other covers, and even many that are much cheaper, but they are for the original hose, and much too big for this SlimLine tube.</li>
      <li>install the wrap, it has a full length zipper which you open up all the way to one end, then insert that end&#x27;s tube through the hole.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made of a nice material that does not feel cold against my skin, it feels more like a sheet.  </li>
      <li>This wrap turns those into a soft rustling noise that&#x27;s much easier to get used to, and ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works great but the cover does not fit the entire length of the tube, not a big deal .</li>
      <li>I hand wash mine with my CPAP equipment and it&#x27;s holding up like new.  </li>
      <li>Love the slime-line tubing, and the lightness overall, but I still fight condensation issues, even when I turn my machine temperature down.</li>
      <li>It did help lessen the hollow hose sound, so I&#x27;d totally keep it on if I didn&#x27;t take my hose off and stow it away every morning.</li>
      <li>I am honestly surprised at what a difference this has made.</li>
      <li>There is a little uncovered tubing that is part of my nasal pillow mask that still allows for some rainout but not nearly as bad as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so how much you pay for shipping and how long it takes can vary.  </li>
      <li>recommend this product if your getting &amp;#34;rain-out&amp;#34; in your CPAP hose due to higher humidity levels.  </li>
      <li>I went back to my old fleece tube cover that covers the connector rubber also</li>
      <li>While I usually utilize cpap.com for cpap supplies, amazon has a few items that are more convenient when delivered via Amazom Prime.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve found that 4 is plenty good, even on DRY winter nights when the air is cold and really dry, and I have asthma and allergies (so sensitive sinuses).</li>
      <li>I only wish they would&#x27;ve made a slightly longer version for the climate line as it doesn&#x27;t cover the whole hose.</li>

<li> It will not fit the standard tubing.  </li>
<li> Other fuzzy fleece tube covers are out there</li>
<li> I purchased this to help with condensation build-up inside the tube, due to the fact that our room is the coldest part of the house.</li>
<li> Product as described, but due to the temperature conditions of my bedroom had to switch to Heated hose.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is washable but I just wipe it down with a wet wipe.  </li>
<li> , you still get dripped to death (at least for my specific home environment).  </li>
<li> , it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
<li> Helps keep the moisture down in the tube.</li>
<li> Cuts down on rainout allot</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice quality. I hand wash mine with my CPAP equipment and it&#x27;s holding up like new.  It does seem to eliminate the rainout.</li>
    <li> Only enough to cover hose, but not the connectors that keep getting hung up on the bed sides. I went back to my old fleece tube cover that covers the connector rubber also</li>
    <li> This product was well engineered. A full length zipper makes putting in on and taking it off a breeze. While not cozy and fleecy like those i used on my full size tubing, it feels much better than the bare tube.</li>
    <li> Product as described, but due to the temperature conditions of my bedroom had to switch to Heated hose.</li>
    <li> I actually added the tube wrapping to my order on a whim when I was ordering replacement tubing for my husband&#x27;s CPAP machine. I am honestly surprised at what a difference this has made. No crinkly noises from the tube at night and it keeps it from getting tangled if he rolls over. I suspect that it will help his tubing last longer as well, since it won&#x27;t get snagged on anything or get smooshed or wrapped up in things.</li>
    <li> After a week of dragging my hose across my pillow and the edge of the bed and feeling the cold tube laying on my arm and having lots of rainout in the tube, I was looking for solutions.  Other fuzzy fleece tube covers are out there but I wanted something that looked more refined and would last a while.  So I picked this tube cover up.  This only fits the ResMed SlimLine Tubing.  It will not fit the standard tubing.  It has a full length zipper which has an extended tab that you tuck under the zipper at the head end of the tube to dress it up very nicely and cover with velcro.  It zips toward the machine end of the tube and the zipper stops well away from your head so no zipper jingling at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is washable but I just wipe it down with a wet wipe.  The rainout seemed to stop after paling this tube cover on.  I keep my room kind of cold so the more humidity I add to my treatment the more rainout I got.  This protects the tub from the cold enough to stop the rainout almost completely.  There is a little uncovered tubing that is part of my nasal pillow mask that still allows for some rainout but not nearly as bad as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very nice looking cover and well made and taylor fit of the SlimLine tuning.</li>
    <li> Good quality construction but made the hose very stiff.  Used it a few nights then took it off and went back to the felt cover.</li>
    <li> Since this is made by Resmed and is designed to fit a Resmed Slimline tube, it does exactly that.  Buying on Amazon is more convenient and undoubtedly less expensive.  The tubing wrap makes the hose a little less flexible but ensures that it probably will never kink although I had no problems with kinks without the wrap.  The Slimline tube without the wrap would feel cool to cold on bare skin and with the wrap is warmer feeling.</li>
    <li> Very nice, inexpensive accessory for your CPAP machine. I purchased this to help with condensation build-up inside the tube, due to the fact that our room is the coldest part of the house. It seems to be doing the trick, and it is much more comfortable, than being snuggled up to a piece of plastic hose. The material seems to be very good quality, and the full length zipper makes it very easy to install. Not sure what you would call this type of material; it is not soft, but it is kind of like a thin vinyl. Like I said, way better than having to feel the bare plastic. Please make sure that you have the SlimLine hose. There are other covers, and even many that are much cheaper, but they are for the original hose, and much too big for this SlimLine tube.</li>
    <li> With my cpap. I knocked off a star because it makes the hose difficult to maneuver and fold, so when I take it off and stow it away in the morning I have to unzip the wrap every time. As a result I only used it maybe 10 times and then gave up. It did help lessen the hollow hose sound, so I&#x27;d totally keep it on if I didn&#x27;t take my hose off and stow it away every morning.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly the slimline tubing wrap arrived.  It&#x27;s good quality and fit perfectly on my slimline hose.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I roll over when sleeping and in doing so, often the cold air hose will rub against my skin and it can be annoying.  I decided to give this tubing wrap a try.  It goes on easily and works very well.  It&#x27;s made of a nice material that does not feel cold against my skin, it feels more like a sheet.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh much and thus doesn&#x27;t tug on the mask and annoy or cause leaks for me.  That was my primary concern when ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this cover with a Resmed Slimline tube and the fit is just right.  The sleeve was about ½\\&quot; longer than needed but that&#x27;s easy to compress a little to make it fit just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To install the wrap, it has a full length zipper which you open up all the way to one end, then insert that end&#x27;s tube through the hole.  Then you zip it up all the way to the starting end.  The end with the tail of the zipper has a Velcro wrap to secure the loose zipper and keep it from being annoying.  You fold the zipper back under the wrap, secure it and it&#x27;ll stay in place nicely.  I place that end on the side with the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clarify my usage, I do not use the humidifier on my Resmed system, I don&#x27;t like it so I don&#x27;t have any issues with humidity since I&#x27;m not adding any.  I breathe the room air all day long anyway so continuing to breathe that through the night hasn&#x27;t been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple sellers here so how much you pay for shipping and how long it takes can vary.  For me it was a good price and arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars, well designed and I&#x27;m very happy with this wrap</li>
    <li> this product helps ro keep my cat from chewing through the tube and causing air leaks! Could be a little longer though.</li>
    <li> I use this cover with the slimline heated tubing. It helps a lot when the temps in my house dip to 65F or below. It actually makes the hose glide over the bed covers easier too. The zipper is good quality and the cover itself seems to have a bit of padding inside. It&#x27;s well made and easy to use. I used to put the hose under my blanket, but they recommend you don&#x27;t do that. If you get water in your hose this cover might help you. I only wish they would&#x27;ve made a slightly longer version for the climate line as it doesn&#x27;t cover the whole hose. Even so, it still works well.</li>
    <li> IT is well made, but does still have rain out on the highest setting (6) of the humidifier.  I prefer the highest setting as I breath through my mouth and it dries out my mouth and nose in lower settings. We do keep the room around 68, so i thought it would not do that, but it does.  .</li>
    <li> Really keeps the moisture out of my CPAP hose.  Solved the nighttime urgling problem</li>
    <li> Bought this to try and keep condensation out of my mask.  Works fairly well, but still have some water in my mask in the morning.  Overall, it does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One item that puzzled me is that the zipper is unnecessarily long on one side.  Folding it over and securing it under the velco strap on that same end resolved the issue of it sticking out, but just does not make a ton of sense.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from rain-out, because you have the heat on your humidity jacked up, this will help keep it at bay.  It will also help quiet some of the noise of your machine.</li>
    <li> 4/9/15. Perfect fit for the ResMed slimline heated tubing.  It has significantly improved the reduction of &amp;#34;rainout&amp;#34; condensation and I was able to increase the humidity of my ResMed AirSense 10 Elite unit to maximum. While I usually utilize cpap.com for cpap supplies, amazon has a few items that are more convenient when delivered via Amazom Prime. The full-length zipper is convenient and easy to operate, when weekly cleaning of the air tubing is required.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking it would help me sleep better with my Resmed CPAP machine.  I was having problems with \\&quot;rainout\\&quot; in my mask and I thought this might be the solution, but after three weeks I have&#x27;t noticed any difference at all.  I&#x27;d send it back, but I&#x27;ve lost the packaging and anyway, by the time I pay shipping, it&#x27;s not worth it.  I guess I&#x27;ll try one of those heated tubes next.</li>
    <li> This product reduces condensation in the tube; protects the tube, makes the tube to slide more easily over bedding and furniture.</li>
    <li> I love the material. Kind of like a parachute-ish feel. A zipper from end to end which makes it easy to install the hose. Velcro at the end closest to your body so you don&#x27;t feel the cold zipper. Love it. If you ever used the Hose Buddy, you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
    <li> Quiets hose, works well</li>
    <li> Cuts down on rainout allot</li>
    <li> The ResNed Slimline Tubing Wrap makes cpap slimline tubing quiet and comfortable.  It  zips on and off easily, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the hose temperature like some people do. But I do have a cat, and even declawed, she managed to get her nails caught in the delicate hose. This hose is MEANT TO FIT the standard or slimline hose--whichever you have--buy that type. So it won&#x27;t slide or move at all. Easy install. I intend to get a lot longer life on my hose this time.</li>
    <li> It seems to be well made and the zipper works great, however the material is too thin and does nothing to stop the &amp;#34;rain-out&amp;#34;.  This is a big disappointment for a Res-Med branded product.  The trouble and cost of shipping to send it back out-weighs the benefits of a return.  We&#x27;ve wrapped the covered hose in 4 ACE bandages and so far, so good.  So, if you order the hose cover, order some ACE bandages as well.</li>
    <li> I was getting excessive condensation in my line that was dripping me to death while I slept.  This wrap stops about 95% of the condensation and dramatically reduces dripping to tolerable levels.  It&#x27;s sturdy, pretty easy to install, and fits the standard hose that my CPAP came with (ResMed).  As a side note it&#x27;s quieter as well...the hose makes &amp;#34;ribbing&amp;#34; noises on hard surfaces (like your night stand) that can be fairly loud.  This wrap turns those into a soft rustling noise that&#x27;s much easier to get used to, and ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if your getting &amp;#34;rain-out&amp;#34; in your CPAP hose due to higher humidity levels.  FYI--I keep my CPAP humidifier set to 3 or 4--if you have a ResMed and you go higher than 4, you still get dripped to death (at least for my specific home environment).  But I&#x27;ve found that 4 is plenty good, even on DRY winter nights when the air is cold and really dry, and I have asthma and allergies (so sensitive sinuses).</li>
    <li> Helps keep the moisture down in the tube. Since I have been using this I haven&#x27;t had to dump water out of the tube.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed! Protects the tube and keeps it clean and free from dust and dirt. Good idea to buy an extra one for travel.</li>
    <li> Love the slime-line tubing, and the lightness overall, but I still fight condensation issues, even when I turn my machine temperature down.</li>
    <li> Very unassuming product. I bought it on a whim. This wrap prevents the irritating rubbing noise from CPAP tubing against the bedding . Product is grey so it blends into the bedding which is a nice plus.</li>
    <li> The description indicates 2 velcro closures, it only has one, which is OK.  The cover helps the tubing from making so much noise when I turn.</li>
    <li> Reduces noise from the corrugated tubing rubbing across wooden furniture. Protects the furniture. Could be a little softer and more comfortable..</li>
    <li> Good Product, reduces hose noise to a great degree.</li>
    <li> The tubing cover is excellent.  And now my provider switched to off brand tubing which seems like it could easily puncture so I am glad for the additional protection to the tubing.</li>
    <li> Works great but the cover does not fit the entire length of the tube, not a big deal .</li>
    <li> Wrap is several inches too long.  I fold it back a little so that I can attach hose cuff to machine. From the directions I thought that there would be two velcro fasteners but it only came with one.  Perhaps I misunderstood. Directions could be written a little larger. The zipper works smoothly, the product does what it&#x27;s supposed to and I like the color. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
