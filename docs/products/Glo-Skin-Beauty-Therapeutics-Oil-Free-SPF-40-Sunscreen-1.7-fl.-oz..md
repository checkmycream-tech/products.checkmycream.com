      <li>Perfect for Southern California hot summers!!!</li>
      <li>It did not break my sensitive skin out and is a great product.  </li>
      <li>This is the best everyday sunscreen I have found yet.  </li>
      <li>this spf lotion is so light feeling and doesn&#x27;t effect my makeup by making it appear greasy or cakey.</li>
      <li>The product does a great job of both hydrating and acting as sun protection.</li>
      <li>Fantastic oil-free moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the Oil Free SPF 40 product.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>Everything went smoothly.</li>
      <li>The Glo Therapeutics SPF 40 blocks the sun better and goes on much nicer.  </li>
      <li>Nice quality moisturizer for my mature buy oily skin.</li>
      <li>and I received the product quick.</li>
      <li>however I didn&#x27;t feel is was blocking the sun adequately</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worthy.</li>
      <li>ABSORBS QUICKLY INTO YOUR SKIN</li>
      <li>It is worth</li>
      <li>I have fair skin, and was told my regular SPF 15 wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my complexion.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend glotherapeutics Oil Free SPF 40</li>
      <li>I found that the new containers did not have the consistency of the original one.  </li>
      <li>As this does work better than what I had been using and my skin likes it so far, taking this extra step of rechecking my face in the mirror for streaks is fine by me; however that is the reason for -1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recently had a laser procedure to my face and must use a daily suncreen, I chose glotherapeutics after reviewing several products and very happy with my choice.</li>
      <li>Sure enough while looking online</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s more than enough to cover my face and neck, so</li>
      <li>Fantastic...the smallest amount goes a long way &amp; the smooth, lightweight lotion replaces a moisturizer!</li>
      <li>and I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Received fast service.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen type smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my skin, but it does protect it very well.</li>
      <li>This works very well on the face......not a problem sweating and getting it in your eyes</li>
      <li>Although the customer service stinks from the company making this product, the product itself is excellent.  </li>
      <li>Great coverage and it thin and not sticky.</li>
      <li>, however I wish they made a SPF 50 and (for my budget) its on the pricy side for how much you get per bottle.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs into your skin very well  </li>
      <li>I wear this sunscreen all summer long as my day cream - it absorbs quickly, is not greasy at all, a great moisturizer and does not cause any breakouts.</li>
      <li>I finally found an SPF that isn&#x27;t greesy and leaves me feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>My priority is to take care of my face first, since I&#x27;m in early 40&amp;#34;s  </li>
      <li>Hands down one of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>The Neutrogena was the only one I could use on my face (as the Vanicream left my skin greasy but blocked the sun better)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it and would purchase it again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to use this year round with no complaints.  </li>
      <li>I brought it a few more times and had no problem with he consistency.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a good facial sunblock that won&#x27;t cause my skin to react negatively and that has a high SPF.  </li>
      <li>I do not want to live without it.</li>
      <li>live in Iowa</li>
      <li>It does dry quickly</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and I find that my skin isn&#x27;t irritated using this at all.</li>
      <li>was using Neutrogena SPF 60 sensitive skin (per my dermatologist recommendations)</li>
      <li>It was marked up to $72.00.</li>
      <li>The consistency is really light too, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am putting on a heavy mask, even though it&#x27;s spf 40.  </li>
      <li>It is more expensive than over the counter products but believe me it is well worth it</li>
      <li>The SPF is high enough to protect me all day.  </li>
      <li>I was recommended this SPF in a high end salon, when I got a facial.</li>
      <li>Put a coat of powder after applying to reduce the shine.&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts a long time, the pump works well and gives you just enough product, and it&#x27;s small and light to throw into your purse when going out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This daily wear sunscreen is also used as my moisturizer without a greasy look or feel.  I recently had a laser procedure to my face and must use a daily suncreen, I chose glotherapeutics after reviewing several products and very happy with my choice. I have turned a couple of friends onto this as well. I highly recommend glotherapeutics Oil Free SPF 40+!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic...the smallest amount goes a long way &amp; the smooth, lightweight lotion replaces a moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I finally found an SPF that isn&#x27;t greesy and leaves me feeling clean.  My skin is very sensitive and I find that my skin isn&#x27;t irritated using this at all. It is more expensive than over the counter products but believe me it is well worth it</li>
    <li> No breakouts.  Nice priming effect over moisturizer and under foundation.</li>
    <li> Light but works!  I will always use this sunscreen.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  Great deals on Amazon, but not always available so I try to stock up.</li>
    <li> This is the best everyday sunscreen I have found yet.  It does not like a shiny film on your face.</li>
    <li> Everything went smoothly. Good experience!</li>
    <li> Fantastic oil-free moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I live in Iowa so I experience dry harsh winters and brutally hot humid summers. I&#x27;m able to use this year round with no complaints.  Hands down one of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at an dermatology office. I paid $32.00 for this there. I had run out. To my surprise my hair salon has this product.  It was marked up to $72.00. There was no way I was going to pay this.  Sure enough while looking online Amazon had it.  It was $10.00 cheaper than the dermatology office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t greasy.  If it gets into your eyes no big deal.  As it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this SPF in a high end salon, when I got a facial. I have fair skin, and was told my regular SPF 15 wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my complexion. I was sent home with a couple sample packets, and I was totally hooked. The product does a great job of both hydrating and acting as sun protection. In fact, my skin (even in chilly, dry December!) has never felt better. I have sensitive/dry skin, and this never irritates.  Plus, it&#x27;s not oil-based (so said my facialist), so I haven&#x27;t had any problems with break outs and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. The consistency is really light too, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am putting on a heavy mask, even though it&#x27;s spf 40.  It basically has zero scent, if you are concerned about the smell. I only have to use a &amp;#34;half pump&amp;#34; of the product and it&#x27;s more than enough to cover my face and neck, so I definitely think the bottle will last. I will buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good facial sunblock that won&#x27;t cause my skin to react negatively and that has a high SPF.  I have Lupus and am photosensitive so I have to wear sunblock daily.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and I like it for the most part.  So far, my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out with the use of this product and I definitely feel the sunblock working, however I wish they made a SPF 50 and (for my budget) its on the pricy side for how much you get per bottle.  I also found that after it dried on my skin there was some areas that didn&#x27;t get blended in and I have to double check myself in the mirror to re-blend in those areas that show white streaks. As this does work better than what I had been using and my skin likes it so far, taking this extra step of rechecking my face in the mirror for streaks is fine by me; however that is the reason for -1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Neutrogena SPF 60 sensitive skin (per my dermatologist recommendations) and I also tried Vanicream SPF 50 (again per doc recommendations).  The Neutrogena was the only one I could use on my face (as the Vanicream left my skin greasy but blocked the sun better) however I didn&#x27;t feel is was blocking the sun adequately and it was not easy to get it to blend into my face w/out white, flaky, slightly greasy residue.  The Glo Therapeutics SPF 40 blocks the sun better and goes on much nicer.  Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update if I have skin issues after using for long period.</li>
    <li> I like that this spf lotion is so light feeling and doesn&#x27;t effect my makeup by making it appear greasy or cakey. Great product, and love the brand. My all time favorite from this brand is glo therapeutic vitamin e creme</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the Oil Free SPF 40 product. I have used it both as a sunscreen on top of a moisturizer or alone and it works great both ways. It doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen type smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my skin, but it does protect it very well.</li>
    <li> Nice quality moisturizer for my mature buy oily skin. Need the spf.  Happy.</li>
    <li> I like this and think it does give excellent SPF coverage.  It did not break my sensitive skin out and is a great product.  I just wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the liquid consistency of it.  It does dry quickly so it&#x27;s not really a big deal and I still use it a few times a week.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Light and not oily feeling at all!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever tryed. Great coverage and it thin and not sticky. It is worth it&#x27;s cost!</li>
    <li> This is a very good sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen.  It absorbs into your skin very well  I&#x27;ll use this from now on..</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Received fast service. The spf is not oily. It melts int o your skin. I do not want to live without it.</li>
    <li> This works very well on the face......not a problem sweating and getting it in your eyes</li>
    <li> I bought this product and was very happy with it.  When I needed more, I purchased 2 more containers.  I found that the new containers did not have the consistency of the original one.  When I pressed the pump, I could see that the product clearly had separated and was watery and not easy to apply as it was slimy and disgusting.  I called the company Glo Therapeutics and they refused to do anything about it.  I asked for a supervisor and she promised to get back to me and she never did.  I offered to send the product to them so they could see and analyze what happened but they were not interested.  Be careful buying this product or anything from this company as they do not stand behind their product. You would think that they should be very interested in keeping a customer and seeing what was wrong with their product.  Instead their answer was too bad and they can&#x27;t do anything about it!  I would never buy this product again.  Shame on a company with this attitude!  Follow up:  Although the customer service stinks from the company making this product, the product itself is excellent.  I brought it a few more times and had no problem with he consistency.</li>
    <li> Ive used glo products for the past 5 years and it is the inly sunscreen that doesnt give me acne. I also use their renew serum and it is the only product I notice a difference from almost immediately. I have horrible acne and have used many products including prescription and Glo sunscreen and serum are two of the only products that I can use and not break out and actually make my wrinkles and pores smaller. Really great products.</li>
    <li> Best sunblock ever! My skin is oily and prone to breakouts. I wear this sunscreen all summer long as my day cream - it absorbs quickly, is not greasy at all, a great moisturizer and does not cause any breakouts. Put a coat of powder after applying to reduce the shine.&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts a long time, the pump works well and gives you just enough product, and it&#x27;s small and light to throw into your purse when going out. I got all my girlfriends hooked on this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  Love it.  Not greasy.  The SPF is high enough to protect me all day.  Perfect for Southern California hot summers!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER AND THE FACT THST IT HAS 40 SUNSCREEN IN IT. ABSORBS QUICKLY INTO YOUR SKIN BUT NEVER FEELS OILY. WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS BUT IT IS A BIT PRICY FOR THE SIZE .</li>
    <li> was disappointed in the price in that you now get the product in a smaller quantity than in privous orders. Will niot reoroder this item at that price again</li>
    <li> This is a perfect sunscreen.  I have been using this for a month and I really like this product. Highly recommend it and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over year and I love it, it is a little bit pricey but it&#x27;s worthy. I have been at the beach exposed to the Florida sunshine and this product blocks the sun, love it.  My priority is to take care of my face first, since I&#x27;m in early 40&amp;#34;s  This product does block the sun of your face, You don&#x27;t want to get wrinkles to soon. My dermatologist recommended this product and since then I have been using it, won&#x27;t change it for anything else.  When I ran out I found it here in Amazon and I received the product quick. no time waiting.</li>
