      <li>two lighter shades are great for everyday, using the darkest shade as eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Really can&#x27;t complain for the price on such good quality makeup.</li>
      <li>shadow trio is a nice, blendable mix of matte shades (matte is a must for my maturing eyelids);  light beige, light-medium brown, and a dark brown.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d wouldn&#x27;t purchase as a gift because the items are really small portions, but a great go to if you haven&#x27;t been exposed to smashbox.</li>
      <li>the eye shadow trio is very pigmented!</li>
      <li>The shadow container has a cute swivel open case.</li>
      <li>The primers are pretty good,the 24 hour shadow primer is my FAV out of this kit.</li>
      <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s better than MAC&#x27;s primer.</li>
      <li>The matte eye shadow shades are very neutral.</li>
      <li>Several of these I will be purchasing in full size.  </li>
      <li>This set comes with decent sized samples of the Smashbox eye primer, shadow trio in &#x27;filter&#x27;, face primer, and mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Love the products but way too small even for a try it kit!</li>
      <li>Though little, it was worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Love this kit, a little goes a long way.</li>

<li> Love this kit, a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> When I use the primer, my eye shadow last all day long, even in the Texas heat.</li>
<li> both primers make my makeup long lasting</li>
<li> I should of just spent the money and got regular sized items.</li>
<li> Especially since they&#x27;re so expensive to buy the full sized products.</li>
<li> Mascara makes my eyelashes long without clumping!</li>
<li> Not a good way to a potential new customer feel ripped off.</li>
<li> The products were a little smaller than I Expected for the price.</li>
<li> Wish the face primer was bigger at least as big as the eyelid primer.</li>
<li> a little goes a long way!</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t tried the other items.</li>
<li> Other than that I like it!</li>
<li> For me, the darkest shade is too dark for everyday when used as a shadow, but could be used sparingly in an evening setting.&lt;br /&gt;Using a beauty blender sponge makes blending even easier.&lt;br</li>
<li> It is a pink cream base that goes on clear and makes your shadow last all day.</li>
<li> Remember the days you had a small doll house with little pieces..</li>
<li> Im not sure about the rest of the products but</li>
<li> Sorry, I think you can only get 2 uses out of this kit.</li>
<li> but they are extremely small extremely small</li>
<li> The primer is SOOOO small!</li>
<li> Will buy the regular size but disappointed with how small it is.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a MAC paint pot or long wear base if you&#x27;re using the smashbox primer and then the eyeshadow.</li>
<li> the eyeshadow  trio is fake.</li>

    <li> Love this damn kit!!! The eyeshadow is AMAZING it lasts allllll damn day.. And the primers are wonderful!! Love it</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and the products are fantastic! The face primer is awesome, the best I&#x27;ve tried. I definitely think it&#x27;s better than MAC&#x27;s primer. The eyeshadow primer is also incredible. Definitely recommend these. Oh, and the eyeshadow is smooth and blends perfectly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a MAC paint pot or long wear base if you&#x27;re using the smashbox primer and then the eyeshadow. You really only need the primer then the shadow. Great product and I loved being able to try the products! Especially since they&#x27;re so expensive to buy the full sized products. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Four great products.  Several of these I will be purchasing in full size.  The primers last forever...a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a nice try sample series. Wish the face primer was bigger at least as big as the eyelid primer. It was extremely tiny. Wonderful products however. Love the mascara, which I will buy soon. The matte eye shadow shades are very neutral. A perfect sample size. Really can&#x27;t complain for the price on such good quality makeup. I&#x27;d wouldn&#x27;t purchase as a gift because the items are really small portions, but a great go to if you haven&#x27;t been exposed to smashbox.</li>
    <li> I brought this kit to Try out the products before I bought full size. I should of just spent the money and got regular sized items. This makeup line is terrific. I love the mascara!</li>
    <li> Love this kit, a little goes a long way. The shadow is a lot smaller than pictured. I like it though</li>
    <li> Perfect size for training</li>
    <li> The products were a little smaller than I Expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Love the products but way too small even for a try it kit! Will buy the regular size but disappointed with how small it is.</li>
    <li> This kit is phenomenal. I LOVE the eye shadow and primer. When I use the primer, my eye shadow last all day long, even in the Texas heat. The primer and mascara are awesome!! Get this kit!!! You won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this try it kit from Macy&#x27;s for $18.00 It is perfect for travel and the products are great! The shadow is tiny but the primer makes the color pop,it gives great color pay off and no creasing at the end of the day. The shadow container has a cute swivel open case. The primers are pretty good,the 24 hour shadow primer is my FAV out of this kit. It is a pink cream base that goes on clear and makes your shadow last all day. The oil-free face primer is good too. The mascara is ok,not my fav for lengthening lashes. All in all good tiny travel kit.</li>
    <li> This set comes with decent sized samples of the Smashbox eye primer, shadow trio in &#x27;filter&#x27;, face primer, and mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The primers are great, allowing smoother makeup application and staying power once makeup is applied.&lt;br /&gt;The shadow trio is a nice, blendable mix of matte shades (matte is a must for my maturing eyelids);  light beige, light-medium brown, and a dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;The two lighter shades are great for everyday, using the darkest shade as eyeliner.

I prefer waterproof, but this is a very nice mascara, plenty of coverage and nice, dark color.</li>
    <li> Well I know one things, for people who are buying this, beware. Im not sure about the rest of the products but the eyeshadow  trio is fake. Too good to be true</li>
    <li> Remember the days you had a small doll house with little pieces..this makeup kit should have been in the dolls&#x27; bathroom. If this is the way Smashbox sells its &amp;#34;try kit&amp;#34; for such amount of money, I will stick with MAC makeup. Sorry, I think you can only get 2 uses out of this kit. Not a good way to a potential new customer feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> Though little, it was worth every penny! I love everything the kit came with and the eye shadow trio is very pigmented! both primers make my makeup long lasting and I love it all! Mascara makes my eyelashes long without clumping!</li>
    <li> The primer works great. Not a fan of the mascara. Haven&#x27;t tried the other items.</li>
    <li> Love everything in it!</li>
    <li> The primer is SOOOO small! Other than that I like it!</li>
    <li> Cheaper than in stores. LOVE the 24 hour shadow primer</li>
    <li> high quality items fit great in your purse or in your bag but they are extremely small extremely small and yes I meant to put that twice they look like they had the size for a doll but it does give you an idea of what the full size products would be like worth trying for the price</li>
