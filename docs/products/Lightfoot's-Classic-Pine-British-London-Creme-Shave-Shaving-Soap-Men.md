      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great or have a distinctive \\&quot;gentlemanly\\&quot; pedigree</li>
      <li>Nice Smell, not the greatest lather.</li>
      <li>Great scent.</li>
      <li>The two star review does not reflect on the seller, they were great.</li>
      <li>Great value for that price point.</li>
      <li>Nice pine smell though!</li>
      <li>And good scent.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>My Face Unscented is a good option).    </li>
      <li>I really liked the scent of the soap, but I just couldn&#x27;t get a good lather out of it.</li>
      <li>This is a top quality soap cake and the lady I bought it from was very nice to do business with.</li>
      <li>Any pine aspects are very mild - just great shave soap.</li>
      <li>The product was a fair price and arrived quickly which made me happy.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, but what good is a shave soap without a lather?</li>
      <li>Nice scented value for money</li>
      <li>Does produce a nice lather.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice shaving soap, lathers nicely.  </li>
      <li>Nice lather.</li>
      <li>Thrilled is not the word.</li>
      <li>But honestly- this stuff sux.  </li>
      <li>It smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, fast shipping, great product.</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t like scents that are overpowering or too perfumey and this is natural and perfect for him!</li>
      <li>It smells great, it&#x27;s priced right</li>

      <li>Glycerine types are OK</li>
      <li>but I still like this better.</li>
      <li>but it lathers up and works ok, and you might be able to save yourself $4 in shipping by going to Walmart.</li>
      <li>Smells refreshing and gets the job done</li>
      <li>It basically has to do two things: provide a stable lather that acts as a cushion between the razor blade and your skin, and provide slickness so the blade is able to glide over your skin.  </li>
      <li>Do you buy shampoo with the intent of adding MORE SHAMPOO to it in order to make it do the one job it&#x27;s already supposed to do?</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I tried many of them too.</li>
      <li>I wanted a pine scent, and that is exactly what I received!!!  </li>
      <li>It dissipates very quickly and I could never build a lather with it no matter what technique or times I tried.</li>
      <li>It dries very quickly, leaving a &amp;#34;waxy, glue-like&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a pine scent that  </li>
      <li>I run this soap out of a ship&#x27;s mug (USS Nassau) with a British made Badger bristle brush and feel that I get an absolutely great shave every morning.  </li>
      <li>It gives a good lather as far as shaving soaps go and helps with a close shave.  </li>
      <li>Very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; in that it rinses off very easily.</li>
      <li>It foams well, and has a pleasing, clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a good soap that I would recommend.  </li>
      <li>good lather,nice scent, big cake,fits my mug</li>
      <li>Lucky to get one pass when you whip it</li>
      <li>lather that lasts and creates a slick surface that gives me an incredible shave.</li>
      <li>correctly it would seem) that a product that has been around as long as Lightfoots had to be a good thing</li>
      <li>Besides, this soap is really worth it.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to LOVE about a truly natural pine smell and creamy lather?</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time, I use it most days (when not on the road for work) and is still going strong after a 6 months.</li>
      <li>I feel like I really got my moneys worth this time.</li>
      <li>Once I built a decent lather it quickly dissipated on my face.</li>
      <li>The tiny amount of moist bubbles I got after almost pulverizing my brush magically disappeared when applied to my face.</li>
      <li>Everytime I&#x27;ve used this soap, I&#x27;ve never been able to make a solid lather.</li>
      <li>a thin bubbly lather that dissipates very quickly, but has good slickness.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty straight forward shaving soap.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong pine smell when using that fades shortly after.  </li>
      <li>I really like the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t really lather up at all.</li>
      <li>Even adding glycerin soap, and using a synthetic brush didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
      <li>I would like it to be much stronger.  </li>
      <li>it is a cross between medicine and pine, would like a true pine scent.  </li>
      <li>I tried less water, more water, lathering in my palm, it was no use.</li>
      <li>I used varying methods of adding more or less water.  </li>
      <li>and I like trying new products.</li>
      <li>I cannot find it where I live</li>
      <li>The smell is less offending post shave, and the soap washes away easy leaving your skin with no oily residue feeling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different shaving soaps from the most expensive to the cheapest and by far this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>but this is a very close second.</li>
      <li>This product is far, far inferior to even the Van Der Hagen mystery chemical soap that I&#x27;ve tried, and that soap can be acquired at your neighborhood Walmart for about $1.88.</li>
      <li>The soap gives a nice, but thin layer of lubrication for the razor.  </li>
      <li>It seems to lather up well enough, but it quickly begins to dissipate and dry out as you shave.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a thick foam that smelled strongly of pine.  </li>
      <li>The soap had a much stronger scent than expected....</li>
      <li>, I was expecting a strong pine scent, this is a weak scent ...</li>
      <li>It left my face feeling raw after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;There are much better soaps in this price range, or even costing less.</li>
      <li>On the upside, though, it is very slick, and when combined with an unscented cream or soap that lathers properly, will give you a good shave with a subtle pine fragrance.  </li>
      <li>My biggest complaint on Lightfoot&#x27;s is that the lather does not last as long as many other soaps.</li>

<li> There are not many pine soaps out there</li>
<li> This is not a very good shaving soap at all.  </li>
<li> I find this soap hard to lather.</li>
<li> Hardly any pine smell.</li>
<li> Lightfoot&#x27;s achieves the latter but fails quite badly in the former.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The soap had a much stronger scent than expected.... almost like sticking a pine tree air freshener up your nose.  The soap gives a nice, but thin layer of lubrication for the razor.  The smell is less offending post shave, and the soap washes away easy leaving your skin with no oily residue feeling.</li>
    <li> This is not a very good shaving soap at all.  Lucky to get one pass when you whip it up- and that pass will not be a very good lather.  Overpriced body soap maybe- but not for shaving.  I will have to use it with a shave cream combo- maybe that will help.  But honestly- this stuff sux.  Nice pine smell though!</li>
    <li> Great value for that price point.Smells refreshing and gets the job done I love it.</li>
    <li> I have to wonder if the reviewers who all gave this soap 5 stars have ever used a proper shaving soap before.  I wanted to like this, I truly did.  It smells great, it&#x27;s priced right and it seems triple-milled so it should last.  But it just doesn&#x27;t do what a shave soap should do.  And in order to make it properly functional, you need to mix it with another product (Kiss My Face Unscented is a good option).    A shaving soap doesn&#x27;t have to be $30 and come in a fancy bowl with Royal Warrants all over it.  It basically has to do two things: provide a stable lather that acts as a cushion between the razor blade and your skin, and provide slickness so the blade is able to glide over your skin.  Lightfoot&#x27;s achieves the latter but fails quite badly in the former.  It foams when worked with a brush, but the lather is never dense or stable.  It begins to disappear within a minute.  I tried lathering it with a boar brush, a badger brush, and a synthetic fiber brush.  I used varying methods of adding more or less water.  The results were the same no matter what - thin, overly-bubbly lather that was not stable.  It fails in comparison even to other cheap shaving soaps.    On the upside, though, it is very slick, and when combined with an unscented cream or soap that lathers properly, will give you a good shave with a subtle pine fragrance.  It just leaves you wishing that they had stuck with the original 1890 formulation, which was, without a doubt, a superior product.  I can&#x27;t imagine any British gentleman returning from a fox hunt and looking forward to s shave with the current product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a thick foam that smelled strongly of pine.  What I got was a thin lather that drys too fast and does not provide as much slip as my Proraso Creme http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JHEY14/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s01_i03&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was expecting a strong pine scent, this is a weak scent ... I would like it to be much stronger.  I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent!  He doesn&#x27;t like scents that are overpowering or too perfumey and this is natural and perfect for him!</li>
    <li> This is a top quality soap cake and the lady I bought it from was very nice to do business with.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty straight forward shaving soap.  I wanted a pine scent, and that is exactly what I received!!!  My biggest complaint on Lightfoot&#x27;s is that the lather does not last as long as many other soaps.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave soap I have found.  I tried many of them too. Glycerine types are OK but I still like this better. I even tried some craft (home) made shaving soaps but they didnt stack up to this.  I run this soap out of a ship&#x27;s mug (USS Nassau) with a British made Badger bristle brush and feel that I get an absolutely great shave every morning.  Any pine aspects are very mild - just great shave soap.</li>
    <li> Hardly any pine smell. Doesn&#x27;t lather well.</li>
    <li> My fave is Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat but this is a very close second. Very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; in that it rinses off very easily.</li>
    <li> Everytime I&#x27;ve used this soap, I&#x27;ve never been able to make a solid lather. It dries very quickly, leaving a &amp;#34;waxy, glue-like&amp;#34; layer on my skin. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my fault (showering before shaving and using a certain soap?) or the soap itself. It&#x27;s a big bar of soap, so it&#x27;s bound to last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers well and lasts a long time.  The subtle pine scent is just an extra bonus.  I cannot find it where I live so I buy several at a time.</li>
    <li> Shaving soap. Thrilled is not the word.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to LOVE about a truly natural pine smell and creamy lather? I figured(and correctly it would seem) that a product that has been around as long as Lightfoots had to be a good thing so I will be a lifelong fan.</li>
    <li> I like others wanted to like this, but the lather is to thin and dries quickly. The scent is pine and is not over powering. I put it back in the box and will try it again in a pinch, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I find this soap hard to lather. Even adding glycerin soap, and using a synthetic brush didn&#x27;t help much. Once I built a decent lather it quickly dissipated on my face. It left my face feeling raw after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;There are much better soaps in this price range, or even costing less. Try Stirling, or razorock.</li>
    <li> Nice scented value for money</li>
    <li> Nice Smell, not the greatest lather.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaving soap, lathers nicely.  I love the smell, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long.  If it did I would have giving the full5 stars</li>
    <li> the smell isn&#x27;t quite pine it is a cross between medicine and pine, would like a true pine scent.  Doesn&#x27;t lather as well as others, but it is doable.  It is also smaller than a lot of soaps and so it is too small for my mug and slips around.</li>
    <li> I want to like this shaving soap as it smells wonderful and by all appearances is a quality soap. However, I can&#x27;t get a quality lather from it. I viewed the YouTube video review of this soap by the Mad Scientist of Wet Shaving and I get the same results; a thin bubbly lather that dissipates very quickly, but has good slickness. By the time I shave one side of my face I need to reapply lather to the other side before I can continue. I need cushion in my shaving lather in addition to slip, and this soap only delivers the slip.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a pine scent that  I thought it would.  Does produce a nice lather.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I almost can&#x27;t describe how terrible this shave soap is. Upon \\&quot;lathering\\&quot; (which it didn&#x27;t actually do at all) I applied the soap to my face only to find it as bad or worse than the worst reviews stated. The soap produces no foam, or lather, or anything that&#x27;s of any use to you while shaving. The tiny amount of moist bubbles I got after almost pulverizing my brush magically disappeared when applied to my face. I tried less water, more water, lathering in my palm, it was no use. One reviewer stated they mixed this with actual soap (?) to achieve sufficient lather, I don&#x27;t know anything about this but I do find the notion moronic. Do you buy shampoo with the intent of adding MORE SHAMPOO to it in order to make it do the one job it&#x27;s already supposed to do? I don&#x27;t. This product is far, far inferior to even the Van Der Hagen mystery chemical soap that I&#x27;ve tried, and that soap can be acquired at your neighborhood Walmart for about $1.88. I&#x27;ve never taken time to do a product review before but I felt obligated to human kind to warn against the absolute terrible worthlessness of this soap. If you need cheap shave soap just buy the Van Der Hagen crap. It doesn&#x27;t smell great or have a distinctive \\&quot;gentlemanly\\&quot; pedigree but it lathers up and works ok, and you might be able to save yourself $4 in shipping by going to Walmart.</li>
    <li> good lather,nice scent, big cake,fits my mug</li>
    <li> I have seen other people with this soap and wanted to try it out. There are not many pine soaps out there and I like trying new products. The two star review does not reflect on the seller, they were great. The product was a fair price and arrived quickly which made me happy. I really liked the scent of the soap, but I just couldn&#x27;t get a good lather out of it. I am continuing to try different methods, but for now this soap is a 2/5.</li>
    <li> Nice lather. And good scent. Works well.</li>
    <li> It seems crazy to mail order shave soap but it&#x27;s a small indulgence. Besides, this soap is really worth it. It foams well, and has a pleasing, clean fragrance. It will spoil you and other soaps will pale in comparisson.</li>
    <li> Like some others have noted, this soap smells terrific; however, its lather is terrible. It seems to lather up well enough, but it quickly begins to dissipate and dry out as you shave. It&#x27;s a terrible shame, too. I love the scent, but what good is a shave soap without a lather?</li>
    <li> I really like the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t really lather up at all. It dissipates very quickly and I could never build a lather with it no matter what technique or times I tried. It&#x27;s almost like its just a hand soap and doesn&#x27;t have any quality to become thick like shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Overall it is a good soap that I would recommend.  It has a strong pine smell when using that fades shortly after.  It took me a while to get used to it, but it is as described by the seller.  It gives a good lather as far as shaving soaps go and helps with a close shave.  I have not had a shaving soap that gave me a lather like the stuff from the can.  It lasts a long time, I use it most days (when not on the road for work) and is still going strong after a 6 months.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Lousy lather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different shaving soaps from the most expensive to the cheapest and by far this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Good lather that lasts and creates a slick surface that gives me an incredible shave. It smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, fast shipping, great product. I feel like I really got my moneys worth this time. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> for all of us that like to shave with a razor this product is excellent.  delivered when promised and on time.</li>
