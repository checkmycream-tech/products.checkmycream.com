<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Get compliments all the time. This is a unisex fragrance, INMO. Very popular for a reason. I&#x27;m also a fan of the earlier Burberry fragrances, and love to wear fragrance and smell it on a guy too. The magazines love to promote obscure fragrances that are $100 or more, which is a big risk if you find out you or your friends hate it. Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue always gets noticed (positively) and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I love the subtle smell this has to it.  Lasts long,  but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  That&#x27;s a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> Received as expected and I love D&amp;G !</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it.  It has a light smell and is good for everyday. I&#x27;m glad I got the big bottle because it is his new favorit!</li>
    <li> Smells Wonderful &amp; for a Fraction of the cost at the Department Store</li>
    <li> This cologne smells so good on my man that every time I walk into his bedroom I have to take my pants off immediately. I can&#x27;t help myself! I cannot keep my hands off of him. If you want to smell 100% irresistible to your woman, buy this D&amp;G Light Blue. You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Sweet and refreshing scent. Probably my new go-to cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you choose Amazon.com as your seller. *VERY IMPORTANT*</li>
    <li> great product and arrived on time,thank you</li>
    <li> For a man&#x27;s cologne it may be a little &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34;. trust me, I am not an expert. It just seems to wear well on me and I get lots of compliments and inquiries.</li>
    <li> Women love this scent and this price is great......PS&amp;#62;....I love it also......</li>
    <li> I really like the scent. Not too strong. Just what we&#x27;ve come to expect from D &amp; G...classy and appopriate for use any time.</li>
    <li> My Favorite Cologne!!!</li>
    <li> my number one favorite mens cologne. great price. arrived in good time.</li>
    <li> Very nice product  would buy again</li>
    <li> It smells like the ones we have bought in the store in the past, but is at a cheaper cost. We&#x27;d definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> My number #1 in the top 3, then:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chic, By Carolina Herrera&lt;br /&gt;Bleu, By Chanel&lt;br /&gt;One Million, By Paco Rabbane&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this parfum is awesome</li>
    <li> perfect Christmas Gift! I was hesitant at first and somebody stole the first bottle that was delivered from outside my home. But the person I bought this for absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> Just received it and it&#x27;s authentic Dolce &amp; Gabbana light blue pour homme.  The scent is a change from my usual John Varvatos and I like it.  Amazingly, it has quite the staying power, on just two sprays the cologne lasted all day into the night.  The packaging, bottle, cap, and ultimately the product is all authentic.  I would not hesitate to buy this again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Many people said on the review that this is a fake. Which it definitely is not. This is a tester bottle which has an off color knob on top, though is the exact same thing as the non-tester (Dark blue knob). People think this is not lasting all day. That is Parfum that last all day. Which at this price which was so good when I asked a Macy&#x27;s Cologne salesperson to match the price with Amazon she said that is way to big a price drop. Which was about $50.00. This is great for a date night out. Though don&#x27;t over do the sprays. 1 on the inside of your wrist and one on your neck is plenty.</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this perfume. I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;girly girl&amp;#34; - I don&#x27;t wear perfume or makeup, but I have always loved the smell of DG Light Blue. Such a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell - w/o smelling overpowering or flowery!! The price was always the deciding factor against purchase for me.....This was a great deal for the size &amp; I just couldn&#x27;t pass it up!! :)</li>
    <li> Loved the cologne. Always get compliment when I wear it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband who loves to wear good fragrances.It was among samples we received in the mail  and he thought it smelled terrific.However,even after applying ridiculously large amount it fades to practically  nothing in ten or fifteen minutes.It is virtually useless to him.And would you believe,I bought the largest bottle!</li>
    <li> I love this scent from Dolce and Gabbana.  I highly recommend this number one scent.  You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I had heard beforehand that some of the colognes in Amazon were counter fit, but I did not run into this problem with this product.  Super happy with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered wanting this for me, but then i realized i orderd the wrong one lol I gave to my partner and he loved it! Fast fast delivery</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cologne, has been for some time. Came full, quickly and with a strong scent. Sometimes they evaporate or come watered down, this is the real deal... perfect.</li>
    <li> Never tried it before, but it I think it wears off to quick.Very faint and very nice otherwise</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for the last 4-5 years, needed some more so I got on here and purchased. Smells great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Light Blue for years, and the price is reasonable here. Retailers sell it approximately $ 20 extra.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for our grandson and he absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;It was what he had asked for and the size was just right !!</li>
    <li> Not just saying this, but every time I wear this somewhere, someone makes a comment about how good I smell. My wife loves it, which means I do too... but I really do.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for a few years now and love it.  I get many compliments from the laies on it.  This is my wife&#x27;s favorite cologne on me.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and get MULTIPLE compliments throughout the day with this fragrance.  A little goes a long way!!!</li>
    <li> As some other reviewers have alluded, this was NOT the Dolce and Gabbana &amp;#34;Light Blue&amp;#34; cologne I have purchased and used previously.  One of my favorite colognes, I was disappointed when I sprayed it to my wrist for the first time.  I compared it to my lsat bottle, and the distinction in aroma is significant.  Moreover, you cannot return colognes back to Amazon.com, per their return policy.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and then husband. We both love it. The scent is quite refreshing but also manly. :)</li>
    <li> Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s Light Blue is a great smelling scent which last for about half of the day. This is a scent that I would recommend trying</li>
    <li> I received this spray in excellent condition and it smells wonderful on my husband. He likes it too of course.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The Light Blue for women is wonderful also.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> I recently fell in love with the smell of the Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue for Men&#x27;s while shopping at Nordstroms. I didn&#x27;t fall in love with the price of $78. So I checked out Amazon and wow $44.95 is great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many reviews saying they received a fake version of the cologne it made me not want to buy it. Since the price is so good I thought I would give it a try.I received the cologne and it seems authentic. The box was really nice and the plastic seemed to have an authentic sticker from Dolce &amp; Gabbana. The bottle looks real and has the frosted look. Since I took pictures of the Nordstroms sample it looks exactly like the one I received. I tested one spray a few feet away and it lasted the regular time that most colognes seem to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I believe it is authentic I&amp;#34;m giving this review 5 stars. The only downfall was that I&#x27;m a prime member and the shipping took a week to receive. I&#x27;m not sure how that happens but I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price for the amazing smell of Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue. I recommend this product to all men. My girlfriend loves the smell of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought this gift for my son for Christmas.  Looked everywhere for the lowest price and found this.  He loves the scent and I was happy with the price.</li>
    <li> Great price. Nice size bottle so happy with this deal...i will def buy again..macys sells it for so much more</li>
    <li> Light and last all day smells good this word min is very dumb on my review can i write a review for that</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne....Lasts all day....Smells great....I get lots of compliments on this one.  I&#x27;m putting this one in my favorite colognes to wear.</li>
    <li> This cologne is great. It smells amazing and its long lasting. Not to mention at an unbeatable price. I love it</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t even received it yet but I already tried to issue a return and it was denied.  ive purchased other products off of amazon that were knock off&#x27;s like my phone case, bare minerals make up, and probably a lot more I am not even aware of.  WTF is going on Amazon???</li>
    <li> Not so much if I like it as it is to whether my lady likes it....so far she is nor impressed...</li>
    <li> I have become an online shopped almost 100% because of the quality I continue to receive.  I am thrilled with the product and shipping.</li>
    <li> I like this cologne, the best cologne i have ever since. The smell is very good.&lt;br /&gt;It is really good for men.</li>
    <li> I knew the price was too good to be true.  We still had a little of our original bottle of Light Blue left. When we got this in the mail, it smelled nothing like the real one.  Had a musk after smell (if that makes sense)... Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This parfume is amazing do not miss it,the small sooooo nice is the best,I think this is the good choose,also all the ladys love it</li>
    <li> My wife had shown me a sample of this Eau de Toilette Spray.  Once I tested it, I was determined to get this. I decided to buy it on Amazon.com as I love the service.  I feel very good and confident after spraying a little of this cologne before I head to work.  Many of my colleagues have complimented me and asked me as to which cologne was I wearing. That should say it all. I recommend this cologne to all those who want a good cologne and feel great!</li>
    <li> i have been purchasing this product for my son every year.. he loves it it might cost a great price but worth every scent it smells wonderful i love it</li>
    <li> Just thought I&#x27;d write a review on here since there seemed to be a lot of negative ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received the Dolce &amp; Gabbana package and just opened it not too long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, i totally received this wayyyy sooner than I thought! Estimated delivery was about a week and I got mine two days after I placed the order. So that was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this product is exactly what it should be. It&#x27;s not a fake or anything. It&#x27;s legit. Package with the authentic Dolce &amp; Gabbana sticker which was on a clear wrap around the box. Box is a velvety texture and the bottle was snuggly inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also was hesitant on purchasing this item after I saw all the reviews. But I was just like...&amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;. And I am actually really happy about this and relieved! I hope this review helps a lot of you!</li>
    <li> This was one of the gifts my daughter wanted for Christmas.  It smells amazing!  I will be ordering this for myself.</li>
    <li> I wear this often. There is no susbstitute. Women wake up in the morning and wonder what happened to them when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I got mine from EDGE USA, Don&#x27;t waste your $!! When I received mine it had an Alchohol Smell to it,the Color look NOTHING like my Original from the Store. I even did a Blind Test &amp; my friend picked out the Original Imeddiatly. They even had 99% ,,I either got a Bad one or other people just don&#x27;t know the Difference</li>
    <li> I love this cologne but it&#x27;s very expensive in stores. I found it to be pretty affordable on amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this buy. Tons of compliments, this is not an everyday cologne in my opinion but I do recommend anybody who is in the market for a new smell to give this a try. I love this cologne</li>
    <li> i like the cologne, it smells good. but i dont feel like it smells as strong OR long lasting as if you were to but it as dillards or some where they sell colognes.</li>
    <li> It Would have been nice to know it was for men...I cannot return it now! Expensive to sit on the shelf!</li>
    <li> This item seems to be a fake. I tried it a few days after I bought it and it does not smell like the real Dolce &amp; Gabbana.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for years, and the last time I ordered from Amazon the product was great.  This time the color was more yellow, and the smell was not good.  It smelled like a mix of original D&amp;G combined with the smell of a wet rag that sat in the corner for a few days.  I am pursuing a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a long time Amazon customer and buy a lot, and 99% of the time am extremely happy with their products, service etc.  This is one of those cases where I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews and bought at a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update July 24, 2013 - Amazon was kind enough to refund me.  I continue to be a very happy Amazon Prime customer and will keep buying from them, and their quick resolution of my issue on this item reinforced my confidence in dealing with them.</li>
    <li> Love this smell!  Smells like fresh citrus!</li>
    <li> This product smells ok, but doesn&#x27;t last long. It may last about an hour or 2 at the most then it seems you never had anything on. It came packaged in its original box with cellophane wrapping and shipped very quickly from the time ordered. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Perfume smells good but no-where near original product i have seen in Macy&#x27;s. it was a waste of $40 dollars, wish amazon allows returns... not sure whats the big deal there... also how do i put 0 stars?</li>
    <li> Clean, fresh scent! Great for summer. Everything you would want for a warm weather fragrance. Women love it!</li>
    <li> I buy all the time on Amazon, including Curve for Men &amp; CK One cologne...this is not the same, as dept. stores, I read reviews that it smells like alcohol, ordered anyway...should have listened...it smells like alcohol...don&#x27;t waste your $</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I expected.  I bought it as a gift for my Husband and he really liked it.  I love this cologne but hadn&#x27;t got around to getting it until this Christmas.  It&#x27;s subtle and sensual, mysterious.  It was the real thing not a knock-off. It was still lingering hours later. Just amazing!</li>
    <li> I really like this cologne, it&#x27;s not too sweet and it smells great. The only thing I do not like is that the bottle is very fragile. I had to end up buying a second bottle because the first broke easily.</li>
    <li> I got this and the smell was different then what u get at younkers and etc. i took bottle in and showed them and they smelled it and tried it and they also said at younkers that it was watered down and not the actual stuff.. Rip offff!!!</li>
    <li> Love fragrance just seems over priced. But I will but it again I am sure.  Maybe price will lower by then.</li>
    <li> Yes definitely my type of cologne..... It has a nice fresh smells to it.....so far so good.....will see how long the smells last. But as of now I really love the smell and will definitely buying more from amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is fake. Don&#x27;t buy it. I used this product before few years ago. It was very good, I thought it would be the same, but unfortunately this is a fake product, Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return the product but it is not returnable.</li>
    <li> not happy with the product&lt;br /&gt;different /less ounce bottle give better satisfaction and quality.&lt;br /&gt;future order to be zero&lt;br /&gt;ithink need refund</li>
    <li> Like an old suit...it just fits and works!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  He says the girls compliment him on it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is the MENS VERSION. I had wanted the ladies version for myself. Tried to return it, and amazon doesn&#x27;t do returns on purfumes or colognes. I had to give it away.</li>
    <li> I like the product and the way it handles. It has an overall positive rating and just cannot believe the overall positive outcome</li>
    <li> Good product for a good price. I bought two bottles. Very happy. Will recommend to friends and family. Thank you</li>
    <li> On time, and the product is excellent. I want more of this! the smell is great, just a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> I Adore this smell :)</li>
    <li> This cologne has a very clean and crisp smell to it.  It is also not overpowering which is nice.  One or two pumps and you&#x27;re fine for an evening out.  I use this as my daily cologne along with a couple of others.</li>
    <li> not happy at all specially paying over 50 dollar for it when after an hour and half at the most you cant even smell it no more so freaking mad/sad.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal not a counterfeit! I tried some other colognes, but had to come back to the Light Blue for its clean and fresh scent without being obnoxious.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. Light and citrusy.</li>
    <li> I love Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue for my husband. Smells amazing. The price was awesome too. Like half of what the stores were selling it for. Shipped quickly, arrived on time and didn&#x27;t break of anything. Exactly as described. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> WARNING! DO NOT BUY! IT IS WATERED DOWN!&lt;br /&gt;Very, very disappointed. I have been using this item for a long time and this was the first (and last time) I purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Product is watered down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you</li>
    <li> For some reason, this doesn&#x27;t smell as strong or last as long. Not sure if it was an old bottle or what</li>
    <li> what can i really say .....it smells great will buy again</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and it gets the 5 star treatment. Original packaging and it is a great product. I highly reccommend this item as a gift to anyone.</li>
    <li> This cologne is really nice. It can cover up the worst body funk on the planet. Sometimes I have a really bad &amp;#34;swamp crack&amp;#34; odor after working 12 hour shifts. I spray this cologne in my ride and the scent covers up my stench!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. Either this is not original and too old. Most likely not original. The fragrance last barely for a minute. Even that does not smell like the original light blue. I have been using it for over 6 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product. Better to buy it at duty free at the airport or at perfume stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent, Fast Shipping, Brand New, Thanks</li>
    <li> I finally got my cologne and I thank you.</li>
    <li> Best price ever. Better than Sephora pricing or any mall.</li>
    <li> Just the one i was looking for :)&lt;br /&gt;And saved abd affordable just ideal!</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderfull and the quality excellent</li>
    <li> is very good and also light blue is the best for summer</li>
    <li> High alcohol content and watered down scent...either this an old batch that went spoiled or its a imposter...either way be careful guys</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t purchased a new bottle of this fragrance in years. It was time - smells just like I remember. Everything worked smoothly with shipping.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to buy this cologne when I walked into Sephora a couple of weeks ago. The lady reccomended this and I was instantly won over. She even gave me a little vial-size sample which lasted for about 2-3 days. That little container got me really excited for this so I went on Amazon knowing that I could probably get it for way cheaper. The price difference is apparent, this literally costs about half of what it does inside retail stores. Anyways, it came delivered very securely and the box was wrapped in plastic and all. I dont think its fake but to me the scent does not last as long as I hoped. For some reason the one I got from Sephora lasted like 5hrs+ and this faded away in less than 2hrs. Just a heads up for anyone who is thinking about buying this!</li>
    <li> Got it today and smells great if your thinking of getting it get it. Love it</li>
    <li> What a great bargain.</li>
    <li> the aroma is very short, is not good quality.</li>
    <li> came in fast with no damages. smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular cologne for years now.This is by far the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen, and for a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> I love D&amp;G, but have put off purchasing it because of the price. I saw this one and jumped on it immediately for my husband. Must be an old bottle. Has lost its fragrance. I should have known, because the price was too good!</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> This smells so good. Not over bearing or heavy.  I bought it as gifts and it was a nice hit.</li>
    <li> Great smell and lasts long.</li>
    <li> Smells great and authentic. I have bought these in sephora, ulta, etc for years. Saved a good amount of money this way.</li>
    <li> Women and gay men are drawn to my scent lol</li>
    <li> No fue entregado a quien correspondia</li>
    <li> I love this smell! smooth and I get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent. Been wearing it since it came out. One spritz does enough so a bottle lasts a long time. Get compliments on it all the time. Glad to find it here $30 cheaper then in the department stores</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. I highly recommend. I was skeptical that it was inauthentic but it is not. My 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it too! Men are hard to buy for but cologne is something they dont think to purchase for themselves.</li>
    <li> Would not wear anything else. The best!!!!</li>
    <li> Falls short compared to Aqua di Gio say,  fragrance doesn&#x27;t last all day.  Dry down unremarkable. Would stick to di Gio.</li>
    <li> light and refreshing, husband loves it and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;package arrive with product in tact, good delivery time and excellent pricing</li>
    <li> i feel like its not the real brand the smell only stay for a short time</li>
    <li> When I received the cologne it seemed okay but after putting it on it smelled differently than my current bottle. I took it to Nordstrom&#x27;s and compared it with one they had and it was a completely differnet scent. It is an imitation scent in a recycled bottle. Not happy at all!!!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell anything like light blue...don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> Well, I was never too into buying this kind of product online because of the negative reviews. The price difference is significant. The only reason I bought this product this way is because of the price. In essence it´s the same when you first put it on, but it doesn´t last too long. This tells you something is not right. Since I saved mone,y I guess I can afford to use a lot at once.</li>
    <li> Love DG Light Blue...that&#x27;s my jam.  Arrived in good time and was a very good price.</li>
    <li> one of my favorites out of the 12 colognes I wear.  It reminds me of other aquatic scents like Acqua di Gio</li>
    <li> Ordered on 10 July, received on 11July.  Surprised me.  Also outstanding product.</li>
    <li> its as i expect and every thing is very good thanks for all staff and i will come back in future</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent and has never had any complaints. It&#x27;s fresh and clean and definitely less expensive on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and my girlfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> Unlike 212 Carolina Herrera, this one is top notch. Stays on long and is a real deal.</li>
    <li> it was fake!!! the smell is different.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this gift.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle am I just can&#x27;t get enough of this fragrance.</li>
    <li> i love it!!! and yes it is authentic</li>
    <li> Great quality,  fast shipping,  value certainly exceeded cost</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; excellent size</li>
    <li> Perfect for a guys birthday, exactly as what i bought in department stores and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I smelled this cologne on a colleague during class and we became friends after I told him I HAD to know what he was wearing. I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday and can tell every time he wears it. I am a huge smell-based person, so I love it! I highly recommend to any girl searching to influence her man&#x27;s collection or even any guy searching to catch a certain someone&#x27;s attention. It got me to initiate the first conversation, so I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work for you too!</li>
    <li> They shipped it fast, however, the scent went away in about 5 minutes. I should have read the reviews before I purchased it. I was lured into it by the cash back bonus they offered. Please don&#x27;t buy this stuff and save your money for the real ones.</li>
    <li> What a great scent.  masculine and fresh!  One of my favorites my hubby wears.  Only had for 5 months and half the bottle is gone! need I say more?  Nope!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past five years. To this day, I still get compliments. I have yet to find an equal to this.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it  Happy wife happy life.</li>
    <li> My husband smells real nice</li>
    <li> I want to bite my husband when he wears it!! :-P</li>
    <li> ONE OF THE BEST COLONES IN THE WORLD ONLY IF YOU CAN GET THE ORIGINAL</li>
    <li> This is a knock off . Smells nothing like the real product .Scent only lasts for a few minutes .</li>
    <li> This cologne smells so sexy on my husband! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Authentic when purchased directly from Amazon. Checked serial / batch number on checkcosmetic.net And found that I received a batch made in July for an order placed in September, which is about as new as I could ask for. Can&#x27;t argue with 50% savings off sticker for an identical product.</li>
    <li> I really love this cologne! I bought it for a special friend of mine who is turning 50 soon! I probably won&#x27;t be able to smell it on him since we live far from each other, but I am almost sure he will enjoy it!!! I&#x27;m sure he will let me know!</li>
    <li> I am loving it and awesome.</li>
    <li> i give dolce&amp; gabbana  a five plus  it grate  nothen  better its the bomb thank you</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne. Got it for him for Christmas. Got a great deal online. Would have paid twice as much as a department store</li>
    <li> The ladies love this fragrance. An exceptionally priced buy. Got the item fast as well. Wear to all special occasions.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in the appearance of the packaging. It appeared yellowed and the shrink wrap was open on one end. The product appeared to be correct.</li>
    <li> I was WORRIED this was going to be an IMPOSTER FRAGRANCE, BUT AFTER LOOKING AT OTHER STORES AND CHECKING OUT PACKAGE CAREFULLY, IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE REAL FRAGRANCE AT A REALLY GOOD PRICE.SHIPPING WITH AMAZON IS AL</li>
    <li> Worn this for years now.  It&#x27;s a very clean, crisp fragrance that never goes out of style.  I get so many complements when wearing this.</li>
    <li> Unique mens cologne aroma that most people around you can enjoy while you passing by!....</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  It&#x27;s a favorite.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. we shopped around and Amazon had the best value around.</li>
    <li> Great value &amp; less expensive than the mall</li>
    <li> VERY NICE SMELL AND THE PRICE IS GREAT. I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LOVES IT. I AM THINKING TO BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Authentic and wonderful, my wife loves this stuff. She actually walks down wind to smell it, lol. Ladies love it. Good stuff!!</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this classy smelling cologne. Got compliments every where I went</li>
    <li> Had to reorder it for my hubby he love it!!! and I love when my hubby smell good :)</li>
    <li> Right on time and exactly as I expected it to look! thanks!</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven! And accountable delivery! Great buy!</li>
    <li> This cologne came earlier than expected &amp; smells great!! Thanks!! Will order again.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend loved it</li>
    <li> this is not a fake it its genuine however i think it wears off way too quickly bcse of the shelf life ..if u look at the batch number tagged under the perfume like mine says 3304- the first 3 represents the year it was made which is 201&#x27;3&#x27; which is wayyyy too longg and has nw been sold to me. I once smelt this on a friend and it was amazing tho. The scent in the beginning is very light and citrus grapefruit kinda scent and its a high alcohol/ water based cologne. as it simmers into yur skin the scent is much bttr a litle bit more warm with citrus infused in it. Now it did not last long on my hand but my colleague spayed it on his hand and it smelt for hours and the scent was diff on him than on me. So it depends on how u like yur scents but for me if i had to choose nw it will def choose ralph lauren pony#3 or issey miyake sport for a younger person. this dolce &amp; gabana is gud but its more for lighter working days evryday kind of cologne.</li>
    <li> D&amp;G Light Blue is all my all time favourite. My brother bought this fragrance as a gift for me in 2009. I got many compliments anytime I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I got another bottle in 2013 for my personal use but my boss loved it too so I gave it to him as a gift. This is my third bottle.</li>
    <li> IN REALITY FOR ME IS ME WHAT ARE SO SWEET SCENT I WILL GIVE AS MY BROTHER IF YOU LIKE stomachs</li>
    <li> Great cologne, great price. What more can you say.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned. Fast shipping, great packaging! Will reorder for sure!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing day time fragrance. Love it on at work and out and about. :)</li>
    <li> I bought these for my boyfriend and my bestfriend since my son uses it and we both love it much</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, last all day long</li>
    <li> Great Item. Just what I ordered. Great pricing. Shipping was fast. Thank you</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the way this smells on me.  Enough said!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite perfume! !&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again when it done</li>
    <li> As my experience, this is not a original perfume, i don&#x27;t recomend it. The odor of this perfume leave very fast, I don&#x27;t recomend buy perfume online.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is long lasting but not overbearing. I would highly recommend this product and expect it to last awhile since only a spray or two is sufficient.</li>
    <li> The size and packaging are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend loved his Christmas present!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;ve changed the formula, or if one man can make it smell so different from another?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make a great gift, but get the person to sample it several times before buying just to check that the smell doesn&#x27;t change on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for money, and I would recommend it when you&#x27;re sure of your scent!</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I really liked this fragrance, so I had to add to my collection, but not at full retail price - No, sir. I am a sucker for fresh and citrus smells in fragrances and this one is as the name suggests, light. It wears very softly and could be stronger perhaps, but this way you will not stink people out of the room, with over-powering cologne smell. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for the best fragrance for men out there. I can get the half-sized version at Macy&#x27;s for double the price, so do the math and buy on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased and happy to have received my ítem. My husband loves this fragrance . Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regards</li>
    <li> Okay, this is the men&#x27;s fragrance. But it is light, refreshing and longer-lasting that the women&#x27;s version. I love it. And so does everyone around me.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great but does not last long. It is the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; and is worth the reduced Amazon price but not the 80.00 big store price!</li>
    <li> This was a purchase for my husband, he enjoys the lightness of the scent and that it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present unaware of what it smelled like. He loved it and so do I! Great product that smells great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this scent. Authentic, lasts long and has great sillage.</li>
    <li> I was told i smelled delicious!.....so you already know whats up:)</li>
    <li> Great deal and the perfect gift for my other half.</li>
    <li> Riquisimo perfume me gusto</li>
    <li> Wonderful at a great price!</li>
    <li> Super water down or old  . Smeel doesnt last at all , a shame becasue I really like this one. SMH</li>
    <li> Love the how it smells on my husband!</li>
    <li> Great gift for my husband!  Even better price!</li>
    <li> Great smell, not too overwhelming...stays on throughout the day.  Great price for the size.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, since I love Dolce &amp; Gabbana for men. The initial scent is too harsh for me to be interested in the second phase of notes. I may have gotten a bad batch, but to me this stuff smells cheap. Because so many people like this, I will fiddle around with it a little more and may change my 2 star rating in the future.</li>
    <li> SMELLS SO GOOD.  THE PRICE WAS GREAT FOR THE SIZE OF THE BOTTLE.  I THINK I GOT A VERY GOOD DEAL.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the Men&#x27;s in this. I tried numerous times to get in contact with the seller. No luck. I like the men&#x27;s version on my husband. This came as the women&#x27;s and I am now stuck with it. I am trying to get my mom to take it. The men&#x27;s version smells great (at least on my husband)... ;-)</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance before,and just because of its warm sent,i had to purchase one for my son because he liked it also.</li>
    <li> This bottle is huge and expensive. My advice is to get a smaller bottle or buy the bottle on sale.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling colognes for men! My husband and son both wear it and I love the smell. I buy a bottle for each of them every year!</li>
    <li> I purchased the female for me and the male for my son. They smell so good. Priced it in the stores and it was a lot more expensive. I love when you cant smell your perfume and people can and they stop and ask you what are you wearing. Its so refreshing smelling</li>
    <li> Cap to the bottle is different then before but smells exactly the same and for the price its all good</li>
    <li> Fragrance Net is my primary store for buying scents. I&#x27;ve been buying from them since 2010 and never once had any sort of issue. They have absolutely the best prices. So, because I&#x27;ve developed such a trust with them, I bought Light Blue from them. Once it came in, and with one spray, I knew it wasn&#x27;t real. Just to be sure, I had a bottle of Light Blue that I had bought from a department store, sprayed that on one arm, and sprayed the Fragrance Net on the other. The difference is staggering. Although the smell is very close, it is absolutely not Light Blue. I will continue to use Fragrance Net for all my fragrance needs, with the exception of this product. Do yourself a favor, buy Light Blue in person from a department store. It&#x27;s the only way to guarantee you&#x27;re buying the true Light Blue.</li>
    <li> Great smelling, not overpowering. This is one of the colognes I&#x27;ve been using for a very long time. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my husband and The scent is so perfect and long lasting on him. I just love this fragrance on him and the  price thank you amazon!!</li>
    <li> This product was not &amp;#34;Light Blue&amp;#34; - it is a knock off! It was not worth the money at all!! Odd colored cap is the dead give-away!&lt;br /&gt;Smells like rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> The best smelling cologne ever. Fast delivery too-days before I expected it</li>
    <li> i just love the scent</li>
    <li> the smell don&#x27;t last 3 minutes. don&#x27; t bother buying this perfume because it&#x27;s waste of money. I won&#x27;t buy any perfume again online unless it&#x27;s a trusted store like Macys</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cologne . I have purchased this product for my husband for some time.  He loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy, love the price!</li>
    <li> Love it when my husband wears it, it is a turn on.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This was not Dolce &amp; Gabbana. It was a copy, and not a good one, unless they change formulas on the 4.2 ounce. I recently ordered a 2.5 ounce and it was very different from this.</li>
    <li> love D&amp;G hence I ordered - good value for money</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Dad for cChristmas and he loves it!!! I use it for women !!! For any man out there this smell is delicious!!!! We women love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased! The Dolce &amp; Gabbana Eau de Toilettes Spray, Light Blue, 4.2 Fluid Ounce  bottle arrived earlier than expected! Smells Great! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the arrival of the cologne. It was swift&lt;br /&gt;and such a good deal. I will be ordering from them in the future.</li>
    <li> This cologne my boyfriend gets so many compliments on its an amazing smelling cologne</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SMELL AND WHILE WALKING AROUND I ALWAYS HAVE PEOPLE ASKING ME WHAT IT IS.</li>
    <li> I wore this cologne before and received lots of compliments, as do I now. And for a fraction of department store prices, it is well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent value, &amp;#34;legitimate&amp;#34; product and definitely not a fake.  I am so glad I bought this from this seller!!!  Arrived on time and received very quickly as promised.  Box had a few crinkles but who cares right?  Wish this seller would sell other cologne products because I would buy again.  If you&#x27;re looking for this products and want to save some money, this is what you&#x27;ve been looking for.  Enjoy the rest of your day and thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> Live this scent, bought it for my hubby and he smells so sexy with this on....</li>
    <li> Excellent product, timely delivery</li>
    <li> I find this to be a very powerful scent. It lasts around 6 hours, but has incredible sillage.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the sample .( Actually I received the sample from MACYS !!! ) .&lt;br /&gt;&amp; When I wear this cologne the smell doesn&#x27;t even last longer more than 2-3 hours !!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Lots of compliments and lasts all day! 5 stars</li>
    <li> My husband smells great</li>
    <li> This cologne really takes the cake.  I have had numerous compliments and wedding proposals on the spot.  Just two sprays of this wonderful fragrance helps to soothe the problems you may be facing in your life.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s nothing wrong with this Dolce and Gabbana light blue Cologne, except that it&#x27;s a very faint smell so it would easily lose its momentive after applying. unless you plan to carry this on you in your back pocket I wouldn&#x27;t recommend on buying , but nevertheless it&#x27;s a good Cologne not sweet smelling so more or less its a genuine smell of those who might like that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and I LOVE IT!!! It is definitely my favorite cologne. It smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Good stuff the best love this perfume , now looking forward for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> saludos buen producto lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> The product arrived and was well packaged. A lot of cologne for the price. Smells nice and lasts for hours. Still trying to get used to the spray pattern of the pump.</li>
    <li> Great , My wife loves the smell !~</li>
    <li> I both this Parfum for my Brother , and I think this one is Fake ... After you spray , it take an hour to completely disappear ..&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy on line any perfume !</li>
    <li> Arrived in great condition and has a marvelous aroma.</li>
    <li> product was way better the I expected Im very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband birthday present. It smells really good. We both love it.</li>

    <li> Many female compliments</li>
    <li> The sent doesn&#x27;t last long 30 minutes or less</li>
    <li> its good to wear causal</li>
    <li> Great price and always rapid delivery.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PERFUME, ARRIVED IN OPTIMAL CONDITIONS</li>
    <li> I have been using Light Blue for about 3 years now. I got this exact bottle and with only using 1-2 sprays about every other day, I have only gotten halfway through. Maybe I don&#x27;t use it as often as I think I do... Smells best applied directly to skin as it will be a little sharper if applied to clothing. For me it lasts a long time, maybe even all day. Smells pretty damn good.</li>
    <li> excellent choise. Great fragance for men. i recomend it. No more to say. . . . . . . .</li>
