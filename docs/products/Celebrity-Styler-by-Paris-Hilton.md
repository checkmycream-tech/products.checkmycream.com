### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My hair looked beautiful!</li>
      <li>and this does the best job yet on straightening it    CONS:  </li>
      <li>It was an excellent buy!!</li>
      <li>mo2WXN9UUVOSQQ2]]2012 and my Paris Hilton is still awesome.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, but aside from going to a stylist for a blow-out every week nothing is going to be.    </li>
      <li>They loved it!!  </li>
      <li>Her hair looks great and she is rather impressed.</li>
      <li>Of course this product works great, if your hair has just been relaxed, or straightened with another product.</li>
      <li>Now I just wanna blow it up, lol.    </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why, because it is a great product.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with it, worked great and lasted maybe 6-8 months.</li>
      <li>This styler is good.</li>
      <li>Very cute pink/black design.</li>
      <li>I am glad I purchased this - I like the effect I get, however I would not pay anymore than I did for one!</li>
      <li>And now I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t!</li>
      <li>Nothing is ever the perfect solution, but this comes very close!</li>
      <li>and she will love u!</li>
      <li>its not the best styler by any stretch but its really good if you just wanna do your hair quickly and easily</li>
      <li>I can honestly say after having used both the InStyler and The Celebrity Styler, I LOVE the Celebrity Styler!</li>
      <li>If the Instyler is generally better than store-bought straighteners then this one might not be as good as it is.    </li>
      <li>and whenever I&#x27;ve loaned it to a friend, they fallen in love with it too and wanted to buy their own.</li>
      <li>But I know in addition to this she lends her name to charitable causes, too,  which is a worthwhile effort on her part, and therefore a redeeming quality.  </li>
      <li>You achieve best result with heat protector spray for added shine than bare hair.</li>
      <li>My first one was great, this one is just OK.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy to have it in my arsenal of hair-taming implements, but I&#x27;m still seeking out the magic tool that will do everything I want.  </li>
      <li>After reading so many reviews about this product, i thought it was time i went to Tjmax and bought one.</li>
      <li>just love her products</li>
      <li>It does a better job at my ends than</li>
      <li>this works way better than any flatiron I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Celebrity Styler has a more sturdier build, and does not feel flimsy the way Instyler does.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
      <li>It straightens better then</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something better.</li>
      <li>love this Celebrity Styler.</li>
      <li>So, I just comb/brush my hair better before using, and wait until the iron is done heating up before using it.</li>
      <li>you want smooth (or both!)</li>
      <li>but I just wanted to say i am really going to buy this sometime 1 for me and my sister lol.</li>
      <li>I have used both the Instyler and the Paris Hilton Styler and like this one much better.  </li>
      <li>Ok omg I havent&#x60; bought this</li>
      <li>I gave the PH styler to a friend with challenging hair.  </li>
      <li>Insulated rubber-ish grip feels cooler and more comfortable in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>The original one just worked better.  </li>
      <li>This is an easy product to use.</li>
      <li>If you do have fine hair</li>
      <li>I think, it might work just fine, but you deffenetly need time to learn how to us it.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, but I have a ton of it</li>
      <li>I own the real INSTYLER.  </li>
      <li>This is cheaply made but it does straighten the hair.  </li>
      <li>The whole process was causing more damage to my hair and making it more frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Without good heat it is completely ineffective.  </li>
      <li>It may be a good product, but in my busy lifestyle, there is no time to fight with it.</li>
      <li>I am soooo glad that I was able to give a gift that was such a success!!!</li>
      <li>It was pretty easy to use!</li>
      <li>I will not be without one of these stylers, I am sold on it and the \\&quot;Instyler\\&quot; which I think was the original product.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this styler based on the comments of others and I am not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>This is a great price on Amazon cause mine did cost a little more</li>
      <li>I guess it is true</li>
      <li>but it does add the feature of being able to flip the hair in or out while straightening so you don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron after your hair is straight.    </li>
      <li>Its been a long time since I&#x27;ve liked my hair!  </li>
      <li>At just under $35, including shipping, it&#x27;s a great value compared to the other over $100 revolving stylers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very coarse frizzy hair and feel that this does a pretty darn good job for straightning or adding curl.</li>
      <li>I have some arthritis and this really makes styling easy for me.</li>
      <li>When I first used the Celebrity Styler, it worked wonders on my hair!</li>
      <li>iron - however I will need to find some product to use with it as it really dries out my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, has the same concept as the Instyler, but I have fine hair and the brush on this one does not grab the hair like the brush on the Instyler would.</li>
      <li>The Celebrity Styler makes my curly hair smooth and straight.  </li>
      <li>The InStyler how ever has those small mircobristle brushes, that pull all the hair in that given area and straighten them Beautifully.  </li>
      <li>Works best for thin hairs.</li>
      <li>but since I use it offend it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Although I USUALLY find Paris Hilton relatively attractive, the packaging looked more like it was for an adult &#x27;marital aid&#x27; product.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to use it, because i was thinking it will be making my life much easier beginning today.</li>
      <li>Well, I ordered this because my old straightener was becoming a pain to work with.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like on my bangs/crown, however right now it&#x27;s pretty long as well as being stick straight and fine to begin with - on the rest of my hair (perm is still in it so pretty curly), it straightens and adds nice body really well - my son even noticed today and commented that he likes it straightened instead of curly.  </li>
      <li>of course if you did have coarse hair you would already know to go with the mirco bristles lol, not the big sticky ones.</li>
      <li>I suspect the very very positive reviews are coming from people who have \\&quot;white\\&quot; hair that is fine, not very curly, and takes to straightening easily.    </li>
      <li>But, by brushing my hair better before using the iron, and taking smaller sections (about 1 inch), this isn&#x27;t a problem</li>
      <li>I thought maybe the iron wasn&#x27;t as hot as the Instyler... but it heats up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, so I must be delusional, because that&#x27;s hot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is something that should be made more obvious to consumer BEFORE purchase.  </li>
      <li>It seems like spending $100 or more on a product is the only way to get something of that caliber.</li>
      <li>My hair feels smooth and soft and stays that way all day.</li>
      <li>(more like fixable cons):&lt;br /&gt;1) Turned itself off for seemingly no reason, but then found out that it only happens when either my hair is getting stuck, or if the iron is not heated up all the way.</li>
      <li>Obviously there is a defect in either just this unit I bought or most of them.  </li>
      <li>It does get really hot, but you can control the tempature.</li>
      <li>bought this item to replace my first PH styler when it died.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I washed my hair with a shampoo and conditioner that detangled my hair( which you should always do before using the celebrity styler).</li>
      <li>This product is definitely on the better end of straighteners that cost about $30</li>
      <li>First of all, let me say that I can&#x27;t compare to the InStyler because I have never tried that tool.    </li>
      <li>a \\&quot;pad\\&quot; to sit it on which is really a plus!  </li>
      <li>Honestly the Clebrity Styler is alright, if you&#x27;re white or have fine hair( meaning anytype asian, fine curly, spanish etc etc).</li>
      <li>my flat iron but seems more drying.</li>
      <li>It is so much better than just a flat iron -</li>
      <li>I still use my trusty Helen of Troy professional curling iron though to finish things off, however I have noticed that my \\&quot;do\\&quot; stays a little better with more lift/body when I use the styler first.  </li>
      <li>Although this might be a great product for some, It&#x27;s not good for me.</li>
      <li>Really the only down-sides I&#x27;ve experienced so far is having it shut off several times when I first start using it</li>
      <li>It heats up pretty fast</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any hotter than a regular straightener or do a better job than a decent store-brand straightener.  </li>
      <li>It is certainly every bit as functional as the InStyler at 1.3 the price.    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think its getting too hot, I am using the same heat setting as the original one.  </li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t really much better than my Remington (wet 2 straight) one.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have the Instyler, but I have the rapid heat-up which does not allow the barrel to rotate both directions.  I tried this to see how it did before returning my Instlyer for a different model.  IT IS TERRIBLE AND VERY CHEAPLY MADE!!!  I have no problems with knock-offs in general as this one is 1/2 the price of the Instyler, but the barrel doesn&#x27;t rotate evenly, the product switches itself off during use for no reason, and it is all around clearly JUNK when you actually start trying to use it.  I&#x27;m not saying go buy the Instyler, because it is pricey, but for 1/2 the cost, you get only 1/10 of the product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try one of these \\&quot;stylers\\&quot; without paying a lot of money - I ordered this one for under $30 - I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to pay anymore than that.  I like it, it&#x27;s better than I expected actually but still wouldn&#x27;t pay close to $100 for one!!  I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it and I do like it better than a plain straightener iron - however I will need to find some product to use with it as it really dries out my fine hair.  One thing that is frustrating is that when I first turn it on (heats up quick!) and start using it, it keeps shutting off!  once I get going, then it usually stays on.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like on my bangs/crown, however right now it&#x27;s pretty long as well as being stick straight and fine to begin with - on the rest of my hair (perm is still in it so pretty curly), it straightens and adds nice body really well - my son even noticed today and commented that he likes it straightened instead of curly.  I still use my trusty Helen of Troy professional curling iron though to finish things off, however I have noticed that my \\&quot;do\\&quot; stays a little better with more lift/body when I use the styler first.  I am glad I purchased this - I like the effect I get, however I would not pay anymore than I did for one! (that&#x27;s just me) And it came with a \\&quot;pad\\&quot; to sit it on which is really a plus!  Really the only down-sides I&#x27;ve experienced so far is having it shut off several times when I first start using it (but then it stays on after that), and it pulls my fine hair (not sure if it&#x27;s the little ball tips on brush that do it or because no product used, or both).</li>
    <li> I opted to buy this instead of forking out the $100 for the Instylyer. It&#x27;s ok, has the same concept as the Instyler, but I have fine hair and the brush on this one does not grab the hair like the brush on the Instyler would. Overall, it straightens my hair smoothly, with a little curl at the end if I desire, but to get tighter curls like they say you can achieve with this product just wont happen because the brush doesn&#x27;t hold my fine hair tight enough.</li>
    <li> some people will buy this only because its by paris hilton but i really like this styler its easier to use than any other cheap hair styler. its not the best styler by any stretch but its really good if you just wanna do your hair quickly and easily</li>
    <li> This is a great price on Amazon cause mine did cost a little more but since I use it offend it is worth it. I have long coarse dark hair and it does a really good job at smoothing my hair. It does a better job at my ends than flat iron cause flat iron heat plate from both the top &amp; bottom causes a lot of breakage and split ends after prolong use. This is an easy product to use. Plus I like that it detangles the hair as you slide it through. The down side to this product is that it is no good for short bangs (like Betty Page bangs). I got a big fat burn on my forehead as a result of the open heated roller. Other then that on long hair it no problem. You achieve best result with heat protector spray for added shine than bare hair. And one more thing, it doesn&#x27;t do fancy tight curls - just loose flips.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for something better. Other stylers are much more expensive. I guess it is true,you get what you pay for. It works,but my hair still looks frizzy and not smooth.</li>
    <li> Just okay, I was looking for a product that curled hair, a revolving curling iron; and it wasn&#x27;t clear that this only straightens hair.</li>
    <li> I gave the PH styler to a friend with challenging hair.  It took her a little time to get the technique down, but she couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Her hair looks great and she is rather impressed.</li>
    <li> Honestly the Clebrity Styler is alright, if you&#x27;re white or have fine hair( meaning anytype asian, fine curly, spanish etc etc). If you do have fine hair i have noooo idea why you&#x27;d be using this. The Celbrity Styler Does shut off randomly, which makes it that much more frustrating to use.  I have lightly coarse hair, and the brush used on this product, no offense intended, is for \\&quot;white girls\\&quot;. Anyone with anytype of coarse hair it does nothing but grab and cling and get suck in ur hair after just having washed it. The InStyler how ever has those small mircobristle brushes, that pull all the hair in that given area and straighten them Beautifully.  Hoenstly this is just another Paris Hilton product intended for white tweens, teens, and young adults. If you have any type of black coarse or curly hair, I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS. GO WITH THE INSTYLER.  of course if you did have coarse hair you would already know to go with the mirco bristles lol, not the big sticky ones. Of course this product works great, if your hair has just been relaxed, or straightened with another product. But then What would be the point of owning this....</li>
    <li> This styler is good. Works best for thin hairs. Sometimes if hairs are not detangled properly, it stops in between, which is annoying. Overall I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Paris might be going for a younger audience with this product but I tell you, she should target the 40-60 age range too!  I have used both the Instyler and the Paris Hilton Styler and like this one much better.  Plus, the cost is less.  I have some arthritis and this really makes styling easy for me. Much quicker than using a conventional curling iron so I&#x27;m buying a second one to keep in my gym bag.  I have had no negative issues at all.</li>
    <li> It is always difficult to find a gift for my teen grandaughters. They are into the hair/make-up thing and when I saw this styler I bought it but was not sure if they would like it.  They loved it!!  I gave this to one of my grandaughters for her birthday and the other has already requested it for her birthday so I will be ordering another one. I am soooo glad that I was able to give a gift that was such a success!!!</li>
    <li> When I first saw the Instyler, I really wanted to use it for cutting down on my flat ironing time. But the Instyler was so expensive! So I saw the Celebrity Styler and ordered instantly. The first time I used it, I washed my hair with a shampoo and conditioner that detangled my hair( which you should always do before using the celebrity styler). Let me tell you, I am an African girl with long, thick, frizzy, relaxed hair. When I first used the Celebrity Styler, it worked wonders on my hair! I didn&#x27;t even have to use the Rotations on my hair to flip it in! After I was finished doing my hair, it was soft, shiny,non-frizzy, and bouncy. My hair looked beautiful! And when I ran my fingers through my hair, it never got stuck! Also, the Celebrity Styler is not cheaply made and I love the LCD screen to change the temperature. Also, I didn&#x27;t burn myself while I using it. It was pretty easy to use! I haven&#x27;t used the Instyler, but I fully recommend using the Celebrity Styler for relaxed hair!</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say that I can&#x27;t compare to the InStyler because I have never tried that tool.    Now, I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews about how well this would work.  It isn&#x27;t perfect, but aside from going to a stylist for a blow-out every week nothing is going to be.    I have tried this on both wet and dry hair.  It works well for both, however is far faster when hair is dry.  To go from wet, it was faster for me to dry it with a hairdryer first then use the styler.  My hair is fine, but I have a ton of it and it&#x27;s a couple of inches past my shoulders. It takes about 10 minutes to go from \\&quot;stuck my finger in an electric socket\\&quot; to straight and shiny when dry.      Some reviewers noted that the tool randomly turns off during use.  Initially this was a concern. After a few uses I figured out that it is not random but a safety feature.  Whenever the motor on the turning barrel shows ANY sort of resistance the machine automatically turns completely off.  Seems like an inconvience but I&#x27;d rather deal with that than having a 10\\&quot; long section of hair get stuck and fried.  The more you use the tool and learn how much hair you can do in a section, the less often it happens.  The manufacturer probably should have addressed this in the instruction manual, which is pathetic at best.</li>
    <li> I have used flatirons with not much luck for my partially wavy, thick hair and I saw an ad for the InStyler, but for over $100, it seemed a bit much and then I found the Celebrity Styler while browsing the Sally Beauty site. I don&#x27;t think they offer it on there anymore though. I have never used the InStyler so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how they compare side by side, but this works way better than any flatiron I&#x27;ve tried. It also makes my long and thick hair which is a little coarse shiny and smooth. The motor is a little loud, but that&#x27;s such a small complaint in comparison to the cost and value. It heats up pretty fast and whenever I&#x27;ve loaned it to a friend, they fallen in love with it too and wanted to buy their own.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2WXN9UUVOSQQ2]]2012 and my Paris Hilton is still awesome.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! It straightens my hair in barely 15 min. and my hair is fairly long and wavy. I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Hi, I had a Instyler for a year, until it broke. Not covered under warrant, of course. The Celebrity Styler does the same job for a 1/3 of the price. Plus it is not loud, heavy, and bulky. Plus you can set temp you want, not low, medium, and high.</li>
    <li> I own the real INSTYLER.  Love it.  My daughter found this one and asked me to get it for her for her birthday.  It does not heat properly.  Without good heat it is completely ineffective.  Buy the real thing, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> So this is basically a knock off of the instyler, that I don&#x27;t have a problem with. It has an on/off button, it heats up to 450F, and I like how the barrel rotates and brushes at the same time. Although this might be a great product for some, It&#x27;s not good for me. I have thick, poofy, coarse, wavy, frizzy hair and when I used this product it straightened my hair after a few times thru but it it was still poofy. I have medium/longish length hair and it DID NOT curl my hair well at all! It just left dents and kinks, not curls. I gave this product 3 stars because it would work well for someone with not as thick of hair as mine.</li>
    <li> It may be a good product, but in my busy lifestyle, there is no time to fight with it. I needed it for curling, and tried a few times. It&#x27;s very hard to curl the hair around the iron. Not the way, I expected it to be. The hair comes out not curled. It could be, I am not following directions, but I have no time to train myself, looking in the mirror, where everything is opposite. I think, it might work just fine, but you deffenetly need time to learn how to us it.</li>
    <li> I DID read reviews before purchasing and thought I&#x27;d try it despite only approximately 50% positive approval rate. There are several things I dont like about this product but in light of keeping this concise - the major problem is:  Like numerous of the other negative reviews mentioned, it stops working intermittently - within a few minutes of plugging it in and turning it on.  Obviously there is a defect in either just this unit I bought or most of them.  I wanted to return the product for a refund but read - only after I purchased the item - that it will cost AT LEAST $17 to return the item (NOT including shipping).  I didn&#x27;t know about that charge until after ordering and opening the package and reading the insert.  That is something that should be made more obvious to consumer BEFORE purchase.  It would have dissuaded me from ordering the unit.  I thought it would be easier to return it if I was displeased but it is not worth the cost and trouble.  Now I feel stuck with this item that does NOT do what it promises.  I feel taken advantage of.    p.s.  Although I USUALLY find Paris Hilton relatively attractive, the packaging looked more like it was for an adult &#x27;marital aid&#x27; product.  I was embarrassed for anyone to see the box for the Paris Hilton Instyler laying around while I was trying to figure out how to return it.</li>
    <li> I have tried both the Instyler and the Celebrity Styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pros &amp; cons of the Celebrity Styler, compared to the Instyler:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Insulated rubber-ish grip feels cooler and more comfortable in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;2) Wider range of adjustable temperature settings with LCD display.&lt;br /&gt;3) Less expensive than the Instyler.&lt;br /&gt;4) Celebrity Styler has a more sturdier build, and does not feel flimsy the way Instyler does.&lt;br /&gt;5) Quieter motor.&lt;br /&gt;6) Ability to turn the rotating feature on or off.&lt;br /&gt;7) Very cute pink/black design. :3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS (more like fixable cons):&lt;br /&gt;1) Turned itself off for seemingly no reason, but then found out that it only happens when either my hair is getting stuck, or if the iron is not heated up all the way. So, I just comb/brush my hair better before using, and wait until the iron is done heating up before using it. Also, if you are really having trouble with your hair getting stuck, you can turn the rotating feature off for a quick run through of your hair, then turn the rotating back on for a finishing polish.&lt;br /&gt;2) Similar to above, my hair was getting stuck. But, by brushing my hair better before using the iron, and taking smaller sections (about 1 inch), this isn&#x27;t a problem anymore!&lt;br /&gt;3) I thought maybe the iron wasn&#x27;t as hot as the Instyler... but it heats up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, so I must be delusional, because that&#x27;s hot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... all in all... the pros FAR outweigh the cons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I need to buy another rotating iron... I&#x27;m buying this one!</li>
    <li> I purchased this styler based on the comments of others and I am not disappointed.  It is certainly every bit as functional as the InStyler at 1.3 the price.    PROS:  Heats up quickly; has multiple heat settings; can turn roller on/off; leaves hair very shiny and soft feeling; I have naturally curly hair and this does the best job yet on straightening it    CONS:  A bit cumberson to use one-handed; I have naturally curly hair and this does NOT flip it up or under; when trying to make a curl it just sticks out from the head    Nothing is ever the perfect solution, but this comes very close!</li>
    <li> I have fought frizz for years, and it just kept getting worse, with blow drying and then flat ironing then hairspray and still having frizz! The whole process was causing more damage to my hair and making it more frizzy.  I had decided to just get my hair bobbed and start over. I got trapped in voice mail tag with my stylist, so I never got the appointment made.  And now I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t! The Celebrity Styler does so well that I can live with my hair now. Its been a long time since I&#x27;ve liked my hair!  I even let it be curly sometimes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Celebrity Styler. I ordered it on a Wednesday and received it three days later - very efficient!  I don&#x27;t find it flimsy at all. And it&#x27;s no more difficult to hold than the flat iron I used to use.  I retired that thing!  The Celebrity Styler makes my curly hair smooth and straight.  I&#x27;ve started just letting my hair air dry and then using the Celebrity Styler, so there&#x27;s less heat damage to my hair.  I tried it without the revolving and it worked well that way too, just not as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The User&#x27;s guide has tips on its use, like which way to hold it to flip ends up or under. Especially important is the tip about excessively styling the same section of hair for extended periods of time, which can damage your hair, so you should to keep the Celebrity Styler moving through your hair as you style, as you should be doing with any heated hair appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have curly hair that you want straight, or fizzy hair you want smooth (or both!), you need this revolving styler! At just under $35, including shipping, it&#x27;s a great value compared to the other over $100 revolving stylers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If putting her name on the Celebrity Styler to get it on the market so not wealthy people can afford it were the only constructive thing Paris Hilton had done, then I would personally appreciate it. But I know in addition to this she lends her name to charitable causes, too,  which is a worthwhile effort on her part, and therefore a redeeming quality.  I vote to give her a break from harsh judgments.art, and therefore a redeeming quality.  I vote to give her a break from harsh judgments.</li>
    <li> No problem with the order or delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item to replace my first PH styler when it died.  My first one was great, this one is just OK.  The main problem is that it frequently shuts off by itself for no apparent reason while in use.  I don&#x27;t think its getting too hot, I am using the same heat setting as the original one.  The original one just worked better.  This one does work, just not as well, so I&#x27;m using it until this one goes.  I will not be without one of these stylers, I am sold on it and the \\&quot;Instyler\\&quot; which I think was the original product.  I had admired a friend&#x27;s hair and she told me she used an Instyler.  These hair stylers have a rotating element -the rotator is the key.  It is so much better than just a flat iron - it actually curls the ends of the hair while it straightens it.  With a regular flatiron, you get those kinks in the hair.  Anyway, I looked high and low for a rotating styler in beauty supply stores, and Sephora, but they are just not easily available.  Don&#x27;t know why, because it is a great product.  Even my hair stylist was unaware of the product.  However, the Instyler is way expensive, and they make you buy 2 (online), so that&#x27;s like $200.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative and that that&#x27;s when I found the Paris Hilton styler online.  I was very pleased with it, worked great and lasted maybe 6-8 months. I guess that&#x27;s the shelf life of these products, especially if you use it every day.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this styler. I like the option to turn off the rotation function.  It does get really hot, but you can control the tempature. I have very coarse frizzy hair and feel that this does a pretty darn good job for straightning or adding curl. I purchased the Instyler from QVC last year, but ended up returning it. I really felt like it would damage my hair if I continued to use it, plus it was not worth 99.00.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the Instyler so I can&#x27;t compare.  I&#x27;ve had several Revlon, Remington &amp; Conair straighteners and curling irons though--which I&#x27;ll be using for comparison.    This product is definitely on the better end of straighteners that cost about $30 but it isn&#x27;t really much better than my Remington (wet 2 straight) one.  My hair is medium thickness and only wavy not fully curly.  I doubt this would work well for someone with very coarse thick or super curly hair.  I suspect the very very positive reviews are coming from people who have \\&quot;white\\&quot; hair that is fine, not very curly, and takes to straightening easily.    It doesn&#x27;t handle wet/damp hair as well as a traditional two-plate straightener but it does add the feature of being able to flip the hair in or out while straightening so you don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron after your hair is straight.    It&#x27;s not as loud as I was worried it would be, but it does make a little motor noise when spinning.  It doesn&#x27;t get any hotter than a regular straightener or do a better job than a decent store-brand straightener.  If the Instyler is generally better than store-bought straighteners then this one might not be as good as it is.    I&#x27;m pretty happy to have it in my arsenal of hair-taming implements, but I&#x27;m still seeking out the magic tool that will do everything I want.  It seems like spending $100 or more on a product is the only way to get something of that caliber.</li>
    <li> This is cheaply made but it does straighten the hair.  At first I had a hard time with the unit staying on and the barrel sounded like it was going to die.  After a couple of times I no longer had this problem.  It straightens better then my flat iron but seems more drying.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Celebrity Styler by Paris Hilton after trying my friend&#x27;s InStyler. I wanted to save money so I bought this version after reading reviews. I can honestly say after having used both the InStyler and The Celebrity Styler, I LOVE the Celebrity Styler! It works just as good, if not better, than the Instyler!! My hair feels smooth and soft and stays that way all day. I would highly recommend buying this version regardless of whether you want to save money or not. It was an excellent buy!!</li>
    <li> After reading so many reviews about this product, i thought it was time i went to Tjmax and bought one. I was so excited to use it, because i was thinking it will be making my life much easier beginning today. SOOOO Wrong!. well i can&#x27;t speak for all hair types, but I&#x27;m African/Arab and i have just a whole bunch of hair on my head. I used the celebrity styler it took forever to get my hair straight. i had to stop 1/4 way and go find my old straightener and just finish 3/4 of my head. because not only was the celebrity styler making my hair look like a giant fur ball, but actually making it more frizzy looking than what my blow dryer tried to accomplish. and i just recently found out that they do not sell this product at sally&#x27;s anymore,because they apparently do not do their job right and has been causing a whole lot of issues ( i couldn&#x27;t really get the Sally&#x27;s clerk to tell me what was specifically the cause of them removing the products off the counter).and I DEFINITELY SECOND in that.so i think it was just a waste of MONEY. this product only works for people with doll hair :(</li>
    <li> Ok omg I havent&#x60; bought this so yeah but I just wanted to say i am really going to buy this sometime 1 for me and my sister lol. she dosent&#x60; like Paris as much as I do and u dont really have to like her as a role model or anything just love her products and she will love u! Loves U paris! Kristen!</li>
    <li> Well, I ordered this because my old straightener was becoming a pain to work with. I have very very thick hair. Well, anyways, this straightener is crap, really. I mean, I ran the thing through my hair for 30 seconds straight trying to get my hair nice and straight, obviously.. Well, the thing shut off, after only 30 seconds. Well, I know some of you say that that is because it shuts off when your hair gets tangled. I have news for you, my hair wasn&#x27;t tangled, and I ran it for the same amount of time out of my hair, and it shut off just the same.    Now I just wanna blow it up, lol.    Also, the thing leaves your hair really frizzy and dry. I know it costs double, but seriously, just buy the instyler. It&#x27;s worth the extra money.    I&#x27;m back to using my trusty old Conair straightener now.</li>
