      <li>Thanks for carrying this product.</li>

      <li>This seems to work but has a slightly different scent than the original (I still had a little bit left).  </li>
      <li>You can easily buy 5 times the amount of vasoline at less than half the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fairly decent skin protector but definitely not worth the price.</li>
      <li>so you will have a little greasiness even depending on how much you use.</li>

<li> My mother used this when I was little (I am 64 now); this is the only thing I have found that makes my feet soft and keeps them from cracking!!</li>
<li> just keep dabbing some outside my nose to prevent chapping and dry skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help with my very very dry hands during the winter months.</li>
<li> This is an old product and hard to find in the stores.</li>
<li> It was just as she remembered it and worked as she had expected.</li>
<li> It makes a thin odorless gentle barrier that allows moisturizers applied BEFORE it to fully penetrate the skin without just evaporating.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that the tin container makes it tough to open after using the product several times.</li>
<li> This is a product that has been around for years, my father sold it when he was a little boy.  </li>
<li> I remember using this when I was a little girl</li>
<li> It has little to no smell.</li>
<li> Had underwear irritation and it cleared it up with a few applications of Cloverine Salve.  </li>
<li> Our medicine \\&quot;chest\\&quot; growing up had very few items but always included Cloverine Salve.  </li>
<li> We have used this product in the past but had a hard time finding it in stores or on line.</li>
<li> At least it comes in a small 1 ounce tin can.</li>
<li> So you don&#x27;t have to worry about an unpleasant odor while using this.</li>

    <li> Use this as a sealant to lock in the moisture from your facial moisturizer or hand creams.  It makes a thin odorless gentle barrier that allows moisturizers applied BEFORE it to fully penetrate the skin without just evaporating.  This locks moisture into the skin.  It can also lock moisture out of the skin.  My mother used this 60+ years ago to put onto baby bottoms to seal clean dry skin and prevent diaper rash.</li>
    <li> We used to use this product many years ago and found it on the website and decided to try it again and was pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> The product came as ordered &amp; in a very timely fashion.  The salve itself is something I had not tried before but since then I will definately re-order once my supply runs out.  It is very effective for a myriad of dry skin/chapped lip problems &amp; I would reccommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and I sold this stuff door to door when I was a kid. I didn&#x27;t know it was still made until I discovered it on Amazon.  This seems to work but has a slightly different scent than the original (I still had a little bit left).  I noticed it is no longer labeled &amp;#34;the original white cloverine salve&amp;#34; made in Cody, Wyoming so I&#x27;m not really sure it is exactly the same thing. Probably another example of a company buying a name and reputation instead of earning one!</li>
    <li> My mother used this when I was little (I am 64 now); this is the only thing I have found that makes my feet soft and keeps them from cracking!! I absolutely love it!  Thank you for supplying it to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this salve for over 50 years. Best thing for chapped lips or hands when applied before going to bed. Used to get it from a door to door salesman as a kid.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product. The Cloverine Salve arrived as described by the seller, and in a timely fashion. Furthermore, the Salve has a 101 uses which made it an extra fun purchase, as well as an economic one. My only complaint is that the tin container makes it tough to open after using the product several times.</li>
    <li> We have used this product in the past but had a hard time finding it in stores or on line. But after awhile I did find it on Amazon, Oh what a great product for rashes and small sores. This product I rate 10 plus stars</li>
    <li> I used this for my daughter when she was a baby for diaper rash (does not burn like zinc oxide!!) and I am gearing up for baby boy now. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I used to sell this product when I was a kid. It sold for a quarter a tin. Those days are gone forever but Cloverine still does the job!</li>
    <li> A great product that has been around for many, many years.  As a kid, we used to sell this product door-to-door in the 1940s.</li>
    <li> Our medicine \\&quot;chest\\&quot; growing up had very few items but always included Cloverine Salve.  My mother started using this product back in the &#x27;40&#x27;s and my sisters and I continue to keep a supply in our homes.  Very gentle and effective. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These items were purchased for my Aunt whose Mother used to use it for scrapes and scretches, chapped skine, etc. She hadn&#x27;t been able to find it in stores anymore. Thanks</li>
    <li> My Mom told me that she sold Cloverine Salve as a child to raise money to buy a sweater.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s in her 90s and was thrilled they were still in business when I gave her a tin.</li>
    <li> I have used Cloverine Salve since childhood and often get several containers to give as stocking stuffers for my family.</li>
    <li> So glad to find I was able to purchase this at Amazon.com. Use all the time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since childhood.  Now 50 years later it is more difficult to find locally so now I use the internet.</li>
    <li> We absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This is 97% white petroleum which is the same as vasoline. You can easily buy 5 times the amount of vasoline at less than half the price. It&#x27;s a fairly decent skin protector but definitely not worth the price. There should be a law requiring full disclosure of ingredients before you buy an item. Most of the time I have to search other websites to find a list of ingredients for many products sold here. I suggest people do their homework before buying. At least it comes in a small 1 ounce tin can. This makes it easy to take it with you when you leave home.</li>
    <li> Had underwear irritation and it cleared it up with a few applications of Cloverine Salve.  Great product.  I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> My mom is 97 and sold Cloverine salve when she was a young lady . It has been used in our family for many years. It has&lt;br /&gt;many uses. We love it!!</li>
    <li> This is a product that has been around for years, my father sold it when he was a little boy.  And that was 70 years ago,so it shows it is a product that kept its reputation, as being very good.</li>
    <li> I use this on my lips when they are chapped.  It works great and I think it smells great too.</li>
    <li> This reminds me of my youth. It is a good salve for chapped hands and the like. Still packaged in the metal can.</li>
    <li> 93-yr old mother-in-law wanted it, possibly because of nostalgia for old timey remedies.  she is using it and loves it.  got it right on time and for a better price than we had seen in another catalog.</li>
    <li> This is an old product and hard to find in the stores. So glad you have it. I ordered it for my mom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help with my very very dry hands during the winter months. It has little to no smell. So you don&#x27;t have to worry about an unpleasant odor while using this. It is a salve- so you will have a little greasiness even depending on how much you use. I am happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s helped with what I specifically bought it for.</li>
    <li> Great salve, hard to find.</li>
    <li> this is great salve , I think it cures everything</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this since I was a child. Used it on my children while they were growing up and now use it on my grandchildren.</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t for myself but for the woman I work for.  She uses it all day and before bed every night on her lips.  She also used it to really soften up a crusty brown age spot on her forehead.</li>
    <li> My mother used Cloverine Salve whenever she was a child.  It was just as she remembered it and worked as she had expected.</li>
    <li> I remember using this when I was a little girl and it still lives up to its expectations.  Thanks for carrying this product.</li>
    <li> After receiving the Cloverine salve, it brought back memories from my childhood. It came in the same style box and metal container that it came in 60 years ago. My grandmother kept it and Red Bud salve all the time to put on my scrapes. I will think of her when I use it.</li>
    <li> my dad was looking for this everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;So I was happy when I found it for him.&lt;br /&gt;He LOVES this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the exact same thing my mother used to use! It&#x27;s great and really works just as well as I remembered. The shipping was fast and it was well packaged. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I always buy this for my friend for Christmas. His mother always used it when he was young and it lights up his face and fills him with happy memories. He swears by it for everything from burns to chapped lips.</li>
    <li> Love the quality and multi-use. Looked like petroleum but much lighter when you use it. I use it a lot when I have colds, allergies and I just keep dabbing some outside my nose to prevent chapping and dry skin. Love the smell too.</li>
    <li> best salve around for sensitive skin and dry lips and stays on without having to reappy frequently. great in summer sun and winter harshness</li>
