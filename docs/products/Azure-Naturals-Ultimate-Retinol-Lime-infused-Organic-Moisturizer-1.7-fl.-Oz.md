      <li>Good moisturizer with a terrific scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream along with &amp;#34;CUCUMBER infused ULTIMATE PEPTIDE EYE BRIGHTENING Gel&amp;#34; and I can&#x27;t say that using this cream alone would be as good</li>

      <li>It absorbs into my skin quickly.  </li>
      <li>I like that this moisturizer absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
      <li>I could buy this on Amazon because most drugstore products don&#x27;t list their retinol %, and if they do, it&#x27;s not as high as 2.5%.  </li>
      <li>using the two together has greatly improved my dark bags under my eyes and I have noticed my acne problem seems to be clearing up</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works very well as I put it on my lips as they get very dry. My lips peel the next day to get rid of dead skin?</li>
    <li> Azure Naturals has yet another serum out that I have had the chance to review an exchange for my honest opinion. I must say I have tried multiple products by Azure Naturals and have yet to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one here is call the Ultimate Retinol Anti Wrinkle Serum which of course helps keep our youth. I have been using this for about two weeks now and have noticed a slight decrease in my fine lines by my eyes. My skin looks healthy and this did not cause any dryness or breakouts which I personally think is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a very tiny amount in the morning and before bed. It is easily absorbed into the skin and leaves the skin feeling clean with no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last me a long time I am sure and in time I am sure there will be even more results. Overall I am very happy with the outcome.</li>
    <li> Ive been using the Azure Naturals products for a few months now and i dont have a single complaint about any of them. They have all made my skin better than I could have ever imagined and dont have all the awful chemicals other brands do. They have amazing customer service and high quality products. I was product for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Retinol is one of my favorite skincare ingredients so I was more than a little excited when Azure Naturals sent me their new Ultimate Lime Infused Organic Retinol Moisturizer with 2.5% Retinol to test out and review for them.  Retinol is one of the most effective ingredients for fighting off fine lines &amp; wrinkles and it also works extremely well at improving hyperpigmentation, skin texture and it even increases skin hydration levels.  All that in one little ingredient and at 2.5% you don&#x27;t even need a prescription to enjoy the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;I like to use the Organic Retinol Moisturizer with 2.5% Retinol as part of my nightly skincare routine.  I apply it to my face, neck, decollete and I&#x27;ve even started to apply it to my shoulders to help get rid of some of the freckles I have accumulated from too much time in the sun!  The moisturizer is really lightweight and it absorbs really quickly into the skin.  I also like to use it with their Ultimate Retinol Anti Wrinkle Serum and double up on the treatment!</li>
    <li> The results I have gotten from this Retinol lotion is great. The light fragrance of lime is refreshing when using this moisturizer.  It comes with a great pump.  The moisturizer is light weight and smooth.  It absorbs into my skin quickly.  I use it in the morning and also after I wash my makeup off getting ready for bed.  I have not experienced any irritation and I apply it under my eye area as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say if it works or not as I read out fairly soon but I was using it on my arms too. I ordered another one.</li>
    <li> I ordered the full line - for morning I use the Vitamin C toner, Vitamin C serum and Vitamin C moisturizer, plus the cucumber eye. in the evening I use the Vitamin C toner, Retinol serum and Retinol moisturizer plus the cucumber eye. I also purchased the Vitamin C cleanser but I haven&#x27;t been using it yet as I finish up another cleanser. there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products. I can say after a couple of weeks there is NOTICEABLE difference in sun-related pigmentation/discoloration and a rough patch of skin that formed on my cheek a few months ago (and didn&#x27;t go away with any other skin products is now completely gone. I use a Clarisonic daily. there&#x27;s been no issue with irritation or dryness. My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully. My forehead lines appear to be smoothing out and my eye crinkles do as well. for the affordable price I am REALLY IMPRESSED. I will keep ordering.</li>
    <li> wonderful ingredients and notice a difference already...would order again...</li>
    <li> It smells good. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s as heavy of a moisturizer as I was looking for...</li>
    <li> Did not like made me break out cyst like pimples I wanted to like it but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out for me</li>
    <li> Just bought another and one for my daughter.  Really does what is says.</li>
    <li> Smells great and seems to work on lines and  texture. I would have given it 5 stars but I gave it four stars but the tube inside the bottle became disconnected from the top pump and it&#x27;s so thick I have not been able to fish the tube out.  I had to turn it over and shake out the product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer smells absolutely yummy! It feels amazing on my skin too. I use this moisturizer in the morning before I apply my make-up and I also use in in the evening after I cleanse my skin and apply my toner and serums. I like that this moisturizer absorbs quickly into my skin. Another plus is that this product is made of ingredients that are good for your skin. Retinol is great for anti-aging. I’m in my early 30’s and it’s time to start fighting those fine lines and wrinkles and getting a good beauty regime in place. This moisturizer has a very potent 2.5% retinol which is great for fighting those wrinkles. Sometimes when you use retinol at first you can experience redness. I have sensitive skin and didn’t really have any issues. I started out using once a day and did increase to twice a day just to be safe. Overall, I really like this moisturizer and all the benefits in the ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product, especially for the price.  You can&#x27;t find anything better!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin is combination skin, and I feel like it&#x27;s keeping me moisterized without feeling too oily or too dry.</li>
    <li> This really has made a difference in my skin! I&#x27;ll be buying more when this runs out!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream with a great scent and good moisturizing ability. It has everything you need without a heavy price tag. Same ingredients as other more expensive creams, not greasy, the only&lt;br /&gt;Issue is the pump bottle could be better and maybe a squeeze bottle might be best .</li>
    <li> pump didn&#x27;t work..It is ok but not great.</li>
    <li> Love this product..Organic, feels nice on skin.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels amazing going on, love the pump dispenser. I might be imagining things, but I can feel it working on my skin every time I apply. No weird reactions, breakouts, rashes or flakiness. My skin looks good so I *think* it&#x27;s working,</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t break out my acne prone skin and it&#x27;s super light :) I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference, by looking back at selfies that my wrinkles are less deep and less noticeable</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin</li>
    <li> It came with no seal. WTH???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks in combination with OZ Naturals Vitamin C 20% Anti Aging Serum after washing my face with Cetaphil and have finally found a skincare regimen that works! I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and the dark spots from old acne have faded considerably and are almost gone. My skin tone is evening out too, and my skin is not left feeling greasy or oily at all. I have combination skin and this does not dry my skin out at all. I use it in the morning and before bed every day. I absolutely love this product and will definitely be buying again and again.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer with a terrific scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream along with &amp;#34;CUCUMBER infused ULTIMATE PEPTIDE EYE BRIGHTENING Gel&amp;#34; and I can&#x27;t say that using this cream alone would be as good but I do know that I have noticed a big difference in my skin.. using the two together has greatly improved my dark bags under my eyes and I have noticed my acne problem seems to be clearing up and I have not had any more flare ups since using these 2 creams..</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my skin Soft and definately notice fine lines diminishing. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for repairing skin</li>
    <li> Feels great. Natural ingredients and my eye wrinkles are almost gone! I am almost 47 and my skin looks better than it did 7 years ago!</li>
    <li> I did not see any great improvement on my skin, the only benefit I noticed was that is reduced the size of my pores.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I will purchase this again when I need it.  Makes skin feel really nice and helps the skin look younger</li>
    <li> The sheer amount of goodness in this serum alone is enough to sell me on it!  Retinol is extremely helpful in restoring collagen and firming/toning your skin, and although I didn&#x27;t realize it lime is another great ingredient. I had no clue that lime could be used for so many purposes, many of them not even associated with your face but some of them are weight loss, improved digestion, relief from constipation, eye care, help with peptic ulcers, and respiratory disorders to name a few.  Skin care is just ONE of the many health benefits and I have seen a lot of skincare products but I have never come across one that included lime as an ingredient so this is a unique product.  You can always rest well knowing that Azure Naturals products are as natural and organic as possible and this serum is paraben free and plant based and their products are NEVER tested on animals.  This along with their 1 year money back guarantee puts them ahead of so many other brands on the market today.  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
    <li> Great product.  In Super happy with this  purchase.  I thought it only came with one but included two....THANKS!</li>
    <li> I just got this organic Moisturizer, and all I can say is FAB, I am going to have to reorder because, my husband is using the&lt;br /&gt;Ultimate Retinol also. Ultimate Retinol is the best, I have used.</li>
    <li> This goes on so light, and leaves my skin very soft!  I&#x27;ve used it about a week, and I can already tell such a difference in how smooth and silky my face feels.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Ordered two bottles and pumps do not work after a few squirts. I took the top off and did not see anything attached to the pump (like a straw). I dug around with a pair of tweezers to see if there was one that had fallen off, but did not find anything. Suggest seller put in glass jar to scoop out and get rid of this pump. Defective. No point in returning since others likely have same issue. Now I have to figure out how to get the lotion out and put it in my own jar. Ugh. As for product quality, I don&#x27;t know. The pump only worked for two days.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer daily for about a week.  But that is only because I have been working up to strong retinols slowly over a period of a year.  I would hesitate to dive right in with a powerhouse retinol like this if I didn&#x27;t have acclimated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging - it&#x27;s an airless pump which only shows a little stripe of product on the side (so you&#x27;ll know when you&#x27;re running out).  it protects the product from light and air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the lime scent, but it thankfully does not linger.  This moisturizer all-in-one product leaves my skin silky, without any tightness, drying, or flaking.  I like that I could buy this on Amazon because most drugstore products don&#x27;t list their retinol %, and if they do, it&#x27;s not as high as 2.5%.  Yet I&#x27;m not quite ready to go down the prescription route.  I&#x27;m 45 and use only BB cream (on top of SPF 30 lotion) most days.</li>
    <li> Good product good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for about a week now and to be honest at first I did not like it felt like it was to watery, but after a couple of days getting use to it I love this product a little bit goes a long way I put it on at night after I have clean my face and my skin is starting to look and feel better I&#x27;m almost 54 and I did not believe this product would work but it has proven me wrong</li>
    <li> I love the light scent of lime in this product. It is just the right amount of fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger but is very subtle. It is a smooth and light creamy moisturizer which glides on your skin and penetrates very quickly. My skin is loving this product and has given me a healthier glow so far! I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied!</li>
    <li> I have skin tags on my neck. I mix this with my really good moisture cream and it keeps the skin tags at bay. No one would guess that skin tags are a problem for me.</li>
    <li> This product has been a great moisturizer, but not my favorite of the Azure Naturals moisturizers that I have tried.  This moisturizer smells good (light smell) and leaves my face feeling moisturized and looking extremely healthy and hydrated.  Personally, I did not feel that this moisturizer was as light as the Vitamin C Orange Infused Organic Moisturizer and I felt that it left a slight residue on my face.  This residue quickly went away, but if I was to choose a moisturizer to use out of the two, it would definitely be the other one.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a month now. It does not leave a greasy feeling on the skin and smells heavenly to boot! (Of course, I&#x27;m partial to lime anyway...) I always worry when putting new products on my face if it will make me break out - I have not had that problem. My skin is clear and smooth. As far as the customer service goes...I emailed Azure Naturals about a defective pump and they PROMPTLY sent me a reply and new products as well. I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> Smells nice...waiting on results</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I see tremendous differences in my skin, but it is soft and I seems to be a bit smoother.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  I&#x27;ve tried MANY, MANY different retinol products and moisturizers and have been quite disappointed.  Not so with this Organic Retinol Moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly and you know it&#x27;s working by the ever so slight tingle you feel when first applied.  Leaves your face feeling incredibly soft.  Will definitely continue to purchase this retinol moisturizer and have ordered other Azure Naturals&#x27; facial care products.</li>
    <li> This product is the opposite of a moisturizer. I was skeptical to begin with, since most retinol products suggest a moisturizer in addition (the retinol almost always makes your skin sensitive).  But I decided to give this a try.  The consistency is nice and light, and the smell is very pleasant - not overpowering, just a hint of lime. I&#x27;ve been using the product on and off - maybe two days in a row, then take a couple days break, a day again, etc - for about two weeks now and I don&#x27;t think I will continue using it.  The areas of my face where I use it most (preventatively) are around my mouth and on my cheek up near my eyes/future wrinkle areas. I am 26 years old with moderate complexion and this never left my face feelign moisturized. Just the opposite. My face felt dry and I would layer a Neutrogena moisturizer on top of it. Morevoer, after a few days it left the texture of my face not just dry but with very small, lightly raised bumps and even a little acne (probably in response to the drying). Going on the shelf for once-in-a-while use!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It goes on smoothly and it keeps my face super hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of the Azure Naturals products! I love them all! Perfect for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> It seem to be working well, haven&#x27;t been using it that long.</li>
    <li> Been using Asure Naturals products for well over a year now, and while I know there&#x27;s no magic bullet, their products are quality and I am liking how they are on my skin, and I have had compliments about my skin too. Since I have used them daily, they must be contributing well to my skin care. I just recently added this product to my regimen. Liking it so far!</li>
    <li> Azure Naturals ULTIMATE LIME INFUSED ORGANIC RETINOL Moisturizer with 2.5% Retinol is one of the most amazing moisturizer I have ever had. Since my skin is super dry, It is very important to me that my skin care product left my skin hydrate and moisturized and this creamy moisturizer made it happened very nicely. Especially, my make up set very nicely on top of it which is matter to me. Plus, lately I noticed a bunch of fine lines around my eyes and also around my lips, which made me a little nervous, I just amazed with this moisturizer’s results within 3 weeks. It decreases my fine lines noticeably and helps the elasticity back to my skin. Left my skin hydrate and fresher than before.</li>
    <li> It comes as no surprise that me that more and more women are looking for ways to fight the signs of aging, some even before these signs start to show up. I&#x27;m only twenty years old but between working and attending college full-time, I have noticed that even I am beginning to exhibit some of these signs. I have always been told I have a baby face as my face is really round and, embarrassingly enough, kind of chubby. However, even with my &amp;#34;baby face&amp;#34; I have noticed my skin beginning to sag and even some wrinkles starting to form due to stress. Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You never want to look older than your actual age unless you are a teenager and even though I&#x27;m just barely out of the teenage years, I definitely don&#x27;t want to start looking older now. Living in Florida also takes it toll on the skin and sun damage can cause the skin to lose it&#x27;s elasticity and vibrancy. I have been using Azure Naturals Ultimate Retinol Lime Infused Organic Moisturizer to help stop the signs of aging in their tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retinol in this moisturizer is a small molecular composition which allows it to penetrate the skin quickly. Retinol works to help stimulate collagen and elastin growth. This, in turn, tightens and tones the skin to give it a more youthful appearance. This moisturizer contains 2.5% retinol which is very high strength and it can be applied around the eye area without causing irritation, it can also be used by people have sensitive skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer has a very fine texture and consistency. It isn&#x27;t too thick which I have found to be an&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;issue with some other moisturizers. Since it is a good mixture between light and thick it doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface of the skin but rather it absorbs quickly. I have had some issues with other moisturizers in the past that made my skin look oily and left behind a really greasy residue but that has not been the case with Azure Naturals. It is so light and gentle that is absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated without leaving it looking oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am still in my twenties, this is a great start to help combat fine lines and wrinkles before they even start. I apply my moisturizer every other day and it only takes a small pump to cover the entire desired surface area. I have noticed my skin look and feels more hydrated and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is hoping to decrease the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and even those who are hoping to combat them even before they start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review. However, I only recommend products I personally use.eaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated without leaving it looking oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am still in my twenties, this is a great start to help combat fine lines and wrinkles before they even start.
