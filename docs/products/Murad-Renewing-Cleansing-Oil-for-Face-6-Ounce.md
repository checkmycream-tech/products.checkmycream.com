      <li>It feels good massaging it in.  </li>
      <li>but this product feels very clean and very good.  </li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
      <li>This cleansing oil is ok.  </li>
      <li>Love all of the Murad products.  </li>
      <li>I have used a lot of cleansers and if you use them most of them will work</li>
      <li>Love, yet wish it would remove eye make-up better.</li>
      <li>At first I didnt think it was a good idea to wash my face with an oil based product.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the first projects I&#x27;ve had that I don&#x27;t forget to use because it makes my skin feel really good.</li>
      <li>This oil is awesome, melts the makeup, helps prevent dry skin.</li>
      <li>I love that I can clean my face and remove my makeup all in one sweep.</li>
      <li>Removes make up easily and thoroughly.</li>
      <li>It has also helped with fine lines</li>
      <li>cleanse method&amp;#34; when I have makeup on but use this product alone on a makeup free face.</li>
      <li>This product leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>I was introduced to this particular product by my esthetician and it really works great.  </li>
      <li>This product may be good, but I won&#x27;t find out as it has a super old (almost rancid) smell.</li>
      <li>Besides the fact it dosen&#x27;t have a great smell, it really dosen&#x27;t remove all the foundation ( a mineral brush on type) or the residue of the mascara ,as you can see the ghost of the make-up on my white pillowcases.</li>
      <li>Has greatly helped my adult acne and leaves my skin soft</li>
      <li>I bought it on Amazon because of the size available and the great price compared to the price of the small container at the salon I use.  </li>
      <li>I think  the key is to really massage it into your face and rinse with lots of really warm water.</li>
      <li>whats nice is that it rinses clean and doesnt leave oil slick on your face.</li>
      <li>It leaves my face soft and clean.</li>
      <li>you have to use quite a bit though to really get all of your makeup off or use it twice, first on eye makeup then all over.</li>
      <li>This all-in-one cleanser is gentle for eyes, face and lips.</li>
      <li>but I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It takes makeup off at the end of the day really well if I wipe around my eyes with a towel after rinsing.</li>
      <li>Frankly, it worked no better,or no worse than the $7 drugstore product.</li>
      <li>Fantastic facial cleanser!</li>
      <li>I tried DHC cleansing oil about a year ago and it dried my face out so much that I was hesitant to try another kind until now.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It has helped tremendously with dry spots &amp; discoloration.  </li>
      <li>the reason was i have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but it left my dry skin very clean and soft.</li>
      <li>It happens to be a bit thick and not as fluid as I wanted for easily spreading and massaging onto the face.</li>
      <li>The product itself works well, however, after a couple of weeks of use, the internal stopper suddenly dropped out and luckily I had it over the sink, as half the product poured out.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to people who have dry to very dry skin like myself.</li>
      <li>My skin is 59 yrs old and normal, not oily or dry, but this slight coat of oil makes it look and feel like there is moisture.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil is awesome, melts the makeup, helps prevent dry skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended as an eye make-up remover.  Removes make up easily and thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an oil cleanser but I&#x27;m loving this. It leaves my face soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Finally.  I can wash my face in the winter without my skin drying up and flaking.  I&#x27;ve been really happy using this and it has not caused any blemishes like I worried about with using an oil to cleanse.  It takes makeup off at the end of the day really well if I wipe around my eyes with a towel after rinsing.</li>
    <li> Love this! Just one step to remove makeup and wash your face!</li>
    <li> Love, yet wish it would remove eye make-up better.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this was not as I expected. It happens to be a bit thick and not as fluid as I wanted for easily spreading and massaging onto the face. I like its ingredients. Also packaging would improve by having a pump. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product may be good, but I won&#x27;t find out as it has a super old (almost rancid) smell. I will prob continue to use the cleansing oil from DHC.</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s for everyone but I really like it.  I use it to remove mascara, then apply a 2nd time all over my face.  It feels good massaging it in.  Then rinsing cleans it off but still feels like your face is moisturized.  My skin is 59 yrs old and normal, not oily or dry, but this slight coat of oil makes it look and feel like there is moisture.  I would use the term dewy but at 59 I don&#x27;t think dewy fits!!  I think  the key is to really massage it into your face and rinse with lots of really warm water.</li>
    <li> This cleansing oil is ok.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell but it left my dry skin very clean and soft.</li>
    <li> whats nice is that it rinses clean and doesnt leave oil slick on your face. you have to use quite a bit though to really get all of your makeup off or use it twice, first on eye makeup then all over.</li>
    <li> Love all of the Murad products.  Great Skincare.</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  Has greatly helped my adult acne and leaves my skin soft</li>
    <li> I have been using the renewing cleansing cream and wanted to try the oil. the reason was i have very sensitive skin.I needed something to remove my eye makeup. this works so good, so very happy with this product, it even cleanses your hole face. I to think you to should try it.</li>
    <li> Solution is too heavy and not even cleansing work.</li>
    <li> I have bought the entire anti aging system.  It has helped tremendously with dry spots &amp; discoloration.  It has also helped with fine lines</li>
    <li> At first I didnt think it was a good idea to wash my face with an oil based product.  I was so wrong.  This product leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.  Removes makeup great also without any rubbing</li>
    <li> The product itself works well, however, after a couple of weeks of use, the internal stopper suddenly dropped out and luckily I had it over the sink, as half the product poured out. So - buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I never thought of using an oil cleanser...seemed contradictory.  I was introduced to this particular product by my esthetician and it really works great.  I bought it on Amazon because of the size available and the great price compared to the price of the small container at the salon I use.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product actually works the way it should. I tried DHC cleansing oil about a year ago and it dried my face out so much that I was hesitant to try another kind until now. This Murad&#x27;s brand cleanses the face but doesn&#x27;t dry it out. It is weird using a cleanser on a dry face but it works. I do a &amp;#34;double cleanse method&amp;#34; when I have makeup on but use this product alone on a makeup free face. I would absolutely recommend this product to people who have dry to very dry skin like myself.</li>
    <li> I had been using another cleansing oil, then I saw this and figured I&#x27;d treat myself,as Murad has a great reputation . I use Neutrogena oil-free eye make-up remover( I don&#x27;t use waterproof mascara) and the Neutrogena wipes in the blue package before I use the oil. Besides the fact it dosen&#x27;t have a great smell, it really dosen&#x27;t remove all the foundation ( a mineral brush on type) or the residue of the mascara ,as you can see the ghost of the make-up on my white pillowcases. Frankly, it worked no better,or no worse than the $7 drugstore product.I&#x27;ll save the $25 difference in price from now on.</li>
    <li> Fantastic facial cleanser! This all-in-one cleanser is gentle for eyes, face and lips. Since using this product, my occasional breakouts are not so occasional anymore. Can&#x27;t remember the last time I had one! I love that I can clean my face and remove my makeup all in one sweep.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of cleansers and if you use them most of them will work but this product feels very clean and very good.  This is one of the first projects I&#x27;ve had that I don&#x27;t forget to use because it makes my skin feel really good.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and she loves it !</li>
