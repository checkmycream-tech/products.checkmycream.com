      <li>Good product and good service!</li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to know that Amazon stills carries it!</li>
      <li>the price was also a good buy and postage was good as well...</li>
      <li>One good thing is that it softened my cuticles and softened my skin...</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>This stuff smells amazing, but does leave an oily after-math.  </li>
      <li>I normally like Sally Hansen products, but this one is not their best.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Massage it into hands and nails, and wake up to more even toned, tighter skin on the hands.  </li>
      <li>I love this Serum.</li>
      <li>-I am sure one has to use it for a month or so before that will work.</li>
      <li>I love a hand oil myself, but I know some people do not like oils.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this besides oil, but it&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
      <li>I use this serum a couple nights a week on the top of my hands and it is softening them.</li>
      <li>i am going to love too</li>
      <li>The shipping was very quick.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, when I first started using it</li>
      <li>I also used it on my feet at night, and they are spa smooth today.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s oily but it absorbs quickly, not to crazy about the smell, but love how it works.</li>
      <li>Have since been using regular olive oil and with time I&#x27;m sure it will be more effective.</li>
      <li>There is no doubt that this new product I am going to use, for sure I am going to love too.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe the huge difference this made in my hands -- right away!</li>

      <li>Smell good and my hands are starting to look better daily</li>
      <li>*smile*</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quite nice to use just before bed especially on cracked cuticles.</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>My skin absorbs it pretty quick, no oil residue.</li>
      <li>Any other recommendations for a good hand firming cream?</li>
      <li>The packaging this product came in looked like it was dragged thru a war, but it&#x27;s the inside that counts, right?</li>
      <li>If only it smelled better...</li>
      <li>My hands are much smoother and the wrinkles are virtually GONE!</li>
      <li>The only drawback is the smell, but I pair it with my favorite lotion and that takes care of the smell.</li>
      <li>I went back and purchased more for my sister and me.</li>
      <li>First the scent</li>
      <li>Leaves my hands soft and moist every time...smells like rose oil, nothing different than what you smell at a spa.</li>
      <li>No dramatic effects here.  </li>
      <li>Its also very oily.</li>
      <li>It really adds a moisture to your skin that absorbs.  </li>
      <li>Starting helping right away!</li>
      <li>There are less brown spots and the skin looks more radiant where I apply the serum.</li>
      <li>smells old and leaves hands very oily</li>
      <li>- it is a bit odd and way too strong for my taste.  </li>
      <li>I began dabbing a little under my eyes and saw reductions in fine lines within 2 days.  </li>
      <li>a scent of roses and geranium and even one application at night makes a major difference by morning!  </li>
      <li>It can be a little oily, but worth the outcome.</li>
      <li>I got this to help my dry and old looking hands and it works really well, it helps to stop them from drying out and gettng that dry and wrinkled looking,  </li>
      <li>Well today, I noticed the skin on my hands are less saggy skin, and very silky.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this because my hand were getting really dry and looking old, I use this before I go to bed.  </li>

    <li> smells old and leaves hands very oily</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the huge difference this made in my hands -- right away! Sadly, it would appear that this item has been discontinued. How very sad. A person can&#x27;t help but wonder why a product that does what this does would get discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love this Serum. I went back and purchased more for my sister and me. The only drawback is the smell, but I pair it with my favorite lotion and that takes care of the smell. That&#x27;s a small complaint for a product that works so well. My hands are much smoother and the wrinkles are virtually GONE!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this a 5 star yet as haven&#x27;t had it long enough. I will say I only use it in evening before bed as is greasy and not good for full time use. It does soak in however. I do have brown spots which others claim it does away with-I am sure one has to use it for a month or so before that will work. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this besides oil, but it&#x27;s fabulous!  I picked up a bottle for $2 on a whim, not expecting anything beyond easing of some dryness.  I immediately saw a temporary reduction in crepiness on the backs of my hands and, over the next few days, the effect began to last longer.  I began dabbing a little under my eyes and saw reductions in fine lines within 2 days.  Of course now that I&#x27;ve found this they&#x27;re discontinuing it, but I&#x27;m stocking up before it&#x27;s gone!</li>
    <li> Starting helping right away!</li>
    <li> I use this serum a couple nights a week on the top of my hands and it is softening them. The smell reminds me of rosary water (being the recovering catholic that I am!). One of the reasons I&#x27;m using it at night. Its also very oily. The packaging this product came in looked like it was dragged thru a war, but it&#x27;s the inside that counts, right?</li>
    <li> I normally like Sally Hansen products, but this one is not their best.  First the scent - it is a bit odd and way too strong for my taste.  It is also too oily to wear during the day - you&#x27;ll leave oily handprints everywhere.  However, would probably work well at night with moisture gloves.  If only it smelled better... So I guess I&#x27;ll use it but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you use it every day....multiple times it seems to help  I would recommend Smith&#x27;s Minted Rosebud Salve for a quick plump up.</li>
    <li> have not used package very soiled, and had leakage on package, sorry</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen is (I believe) in the process of discontinuing this product.  This is one of the best hand products I have ever used.  It is an oil, with a scent of roses and geranium and even one application at night makes a major difference by morning!  Massage it into hands and nails, and wake up to more even toned, tighter skin on the hands.  The new Sally Hansen products are not nearly as good as this one!  I love a hand oil myself, but I know some people do not like oils.  It is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> No dramatic effects here.  Save your money</li>
    <li> Pricing is about $7 and totally not worth it. Have since been using regular olive oil and with time I&#x27;m sure it will be more effective.</li>
    <li> Works great for my very dry hands. I see the difference already.</li>
    <li> I got this to help my dry and old looking hands and it works really well, it helps to stop them from drying out and gettng that dry and wrinkled looking,  the price was also a good buy and postage was good as well...</li>
    <li> Makes my hands feel and look better, but, the smell is awful.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing, but does leave an oily after-math.  It does improve the appearance and texture immediately upon use, but it can&#x27;t be used during the day because anything you touch for the next hour will have oily fingerprints....no matter how sparingly I try to apply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do continue to use it at night on fingertips and toes, then wear socks.  I&#x27;ve read it&#x27;s been discontinued which is disappointing.....it&#x27;s quite nice to use just before bed especially on cracked cuticles.</li>
    <li> This serum has made my hands look younger in just a couple of weeks of use.  There are less brown spots and the skin looks more radiant where I apply the serum. I put a few drops on the back of each hand at night.  It works!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Leaves my hands soft and moist every time...smells like rose oil, nothing different than what you smell at a spa. My skin absorbs it pretty quick, no oil residue. I&#x27;m thrilled to know that Amazon stills carries it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my hand were getting really dry and looking old, I use this before I go to bed.  It&#x27;s oily but it absorbs quickly, not to crazy about the smell, but love how it works.</li>
    <li> I got this product a week ago.  The shipping was very quick.  I&#x27;ll be honest, when I first started using it, I was very disappointed.  It just felt like oil,but I thought I would give it a week.  Well today, I noticed the skin on my hands are less saggy skin, and very silky.  I also used it on my feet at night, and they are spa smooth today.</li>
    <li> Good product and good service!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It definitely makes my hands less crepey. As for brown spots? Dunno.  Maybe.  I have another product that helps with that but I believe this serum also contributes.</li>
    <li> There is not doubt that this new product , i am going  to use, for sure i am going to love too</li>
    <li> definitely notice a difference even after just one week of using it.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I have not seen a difference. Has a weird smell. The oiliness does go away but you have to be careful until it does or you&#x27;ll get it everywhere. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It really adds a moisture to your skin that absorbs.  It can be a little oily, but worth the outcome.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt that this new product I am going to use, for sure I am going to love too.</li>
    <li> Smell good and my hands are starting to look better daily</li>
    <li> Will never buy it again</li>
    <li> I use it every night.  It is an oil rather than a lotion or something similar that I expected.  I do see some minor difference - my hands have less wrinkles.  I think you have to use it for a very long time to see the effect.&lt;br /&gt;It has some smell to it but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used the product for a few weeks and saw no marked improvement in my skin&#x27;s firmness. My hands are probably the one thing on my body that looks my age (52) *smile* and I wanted to roll back the clock a bit. The serum is oily and I had to keep it in a zip lock back when I carried it in my purse. One good thing is that it softened my cuticles and softened my skin...but that&#x27;s about it. For the price, it wasn&#x27;t a total bust. Any other recommendations for a good hand firming cream?</li>
