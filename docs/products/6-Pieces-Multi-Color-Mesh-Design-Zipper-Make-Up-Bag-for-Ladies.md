      <li>I took the goofy clips off, cumbersome and not needed.</li>
      <li>Quality is just OK</li>
      <li>Okay, these aren&#x27;t made with the utmost attention to detail or high-end materials, but I LOVE them.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>but I won&#x27;t be able to use them for the purpose I bought them.</li>
      <li>I would return them but it would cost more to do it than the pouches themselves.</li>
      <li>Kind of cheap looking.  </li>
      <li>Love you can see through the mesh to contents</li>
      <li>I love the size and the fact that you can see the content.  </li>
      <li>At the price of most organizer bags of this size and type these are really phenomenal.</li>
      <li>I probably should have looked at the measurements better.</li>
      <li>I will probably order a couple more.</li>
      <li>These are made ok, more promotional quality.</li>
      <li>The colors are vivid and very pretty; I can see the contents; the size is perfect.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE the translucency because it helps me to locate the appropriate make-up in my purse quickly.</li>
      <li>Cute and fun!</li>
      <li>I use them myself for easy organization and handbag changes.</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to see what&#x27;s inside.</li>
      <li>They make it so easy to see what&#x27;s insside.</li>
      <li>I sort purse items in them (make-up,electronics, emergency, etc) and it&#x27;s easy to grab the one I need.</li>
      <li>The fact that you can see through them makes it easy to identify the contents.</li>
      <li>Easy to keep things organized in my purse and vehicle.</li>
      <li>they would be fine.</li>
      <li>and they were less then impressive quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These mesh bags are so cheaply made lol. The zipper won&#x27;t close fully, they look and feel cheap, the mesh is coming out.</li>
    <li> If your the only one looking at these bags and they sit in a drawer not being used daily they would be fine. They are a great price so I was not shocked when I received them and they were less then impressive quality. I&#x27;m only down rating because I think the customer photos made me believe they were something more and they were not that. Very stiff plastic while being flimsy at the same time, one of the pleather boarders was coming un sewn upon opening. Just know they are a cheap cost because well... they are cheap.</li>
    <li> I really like the product. It made it easy to pack my 3rd mascaras and business  cards up and have them ready to hand out to customers. They loved the free gift.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my purse and can see what&#x27;s in them/  Love them!</li>
    <li> Liked these so much I ordered a second set.&lt;br /&gt;I used my first set for make-up and was able to fit my entire large collection into one set. For reference, I fit 14 lipsticks into one and 5 mascaras + 7 eyeliners into another. I use my second set for electronics, buttons, bra straps etc.&lt;br /&gt;Both my sets are as sturdy as anything you would find in a grocery store and a great value for $8. The colors are very pretty and make color-coding easy. I will probably order a couple more.</li>
    <li> These bags were a great price. I love the size and the fact that you can see the content.  I bought several sets kept one set and gave the rest as&lt;br /&gt; gifts. Everyone is happy with them. I use them myself for easy organization and handbag changes. The black edge is heavy plastic or vinyl. Not what I expected. I will see how they last. So far they are fine, but seem as though they could be brittle with age.  I would just prefer if the black edge were a more flexible medium.</li>
    <li> I wish these were a little longer.  Also, I wish they didn&#x27;t come with the handles.</li>
    <li> I ordered too late for Christmas, but I will use them another time.  For the price, I have no complaint.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price!</li>
    <li> These are just the right size for storing away loose items in my messenger bag for travel overseas. I like the different colors- I use red for first aid stuff, purple for laptop cables, yellow for international plugs, blue for medicine, etc. The mesh is light and see through, so you can know what&#x27;s inside. The size is just right. I took the goofy clips off, cumbersome and not needed.</li>
    <li> These are great for party favors! Just the right size and are true to the colors shown. I only had one out of 30 that had a messed up zipper.</li>
    <li> These bags are not terribly high quality, but I still really like them. They hold a fair amount of things, and the color coding makes it easy to find what I am looking for without searching all over a bag. I have purchased more than one set of these, as they have so many great uses. Right now I am using a set in my purse to sort my things out, but have another set in the drawer at home holding different cords and plugs for different devices. Thanks for this great and inexpensive product!</li>
    <li> Awesome inexpensive answer for purse organization!</li>
    <li> Great quality terrific price!  I&#x27;d order again!  I did cut the wrist straps off of some of them just because I didn&#x27;t need it on - simple!  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Looks good for the price</li>
    <li> These bags are cute and appear as described but I won&#x27;t be able to use them for the purpose I bought them. I was hoping to put my travel size shampoo/conditioner/face wash in a bag to take into the shower at the gym. The bags are too short for that. I could fit 2 travel bottles horizontally in one bag, but I wanted to put them in vertically and fit 4 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find other uses for them, but I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking for a mesh shower bag.</li>
    <li> Meh, made of thin mesh and sewn poorly.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  I like the colors but seem a little flimsy.</li>
    <li> cheaply made, but so far have not ripped or broken. they don&#x27;t zip as tightly as I would like and the loop is pretty useless, but all in all fine</li>
    <li> absolutely love these, so much so that i bought a second set. the handle straps are very cheap &amp; flimsy but i didn&#x27;t buy them for that. the mesh is nice &amp; stiff so they hold their shape well. i use them to organize my purse, backpack, beach bag....just to name a few. love the colors too</li>
    <li> Convenient. Easy to keep things organized in my purse and vehicle. I only wish they came in multiple sizes.</li>
    <li> So cheap. Not even worth returning.</li>
    <li> Fun to use for organizing small items!  We use for keeping track of gift cards, hair clips, cosmetics, etc.</li>
    <li> Since the styles are very different I can&#x27;t speak for the other styles, but style 1 - the set of 6 multicolors - is quite nice. I&#x27;m not a fan of the straps they put on - they feel like flimsy, weird pseudo-plastic - so I took them off and put my own lanyard on the clips. The bags seem to be of sound construction and don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;ll fall apart too soon; add that to the fact that one bag holds 11 Prismacolor markers, and they are exactly what I needed. There are a few frayed edges and again, I&#x27;m not a fan of the straps - so 4 stars.</li>
    <li> These are great for so many things</li>
    <li> The quality isn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, and unfortunately I can&#x27;t return them.</li>
    <li> The colors are very bright. They do hold enough for what I needed them for.</li>
    <li> Great buy! It was shipped timely and I actually liked the product better in person!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much...but these are nice littla extras to gift with any small item as an added gift.  Handy too.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought... I planned to use two of these in my purse - one for foundation and eye makeup and a second one for lipstick and lip glosses.  I actually had to end up using three due to the size ( one for lip products, one for eye products, and one for foundation/brushes/concealer/setting powder).  With that being said, the bags seem durable so far. ..and I LOVE the translucency because it helps me to locate the appropriate make-up in my purse quickly. I also like that there is NO plastic over/undercoat  (which could rip and cause additional inconvenience as I have experienced with other make-up bags).</li>
    <li> Quality is just OK and they are a bit flimsy. I ended up giving them to my niece.</li>
    <li> Okay, these aren&#x27;t made with the utmost attention to detail or high-end materials, but I LOVE them. I use them to collect and organize all the accoutrements for my knitting-- measuring tapes, stitch holders, needle caps, seaming needles, scissors, stitch markers, crochet hook, etc., etc. and they work great. I can carry everything I might need to use for a project in one tote, sorted in these zipper bags. The colors make it easy to identify the tool or accessory I&#x27;m looking for, and the mesh seems to be sturdy enough. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Good quality and great price! These are great little cosmetic or small item bags. Love you can see through the mesh to contents and I think these will be great for keeping small items together in my suitcase on trips. I already filled one with bandaids, neosporin, alcohol swabs, and butterfly closures as a first aid kit, and had room for individual  packages of aspirin, aleve, some stomach medicines, and a small  bottle of dramamine and a small bottle of benadryl. Will use one for jewelry, and one for power cords for my phone and kindle. These ae also big enough to serve as pen/pencil bags for school.</li>
    <li> These are really tiny. I probably should have looked at the measurements better. They&#x27;re alright quality what you&#x27;d expect for the price, but haven&#x27;t found anything to use them for yet since they&#x27;re so small...</li>
    <li> Nice small zipper pouches, worked well for plan.</li>
    <li> These are made ok, more promotional quality. I don;t think they&#x27;d stand up to daily use. But for the price or a goodie bag, the are good. It took a long time to receive these.</li>
    <li> The mesh in these bags is not as soft as some I have had but because of that they are a little more functional and probably more durable.  I use them for a number of thiings, inclluding carrying some of my art supplies.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for but suited what I needed them for! Little flimsy but for price ok!</li>
    <li> Zippers not strong enough....,they break easily.</li>
    <li> This bags turned out to be smaller than I expected however they have come in handy for keeping small items together in my handbag and in my nightstand.  I would definitely purchase them again....and I just might.</li>
    <li> Not sturdy as the four piece set.</li>
    <li> I purchased these zippered bags for when I travel.  Red has first aid supplies, blue has cleansing wipes, yellow has medication, etc.  They are made well enough for the price --- not the sturdiest, but good for the price.</li>
    <li> Value price is good.  Quality is not outstanding, but is what you would expect for the price. A step above Dollar Store quality.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Unfortunately much smaller than what it looks like. You can fit small feminine products and travel size items only. Wish they were bigger.</li>
    <li> They seem ok, but they are smaller than I thought they would be. The quality is fair not great. We shall see how long they last.</li>
    <li> I use these bags to organize my make-up, hair access shenanigans. The mesh is small enough to store hairpins but keeps the make-up dusts out. You can see clearly what&#x27;s inside. I removed the straps immediately since I use these as storages.</li>
    <li> These mesh pouches a kind of on the small side. In fact they are a lot smaller than I wanted them to be. I  am not sure how I will end up using them. I would return them but it would cost more to do it than the pouches themselves. They are fair quality. The zippers on some of them are not very good and the stitching is not very straight. This is not to say that they are not usable. I am just a little disappointed</li>
    <li> Sturdy and holds plenty of items without taking much room.  Use to hold computer items in briefcase and items in purse.</li>
    <li> These bags are very pretty and I hope to use them in my purse so I can see what it is I am carrying. The 4 stars instead of 5 stars is for the feeling that they might not wear well. I will have to see how rugged they are.</li>
    <li> I needed these for storage of things like memory stick, some smaller cords, Fitbit chargers and the like.&lt;br /&gt;These items were in a drawer and I wanted to segregate them and keep them contained.&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for that.  I can see through them; they are not rigid so the odd shapes are not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;But this is a static area where they are not going to be jostled about.  I don&#x27;t know that the zippers can take much jostling.&lt;br /&gt;But for my desired use of them, they are pretty perfect.  I like the  colors.  They came quickly and were packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I don&#x27;t know that I would use them for anything that I would travel around with or be opening the zipper a lot.</li>
    <li> Cheap feel, cheap looking. Not happy. One bag arrived with the seam coming apart. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;Will use for travel - keeping tech stuff separated.&lt;br /&gt;different colors for different types of stuff&lt;br /&gt;Equivalent is a lot more expensive at Container Store.</li>
    <li> These little bags are sooooo convenient!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two packages. They are good to&lt;br /&gt;use in purses &amp; for travel.</li>
    <li> Great little mesh bags.Love the different colors and that you can see through them to see what&#x27;s in them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected but worked out for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> God these to organize the stuff in my purse and it has been great.  No more rooting around for a set of keys.  All of my keys, garage door opener and mailbox key are in one pouch.  Beauty products in another, spare change in the 3rd, you get the idea.  They are very handy and are good quality.</li>
    <li> Workmanship is good.  Delivery was fast.  I have used them for about 6 months in my purse, and they have held up just fine.  One I use for coins and cash, One is for gift/club/reward cards, One is for cell phone charger and cell phone doo-dads.  They feel like a plastic screen mesh, kinda like a screendoor.  I love the little color they have.  I would order these again.</li>
    <li> Super cute mesh bags. A bit small, but reasonable. Bought as part of a gift, but I may buy again for myself.</li>
    <li> Very useful for holding chargers, meds, or any other small items in a purse or suitcase.  I like that they are different colors to make finding the item easier.</li>
    <li> Love how they mesh lets wet items/drying items (like a toothbrush) air dry when traveling.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> use these all the time... love them... am super organized now!!</li>
    <li> small for a makeup bag</li>
    <li> I use it to organize the diaper bag.  Great deal</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and small</li>
    <li> Received in two days. These are exactly what I needed and I like the colors. However the material of the strap is cheaply made but the good thing is you can detach it.</li>
    <li> The seams are a little weak. I used these bags daily. I was bummed to find that one of them had some open.</li>
    <li> Kind of cheap looking.  Tabs came off after a couple of uses. Was hardly worth returning.</li>
    <li> Love these! They keep me organized and it&#x27;s easy to see what&#x27;s inside.</li>
    <li> Great little bags for travel or for your purse.  Best part is that they are color coded and you can see what&#x27;s inside each bag.</li>
    <li> I used one of these for my makeup.  There is a gap where the zipper closes and sometimes an eyeliner pencil or something of that type size will fall out.  The bag tore after a few months.  The black edge where the zipper is is made of plastic and looks (and feels) cheap.  Well, they were cheap, so you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Cheap made, handle is sad, would not order again.</li>
    <li> I use these to organize my purse. The fact that you can see through them makes it easy to identify the contents. Great price for a product that does its job.</li>
    <li> The price was right and the bags seem fine, but it took 5WEEKS to get here.  Just make sure you know that before you order!</li>
    <li> Great value.  They work well so far but not sure how long they&#x27;ll last.</li>
    <li> I got these to help organize all the small stuff for my phone, tablets, etc on the go and they are just great!  The see through mesh makes it easy to know what is in each bag, the different colors help to organize by color (cables in blue, earbuds in red, styluses in orange, etc) and they keep all that little clutter neat and well under control.  Even the little wrist straps help and actually fit over my rather small hands.  As others have mentioned, the construction seems quite sturdy as well.  These will work just as well in organizing any bag or purse. You really can&#x27;t beat the price and I am ordering a couple more sets.  At the price of most organizer bags of this size and type these are really phenomenal.</li>
    <li> Small enough for throwing in the purse and big enough for carrying make-up, regular size pencils, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much prettier than expected- nice, bright colors, shiny patent-looking piping. Cute and fun! See uploaded photos. The phone is an HTC One M8, to give you an idea of size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great to share with a girlfriend. Using one in my purse for small amount of make-up I always carry for touch-ups. Another in my regular make-up bag to separate primers and first use type items. Another for last topping type items lol. Another in my sewing basket. And another for small craft tools in my office...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list goes on~ Great for USB cords in the car or spare batteries in the camera bag... Medical bandages and small emergency supplies on the go. Little girl purse (my granddaughter loves hers!). These have countless handy uses and are needless to say, excellent for organizing. Those who enjoy color coding can have a hay day! Smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached the straps onto the zipper pulls, instead of the loop it&#x27;s designed to attach to. Handy to use the strap to open and shut like a clutch for quick convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zippers pull nicely and don&#x27;t catch. After a few months of use, they still feel and look like new. These are breathable mesh, not the type that are sealed and just look that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straps to attach are somewhat thin and the bags may outlast them but I&#x27;m not concerned. Excellent value. Buy with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note on colors: there is no red. 2 shades of pink instead.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made an smaller then expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to help organize my diaper bag and purse while traveling.I love that they are different colors, first aid in blue, mommy stuff in purple, cords and chargers in green etc....the straps are removable which I liked as well. I love that you can see through them so you know what is in each pouch. I will probably order another set for home, as they have multiple uses</li>
    <li> These things are great...I have already ordered them twice and getting ready to order again. I use them for everything. I love the fact that what you put in them you can see through...so no more searching in your purse...just look inside and pull the one out that has what you need.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I hoped for!  Bought these to organize my lipsticks by color.  The fake leather detail on the boarder and the strap is a bit cheap, wouldn&#x27;t use this as a fashion clutch by any means, but they are perfect for organizing small items.  Luckily, the strap is removable and the zippers are high quality and work well.</li>
    <li> These are great because you can see what you are hunting for.  I keep them in my car for the small things, like lip gloss and gum, because my poorly designed Escape doesn&#x27;t even have a small space to keep those things so they can be easily reached and I don&#x27;t want to be distracted hunting for them, or retrieving them from falling on the floor.</li>
    <li> I use them to organize small staff</li>
    <li> I have only used one of these, but the seam tore out almost immediately.Good idea but not strong enough to hold cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Love these bags, and now they&#x27;re gone! I would totally buy another set if they came back to Amazon. I use them as sachets for Downy Unstopables‎ - add a little bit of your favorite scent, and toss them in luggage, linens, or drawers.</li>
    <li> Not much to say... they work, the colors are nice and bright, and these are really convenient for keeping my random things organized when I travel.  They don&#x27;t feel super sturdy but so far they have held up very well.</li>
    <li> Total waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I really like these pouches because of the colors!  When I&#x27;m traveling and also while using these in my work bag, I can quickly and easily grab what I want, because I know what&#x27;s in each color.  :)</li>
    <li> These bags are nicely made, stitching stays strong, and close completely. The mesh is see through yet stiff enough to hold it&#x27;s shape.</li>
    <li> I use these to organize objects in my tote bag/purse.  It&#x27;s a reversible bag, and having all my objects in these pouches makes it a snap to reverse.  They&#x27;re holding up well, and help with the hunt one always goes through for objects in a big bag.  Make-up?  Pink Bag.  Pens?  Purple.  Tissue and sundries?  Blue.  And so on.  Got this system going for travel, but it&#x27;s great everyday too.</li>
    <li> I love these. They help me organize my purse.</li>
    <li> I just wish they made them in other sizes, as well. These are small.</li>
    <li> I love these bags. They make it so easy to see what&#x27;s insside. Rey light weight and well made</li>
    <li> would not recommend.  flimsy and cheap</li>
    <li> About what I expected. Cheaply made. Zippers broke on two of them rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Great bags, perfect for giveaways or party favors!</li>
    <li> Wonderful little bags for the purse or suitcase.  I use them for all sorts of small items.  They are of good quality and I really like the mesh that you can see through.</li>
    <li> Very cheap rubber top.  Not what I expected; I returned them.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for this low price and I was wrong. I bought these to organize the \\&quot;smalls\\&quot; in my tote. (Tired of digging on the bottom for small necessities).    The colors are vivid and very pretty; I can see the contents; the size is perfect. I don&#x27;t need the wrist straps, but some might. These bags work!    And all this at a great price. I only needed 3 so the others are in my empty suitcase ready for my next trip.The quality is superior for the price. They aren&#x27;t \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; but they carry my goodies handily. Happy customer here.    Recommended!</li>
    <li> I call these ditty bags.  I keep my purse, gym bag, boat ....... organized with them.  These are a bit small, and a little on the cheapish side.  However, for the price and quantity you get they are a good deal.  I have only had them a few days so I do not know how they will hold up.</li>
    <li> I gave it 2 stars because the colors are bold and pretty and I like the nylon mesh...however, the quality is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;These will probably last a few months before they fall apart but we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;m using these to organize things in my purse. One for Tissues, gum, receipts. All us ladies throw things in our purse and after awhile it&#x27;s a mess. So fr these are keeping my purse clean and organized. I hope I can continue to organize as long as these mesh bags last.</li>
    <li> These are inexpensive mesh bags, and unfortunately it shows.  I bought these to try and organize my purse, but I doubt they&#x27;ll last more than a couple of months.  The mesh is very thin, with a cheap piece of tape across the bottom.  You get what you pay for with these.</li>
    <li> The bag was small..I thought it was bigger but it will do</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really going to like these.  I sort purse items in them (make-up,electronics, emergency, etc) and it&#x27;s easy to grab the one I need.</li>
    <li> These are made well and look just like the photo.  I am using 2 in my purse and will use the other 4 for travel.  Such a deal!</li>
    <li> These were not as great as they looked online. They felt &amp; looked really cheap. I later found some at Dollar Tree that I liked better &amp; regretted this purchase.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the quality of the material used for this cute bags.  I like the mesh but not the wristlet.</li>
