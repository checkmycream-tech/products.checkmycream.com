      <li>This shampoo/conditioner from Sebastian is wonderful at protecting and revitalizing while it keeps my hair light and voluminous.</li>

      <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>I think this works so nicely on my hair.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is so nice.</li>
      <li>When I rinse it out and blow-dry, my hair looks spectacular.</li>
      <li>I never tried the Sebastian line before, but it really is nice.</li>
      <li>I pair it with Sebastian Light shampoo, and my high-lighted hair is gorgeous and flowing.</li>
      <li>Love love love!</li>
      <li>This product works fine, if you can get it out of the container!  </li>
      <li>Okay, the conditioner itself is not \\&quot;bad\\&quot;, but when you consider the price there are much better products out there.</li>
      <li>I love using it with the matching shampoo.</li>
      <li>My hair felt better when I went to rinse that time, but...</li>
      <li>Matrix Biolage Hydratherapie blows this out the water at just a couple of dollars more.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Truly, Walgreen&#x27;s Biofusion Hydrating Conditioning Balm, Nature&#x27;s Gate Pomegranate, and even L&#x27;Oreal has better conditioners than this.</li>
      <li>Dove intensive care performs much better then this.</li>
      <li>I love the Sebastian Potion 9, so I thought I would try this.  </li>
      <li>I love Sebastian shampoos and conditioners.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist recommended it and she was right - best conditioner and a good price compared to other designer brands.</li>
      <li>Drench is okay, but I expected better for the price (and the name lol).</li>
      <li>Definitely a huge difference.</li>
      <li>It keeps it soft and in good shape.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair and it is the perfect product to maintain my dense long main.</li>
      <li>after using this product on your hair it feels so clean and hydrant.</li>
      <li>It rinses easily, but leaves my hair feeling very soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>The first couple of times, product comes out easily but after that you have to use herculean strength to get the stuff out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved other products by Sebastian (like Potion 9), but this one won&#x27;t be making its way into the rotation.</li>
      <li>Worth the money and will certainly purchase it again.</li>
      <li>More recently, I started paying attention to the fact that what I was using smelled good, but it was also leaving my normal hair feeling dry.</li>
      <li>Little bit goes a long way - excellent value</li>
      <li>And since my hair needs so much conditioner, I&#x27;m pretty picky about the quality I get for the price.</li>
      <li>This stuff moisturized dry, chemically treated hair like magic.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used a moisturizing conditioner that does so little.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced considering.</li>
      <li>Great for color treated and dry hair without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and gets dry in the winter months.</li>
      <li>Now I also have to take the new funky sleeve off the top along with squeezing the bottle upside down against the edge of the tub to get any product out.</li>
      <li>This one is fantastic, as expected, but your hand will cramp up trying to squeeze it out of the bottle!</li>
      <li>As a guy, I have usually worried more about how my shampoo and conditioner smell than what they do (or don&#x27;t do) for my hair.</li>
      <li>It seems like a pretty decent shampoo and conditioner, but   I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really form an opinion yet..</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly/wavy hair.</li>
      <li>In the shower my hair felt soft and conditioned just the feeling I imagined getting from the drench line, but as my hair dryer that changed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got thick hair and also use Alterna Hair Concrete each day for light styling.</li>
      <li>Plus very reasonably priced compared to Pureology or other brands.</li>
      <li>As much as it should be heavy, I really didn&#x27;t feel it overly conditioned my hair and left it dryer then before.</li>
      <li>Aussie Moist&#x27;s product line, especially their 3-minute miracle, far surpasses this.  </li>
      <li>Sebastian company, if you are reading this, you are making these bottles worse instead of better.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, so for once I&#x27;m not tearing through a bottle quickly.</li>
      <li>It makes it feel really moisturized without feeling weighted down.  </li>

    <li> I love this conditioner. The bottle sucks, so I&#x27;ll give it four stars instead of five. This is for the 8-ounce bottle. Sebastian company, if you are reading this, you are making these bottles worse instead of better. Now I also have to take the new funky sleeve off the top along with squeezing the bottle upside down against the edge of the tub to get any product out. It gets worse as the product is used. When about a third of the product is left, I have to dilute it with water so I can get it out. Please look at bottles that work, and switch to that style. Please don&#x27;t change the conditioner, just the bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner. I never tried the Sebastian line before, but it really is nice. Reasonably priced considering. I would order again.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this leave in conditioner is great</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Makes my hair shiny and silky with no stringy-ness. Sometimes conditioners will make my hair look oily, but this one does not. I pair it with Sebastian Light shampoo, and my high-lighted hair is gorgeous and flowing.</li>
    <li> As a guy, I have usually worried more about how my shampoo and conditioner smell than what they do (or don&#x27;t do) for my hair. More recently, I started paying attention to the fact that what I was using smelled good, but it was also leaving my normal hair feeling dry. I&#x27;ve got thick hair and also use Alterna Hair Concrete each day for light styling. I talked to the woman who cuts my hair and she suggested I give this conditioner a try. Definitely a huge difference. A little goes a long way, so for once I&#x27;m not tearing through a bottle quickly. A pea sized amount is all I need.  It rinses easily, but leaves my hair feeling very soft and healthy. The smell is very light and pleasant, so I&#x27;m happy she steered me in this direction and will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> I love the Sebastian Potion 9, so I thought I would try this.  The bottle is too rigid making it difficult to squeeze product out.  If the product were good, I wouldn&#x27;t begrudge the effort.  Aussie Moist&#x27;s product line, especially their 3-minute miracle, far surpasses this.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used a moisturizing conditioner that does so little.  This product should be sitting on a shelf in the Dollar Tree.</li>
    <li> after using this product on your hair it feels so clean and hydrant. great sent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have a lot of hair and it is the perfect product to maintain my dense long main. My hair stylist recommended it and she was right - best conditioner and a good price compared to other designer brands.</li>
    <li> Great for color treated and dry hair without weighing it down.  Plus very reasonably priced compared to Pureology or other brands.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the best I have tried.  Great for colored hair.  It keeps it soft and in good shape.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> In the shower my hair felt soft and conditioned just the feeling I imagined getting from the drench line, but as my hair dryer that changed. As much as it should be heavy, I really didn&#x27;t feel it overly conditioned my hair and left it dryer then before. Dove intensive care performs much better then this.</li>
    <li> This product is the best.  I have used for years.  After putting on shampoo and conditioner, use this to get the rest of the tangles out.  Leave in for awesome hair!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is so nice. I have colored, wavy and dry hair.  I think this works so nicely on my hair.  It makes it feel really moisturized without feeling weighted down.  I love using it with the matching shampoo.</li>
    <li> It seems like a pretty decent shampoo and conditioner, but   I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really form an opinion yet..</li>
    <li> I love Sebastian shampoos and conditioners. This one is fantastic, as expected, but your hand will cramp up trying to squeeze it out of the bottle! Who designed this container????</li>
    <li> 5 stars...nothing works as this does on my wavy, frizzy-prone hair...just don&#x27;t wash it all out upon rinsing.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Great for color-treated hair. My hair is fine and gets dry in the winter months. This shampoo/conditioner from Sebastian is wonderful at protecting and revitalizing while it keeps my hair light and voluminous.</li>
    <li> This stuff moisturized dry, chemically treated hair like magic.  Worth the money and will certainly purchase it again. Little bit goes a long way - excellent value</li>
    <li> Love love love! I use it as a hair mask and leave it on overnight or 4 to 5 hours during the day. When I rinse it out and blow-dry, my hair looks spectacular. I&#x27;m totally inlove with this product!</li>
    <li> This product works fine, if you can get it out of the container!  The first couple of times, product comes out easily but after that you have to use herculean strength to get the stuff out.  Not much fun with wet hands in the shower.  I ended up unscrewing the lid and squeezing it out that way.  Will buy a product with a pump next time.</li>
    <li> I have to wonder about the shelf life of the bottle I received.  It was so think that I had to take the cap off to use it.  It wouldn&#x27;t squeeze out of the bottle like designed to do.  I may or may not order again.</li>
    <li> Okay, the conditioner itself is not \\&quot;bad\\&quot;, but when you consider the price there are much better products out there. Matrix Biolage Hydratherapie blows this out the water at just a couple of dollars more. Drench is okay, but I expected better for the price (and the name lol). The trick to this seems to be water. I followed the directions, but left it on a little longer than the bottle says. My hair didn&#x27;t seem any softer. Yet, when I started to rinse it out, the conditioner started to... puffy up! So with the little extra water added, I reworked the conditioner through my hair, and put a plastic cap back on. My hair felt better when I went to rinse that time, but... it just doesn&#x27;t compare with the other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly/wavy hair. It&#x27;s very long, very thick, and very frizz prone. The ends of my hair have some damage from hair dye that I&#x27;m slowly cutting out (still), so I need super conditioners for my hair. And since my hair needs so much conditioner, I&#x27;m pretty picky about the quality I get for the price. I&#x27;ve loved other products by Sebastian (like Potion 9), but this one won&#x27;t be making its way into the rotation. Truly, Walgreen&#x27;s Biofusion Hydrating Conditioning Balm, Nature&#x27;s Gate Pomegranate, and even L&#x27;Oreal has better conditioners than this. Sorry, Sebastian! &#x3D;-/</li>
