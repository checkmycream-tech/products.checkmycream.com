    <li> I&#x27;ve used Influx 33 for many years and love it.  It does help my hair to be significantly softer and easier to brush. I just like the way it feels!  (Don&#x27;t tell anyone, but it also make a dog&#x27;s hair easier to brush)l</li>

    <li> My favorite product EVER, and getting harder to find. I&#x27;m afraid they may be discontinuing. Great for skin and hair. Great for little kids as a detangler. It&#x27;s also good for sunburn? I use this to dampen the sponge before I put on my foundation. Very soothing</li>
    <li> I expected  more from this product in terms of softening the texture of my multi ethnic hair. My primary motive for buying it is sunscreen protection. I can only hopwork that it does what it promises to do.</li>

    <li> I was so happy to have found this on Amazon because it&#x27;s so hard to find.  My hair knots so easily, and conditioner sprays just don&#x27;t help.  But this stuff works wonderfully for de-tangling my hair.  And it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or anything like that.  It smells good too.  I gave some to my friend to use for her son&#x27;s kinky curly hair, and she said it makes coming his hair a million times easier.  Only thing you gotta watch out for is if you get over spray on a linoleum or laminate floor, it will make the floor slick...yea, I learned that the hard way, hehe.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful stuff....makes my fine hair so manageable between washings.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years ,not only does it make it easy to comb,but also makes the hair grow.Thank you Clubman</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. My hair tangles a lot, so I use this to help me comb out. I have it in a spray bottle and even dilute with water a bit; when I was getting professional perms, my beautician would spray each lock of hair before they rolled it with the curler. It is a great product and at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent leave-in hair conditioner.  I have used this product for many, many years</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago. Store stopped carrying it; so I went to Amazon. Naturally I found it, again. Still the best leave in conditioner available. I bought 3 bottles for now. Will buy more when I use these all up. I even use it on dry hair. Removes tangles or rats, without pulling out my hair.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best leave-in out there. Sally Beauty supply took it off their shelves almost 7 years ago. My mom who is a stylist had been using it for years ended up switching her leave-ins repeatedly in that time period because nothing has measured up to influx. This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s light weight but I like to put it in a spray bottle to evenly distribute it. It protects the hair, encourages growth, and smells amazing. I need a whole case. Thanx amazon</li>
    <li> This conditioner really helps tame the fly aways in my hair. The SPF is a good thing to help keep sun damage at bay. Couldn&#x27;t be easier to use!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 15 years.  It is by far the best detangler that does not leave your hair feeling weighed downQ</li>
    <li> So happy you have my product!  So hard to find!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Used to buy this at Sally&#x27;s, but they no longer carry them. I&#x27;ve been using this for over ten years and can&#x27;t be without it. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here. I hope it&#x27;s not discontinued.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much water in the bottle.</li>
