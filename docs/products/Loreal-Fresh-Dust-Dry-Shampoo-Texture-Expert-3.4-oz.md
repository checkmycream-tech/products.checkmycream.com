      <li>My hair was fairly oily, so I thought that would be a good test.  </li>

      <li>Works great to keep hair looks clean longer</li>
      <li>I consider myself a products junkie and have tried them all (from drugstore to prestige brands) and this by far the best.  </li>
      <li>This one is BY FAR the best!  </li>
      <li>Very cheap in price compared to others like it</li>
      <li>Very light n airy</li>

      <li>Since I bought it to combat grease, I can&#x27;t say I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This was recommended to me by my hair stylist, and I have to say, I&#x27;ve used better (for cheaper).  </li>
      <li>This product lasts all day, gives extra volume, and smells great!</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
      <li>In those, their Good Housekeeping Institute staff will take a certain product, appliance, etc.</li>
      <li>When I purchase a product for the scent, the review better be precise.  </li>
      <li>However, it has a strong &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34; scent, which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
      <li>It works fine, it smells fine.</li>
      <li>Fresh Dust doesn&#x27;t do that!</li>
      <li>It helps me feel better about dropping $40 to get my hair done since it now works out to $10/day thanks to Fresh Dust :)</li>
      <li>Works great and does not make your hair appear grey</li>
      <li>Clean - not like a chemical, but akin to scents described as &amp;#34;rain&amp;#34;. 2.)</li>
      <li>Good is relative.  </li>
      <li>Does it smell good enough to justify the expense?</li>
      <li>This one is NOT white and powdery, which is probably good for brunettes.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Worked great but ran out way sooner than I expected!</li>
      <li>Keeps hair fresh and clean longer</li>
      <li>No white residue and nice light fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, and not sticky, but I dont think my hair is cut out for dry shampoos...</li>
      <li>I thought my Suave dry shampoo did just as good of a job.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great for keeping your hair fresh feeling longer after a wash and keeping down oiliness.</li>
      <li>One even said, &amp;#34;My hair looked freshly washed for days!&amp;#34;  I was eager to try it since I had been looking for a good dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I did like the fresh, light scent, which was a positive comment in the GH review.  </li>
      <li>It did fluff it up a bit and make it smell good</li>
      <li>No heavy perfume smell and can&#x27;t ask for more</li>
      <li>Up to you if it&#x27;s worth the premium price.</li>
      <li>If you spray it on your hair and just blow it out, looks like you just freshly washed it.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
      <li>Fresh Dust does do the job.  </li>
      <li>The L&#x27;Oreal Fresh Dust got the highest rating of the ones they tested.  </li>
      <li>Garnier Fructis has a similar product that works equally well and smells great at a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best dry shampoo in the market.  </li>
      <li>Did exactly as promised.  </li>
      <li>Really helps!</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I was glad to finally find it somewhere.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying a bit more for it to be bigger.</li>
      <li>Rarely does a product live up to the description.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better smelling dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I am a blonde with fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I first read about this on New Beauty.com, where it is described as \\&quot;A Dry Shampoo to Top</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling fresh, smells great and it removes residual oil, but it&#x27;s way too expensive for this purpose.  </li>
      <li>It was promised to not only clean my hair of oil, but to add volume.  </li>
      <li>From a lot of dry shampoo products out there this on so far is my favorite.</li>
      <li>sprays on almost clear, not thick and &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; like many dry shampoos.  </li>
      <li>Does it work significantly better than a less pricey product?</li>
      <li>I have to use a lot to get a decent finish</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t change the color of my hair as much as some other ones.  </li>
      <li>This was my first experience with dry shampoo -- I love the concept and the smell of this particular dry</li>
      <li>So, I tried it on a morning I would normally have washed my hair.  </li>
      <li>Will continue to only use Fresh Dust</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect weight for my thin hair where others I&#x27;ve tried just weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>this is more expensive than most dry shampoos, but well worth it</li>
      <li>I finally found it online, although at what I consider a pretty steep price.  </li>
      <li>One use ( maybe twice) is ok, but no more without shampooing.</li>
      <li>I bought my first cannister through my salon and ordered the second through Amazon.</li>
      <li>So the white powdery dry shampoos work fine for me - I don&#x27;t have to worry about residue showing.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit more expensive than other dry shampoos but is a far superior product.</li>
      <li>Soft - not like a loud perfume.  </li>
      <li>Gives my hair a lot of body, which I don&#x27;t have naturally.  </li>
      <li>The can does seems a bit large for the amount you get - when I shake it, it seems to be only about half full.  </li>
      <li>I have dark hair and most dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for fine hair!  Really helps!</li>
    <li> Works great. No heavy perfume smell and can&#x27;t ask for more</li>
    <li> I first read about this on New Beauty.com, where it is described as \\&quot;A Dry Shampoo to Top All Dry Shampoos\\&quot;    [...]    It was promised to not only clean my hair of oil, but to add volume.  It does that!  My hair doesn&#x27;t look just washed--it doesn&#x27;t have that shiny, slick look--but the oily look is gone, and it has the volume of freshly-washed hair.  In other words, I can use this between shampoos when I&#x27;m pressed for time, and I don&#x27;t have all the problems I&#x27;ve had in the past with other dry shampoos, such as oil-infused powder falling all around, which makes me look like I have dandruff.</li>
    <li> This item was received timely and is just excellent! Rarely does a product live up to the description. Well this one delivers as promised.</li>
    <li> Adds body, nice scent, doesn&#x27;t give that &amp;#34;I just put powder in my hair&amp;#34; feeling. Better than less expensive brands. Up to you if it&#x27;s worth the premium price.</li>
    <li> This is the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found that does such a fantastic job...doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down at all and adds a bit of lift and volume. Based on other products I&#x27;ve used (from low to hi price points) I was skeptical when a friend recommended it. After using it, I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Very light weight.</li>
    <li> I have dark hair and most dry shampoos show up - this one does just barely! There&#x27;s a little visible product, but rub it in and it&#x27;s gone.  It works great - best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. No white powder and does not make your hair crunchy like other products. Have already purchased my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this dry shampoo on the recommendation of a magazine article, and because we have frequent power outages where I live.  Fresh Dust does do the job.  It leaves my hair feeling fresh, smells great and it removes residual oil, but it&#x27;s way too expensive for this purpose.  Garnier Fructis has a similar product that works equally well and smells great at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  I had seen it in Good Housekeeping magazine in one of their consumer product reviews.  In those, their Good Housekeeping Institute staff will take a certain product, appliance, etc. and review several brands of the same product.  In this article they reviewed several brands of dry shampoo.  The L&#x27;Oreal Fresh Dust got the highest rating of the ones they tested.  In fact, their testers raved about it.  One even said, &amp;#34;My hair looked freshly washed for days!&amp;#34;  I was eager to try it since I had been looking for a good dry shampoo. I looked for it in six different retail stores, but was unable to find it.  I finally found it online, although at what I consider a pretty steep price.  Nevertheless, I was glad to finally find it somewhere.  So, I tried it on a morning I would normally have washed my hair.  My hair was fairly oily, so I thought that would be a good test.  I was very disappointed.  My hair, quite frankly, didn&#x27;t look any different.  It was still just as oily.  I did like the fresh, light scent, which was a positive comment in the GH review.  I have, in the past, used another dry shampoo, which is not at all expensive, and it did a very good job.  However, it has a strong &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34; scent, which I don&#x27;t like.  All in all, I&#x27;d have to say this product is not worth the money, if you can even find it in a store.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my hair stylist, and I have to say, I&#x27;ve used better (for cheaper).  I am a blonde with fine hair.  So the white powdery dry shampoos work fine for me - I don&#x27;t have to worry about residue showing.  This one is NOT white and powdery, which is probably good for brunettes.  But, I don&#x27;t feel it got rid of the grease in my hair.  It did fluff it up a bit and make it smell good (the smell is awesome!), but my biggest problem is grease.  Since I bought it to combat grease, I can&#x27;t say I love it.</li>
    <li> this is more expensive than most dry shampoos, but well worth it - works great.  Keeps hair fresh and clean longer</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great for those days when you just do not have time to shampoo.</li>
    <li> If I even go one and a half days without showering, my blond hair gets greasy and my roots start to show. This dry shampoo works wonders! I just spray onto my roots, brush through my hair, and voila! I do not need to shower EVERY day. I love this stuff, easy to apply and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Smells delicious. Not worth the money though :( Baby powder does the same thing. So does the cheaper brand of dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant, and not sticky, but I dont think my hair is cut out for dry shampoos...but it is good.</li>
    <li> Meh.  Too expensive.  Batiste is 1/3 the cost and works better.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars because of the price.  Yeah, you can get a decent dry shampoo for about half the price that will work just as well.  What you can&#x27;t get is one that smells as awesome as this one!  I read lots of reviews before buying any product - I hope you do, too, because it can save you a load of time and money! When I purchase a product for the scent, the review better be precise.  &amp;#34;It smells good&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t cut it.  Good is relative.  Here&#x27;s how it smells: 1.) Clean - not like a chemical, but akin to scents described as &amp;#34;rain&amp;#34;. 2.) Soft - not like a loud perfume.  It will give your hair a slight smell of a clean cologne, not really sweet.  Somewhat faint, so it won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume, but it will give your hair a clean, fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;It sprays on almost clear, not thick and &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; like many dry shampoos.  The can does seems a bit large for the amount you get - when I shake it, it seems to be only about half full.  I don&#x27;t use dry shampoos often, so I figure this will last me awhile.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a lot of body, which I don&#x27;t have naturally.  No white residue and nice light fragrance.  My hair stylist recommended this - said it was the best one he&#x27;s ever used.  Will continue to purchase.  UPDATE 3/10/2015: Since it was cheaper and from the same company, I bought L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStyle Texture Series Energizing Dry Shampoo but I DON&#x27;T like it.  I have to use a lot to get a decent finish and my hair is a grease ball half way through the day.  Will continue to only use Fresh Dust - it&#x27;s the best!!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a good dry shampoo, leaves minimal white residue and doesnt make your hair feel cakey, but it overpriced and not worth $15-20 when Suave works almost as well for $2.99.</li>
    <li> Did exactly as promised.  Not something I would use often - only if pressed for time.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best dry shampoo in the market.  I consider myself a products junkie and have tried them all (from drugstore to prestige brands) and this by far the best.  I splurge on blow-outs fairly frequently and this lets me enjoy the blow-out at least 3-4 days.  It helps me feel better about dropping $40 to get my hair done since it now works out to $10/day thanks to Fresh Dust :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the perfect weight for my thin hair where others I&#x27;ve tried just weigh my hair down. It doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a white powdery finish either. And it smells awesome! Only downside is the price but it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with dry shampoo -- I love the concept and the smell of this particular dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it a little rough for double-processed hair, but still like using it.</li>
    <li> Great smelling.  Works well to freshen hair for restyling.  One use ( maybe twice) is ok, but no more without shampooing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells amazing and does what it claims. It also gives you lots of volume. I just wish they sold it in bigger portion or packaging. 3.4 oz isn&#x27;t enough to me. I just ordered my 3rd bottle and 1 bottle lasts me for about 2 months since I use it around to 3 times a week. I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying a bit more for it to be bigger. Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Overpriced. I thought my Suave dry shampoo did just as good of a job.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for keeping your hair fresh feeling longer after a wash and keeping down oiliness. I bought my first cannister through my salon and ordered the second through Amazon. Unfortunately, part way through the second cannister I seemed to develop an allergy to this product. Now I can&#x27;t use it without getting a wicked headache, sneezing, and feeling like my skin is burning. Obviously I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
    <li> Very happy with item.  I bought this to try, I had never heard of it before.  I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> If you spray it on your hair and just blow it out, looks like you just freshly washed it.  Very cheap in price compared to others like it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product. I like to put in my hair the night before. Pull my hair up and off to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Wake up shower (not washing hair). Pull hair down and you can&#x27;t even tell you have used this.&lt;br /&gt;Doing it that way makes it so you see no powder.&lt;br /&gt;Best secret around!&lt;br /&gt;Shhhhhhh!</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo did add some volume, but it had a very unpleasant odor.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of dry shampoos.  I am a believer in not washing hair but I few times a week.  I have used a lot of different dry shampoos from everywhere.  This one is BY FAR the best!  It is light and doesn&#x27;t change the color of my hair as much as some other ones.  I have dark brown hair and some of them will always make your hair look strange.  Fresh Dust doesn&#x27;t do that! Literally in minutes I can have hair that looks just washed.  This is a dry shampoo like no other!</li>
    <li> This is one of the better smelling dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  I have dark brown to black hair and it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to work the product into your scalp.  Some other dry shampoos take work to get rid of that white, powdery cast on your scalp.  Not this one.  I will purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! Best dry shampoo ever! Leaves no flaky residue and has a lovely scent. It is a bit more expensive than other dry shampoos but is a far superior product.</li>
    <li> Worked great but ran out way sooner than I expected!</li>
    <li> Works great and does not make your hair appear grey</li>
    <li> The product definitely helps between shampoos, but don&#x27;t expect your hair to look like it&#x27;s freshly washed and blown dry.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and is a nice fresh-up product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery residue.</li>
    <li> Smells so nice. Very light n airy</li>
    <li> Works great to keep hair looks clean longer</li>
    <li> From a lot of dry shampoo products out there this on so far is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is a decent dry shampoo. I&#x27;m a little confused about all the raves. It works fine, it smells fine. Does it work significantly better than a less pricey product? No, it doesn&#x27;t. Does it smell good enough to justify the expense? No, it doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t regret trying it, but it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product lasts all day, gives extra volume, and smells great! Also doesn&#x27;t leave white residue on the scalp area.</li>
