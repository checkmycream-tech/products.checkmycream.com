### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The protection this provides is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
      <li>Not the best, compared to my alba sunscreen.</li>
      <li>(so I never look greasy/keeps zits away) and a wonderful primer to keep makeup in place.</li>
      <li>It has great ingredients but the zinc is just too pasty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m told this product works great.  </li>
      <li>I learned about this from a great YouTube channel: DermTV.</li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>I was happy with it but wanted something with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>, there isn&#x27;t anything great about it.  </li>
      <li>But it smells great.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good that way.</li>
      <li>I saw the Yes to Cucumber and thought that would be good to try.</li>
      <li>I read something good about this moisturizer (and this brand) and decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Like at the racetrack!  : )  Works great for me.  </li>
      <li>Very light, pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I gave the product 2 stars for being effective at sunblock, and for not causing an allergic reaction (which would have been weeks of scaly itchy skin).</li>
      <li>, I wanted to see if this would work just as good, as its a better price point.  </li>
      <li>It takes 15-20 min to sink into the skin so that makeup can be applied over it, but it leaves kind of an ethereal glow on the skin.</li>
      <li>The sun protection is good, the smell is OK.</li>
      <li>But for the most part this is a great product, and I enjoy it.</li>
      <li>The cucumber smell is very strong and lingers.</li>
      <li>It keeps my super oily t-zone oil free for 10+ hours!!!</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is the most amazing product that I ever tried.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s best not to ever rub it anyway.</li>
      <li>It may provide great sun protection, but to put it on I&#x27;ll create so many wrinkles from rubbing it in, I don&#x27;t think its worth it.</li>
      <li>It also makes my skin more luminescent, and works a bit like a primer, or BB cream.</li>
      <li>With my light skin I cant imagine that any one could away with it!</li>
      <li>I have been on the hunt for the perfect daily SPF with no/reduced chemicals.  </li>
      <li>When there are more 1 star reviews than 5 star reviews, trust them.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Love the brand though.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;ll be ordering more when this is out.  </li>
      <li>I use Badger sunscreen that is a zinc oxide and titanium dioxide mixture that blends better than this stuff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love so many of their products.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for that perfect moisturizer with physical sunscreen.</li>
      <li>This product uses zinc oxide, which sits on top of the skin.</li>
      <li>If your skin is normal to oily, this works great.</li>
      <li>lotion separates out easily once its on the skin.  </li>
      <li>They all smell pleasant and the hair products leave my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>And if you still aren&#x27;t happy, they make a carrot product with a lower SPF 15 which glides on more smoothly and a version of the same cucumber product with no SPF at all.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the Yes</li>
      <li>I stick with the SPF to keep my face guarded from wrinkle-causing</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, fair, freckled skin and need great sun protection daily, so I bought it on a whim.</li>
      <li>(I have fairly light skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too dense and is light on my skin.</li>
      <li>Once you learn how to apply it (and of course the right amount), you will love it.</li>
      <li>But that alone won&#x27;t stop me from using a great product since I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to other sunblocks.</li>
      <li>ON THE OTHER HAND, I gave it to my daughter, and it works great for her.</li>
      <li>I saw this at Ulta and quickly used my Amazon App to scan a comparable price and read reviews.  </li>
      <li>I used it twice, and had to wash it off quickly after applying it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also kind of tough to put a face powder over the top of this because it remains kind of sticky for a while.</li>
      <li>The first thing I do is put on my finger tip to smell it; cucumbers!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I just wanted the Sunscreen with the moisturizer more than anything.</li>
      <li>love that it is natural</li>
      <li>I DID have to learn the right amount to put on</li>
      <li>I get that it&#x27;s zinc oxide-based, but then it should be more apparent on the packaging so customers know what they&#x27;re getting.</li>
      <li>It feels burny, even though I don&#x27;t have terribly sensitive skin, it dries up tacky, and the fragrance is WAY too strong, even for this cucumber lover.</li>
      <li>I tried the Yes to Cucumbers lotion with 30spf because I liked the Yes to Carrots shampoo and all the natural ingredients, and the 30 spf for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Glad I can return this to Ulta and get my money back.</li>
      <li>This would work as a sunscreen, but it is less than ideal for daily moisturizing under makeup.</li>
      <li>To brand, in fact I have switched most of my family&#x27;s bath products to Yes to, but this particular product is a total dud.</li>
      <li>I wish this had a higher spf because I do not carry it with me to reapply throughout the day, and SPF 30 is only good for a limited amount of sun exposure.</li>
      <li>skin no longer burns and the dry feeling and peeling is getting better (its been about a week since I&#x27;ve used the product).</li>
      <li>(do more patting with fingertips)-but, but it has calmed my red nose and cheeks to a normal level within 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>It smells inoffensive, and I like the companion cleanser very much, so I had high hopes.</li>
      <li>Chemical sunscreens are a nightmare for my breakout prone skin and a lotion is much quicker to apply than a powder, so this physical sunscreen is my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>Really wish I had read the reviews.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
      <li>It works fast and makes a difference.  </li>
      <li>Much like their calming moisturizer, Yes</li>
      <li>I just take my time and gently massage it into in skin.</li>
      <li>Mine is pretty much normal,</li>
      <li>Now I have this $15 dollar bottle of lotion sitting in my cabinet, but I can&#x27;t really stand to use it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually very diligent about reading customer review before purchasing beauty products, but i bought this one on a whim.  </li>
      <li>I had nothing against this brand before but whoever was involved in creating this should be fired because it threatens their whole brand&#x27;s integrity.</li>
      <li>The only thing this product has going for it is a light scent.  </li>
      <li>The zinc oxide is clumpy and when you do try to rub it in thoroughly, you really have to rub *</li>
      <li>To.. brand, my face has really cleared up.</li>
      <li>What makes this daily moisturizing sunscreen great for sensitive skin is not just the cucumbers and other soothing ingredients, it&#x27;s the sun-screening method itself.</li>
      <li>Not very moisturizing or easy to apply.</li>
      <li>so I am not putting so many harsh chemicals on my skin and body.</li>
      <li>This is a chemical free product, thus it&#x27;s not going to be like other moisturizers.</li>
      <li>It is disappointing because this is such a great company!</li>
      <li>It had Sunscreen and said it was for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for the past 4 months and love it</li>
      <li>This product also has a clean and fresh smell, unlike many other SPF products which smell weird and chemically.</li>
      <li>happened even after I discarded a couple pump squirts to clear the pump.</li>
      <li>Completely unsatisfied with product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is absolutely non-irritating to my skin, and I have been using it every day for several months.  </li>
      <li>Larger sizes would be appreciated.</li>
      <li>My skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping to find a good daily moisturizer with good SPF protection - it is awful.</li>
      <li>The white stuff that would not blend in became more and more difficult to get off!</li>
      <li>Nice product but not really a good daily moiturizer for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Yes to Cucumbers Daily Moisturizer before and loved it, but this kind, with the SPF is terrible.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why other reviewers had such a problem with it, but then, as I always say,  everyone&#x27;s skin is different and reacts differently to certain products.  </li>
      <li>This goop would barely spread on my skin.</li>
      <li>So here&#x27;s the secret to using and enjoying it:</li>

</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the worst moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried so far. I typically use philosophy &amp;#34;take a deep breath&amp;#34; but it is 35.00 so I&#x27;ve been looking to find an alternative. This moisturizer does not fully rub in to your face &amp; makes makeup look patchy. It might be the SPF in it but the philosophy had SPF too and did not do the same thing. It actually made my skin dry out a little. It is disappointing because this is such a great company! I love so many of their products. The only thing I can say is that there is a &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; feeling after application. But sadly, I&#x27;ll be returning this because everything else is not worth it.</li>
    <li> Chemical sunscreens are a nightmare for my breakout prone skin and a lotion is much quicker to apply than a powder, so this physical sunscreen is my new favorite.  I DID have to learn the right amount to put on so I had sun protection but didn&#x27;t look like a greasy corpse, but it works for me and I don&#x27;t understand all the low reviews.  Especially the one about bleaching a towel - that just doesn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before but I was compelled to because this is the most laughably awful product I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. I&#x27;m white and it still looked like I was in whiteface an inch thick that would not rub in. Took five minutes to scrub it off and whenever I pass a mirror I still notice spots I missed. I had nothing against this brand before but whoever was involved in creating this should be fired because it threatens their whole brand&#x27;s integrity. Will never buy a &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34; product again.</li>
    <li> I will not be buying this again. The SPF is too white and does not rub into my skin.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Yes To brand, in fact I have switched most of my family&#x27;s bath products to Yes to, but this particular product is a total dud. When you pump the lotion in your hand it looks thick and creamy. When you go to put it on your face it is dry and WILL NOT rub in! It leaves a thick white-ish layer of grease on your face (much like old school sunscreens) and only disappears after some serious rubbing. I hate letting things go to waste, but I am going to throw this one out!</li>
    <li> Nice product but not really a good daily moiturizer for me. I&#x27;m using it as a moisturizer on days that I know I&#x27;ll be out in the sun, more like a sunscreen without the bad stuff ir it!</li>
    <li> Made my face really red and stung very badly.  I can&#x27;t use this at all.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in this product, especially for the price.  It smells fine, but it has a terrible consistency.  It&#x27;s too hard to rub in, so it just feels like there&#x27;s this weird film sitting on my skin.  I left it on for a while (about an hour) but it never seemed to sink in; I was going out, and my face looked so shiny I had to wash it off.  Now I have this $15 dollar bottle of lotion sitting in my cabinet, but I can&#x27;t really stand to use it.  Bummer.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only sunscreens that I have tried on my sensitive skin that I can actually use!  It is absolutely non-irritating to my skin, and I have been using it every day for several months.  It takes 15-20 min to sink into the skin so that makeup can be applied over it, but it leaves kind of an ethereal glow on the skin.</li>
    <li> Good Grief!  It works!!!</li>
    <li> This goop would barely spread on my skin. It felt like a thick layer of clay on my face. Yuck.</li>
    <li> My sister bought this, in search of a vegetarian facial moisturizer, and didn&#x27;t like it, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. The cucumber smell is very strong and lingers. The moisturizer is also very thick, causing me to have to rub it in harder than I&#x27;ve ever had to with other moisturizers, and it was making my skin tingle and burn, even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I used it twice, and had to wash it off quickly after applying it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, unless you purchase it from a place that would allow you to return it after trying.</li>
    <li> This product is really, incredibly thick. It&#x27;s darn near impossible to rub in. That said, I mix it 50/50 with my lightweight face lotion and it&#x27;s good that way. The sun protection is good, the smell is OK. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d buy it again because I have to carry a second lotion around if I want to use this one and that is inconvenient, but it protects me from the sun and that is the main reason I bought it. It&#x27;s also kind of tough to put a face powder over the top of this because it remains kind of sticky for a while.</li>
    <li> It is like paste and is difficult to apply. It sits on your skin and makes you look ghostly, still looks that way an hour later. It also itches. Horrible product that I am returning to the store today.</li>
    <li> I always buy this brand along with the Carrot shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. They all smell pleasant and the hair products leave my hair very soft. I like the fact that these are organic products so I am not putting so many harsh chemicals on my skin and body.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face whenever I&#x27;m going to spend long hours outdoors in the summer sun.  Like at the racetrack!  : )  Works great for me.  I blend it with a little bit of my normal moisturizer.  The protection this provides is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to reapply it after a couple of hours, as with other products.  I really don&#x27;t understand why other reviewers had such a problem with it, but then, as I always say,  everyone&#x27;s skin is different and reacts differently to certain products.  Mine is pretty much normal, average skin - not dry, and not oily, so that could be why it caused me no problems.  This product also has a clean and fresh smell, unlike many other SPF products which smell weird and chemically.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, fair, freckled skin and need great sun protection daily, so I bought it on a whim. The first thing I do is put on my finger tip to smell it; cucumbers! I thought it was alright and let my fiance smell. &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; was his immediate response. Great. But that alone won&#x27;t stop me from using a great product since I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to other sunblocks. Every time I used this I felt like a vampire though! With my light skin I cant imagine that any one could away with it! Maybe if I was child running around at a park all day, but I am a woman who cares about my daily appearance. I used it a handful of times to give it a shot. Finally had to say &#x27;no more&#x27; after putting it on during the day, went out to a stand-up comedy that evening without washing it off (it is a moisturizer afterall), we took pics with comedians after, and I looked hideous! The flash must reflect off that zinc! I&#x27;m embarrassed. And the club took pics to put on their Facebook profile but when looked I noticed ours was not put up--what, they didnt want a vampire upstaging their comedian?! I gave the product 2 stars for being effective at sunblock, and for not causing an allergic reaction (which would have been weeks of scaly itchy skin).</li>
    <li> Much like their calming moisturizer, Yes To Cucumbers Daily Calming Moisturizer SPF 30 has obviously changed its formula.  Perhaps this is because the zinc was difficult to rub into the skin before.  However, whatever they did to change the formula made me break out on my forehead and chin.  The consistency was noticeably lighter and not as thick as before and much easier to rub in without having large white streaks.  However, be careful if you have sensitive skin that you might breakout.</li>
    <li> Yuck. I&#x27;ve used the Yes to Cucumbers Daily Moisturizer before and loved it, but this kind, with the SPF is terrible. It feels like I&#x27;m trying to spread chalky paste across my face. It doesn&#x27;t soak in and don&#x27;t even think about putting on any makeup over it. In the trash it goes.</li>
    <li> This product damaged my skin....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I got this product I had used the Yes To Grapefruit moisturizer. I was happy with it but wanted something with sunscreen. I saw the Yes to Cucumber and thought that would be good to try. It had Sunscreen and said it was for sensitive skin! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I just wanted the Sunscreen with the moisturizer more than anything. I wished I researched it before buying though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product didn&#x27;t blend in (made my face look ghostly), so started using it at night instead. After a week of use my skin started to feel very dry and look aged. Later my skin began to burn and peel! The white stuff that would not blend in became more and more difficult to get off! I had tried to wipe the excess off on a towel and the product BLEACHED MY TOWEL!!! If this stuff could bleach a towel, imagine what it did to my face!! I discontinued use and started only applying coconut oil and olive oil to my skin, skin no longer burns and the dry feeling and peeling is getting better (its been about a week since I&#x27;ve used the product).</li>
    <li> Hate it. It feels burny, even though I don&#x27;t have terribly sensitive skin, it dries up tacky, and the fragrance is WAY too strong, even for this cucumber lover. Also, the dispenser is odd for a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this elsewhere and cannot find anywhere else to warn people away from it. SUCH a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This stuff takes forever to absorb into the skin.  Smells faintly like cucumber, but in a bad way.</li>
    <li> This is the worst moisturizer I have ever used!  I don&#x27;t usually write product reviews, but this product is so terrible I felt compelled to let people know.  I doesn&#x27;t ever rub into my skin and it leaves a visible white film on my face (I have fairly light skin and you can still see it).  It also left my skin feeling really dry, as if I had washed it with bar soap.  I even mixed a little apricot kernel oil into to try to add a little moisture and it didn&#x27;t make any difference at all.  I have used other similar natural facial moisturizers with spf and none have been like this.  I recommend you keep looking and don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and has an SPF that works all day. It&#x27;s not too dense and is light on my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried the Yes to Cucumbers lotion with 30spf because I liked the Yes to Carrots shampoo and all the natural ingredients, and the 30 spf for my sensitive skin. I was very disappointed that it did not spread smoothly, but stayed in one spot.  I would have had to rub very hard to get it to spread and I wasn&#x27;t going to do that to my face. Something is wrong here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happened even after I discarded a couple pump squirts to clear the pump. The date was not expired either. So I brought it back to Target, told them about its unacceptability, and they gave me a refund. Sorry, I don&#x27;t like to give bad reviews, but if this helps someone save some money, I will feel better.</li>
    <li> Very light, pleasant smell. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t rub in at all, and leaves a white film on your face. It looks like a kabuki mask. I get that it&#x27;s zinc oxide-based, but then it should be more apparent on the packaging so customers know what they&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the most amazing product that I ever tried. It keeps my super oily t-zone oil free for 10+ hours!!! The texture can be difficult to work with and it can leave a white cast on your face if your skin tone is darker but I wear makeup everyday so that is not a problem. I just take my time and gently massage it into in skin. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This is a little thick to apply because of the mineral sunscreen in it. I find that if I apply after the shower before my face fully dries from the water, application is easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At application, it looks a little white on my skin, but I&#x27;ve noticed that it goes away after about 15 minutes as the moisturizer is absorbed. Im from California though, so I don&#x27;t mind the sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is natural and since I&#x27;ve started using Yes To.. brand, my face has really cleared up.</li>
    <li> The only sunscreen that I can use. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Once you learn how to apply it (and of course the right amount), you will love it.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely sensitive. This product is very thick, and it really dried my skin out. ON THE OTHER HAND, I gave it to my daughter, and it works great for her. I would say if you have very sensitive, dry skin, try a different product. If your skin is normal to oily, this works great.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for the perfect daily SPF with no/reduced chemicals.  I&#x27;m usually very diligent about reading customer review before purchasing beauty products, but i bought this one on a whim.  Really wish I had read the reviews.  The only thing this product has going for it is a light scent.  Other than that, there isn&#x27;t anything great about it.  It left a white film on my face all day, and it was not moisturizing.  Waste of money - I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Yes, I agree the Yes to cucumbers daily calming moisturizer spf 30 can be a bit sticky, and a little hard to spread over the face (do more patting with fingertips)-but, but it has calmed my red nose and cheeks to a normal level within 2 weeks. It also makes my skin more luminescent, and works a bit like a primer, or BB cream. Pat in on gently, and wait 10 to 15 minutes, then brush on a little loose powder and your skin really (well my skin at least), looks younger, smoother, and calmer (no red!).&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product feels chalky going on and the SPF ingredient leaves a white mask on face.  Completely unsatisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to find a good daily moisturizer with good SPF protection - it is awful. The zinc oxide is clumpy and when you do try to rub it in thoroughly, you really have to rub *HARD*. Once it is rubbed in, you can definitely see the lighter shade from the zinc oxide on your face, I mean I was literally a shade lighter. It may provide great sun protection, but to put it on I&#x27;ll create so many wrinkles from rubbing it in, I don&#x27;t think its worth it. Definitely not worth the $15 pricetag.</li>
    <li> Too thick. Goes on cake and white, like a ghost. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Love the brand though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about? This is a chemical free product, thus it&#x27;s not going to be like other moisturizers. It lays on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t soak in. I love it, it&#x27;s thicker but you just have to spread it on thin, I use a little water with it on my fingertips and do just fine. I think it actually helps brighten my complexion a little. This is the only moisturizing sunscreen that does not cause a breakout, for me.</li>
    <li> I saw this at Ulta and quickly used my Amazon App to scan a comparable price and read reviews.  When there are more 1 star reviews than 5 star reviews, trust them.  This does the same thing everyone else has complained about, leaves clumps due to the SPF on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion separates out easily once its on the skin.  I even shook the bottle aggressively to try and mix everything together, still didn&#x27;t work.  I use Badger sunscreen that is a zinc oxide and titanium dioxide mixture that blends better than this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; SPF, go with the Josie Maran Argan Oil Daily Face Lotion, SPF 40, it has the Z.O. and T.O. blend, plus Argan oil.  I&#x27;ve used it for the past 4 months and love it, I wanted to see if this would work just as good, as its a better price point.  You get what you pay for.  Glad I can return this to Ulta and get my money back.</li>
    <li> I use the Yes to Tomatoes cleansers and daily moisturizing lotion, and I tried this due to its high SPF (30).  I was disappointed in the consistency - it was thick and hard to distribute evenly.  This would work as a sunscreen, but it is less than ideal for daily moisturizing under makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m told this product works great.  It works fast and makes a difference.  She&#x27;ll be ordering more when this is out.  Larger sizes would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> Has a thick white texture, doesn&#x27;t blend in too well. But it smells great. Using it on hands and arms instead.</li>
    <li> What makes this daily moisturizing sunscreen great for sensitive skin is not just the cucumbers and other soothing ingredients, it&#x27;s the sun-screening method itself. A lot of sunscreens are chemicals that soak in, which your skin might not like. This product uses zinc oxide, which sits on top of the skin. This physical method of blocking the sun&#x27;s rays has been in use for a long time, but the reason it went out of fashion is because since it won&#x27;t \\&quot;rub in\\&quot; it left a white residue on the face. Today, they can make the zinc particles a lot finer, which helps, but the product is still meant to form a barrier between your skin and pollutants instead of being absorbed.&lt;br /&gt; Zinc is also used in baby products for diaper rash b/c it&#x27;s so gentle. I have noticed, that using a physical sunscreen has also served as a lasting matte finish (so I never look greasy/keeps zits away) and a wonderful primer to keep makeup in place. So here&#x27;s the secret to using and enjoying it: PAT IT ON YOUR FACE. Put a little glob on your finger and make dots in key areas around your face, then use all your finger tips to gently pat it in. If you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s best not to ever rub it anyway. I learned about this from a great YouTube channel: DermTV. And if you still aren&#x27;t happy, they make a carrot product with a lower SPF 15 which glides on more smoothly and a version of the same cucumber product with no SPF at all. I stick with the SPF to keep my face guarded from wrinkle-causing UV-A rays which can travel through windows.</li>
    <li> I wish this had a higher spf because I do not carry it with me to reapply throughout the day, and SPF 30 is only good for a limited amount of sun exposure. My face also tends to stay white like I have not rubbed it in enough, even though I have rubbed it on my skin quite a lot! But for the most part this is a great product, and I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I probably should have listened to the reviews before purchasing this, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot anyway. This stuff will make your face very white (and I&#x27;m already fair-skinned). It has great ingredients but the zinc is just too pasty. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Not the best, compared to my alba sunscreen. Sometimes this leaves white residue after washing my face thoroughly. Not very moisturizing or easy to apply.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using chemical sunscreen, but I want to make a change and switch to a physical sunscreen.  I read something good about this moisturizer (and this brand) and decided to give it a try.  Very disappointed.  Its texture is too thick and I have a hard time rub it evenly on my face.  It leaves behind the white patches all over my face and not even any makeup can cover it up.  I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for that perfect moisturizer with physical sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It smells inoffensive, and I like the companion cleanser very much, so I had high hopes. But no, just skip it. It clumps, is sticky, will simply not blend into your skin, and if you sweat, it&#x27;ll drip into your eyes and hurt. I&#x27;m trying not to waste it but I just can&#x27;t finish the jar.</li>
