      <li>hair was good for the price i really rate the delivery</li>
      <li>great product great............ real human hair .... if you have thin hair this will be perfect for you ....</li>
      <li>The hair is really soft and the length and color are perfect, but I&#x27;m really bummed that I cannot wear them as they do not blend at all.</li>
      <li>It was super long and beautiful!</li>

      <li>I know they&#x27;re cheap</li>
      <li>Its very useful recommend it</li>
      <li>I was so excited</li>
      <li>beautiful LONG pretty hair.</li>
      <li>Mine were actually lost in the mail (by the mail carrier) and the seller of this product was nice enough to resend them to me free of charge!!!</li>
      <li>100% satisfied and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
      <li>Not thin at all!!...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even use all of it in my hair definelt worth it</li>
      <li>These would be perfect except they&#x27;re so thin.</li>
      <li>i think it was worth the money.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t receive clip ins or the right brand of hair</li>
      <li>it one long piece that u have to cut on your own and do everything.</li>
      <li>I could get a way better set in Downtown Los Angeles worth the same amount of money.</li>
      <li>No doubt it&#x27;s real hair!</li>
      <li>The color and hair blends in well, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>The length is exactly what I ordered and hair color.</li>
      <li>The color was exact, even the hair length in the description.</li>
      <li>This hair was super soft and right color.</li>
      <li>i love how long it is  </li>
      <li>My recommendation is if you have medium hair like me, you should maybe buy 2 orders of extensions just to blend the extensions more with your hair because if you only order one pack, the extensions will only blend when you curl and look more natural.</li>
      <li>They came fast.</li>
      <li>fast deliveryyyy</li>
      <li>I Was Really Upset</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t think its real hair melted to my curling iron.</li>
      <li>I was really nervous after reading some reviews, but I decided to take the risk and but them...</li>
      <li>Thank you so much</li>
      <li>I recommend if you&#x27;re expecting the &amp;#34;7 piece clip in hair extensions)&amp;#34; DO NOT  $42.00 Thanks; NOT.</li>
      <li>The texture is good the clip is thick</li>
      <li>Only reason i got these is because the comments are most likely positive.</li>
      <li>its worth the price once again totally recommend it actually real helpful</li>
      <li>Curls and straightens easily, it can be colored however more difficult than real hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wrong length &amp; not the same thickness all the down.doesn&#x27;t come with the clips either just one long piece</li>
    <li> For starters mine was shipped with no clips , let&#x27;s not forget that it was one giant long piece of hair , more like 18 inches and rest was thin fuzz , sorry but I didn&#x27;t get what was in the discription 44$ down the drain , I was not happy , and trying to get my money back will probably be a royal pain...sigh :(</li>
    <li> I received them a couple days ago &amp; istill havent tried em what i did do is curl one strand just to prove it was real hair &amp; it did curl so far i like them</li>
    <li> The extensions I got were not clip in</li>
    <li> I really love everything about these except how thin they are. I feel kind of jipped because it said they were 100 grms. But they aren&#x27;t even close. All together they equal 100g. I would have to buy maybe four more sets to be able to wear. The hair is really soft and the length and color are perfect, but I&#x27;m really bummed that I cannot wear them as they do not blend at all. When I put whole set in, there&#x27;s just a small strip of hair hanging down my back. It looks like I have a &amp;#34;rat tail&amp;#34; hair do.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, It wasn&#x27;t horrible but you get what u pay for. Either buy 3 packages or splurge and get better quality ones. The hair was thin</li>
    <li> There very thin and cheap looking nothing like the picture,the color is dark brown black not jet black.</li>
    <li> So stringy and very very thin at ends of extensions, if you have super thin hair then these are for you. But i would never buy these again! Also fake hair, will not hold a curl to save its life!</li>
    <li> Would not order again. The hair was so thin unable to work at all.</li>
    <li> I bought these extensions and I did not like them.&lt;br /&gt;Very poor quality, very thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you order this item you will be disappointed</li>
    <li> hair was good for the price i really rate the delivery an A</li>
    <li> I received my extensions yesterday, I love them. I haven&#x27;t curled them or anything but I&#x27;m in love. The length is exactly what I ordered and hair color. The only problem I had was the dilevery I thought they&#x27;d come sooner. I think these extensions are great for the price. My recommendation is if you have medium hair like me, you should maybe buy 2 orders of extensions just to blend the extensions more with your hair because if you only order one pack, the extensions will only blend when you curl and look more natural. That&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
    <li> i love how long it is  but i asked for jet black and it looks more like a soft black or deep dark brown</li>
    <li> Bad item. Came as just a long thin weft, no clips, not thick, not 24 inches. Would not recommended.</li>
    <li> very little hair should be abundantvery little hair should be abundant</li>
    <li> MINE LOOKS THE SAME ^^^ you have s*** extensions i ordered different ones and sent that back it doesn&#x27;t even look like 24\\&quot; not even thick and way to big to fit on a persons head didn&#x27;t even come with clips no one buy these you&#x27;ll regret it</li>
    <li> These extensions are not 100g. They are soft and long but I had to purchase another set from a different seller to be able to use them.</li>
    <li> These would be perfect except they&#x27;re so thin. The texture is good the clip is thick but I bought two packs and they was no way I was gunna be able to wear them out. I had to go to sallys and but 14&amp;#34; just to thicken then. Then cut these extentions so they&#x27;d blend. Very very disappointed. I know they&#x27;re cheap but damn that qualify wad unnecessary</li>
    <li> not what i ordered got it with no clips as it says and as shown on the image.  also not 7 pcs just received 1.  will be reporting and want my money back or get what i ordered.</li>
    <li> Got my extensions today only to find out that they were a scam. On the picture itself, it said 100g. Turns out what I got is only 70g.  I got these mainly for the 100g not to be disappointed by how thin they are and 70g. I&#x27;m pretty pissed because it was so not worth the money by what I got.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried ordering these, but they are great! They arrived in about a week well before the estimated delivery date. Great hair, length and color. Very happy with these, will order these again for sure!!</li>
    <li> Only reason i got these is because the comments are most likely positive. I just got mine in the mail 10-15 minutes ago and I&#x27;m NOT satisfied. They did not come with clips, way to thin, and are not 7 pieces, they came in one whole piece. Not buying again. I could get a way better set in Downtown Los Angeles worth the same amount of money.</li>
    <li> Best extensions iV bought, people are saying they&#x27;re think but they are really thick.. I don&#x27;t even use all of it in my hair definelt worth it I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
    <li> I was expecting more hair than whay I received. I need to purchase more  and thats not good.  If i purchase more hair  i may not receive the same type of hair.  I cant use it becsuse it does not look good.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy for the price, they lasted about five months for me (I wear them every day) they wash well and are very soft to touch. Definitely will buy again soon.</li>
    <li> Great product. We died the extensions red which required a lot of bleaching and did not get damaged! We must have bleached them 10 times within a week and they held up great!</li>
    <li> Very good hair! BUT a little too thin</li>
    <li> So I just got my hair extensions and it doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture I got. It comes with I clips so how are u suppose to wear it and it&#x27;s not 7 pieces it one long piece that u have to cut on your own and do everything. So not worth it. I was so excited and now I am so disappointed. It also doesn&#x27;t look 24 inch. The bottom is so thin like no tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical buying these,I ordered 2 sets and glued them together. I love them,for the price yes they are awesome. I died mine black I match my hair and there are tons of Greys. People are always commenting on my grey hair lol. The clips are kinda hard to unsnap but other than that,they are great</li>
    <li> They are very thin and hair falls out of the clip,,</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I ordered. The color was exact, even the hair length in the description. Looks good in. No complaints! I would recommend them to anyone. Great price too</li>
    <li> 100g is NOT enough for hair extensions, they were just too thin. Dont buy extensions off of amazon!  Go to bellamihair.com! Theyre amaziinngg!!!</li>
    <li> Had to resew the clips back on twice. color matches nicely with my 18 inch extensions. would recommend and/or buy again.</li>
    <li> Is too thin is not 24 inch and does not have the clip and not even seven pieces hate this not worst the money</li>
    <li> These exstentions are awful. They are NOT 24in and are very , very thin. I was extremely disappointed when I opened my package. Should have returned.</li>
    <li> I Was Really Upset How Thin They Were, and how hard it was to blend with my natural hair I Wouldn&#x27;t recomend to anyone with thick hair</li>
    <li> I bought these to add length to my existing extension set, and I absolutely LOVE them! The color and hair blends in well, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. After I washed the hair, I had no problem curling, waving or straightening the hair. To my surprise, these are the best extensions I&#x27;ve bought in a long time. No doubt it&#x27;s real hair! I was able to ombre the extensions and style them without a problem. If you&#x27;re not buying these to add on to existing hair extensions, I&#x27;d suggest buying two packs AND make sure you wash the hair before styling it to avoid problems with the hair not holding the style.</li>
    <li> Exceeding my expectations love them !!long sexy they don&#x27;t hurt was givin exstra threading just very happy with them!! Love love love them</li>
    <li> I love it , good quality, perfect color and texture. I&#x27;m definitely buying them again soon.</li>
    <li> I Love them they exceded my expectations just the way i wanted them😍😍😍</li>
    <li> shipping time took forever and not worth the money, went to a local hair store and spent same amount and got triple the amount.</li>
    <li> I love the service, love the product. Great Buy!! Thank you so much</li>
    <li> beautiful LONG pretty hair. Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Love theses! Hair was beautiful</li>
    <li> Horrible quality definitely not worth the price, too thin, clips too hard to open &amp; won&#x27;t stay on. Good day</li>
    <li> despite what the package says I absolutely believe that this hair is not human hair it will not curl it will not straighten it is dry and ugly it looks like crap!! a total waste of money so disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t think its real hair melted to my curling iron.</li>
    <li> Fit perfect, look perfect, and have had no problems yet.</li>
    <li> Its very useful recommend it ♥♥♥ very nice and its worth the price once again totally recommend it actually real helpful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, they are thin. Color is great. They came fast.</li>
    <li> The hair is great quality for the price. Curls and straightens easily, it can be colored however more difficult than real hair I had to bleach it twice and even then the ends were not completely done. HOWEVER when I finally bleached it 3 times the colors came out beautiful! Love love loved em. Only complaint there so thin. I ordered 2 sets and sewed them together lol but worked better for me !</li>
    <li> Really good.....fast deliveryyyy</li>
    <li> Love these extensions!</li>
    <li> I am SUPER DISAPPOINTED. I just received my &amp;#34;24in Straights CLIP in Remy Human Hair extensions 100g 7pc&amp;#34; AND THEY LOOK NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTO. THEY DIDN&#x27;T EVEN COME WITH THE CLIPS. I would seriously love to get some contact information. I did the &amp;#34;two day shipping&amp;#34; because I needed these for this weekends weeding I&#x27;m attending.  I recommend if you&#x27;re expecting the &amp;#34;7 piece clip in hair extensions)&amp;#34; DO NOT  $42.00 Thanks; NOT.</li>
    <li> i guess u get what u pay for......i bought them for a little added length ....its horrile.....the clips are HUGE, bulky and heavy, theres very little hair on them. poor quality.</li>
    <li> I got my package way before promised which was absolutely awesome! The price is great and the hair is silky and smooth! It was super long and beautiful! Great product</li>
    <li> I was really nervous after reading some reviews, but I decided to take the risk and but them...and I love them! I have worn extensions for the last four years and my grandmother is a cosmetologist and she also agrees they are great quality for the cost. They are beautiful and curl perfectly. I have also dyed them and they still look great. The price for them is also amazing. I definitely recommend buying these.</li>
    <li> This item was HORRIBLE I didn&#x27;t receive clip ins or the right brand of hair it was two long strands of hair that I rubbed my fingers and begin to shed I will never order hair off of this again my items were $82.00</li>
    <li> great product great............ real human hair .... if you have thin hair this will be perfect for you ....if you have thicker hair i suggest you get two packs. Will defiantly be buying from again THANKS!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This hair was super soft and right color. The only bad thing id say is how its so thin but my hair is already thin and when your un rolling the hair got a lil bit tangled but other than that i think it was worth the money. Thankyou for the fast shipping and responding back to my emails. Defiantly would buy again</li>
    <li> Beautiful product!! Not thin at all!!...Mine were actually lost in the mail (by the mail carrier) and the seller of this product was nice enough to resend them to me free of charge!!! Great service!!! 100% satisfied and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! I love it</li>
    <li> These extensions are horrible DO NOT BUY! SAVE YOUR MONEY! They are not 100g hair they are 70g and I know the difference because I have a set of hair extensions that are 100g and they don&#x27;t come close to the them. The clips are sew in poorly had to re sew them only after 2 uses.</li>
