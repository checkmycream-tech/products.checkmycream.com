      <li>I LOVE the colors.</li>

      <li>but I love the added sparkle that the two polishes bring.</li>
      <li>Okay so I puchased these and they are so cool!</li>
      <li>The polishes were not sticky nor did they have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>in the right light it almost looks orange, but that could be because of the tanning lotions i use.</li>
      <li>I didnt notice it being super running or anything</li>
      <li>They are full size, and way worth the $$</li>
      <li>the colors are just as vibrant as the picture shows, and the sparkle polishes (left and right in picture) are great quality, I use them as</li>

      <li>These polishes are fun.</li>
      <li>I love the clear coat and how it has glitter and stars</li>

      <li>just do it as a bottom coat and add one of the other polishes on top:).</li>
      <li>I love pink, so this was an easy choice for me.</li>
      <li>I wish the nail polish was a bit more durable than it is, but overall, I would recommend it.</li>
      <li>it just sits and looks pretty again</li>
      <li>the colors are pretty</li>
      <li>Love the pink polish and the glitters they are very pretty .any</li>
      <li>The pink is called Barbie pink, and it has a great formula, and the color is just so fresh and pretty.  </li>
      <li>The quality was way better than I expected</li>
      <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very stinky.</li>

      <li>The theam was pink so these fit right in.</li>
      <li>Colors are vibrant and not clumpy at all.  </li>
      <li>Even the one that looks bright pink in the bottle comes out pretty much clear with a few sparkly pieces of glitter.  </li>
      <li>Gift for a teenage girl that loved the colors, but heart broken it chips off right a way.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m pretty pissed because although these are all really pretty colors, the main reason I got this set was because I wanted the Barbie pink</li>
      <li>The Barbie Pink is solid polish not any glitter in this one but its cool because I can use the Barbie Pink and top coat it with either pink glitter or peach glitter.</li>
      <li>The solid color is pretty thick it will be interesting to see how long it lasts</li>
      <li>And yes the neon pink is pretty</li>
      <li>This is more of a clear polish you will rarley get the stars or moons on your nails and it is very thick.</li>

      <li>well i am very upset with this set two of three polish were not closed tight and were already sticky when i got them.</li>

<li> The pink doesn&#x27;t go on well, possibly because the brush is so cluncky.  </li>
<li> The barbie pink was broke but I contacted seller so hopefully they do something about it.</li>

<li> The pink polish clumps up</li>

<li> cheap, crap! chips right away and is all chipped off with in 24 hours of using it, nails and even on the toe nails.</li>
<li> and I specifically wanted the Barbie pink and didn&#x27;t get it so for that reason I took off 2 stars but other</li>
<li> I got some other pink satin like color</li>
<li> i used the pink polish and a dark pink crackle polish-</li>
<li> wish i knew about this line prior to spend a small fortune at the beauty supply store.</li>
<li> but instead they have me neon pink!</li>
<li> the polish is sort of thick, and takes a LONG time to dry.  </li>
<li> all the little moons</li>
<li> Cheap, crap.</li>
<li> but if your getting this set specifically for the Barbie pink like me, then don&#x27;t bother cuz you may be unfortunate like me :/</li>
<li> The nail polish is very thick and it makes it hard to apply, it ends up looking chunky, its also a lot brighter than it appears from the picture.</li>
<li> sad bc</li>
<li> Kinda of sad, but o well.</li>
<li> it was thick and smelled awful.....</li>
<li> I just got a bad batch.</li>
<li> it was all horrible.</li>
<li> Horrible polishes</li>

    <li> The nail polish is very thick and it makes it hard to apply, it ends up looking chunky, its also a lot brighter than it appears from the picture.</li>
    <li> So pretty!  The pink is called Barbie pink, and it has a great formula, and the color is just so fresh and pretty.  The glitter polishes are perfect.  lots of glitter, and also great formulas!  Buy these!  They are full size, and way worth the $$</li>
    <li> the colors are just as vibrant as the picture shows, and the sparkle polishes (left and right in picture) are great quality, I use them as a \\&quot;top coat\\&quot;-since i used the pink polish and a dark pink crackle polish- and tehy do not fall off or ruin the coat! please note, this brand of polish is VERY runny,(the polish not the nail-fetti lacquer) some people might not like that. I dont mind it, its easier to do ur nails evenly and the perfect consistency for nail art. If your hesitant about buying this, dont be. As @jessica mosier reviewed, it deff. is a great mood changer! take it from me as well, Im expecting so I should know about mood swings XD</li>
    <li> This arrive today and the two of the three nail Lacquer are glitter polish. The Barbie Pink is solid polish not any glitter in this one but its cool because I can use the Barbie Pink and top coat it with either pink glitter or peach glitter. Very nice mood changer.</li>
    <li> The two glitter polishes have no color.  Even the one that looks bright pink in the bottle comes out pretty much clear with a few sparkly pieces of glitter.  The glitter sort of clumps and doesn&#x27;t come out evenly, and the polish is sort of thick, and takes a LONG time to dry.  The pink doesn&#x27;t go on well, possibly because the brush is so cluncky.  I&#x27;m not a big fan.</li>
    <li> cheap, crap! chips right away and is all chipped off with in 24 hours of using it, nails and even on the toe nails. Gift for a teenage girl that loved the colors, but heart broken it chips off right a way. Cheap, crap.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and great quality. The polishes were not sticky nor did they have a strong smell. The colors are beautiful and are perfect for those Barbie girly girls!</li>
    <li> the \\&quot;Barbie Pink\\&quot; color is amazing and looks GREAT. in the right light it almost looks orange, but that could be because of the tanning lotions i use. love the color, that&#x27;s the reason i bought all 3. have yet to use the 2 glittery ones. but they look nice i guess.</li>
    <li> I love these colors.  I have bought from this company two times now, and love their color sets!  Everything goes on smooth and lasts for at least a week without chipping.  Awesome products, and will buy over and over again!  Highly recommend their cool packages that go great with one another!!!</li>
    <li> This is more of a clear polish you will rarley get the stars or moons on your nails and it is very thick. The pink polish clumps up very easy.&lt;br /&gt;*Update* I dont even use the product anymore it just sits and looks pretty again don&#x27;t waist your time it has something to do with the make up of the chemicals mabey I just got a bad batch.</li>
    <li> loved the colors but when I tried using the polish it was thick and smelled awful.....sad bc the colors are pretty</li>
    <li> Colors are vibrant and not clumpy at all.  The color go on nice and smooth.  They can be used with any color.</li>
    <li> Love the pink polish and the glitters they are very pretty .any of my friends asked me where I got mu polish I said Amazon.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the colors. I wish the nail polish was a bit more durable than it is, but overall, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m pretty pissed because although these are all really pretty colors, the main reason I got this set was because I wanted the Barbie pink but instead they have me neon pink! And yes the neon pink is pretty but I already had that color and I specifically wanted the Barbie pink and didn&#x27;t get it so for that reason I took off 2 stars but other then that the colors are beautiful and the aurora the prettiest glitter polish I&#x27;ve ever owned so I would recommend these but if your getting this set specifically for the Barbie pink like me, then don&#x27;t bother cuz you may be unfortunate like me :/</li>
    <li> Great party favors. We got many bottles and decorated them for a Bridal Shower. The theam was pink so these fit right in.</li>
    <li> Horrible polishes, they smell like industrial glue. Plus I did not get the Barbie Pink I got some other pink satin like color it was all horrible. I regret buying this.</li>
    <li> The solid color is pretty thick it will be interesting to see how long it lasts and it&#x27;s very stinky.</li>
    <li> These r really pretty and all, but the downside is its very thick so therefore you can&#x27;t get enough of the sparkles on the nails. I had to apply 6 coats to barely get a few of the sparkles on my nail bed! I applied it 6 times and probably picked up only 2 or 3 sparkles. Kinda of sad, but o well. They are very cute to look at...</li>
    <li> Okay so I puchased these and they are so cool! The barbie pink was broke but I contacted seller so hopefully they do something about it. But I love the colors. The aurora is so awesome I love the clear coat and how it has glitter and stars so cute!!! The pinky moon is nice as well my daughter loves it all the little moons another great top coat if you dont want to color your nails. I give these polishs a A+ I didnt notice it being super running or anything but I love the added sparkle that the two polishes bring. Barbie pink is cute as well but no sparkle which is okay just do it as a bottom coat and add one of the other polishes on top:). Love it!!!</li>
    <li> wonder purchase,  colors are amazing! wish i knew about this line prior to spend a small fortune at the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> This polish is so cute and fun and perfect to get you in the mood for spring time. The quality was way better than I expected and I only had to use one coat of the &amp;#34;barbie pink&amp;#34;. The color is bright and topped with the stars or moons is adorable. Many complements:)</li>
    <li> well i am very upset with this set two of three polish were not closed tight and were already sticky when i got them. oh well you get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> These polishes are fun. I love pink, so this was an easy choice for me. Cover nicely, and stays on well.</li>
