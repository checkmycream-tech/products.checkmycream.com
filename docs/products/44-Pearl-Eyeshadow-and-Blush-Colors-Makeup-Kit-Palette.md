      <li>I love all of the various shades.</li>
      <li>but the dark colors show up nicely.</li>
      <li>but the shipping is as much as the product itself.</li>
      <li>But the way the pictures make it, it makes it seems like it&#x27;s one whole thing that opens up.</li>
      <li>Purchased this for mydaughter for her bday, she really lived them</li>
      <li>They are really glittery</li>
      <li>.The eyeshadows seem to show up well, but the blush take a little more effort.</li>
      <li>I think it is mostly powder, and very little pigment.</li>
      <li>I, myself, use a small sponge or a better brush.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s birthday.</li>
      <li>Once you get past the glitter top, the rest of the shadow is simply matte.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t really what I expected.</li>
      <li>The eyeshadow barely even shows up when you put it on either.</li>
      <li>this kit is amazing but one of them was broken, it about 2 and a half weeks to deliever at my house</li>

    <li> It was completely crushed when it arrived so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good product or not.</li>
    <li> Product was hard to blend, as the consistency is almost cream-like. (So is time-consuming.)&lt;br /&gt;But the colors are great; have much pigment. And get points for being shimmery-finish. (You never get those 2 qualities&#x27; with expensive-makeup.)&lt;br /&gt;Good price, though.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for mydaughter for her bday, she really lived them</li>
    <li> I love this! Huge makeup junkie and most my favorite products have been pretty cheap. The eye shadows arnt too pigmented. The blush!!! Omg so beautiful and pigmented... I&#x27;d buy over and over just for the blush.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s birthday. She loves playing dress up, and giving the family makeovers. I figured by giving her some makeup that was just hers, she would leave mine alone.  It came in one piece, no shattered colors. the colors look vibrant and pretty in the palette, but go on pretty sheer which worked out great for my purposes. I also gave her a set of makeup brushes, we didn&#x27;t try using a sponge applicator, but I can say they don&#x27;t go on that well with makeup brushes. Although I have used it on her, and with a bit of effort was able to get pretty good results, even if the look was light.  It&#x27;s very sheer, and doesn&#x27;t stay on long. I think it is mostly powder, and very little pigment. The product worked out great for what I wanted it for. I would not purchase this for myself to use as my daily makeup. But I think the price is pretty indicative of the quality.</li>
    <li> It was worth the money, when it came one or two of the colors was out. it was way to sparkly.</li>
    <li> The order arrived quicker than expected. But the way the pictures make it, it makes it seems like it&#x27;s one whole thing that opens up. But it&#x27;s actually two separate palettes. The colors are very pretty but only the top is glitter. Once you get past the glitter top, the rest of the shadow is simply matte. Honestly, I don&#x27;t mind the matte eyeshadow but it wasn&#x27;t really what I expected. The light colors don&#x27;t really show up that well but the dark colors show up nicely.</li>
    <li> I like color is good but I like and maybe y buy a gain other pearls for make up thx</li>
    <li> This was a present for my niece.  She is in love with eye make-up and wanted to start experimenting with different techniques and colors.  These colors are very subtle and just right for a girl of 12.  They are really glittery so I would not recommend for everyday wear at work, but if you want to sparkle up your eyes for a night out or a special occasion these eye shadows are perfect.  The colors are really pretty and look great on.</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;m super picky about my eyeshadows too. I want something That&#x27;s got color. Not just in the case but on my eyelids. This stuff rocks.</li>
    <li> So, I was really excited to get new eyeshadow colors. However, when I recieved this in the mail the hinges were all broken, some of the eyeshadow had been messed up somewhere along the shipping line and so they are no longer in the palette. The eyeshadow barely even shows up when you put it on either. Overall this is a terrible product and I do not suggest you purchase it. I also thought that this was one piece but it is actually two separate pieces.</li>
    <li> I love all of the various shades. The shimmery colors are so nice and look good on. The blush is okay.</li>
    <li> Just got mind today but it look nice for a price...</li>
    <li> Shades are good but the glitter is only on the top... rest is just matte shade!</li>
    <li> I LOVED THE COLORS BUT WHEN I GOT THEM SOME OF THE MAKEUP WAS BROKEN. AND I HAD USE IT FOR A WEDDING THE NEXT DAY IT WAS VERY UNBELIEVABLE</li>
    <li> When I received the package it was busted up I mean the solid shadows and blush were busted up and all over the pallets . It was a big ole mess. So not very happy now. But the ones not broken up after a good dusting were very nice quality</li>
    <li> this kit is amazing but one of them was broken, it about 2 and a half weeks to deliever at my house</li>
    <li> There are 2 small palettes in this collection. They each have 20 glittery pearl eyeshadows. Mine were not 44 colors, mine were 40 clolors. They also come with 2 different colored blushes in each palette .The eyeshadows seem to show up well, but the blush take a little more effort. I didn&#x27;t even try using the blush brushes that came with them because blush to me, doesn&#x27;t go on well with these brushes. I, myself, use a small sponge or a better brush.The eyeshadow color are all very bright colors and I, myself ,liked them a lot. There is a variety for everyone.The price I paid was very well worth it but the shipping is as much as the product itself.I have always recieved everything from Amazon with 10 days of ordering.These are nice small palettes that can easily be carried in your purse.</li>
    <li> There are no complaints, the product is simply the best... The color  pops, and stay on long all day. The shades are magnificent how it arrays ..I will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Great quality, arrived on time</li>
    <li> i need a new order my whole make up set was broken up into pieces ...like wtf bad serviceit was bad</li>
