<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product Does not come with the poofy ball sprayer as pictured. Still a great value for the price. Smells amazing and is definitely one of the better things Brit has done in life. 💜</li>
    <li> This perfume is one of my signatures that I wear along with Lucky You. It is a great value for the size, comes very well packaged. However, if you are looking for a long lasting fragrance, keep looking. I tend to need to reapply this at least twice throughout the day. It really is more of a body spray strength wise.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume by far, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect. I recommend.</li>
    <li> My 19 yr old neice bought this and before I knew it was by Britney Spears I loved it!  Still love it, so fresh and mild.  Only downside - bottle leaks at the top a little.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so wonderful. I love it and wear it everyday and constantly get compliments on it. I would recommend this perfume to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 14 yr old niece and of course had to smell it out of &#x27;curiousity&#x27; and actually ended getting some for myself.</li>
    <li> It is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrances!</li>
    <li> I paid half the price as I would have in a department store or any where else on line, and got twice as much product. My daughters loves it!!!        Barb In New Jersey</li>
    <li> Smells very nice but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She likes it very much. I don&#x27;t  see it very attractive but it is not bad too. If your girl likes this and used it before I would recommend buying it amazing price for a big bottle.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition. I bought it for a gift.</li>
    <li> I love Curious it has a lovely clean smell,wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is a very light fragrance and seemed to have lasted for most of the day. This is something I would purchase as a spring and summer fragrance. Not too bad!</li>
    <li> How anyone could give this a positive rating amazes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stinks of alcohol, no &#x27;notes&#x27; to it. Celebrity perfumes tend to be a waste of money and poor quality but this takes the biscuit. Want quality? Go for Estee Lauder Beautiful.</li>
    <li> love it the best smell ever . I might order more and hope my shipment hit my door step . thank you</li>
    <li> Overall a VERY good perfume that smells just INCREDIBLE. Would recommend anyone to get it.</li>
    <li> This item came in earlier than promised. It was in great condition. It was exactly as it appeared in the description. This was a christmas gift for my daughter who was happy to get it. It smells great too. I will be buying from this site again.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!  It is one of my favorites.  My only negative is it doesn&#x27;t last long as the scent is weakened.</li>
    <li> THIS SELLER WAS VERY QUICK AND PROMPT WITH THE DELIVERY. NOT TO MENTION I LOVE MY PRODUCT. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING SO LONG AND HARD AND NOW I FOUND IT. I DO PLAN TO DO BUSINESS AGAIN :)</li>
    <li> The wrong perfume was packaged and shipped.  Paperwork was all correct though.  The kicker is that perfume is classified as hazardous materials, so I could not ship it back.  After a few headaches, I was able to reach a real person and a credit was issued.  Good for Amazon for stepping up.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume one of my all time faves! smells amazing my husband loves it. and of course bottle is adorable. i dont think Britney has ever made a bad perfume though.</li>
    <li> I love the smell the size it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> I tried this on in the store to see if I would like it I didn&#x27;t like it smelled like older lady perfume to me ill stick with the Fantasy Perfumes</li>
    <li> No smell, more like alcohol</li>
    <li> I can only rate on the seller as I have purchased this as a gift for my friend John. I hunted for weeks for this perfume because he looooves it. And for the price I bought it at it&#x27;s a great deal. Very well packaged he&#x27;d going to have to wait though to get this gift the third of three gifts for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was VERY prompt as I got it today while at work, and it was nicely packed and sealed in bubble wrap.</li>
    <li> This has a very....\\&quot;fleshy\\&quot; smell that I don&#x27;t particularly like.  Waaaaaaaay too heavy on the musk for me.  I&#x27;d describe it as a sweaty, or oily smell.  I think I&#x27;d recommend it as a summer scent though.</li>
    <li> I was buying this as a gift for my sibling. She loved it and the price I was able to get it for.</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite perfume-everyone i know (including my husband) thinks it smells great!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, smell drives me crazy! Love it!</li>
    <li> Its a perfect gift to your family, friends and great value. I gifted my sister and she loved it, fantastic</li>
    <li> this is a beautiful bottle of perfume.  we love the spray atomizer. i got this for a great price at amazon on sale. very pleased.</li>
    <li> Got this purfume when it was on sale way cheap.  I probably would have paid the full price though it&#x27;s well worth it!  Great scent, you don&#x27;t need a lot and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This perfume is a great value and very sophisticated smell. It lasts for a long time and I receive many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume because it was cheap, and I had seen a lot of commercials for it over the years. It smells so weird, my boyfriend says the same thing, just gross. I cant understand why there are so many 5 star reviews.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite. just wish it wasn&#x27;t getting harder and harder to find</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  This one is my favorite.  The size is perfect, and the smell is very seductive.  Try it and you won&#x27;t regret you bought it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my wife. Smells great and was exactly as described. For the lower price, well worth going through Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;-Logan</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it I love that I got samples of other perfume to try to its a good product</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter. Exceeded her expectations!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff for years. It&#x27;s got a sweet, clean smell that&#x27;s great for everyday wear. My guy loves it - he compliments me on it constantly. That&#x27;s a win in my book! Doesn&#x27;t last as long as more expensive perfumes but it is great for the price.</li>
    <li> Great buy, love the scent and was very lucky to received compliments on it. I normally wear it for work or special occasions. And the packaging is quite lovely.</li>
    <li> Im in love again!!! :) hands down this is my fav smell!! I ordered this before as a little happy for my self when feeling down and will buy more!!! This was well packaged and recived earlier than expected.ordered from perfume world here on amazon, and i must say they were fast! Will order again from them.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the price was awesome.</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL smell. I love it. Hell, I like smelling it even when I don&#x27;t have anywhere to go and haven&#x27;t got any on. I love it!</li>
    <li> Okay so I am going to write a review for this product after one year of use. I bought this perfume before starting dating my fiance I think or a little after (not sure about that) but till today this is his favorite perfume ever. Although I have more perfumes and all are more expensive that this one, but I love this one. Not only the scent is amazing but it has a nice price and stays long, too. I just got a lot of complements last weekend for wearing this perfume. No one believed its actually this perfume. Sounds like works perfect with my skin. Just to let you know, I have a super dry skin and no matter how much oil or moistrizer i apply no perfume stays on me. So I happily give this product 5 star. Hope they continue their quality and their great price.</li>
    <li> So disappointed with this perfume, on me it stays for about 15 minutes and that&#x27;s it. It doesn&#x27;t last long at all. The scent doesn&#x27;t smell like the one you&#x27;d get at an actual store.. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Its awesome.. thats what I wanted in best price :)</li>
    <li> Since I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore, I had to order here. But this will absolutely be my favorite all time fragrance. I also have several high end fragrances such as Versace, D&amp;G.. But Curious from Britney Spears is my favorite lol</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume because I read online that it smells like Ralph Lauren Blue perfume....at a much more affordable price.  I definitely can smell the similarity and I really like this perfume...but Blue is still my Fav.  (I will just ask Santa for that one...LOL)</li>
    <li> My mom loves this perfume. This is the BIG size. Great price...great product :-)</li>
    <li> I think she smells great wearing it and she loves wearing it! Also a great deal in this size and the container is nice.</li>
    <li> muy buen producto la mujer encantada con esto lo unico es que deberian envalarlo mas pequeño para que el envio no sea tan costoso</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my oldest duaghter she has worn this for years off and on. Price is good!</li>
    <li> The smell is not really what I perceived in the perfume of my country. it really is not. I do not like at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using Britney Spears perfume for 7 years now (I hate to admit that it&#x27;s britney spears). Before I would just drive to my local large department malls or Kohl&#x27;s and buy it there. Of course, way over priced, but had to purchase it because where else am I supposed to get it. Until I found Amazon. Not only did they have my product and much more of her line, but they had it in bigger sizes for cheaper than the small one at the mall! I ordered it and put a &#x27;standard shipping&#x27; on it and I got in about 4 1/2 days right to my door. If Amazon and their promoters ever got a virus or something and couldn&#x27;t connect with us consumers and I had to go out of my way for a drop of perfume that is 3 times the price....I think I would literally have a panic attack!</li>
    <li> Love the smell!!! Buy it!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. I love it, but more than hate the name. Better than Curious In Control.</li>
    <li> Favorite everyday perfume. I&#x27;m on my 6th bottle, even when I try others, I always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> As a 32-year-old woman maybe I should be embarrassed that my favorite perfume on the planet is Curious by Brittany Spears, but I am not :)&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments on how soft and clean-smelling this perfume is. It is not heavy at all. It is light and airy. No matter where I go I always get compliments on this perfume. I can&#x27;t go any where without someone saying how good it smells! I&#x27;ve smelled her other perfumes and I HATE them. This one is the perfect balance for an everyday perfume. Plus the price on Amazon is out of this world!!</li>
    <li> I would not buy this cologne. I bought some three years ago and over time the stuff turned yellow and became like gel. I have other colognes and parfums that I have had for much longer that never changed consistency like this stuff. Unless you plan on using it all up within 6 months, I would not waste my money.</li>
    <li> I really love the scent of this perfume.  I have allergic reactions to many scents.  Not with this perfume.  I have been buying this perfume from this seller for years. I am very pleased and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the Britney perfumes. I used to wear it a lot when I was in my late teens/early twenties. The scent reminds me of Barbie&#x27;s hair, as strange as it may sound. Very light, floral, and feminine. Little girls always commented to me that they liked my perfume.</li>
    <li> This is out of production everywhere! So glad I could still buy it here, especially in the big bottle :)</li>
    <li> From the paper packaging opening to the smell itself. I always find myself smiling at this perfume. 8 years ago I was 15 and picked this up. I&#x27;m not really into \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scents, but this one has had me head over heals ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume reminds me of my high school days, when I thought I knew everything and there was no wrong. For some people it&#x27;s coca-cola or momma&#x27;s cookin&#x27;, but this is what really takes me back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy This Item! It&#x27;s a great scent for a great price! I display the bottle in my room all the time. You wont be dissapointed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it did take a while to get here, but that&#x27;s what happens when you order from the opposite end of the country...</li>
    <li> I bought two Britney Spears perfumes, and they arrived almost empty the sealed was  bad all the perfume was outside the bottle and I´m really upset with this product because for the manufacturing error i lost my money.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume in a spray bottle from superwalmart for around $7 and it smells pretty decent. I&#x27;ve used this perfume years ago when I was younger and decided to grab a bottle of this one since the smell is pleasant and the price was unbeatable. I use it before going out and after each shower. Keeps me smelling nice.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. Very light and simple but a beautiful sent. Lasts quite a while. Many compliments are given when I wear it. Also it was shipped very quickly and packaged safely</li>
    <li> My sister bought this the other day and sprayed it, and all i could really smell was an alcohol like nail polish odor. it did not smell like a light perfume at all. its very strong but maybe a bit over powering. I am not a fan of this one, britney has many others i love but this one is just alcohol smelling more than anything. Not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> I could not believe my eyes when I open that box.I was in shock by the size of this bottle of perfume.I order this for my daughter.And I&#x27;m thinking about getting myself a box.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the single most nasty perfume on the market. Worse than Red Door. Worse than Shalimar. Worse than White Shoulders. Worse than Designer Imposters.   This perfume smells like it&#x27;s bottle aroma from grandmas 50 year old wedding bouquet rotton and dry in the attic. I don&#x27;t get many florals out of this, or fruit, or anything that is even remotely sexy. I belive that to cover yourself in mothballs would be a better way to get people to ask you what you&#x27;re wearing. At least that smell is unmistakable. With this fragrance, people will think you just stink.</li>
    <li> I have never been more excited about a perfume ever in my life.  I am not a big perfume wearer, mostly I stick to body sprays but a customer of mine came in wearing this and I asked her what she was wearing and I ordered this the same day!!!  I have been wearing it everyday since, and I will be heart broken if they ever stop making this!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PARFUM&#x3D; BEEN USING IT FOREVER</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this scent got it for a great price.</li>
    <li> Perfume arrived very quickly; came with old fashioned atomizer, which was a pleasant surprise.  I always get compliments when I wear this perfume, from both men and women.  Not too overpowering, and not overly sweet/floral; just the right blend that is feminine and flirty.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my sister in law the package came in requested time frame and it was packaged beautifully and the bottle was very pretty and my sister in law loved it!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I am on my 3rd bottle of Curious. I have many wonderful perfumes because that is just my thing. But every and I mean every single time I wear this scent I get a compliment and they want to know who I am wearing. I carry the bottle in my purse not because I have to reapply but to give the admirers a visual of the bottle. This is a scent that is not too strong where it gives you a headache or where you have to wait for it to wear off to smell good. No this perfume is one that from the moment you spray yourself you just feel sexy. I love this perfume. While I thought I have my signature scent before, I always come back to Curious!!!! Doesn&#x27;t hurt that the price is soooooo checkbook friendly! You wont regret this purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> ?....love it, love it, love it...its not flowery like other perfums....but has a very fresh and clean scent to it...I would recommend this to any womam who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a walking rose</li>
    <li> Genuine perfume.  Great smell,great price.</li>
    <li> love the smell always have</li>
    <li> Producto en excelente estado, lo recomiendo amplia mente, yo vivo en Venezuela y el producto me llego en muy buen estado</li>
    <li> I love curious I wear it everyday I only buy it from Amazon . I get so many compliments on it. I give it give stars.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed by the size and how inexpensive it was. I will definitely by from this company again.</li>
    <li> i love this perfume and its cheaper online than buying it at a department store, i will always purchase it online due to the price and how fast it comes.</li>
    <li> Smells nothing light Ralph Lauren blue wish I could return. And smell is very no distinctive.  Hate it</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent.  Very cool and calming.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  Great recommendation.  Very pretty bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells very clean, kinda aquatic. It&#x27;s a very unique smell. It&#x27;s not really sweet, it&#x27;s more just different.&lt;br /&gt;If you want the sweet version of this, get Curious in control. It&#x27;s the sweeter version.&lt;br /&gt;More of a 18-35 y/o kinda scent.&lt;br /&gt;More day time than night scent.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting power is pretty good, between 6-10 hours (on me!)&lt;br /&gt;Silage is pretty good, I can be about a foot away from my bf and he can smell it, generally.</li>
    <li> I paid extra to have this shipped in 2 days....and ordered it on the 15th and I get an email on the 17th saying it has been shoipped and will be here by the 21st. Pretty irritating that I paid extra so i could have it  sooner and they gladly charged me but didn&#x27;t get it here within the 2 days.. Hopefully it&#x27;ll be worth the wait.</li>
    <li> nuca llego el liquido solo el envase roto</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it was a great deal I bought 2 and they came when they were supposed to</li>
    <li> I love this perfume it just doesn&#x27;t last long at all. As soon as you spray it on the smell is gone! Also the bottle was kinda broken at the top which was leaking in the box.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and was purchased from Perfume World, a very good company that packed it well and shipped it fast. Everything was perfect. The perfume itself smells like green apples, pears, honeysuckle and a tiny touch of smokiness? that comes out after a few minutes. I would disagree that it&#x27;s only for teenagers. It&#x27;s an everyday fragrance that smells fresh and fruity without being too sweet. It lasts hours on me and hasn&#x27;t faded too much. It&#x27;s really what I wanted DKNY&#x27;s Be Delicious to smell like but it ended up smelling weird and too sweet on my skin. Overall, a winner. I rarely give any fragrance 5 stars. The only other one I would probably give that high of a rating is Prada Candy which is about 3 times as expensive.</li>
    <li> Thus us honestly my absolute favorite perfume. It&#x27;s sexy but not too much. It&#x27;s very feminine and it isn&#x27;t too strong. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This is my third time I order this perfume, I love the smell very much and it keeps for all day.  I will order more in the future. Thanks</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance! Beautiful packaging and bottle. It Looks so lovely on my vanity table!</li>
    <li> Love the scent.I always get complement every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Britney, but never really been a fan of perfume. Scents that are too strong tend to give me headaches. But this one is amazing. It&#x27;s light enough that you can spray it on a few times without the scent becoming overwhelming, but strong enough so that you can smell it on yourself all day. I also have Fantasy and it has the same light qualities. Both are great scents, although I prefer Curious. I think the bottle is tacky, but that&#x27;s okay. Love it and will continue to buy it when I run out.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hot ass girlfriend!! She loved it!! She was amazed at the price and size of the bottle...better than Walmart!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and have bought this for several women, and Love this perfume! It is hard to describe smells, but this one is very pleasant and not overpowering like some other perfumes. I get migraines at times from some strong smells, so that is very important to me. This is a great gift idea for Valentines day or birthday or even Christmas. It is best to always find a way to get them to smell it first and be sure they like it, of course.</li>
    <li> Omg idk why ive putting buying this off for soo long. I used to have the very small size and loved it, then used it up and got another small one. This time i finally bought the big one. Smells so good just like i remember.</li>
    <li> my wife loves to smell good all the time even right when she gets out of the shower.  she has been wearing this perfume for many years.  i used to wait for it to go on sale at Walgreens but now its even easier to get on amazon.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping and the item is excellent- I&#x27;ve always use this perfume ever since back in high school and nowadays- they are so hard to find in stores so I found these items through amazon- I&#x27;m really happy about it and really good price. Thanks! :-D</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she loves it</li>
    <li> Good fragrance, good smell, I recommend it, you will feel fresh, and receives compliments are good, comes in good condition, well packaged. Thank You. I would buy again</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume I was a little hesitant because in store this bottle is twice if not three times more money. Great deal!!</li>
    <li> Love this sent, but the spray top isn&#x27;t working. Im still using it though.</li>
    <li> Amazing&lt;br /&gt;Great buy&lt;br /&gt;Love this perfume!</li>
    <li> Great feminine scent without being too sweet or too musky.  A perfect scent for every day use.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent. I always get compliments on it. I can never switch to another perfume ever. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very quickly and was packaged with great care.  My wife has been looking for this specific perfume for quite sometime and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and ask for this every year for Christmas. definitely worth the money for the size bottle. I even like the cute grange looking bottle</li>
    <li> The perfume was delivered very quickly and was exactly what I was expecting. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> i have used this perfume for several years and have not come accorss another with the same quality that matches me</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my Daughter for Christmas, she loves it. It&#x27;s a huge bottle and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Spraying a couple squirts on a day.  I&#x27;m not growing tired of it.  It&#x27;s yummy.  Beautiful bottle too.  I&#x27;m curious what the other Britney smells are like now.</li>
    <li> Smells sooo dAmm good 100% will buy more</li>
    <li> Omg I had the Britney purfume when I was a teen in high school and I missed it so much the last 8years I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s still available and I got such a great deal for the price! A must buy now my teen sister wants her own!</li>
    <li> I never wore perfume, body sprays or any other fragrance and I mean never until I came across Curious by Britney Spears. I get severe migraines and one of my main triggers is perfumes, colognes, any fragrance essentially. The cosmetics counter in department stores kills me, as well as BBW. Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even sure how to explain the scent, but it&#x27;s definitely not flowery, because that is the one scent that I can&#x27;t stand. It&#x27;s very light and feminine. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but you still pleasant. It&#x27;s not fruity either, because I feel like that is a childish scent.&lt;br /&gt;I typically apply it to my wrists and then rub them on the base of my neck. It doesn&#x27;t both my nose or my head at all! I can honestly say this is the ONLY perfume I have found that I can use on a daily basis!</li>
    <li> used this for years, love it!</li>
    <li> She has loved it ever since I bought her a 1.1 oz for xmas back in 2009....It was great for the price, I purchased this as my first gift to my mother since I got my first job, and now 4 yrs later my mom still likes it. It kind of smells like a little sweet but not that much its not over powering and its ideal for almost any age.....I reccomend this one</li>
    <li> i love this perfume, its my favorite</li>
    <li> This is not an overwhelming scent and my boyfriend really likes it. One or two sprays lasts you through the day. It is not a teen scent or an old lady scent, if you know what I mean. The item arrived on time and I had no issues with shipping. I&#x27;ve always loved this scent since I was a teenager and I think it still suits me.</li>
    <li> Even at 81 1/2 I feel sexy when I wear this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who asked me for it and loves the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I wish that you work the more and more to improve it quality because I find the quality isn&#x27;t anough strong.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite scent and I was so glad to get it at this price. Arrived early &amp; everything!</li>
