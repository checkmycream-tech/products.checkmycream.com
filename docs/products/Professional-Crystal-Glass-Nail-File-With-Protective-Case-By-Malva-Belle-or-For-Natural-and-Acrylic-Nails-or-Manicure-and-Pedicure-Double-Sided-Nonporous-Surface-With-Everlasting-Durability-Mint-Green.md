<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this this file.  It works very well, plus it has a really ice case.</li>
    <li> Love this nail file! Does a great job and isn&#x27;t too weak or aggressive. Nice smooth file. I like that it comes with a case to keep it in. It prevents it from getting broken.</li>
    <li> Wonderful nail file with a case to put it in leaves nails very smooth.</li>
    <li> Nice product.Takes more time to file your nails.It is in between filer and buff.</li>
    <li> What a beautiful nail file, well worth the money! At last my nails so smooth and even. Wow I am so impressed with this crystal nail file, it files so perfect and with just a such a simple and light touch.I am very crazy about about my nails since I have gotten worse with my MS, if I have a small burr or break it will drive me crazy until I fix it. Other nail files don&#x27;t even compare to this nail file, in beauty or action! I never thought I&#x27;d say a nail file is pretty but, it is. I keep one in my purse so it is always with me and I am buying another for my nightstand so it will  always there.I will never use any other nail file again .&lt;br /&gt;To tell you the truth,  I have never splurged and bought a crystal or glass nail file. I&#x27;ve always use the cheap emery boards or something like that on my nails. Now I have a mess with all the medicines my nails split and averages of them. This beautiful nail file is amazing. I am so glad that I got this nail file! I will never ever reason find reason to use anything else. Not only is it beautiful, but it is so good for sensitive nails... it&#x27;s gentle,  it&#x27;s just amazing, I can&#x27;t find words to describe it. If you&#x27;ve never splurge for your nails do it now!</li>
    <li> I just took off my acrylic nails, but I hate carrying around nail files in my purse. They always scratch up things that I keep in my purse. I love the feel of this file, plus it comes with its own case. :D</li>
    <li> I really love the file for natural nails. It creates a smooth finish. As a suggestion a mini  file for your purse included would be great. But I would recommend getting this it came quickly and works ️as described.</li>
    <li> Love this nail file, very durable &amp; will last. Only file I&#x27;ll need. Very pretty &amp; perfect for my purse.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful new addition to my mani-pedi kit!  It&#x27;s made of hardened glass with engraved (rather than etched) ridges for exceptionally smooth filing.  It doesn&#x27;t tear or split the nail when filing.  Unlike a lot of emery-type files, it doesn&#x27;t attract bacteria or dirt.  It can be rinsed after use to keep it sparkling clean.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a protective case that can be tucked in a nail bag, handbag, or even a small clutch.  The case is a very soft peach rose colour and is very stylish!&lt;br /&gt;The crystal file can be used on both real and artificial nails. I absolutely love it.  I received this file for the purpose of review. All opinions are my own and based on my own use of the item.</li>
    <li> This is a handy little finger nail file to have in your purse!  I always have a problem with my nail files wearing down.  This one is made of a glass product and works great!!  Comes in a nice little case to protect it!!  I love it!</li>
    <li> After using this file for a few weeks now, I understand what all the fuss is about when comparing this against the old faithful emery board.  PROS 🔸Easy to clean - just use soap and water. 🔸Lasts longer 🔸Can be sanitized and sterilized (YES!!) 🔸Glass files seal the keratin layers of the nail together  CONS 🔸If you drop it, it&#x27;ll shatter 🔸When filing your nail, it doesn&#x27;t allow any bend to conform to the shape if your nail...shaping the nail especially the sides can be outright difficult to do with a crystal file. 🔸The container that the fine is kept in isn&#x27;t made of quality material. There are several noticeable scratches. Not sure what&#x27;s up with the hole at the bottom.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this file on my nails, I love the clean look afterwards. I will never go back to using cardboard files again.  Was it worth it....yes Would I purchase again....yes  I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This nail file is a mixed bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: It looks nice and it will hold up with lots of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: There&#x27;s not enough texture to really file nails effectively. It works to smooth out a snag, but takes forever to shape nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Very nice design, fine file but it could be a little thinner.</li>
    <li> This file is fantastic! It leaves a very smooth edge, lasts for a lifetime. It comes with a heavy duty case. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;-Chrissy</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail file. I really didn&#x27;t expect to see much difference between one nail file and another, but his nail file is really the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. It does a great job of filing without being rough on the nails. And the case that comes with it is a lovely bonus! Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use a drugstore nail file ever again.</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Not sure how it works, not like any other file I&#x27;ve used but did a great job!!</li>
    <li> File works well, and love that it comes in a travel case to keep it protected in my purse.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review. When I bought this I thought I was getting a nail file but this doesn&#x27;t actually file anything. The grittiness of the surface is so fine that it really only rounds the edges of my nails. I have to use a different file and then the one helps to buff my nails and round the edges and sides a bit. It would take forever to actually get anywhere if you were trying to file down the length of your nails.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites, love the case and crystal file</li>
    <li> I have always used a crystal nail file. This product is perfect. And the best part it comes with a hard case so it won&#x27;t break. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I am a classical guitarist and as such I am always concerned about having a very fine, smooth surface on the edge of my nails.  This file is the very best I have found to do this.  Nice case is a plus as well.</li>
    <li> I love this file. It is very eliquent and I love the case it comes in.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This so SO FINE that I wouldn&#x27;t even consider it as a nail file. It&#x27;s more like a buffer. It will take forever to file the edges of your newly clipped nails. But, if you only want to smoothen you nails edges (already filed nails) then this one is for you.</li>
    <li> The file does what it is supposed to and it comes in a really nice looking case.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.  Says it works great, seems very durable and looks like it will last a long time.  Had a little trouble getting the nail file into the case initially but eventually got it in there and no problems since.  Regarding the durability - dropped the file onto a tile floor and it was fine (in case you were worried about it easily breaking since its crystal).  Recommend!</li>
    <li> Not exactly sure what this product is supposed to do but I believe it&#x27;s supposed to have the same effect as a jade nail file. Seems ok but not best material.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to purchase this crystal nail file! It works so well, love that it comes with a matching case. The only negative I&#x27;d consider giving this product is that the case itself is very cheap, it feels and looks cheap but the nail file itself is amazing! Definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a nice clean edge on their nails.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the purse</li>
    <li> I signed on to review the Genuine Crystal Nail File by Malva Belle in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. While every woman likes new Nail Swag, I knew the best, most critical customer would be My Mother ;). I handed her this Nail File, asked her to do her Nail Filing Business a few times and to report back to me on her Likes and Dislikes. A few days later My Mother called me with her assignment fulfilled. I cannot do this product justice any other way than to offer this direct quote from My Mother- &amp;#34;I threw away every other Nail File in my house (Daughter) and I want a half dozen more of THESE.&amp;#34; I wish I could convey what receiving such a well regarded opinion from *My Mother* really means and how hard it is to get her approval :). She reports that the Genuine Crystal Nail File by Malva Belle is, First Of All, beautifully crafted, solid, durable and &amp;#34;pretty.&amp;#34; She appreciates that it comes with a case for storage. She also reports that this file did not break, chip, or crack her nails, nor did it cause injury at the cuticle line. If you are in need of a Nail File and want one of the best available, Mandy&#x27;s Mother gives this Genuine Crystal Nail File by Malva Belle her Seal of Approval. Now if *I* could just get her Seal of Approval... ;).</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  It is a good quality glass nail file with a nice coordinating case.</li>
    <li> As long as it lasts, it&#x27;s the only file you&#x27;ll ever need! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to a lady friend at work and she absolutely loved it</li>
    <li> This nail file is AWESOME!  I purchased this to replace one that broke and I&#x27;m really enjoying it!  It has such a nice pretty case too!  Great find! :)</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  Durable and work just fine!</li>
