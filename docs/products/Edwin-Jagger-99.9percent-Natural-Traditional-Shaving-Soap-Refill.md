      <li>This is a very nice shaving soap.  </li>
      <li>great aroma and easily suds up for a great shave!!</li>
      <li>Aloe does a good job soothing the skin, and I&#x27;ve stopped using aftershave because of it.</li>
      <li>Lathers up nicely and smells great.  </li>
      <li>I recommend getting E. Jagger&#x27;s apothecary shaving cup, since these pucks fit perfectly in it.</li>
      <li>Recieved the item quickly and am very happy with the lather, fragrance, and performance of the product!</li>
      <li>Makes very good, fine lather</li>
      <li>Smells great, very light scent, refreshing.  </li>
      <li>but I find it smells  quite nice.</li>
      <li>Nice high-quality soap.</li>
      <li>Also, while it is Aloe Vera scented, it doesn&#x27;t have nice lingering fragrance after the fact.</li>
      <li>However, the soap does make for a nice close shave.</li>
      <li>Nice lather, pleasant, mild scent</li>
      <li>Great product worth the price.</li>
      <li>Soap is a bit pricey per/oz, but I like it and considering it&#x27;s alleviated my need for aftershave, it kind of works itself out.</li>
      <li>It is very smooth and lubricates my shave well.  </li>
      <li>Out of three brands, this soap was our favorite based on ease of lathering and skin conditioning.</li>
      <li>much better than others</li>
      <li>I love this shaving soap.</li>
      <li>I used Barbasol for many years being easy to get and inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Good soap, gives me a very close shave.</li>
      <li>Great shaving soap - lathers well, smells great, makes your face super slick for the shave, and moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>This soap is fine.</li>
      <li>- you want a paragraph for a bar of soap - fine - I bought mine</li>
      <li>Lathers very well and lubricates well for a nice smooth shave.</li>
      <li>but the shave is smooth and comfortable.</li>
      <li>Will enjoy using this from time to time</li>
      <li>Made to fit the Edwin Jagger cup</li>
      <li>I thought this would be good for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>As far as shaving bars go this stuff works well and smells good too</li>
      <li>It really helps you work up a good, thick lather - perfect size.</li>
      <li>Good even for sensitive skin, prone to irritation.</li>
      <li>I saw that Edwin Jagger products get good reviews and the soaps are mostly natural</li>
      <li>It works very well, developing a nice rich lather.  </li>
      <li>It is kind to his very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Most of the irritation and redness are gone and my face is much smoother after shaving.</li>
      <li>Good lather and has a terrific feel after I am done shaving.  </li>
      <li>functionally this gives decent coverage, penetrates the beard well, and lets&#x27; the razor glide very smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Lathers quickly and a bunch of it.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the creams from Taconic Shave as they are much better on sensitive skin and lather much better.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell that stays with you for several hours but is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Foams nicely for me, and has a good, subtle smell, which I really like, as I&#x27;ve used soaps that are too overpowering.</li>
      <li>Partly because the soap doesn&#x27;t necessarily generate enough foam to be able to get a nice shave.</li>
      <li>My previous soap was Van Der Hagen Deluxe soap, which is good, but I wanted something a little more natural.  </li>
      <li>I put together a huge ensemble kit for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday so he could convert to an old school safety razor system.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use a shaving brush to generate enough foam for the shave.</li>
      <li>It is more of a standard cologne smell.  </li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s purely in the cosmetic department --</li>
      <li>If you enjoy a bigger, thicker lather, this may not do it for you.</li>
      <li>For the record, I use a double edged saftey razor with Merkur blades (also available at Amazon along with the Tweezerman brush).</li>
      <li>Fast delivery as well</li>
      <li>Edwin Jagger in my opinion makes only the finest shaving products available.</li>
      <li>and it just isn&#x27;t very slippery.</li>
      <li>I tried both mug lathering and face lathering and both work very well.  </li>
      <li>Makes an already very well appointed</li>
      <li>It smells nice, and appears to last for a long time, but the lather is somewhat lacking.</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, and this soap didn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
      <li>There is only one shaving soap worthy of the name:  Edwin Jagger.</li>
      <li>As far as it&#x27;s shaving properties go, the razor glides very well.</li>
      <li>Only complaint would be this is a very thirsty soap, it requires a LOT of water to get good lather.</li>
      <li>This is a good Shaving Soap, but not great.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to mess with my allergies.</li>
      <li>I first tried an artisan soap from a local market</li>
      <li>Where I live we have naturally soft water, so</li>
      <li>Really, multistep shaving becomes a drag fast!  </li>
      <li>so I can get my bristly  hairs soft for a close shave.</li>
      <li>shave set complete...</li>
      <li>and after I finish this particular soap, am going to try some of their other \\&quot;flavors.\\&quot;</li>

    <li> Great shaving soap - lathers well, smells great, makes your face super slick for the shave, and moisturizes well. I have pretty sensitive skin, and this soap didn&#x27;t irritate it at all. I recommend getting E. Jagger&#x27;s apothecary shaving cup, since these pucks fit perfectly in it. It really helps you work up a good, thick lather - perfect size.</li>

    <li> Great product.  much better than others</li>
    <li> I used Barbasol for many years being easy to get and inexpensive. But I had skin irritation and redness and my face (especially my neck and chin) felt sore. But this product has changed all that. Most of the irritation and redness are gone and my face is much smoother after shaving. I use this soap with the Tweezermann brush and I no longer dread shaving. Yes, it takes a while to whip up a lather and I will still use Barbasol when travelling but when at home this is the way to go! I love this shaving soap. Has a slight scent that some may not like but I find it smells  quite nice. For the record, I use a double edged saftey razor with Merkur blades (also available at Amazon along with the Tweezerman brush).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to mess with my allergies. Lasts a long time. Makes very good, fine lather so I can get my bristly  hairs soft for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Good even for sensitive skin, prone to irritation. Not such as foam or shaving gel. My husband is still focused on shaving gel by L&#x27;oreal. But it is great for him to use the soap in weekend.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent soap.  My previous soap was Van Der Hagen Deluxe soap, which is good, but I wanted something a little more natural.  I first tried an artisan soap from a local market but it was way too irritating on my face.  I saw that Edwin Jagger products get good reviews and the soaps are mostly natural so I chose this product.  It works very well, developing a nice rich lather.

It has a nice smell that stays with you for several hours but is not overpowering.  My only complaint is that the smell is not very natural.  It is more of a standard cologne smell.  It is still very nice.</li>
    <li> Lathers up nicely and smells great.  Leaves the skin feeling moisturized during your shave.  It does not feel dry like some other shaving soaps and a bar lasts for over two months, even when shaving every day.</li>
    <li> Edwin Jagger in my opinion makes only the finest shaving products available. Recieved the item quickly and am very happy with the lather, fragrance, and performance of the product!</li>
    <li> For shaving cream in bar form this was a great product. I wish they would invent a combination preshave oil and shaving bar so I could reduce my morning routine by one step.  Really, multistep shaving becomes a drag fast!  As far as shaving bars go this stuff works well and smells good too</li>
    <li> This is a good Shaving Soap, but not great. Partly because the soap doesn&#x27;t necessarily generate enough foam to be able to get a nice shave. Also, while it is Aloe Vera scented, it doesn&#x27;t have nice lingering fragrance after the fact. However, the soap does make for a nice close shave. Make sure you use a shaving brush to generate enough foam for the shave.</li>
    <li> min words realy - its shaving soap - you want a paragraph for a bar of soap - fine - I bought mine</li>
    <li> This soap is fine. It smells nice, and appears to last for a long time, but the lather is somewhat lacking.</li>
    <li> Nice lather, pleasant, mild scent</li>
    <li> The scent of this shave soap is INCREDIBLE and so sexy-manly! I put together a huge ensemble kit for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday so he could convert to an old school safety razor system. Out of three brands, this soap was our favorite based on ease of lathering and skin conditioning. No joke, by the end of that week, he proposed to me lol Edwin Jagger makes some superb soap!</li>
    <li> Lathers very well and lubricates well for a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> A little pricy for shaving soap, but my husband loves it. It is kind to his very sensitive skin. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Good soap, gives me a very close shave. Only complaint would be this is a very thirsty soap, it requires a LOT of water to get good lather. Where I live we have naturally soft water, so I don&#x27;t believe that is my issue. Will enjoy using this from time to time but I keep going back to Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite as thick as I would like it after mixing up my shaving lather but the shave is smooth and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Art of Shaving and some other soaps for about 10 years, but wanted to see if there was something that was a little kinder to my sensitive skin (not that those were bad, just looking for improvement).

If you enjoy a bigger, thicker lather, this may not do it for you. But that&#x27;s purely in the cosmetic department -- functionally this gives decent coverage, penetrates the beard well, and lets&#x27; the razor glide very smoothly.  I definitely plan on sticking with this for awhile and after I finish this particular soap, am going to try some of their other \\&quot;flavors.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great product worth the price. Fast delivery as well</li>
    <li> There is only one shaving soap worthy of the name:  Edwin Jagger.</li>
    <li> Smells great, very light scent, refreshing.  Puck is a bit on the small side.  It rattled around in my Van Hagen shaving cup.  Made to fit the Edwin Jagger cup only I think.</li>
    <li> Makes an already very well appointed shave set complete...great aroma and easily suds up for a great shave!! And I purchased this along with the 4 piece shave set mentioned....treated myself to a great gift!!</li>
    <li> Very good soap. Lathers quickly and a bunch of it. Non- scented which I like.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shaving soap.  Good lather and has a terrific feel after I am done shaving.  It has lasted quite well and I look forward to trying other styles of Edwin Jagger soap.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be good for sensitive skin but when I shave with this I get lots of razor burn and it just isn&#x27;t very slippery. I much prefer the creams from Taconic Shave as they are much better on sensitive skin and lather much better. Of course YMMV as it is quite possible the is due to local water conditions.</li>
