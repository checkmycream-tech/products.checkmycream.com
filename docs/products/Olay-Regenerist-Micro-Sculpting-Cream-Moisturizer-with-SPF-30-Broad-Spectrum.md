<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a daily sunscreen with anti-wrinkle features that is more than SPF 15.  Way to go Olay for creating an appropriate skin lotion for us women living in sunny places.  It&#x27;s not greasy and works all day long.  Will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> it was alot smaller than i thought given the price.</li>
    <li> I also had a problem with it running into my eyes while on my walk.  The burning was so bad I had to walk home with my eyes shut most of the way.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.  It&#x27;s a bit grainy, like an exfoliate - maybe I just got a bad batch?  And the product was heavy, too.  I didn&#x27;t want to put foundation on afterwards.  I wanted a product with a high SPF, but I&#x27;m really not happy with this one.  I&#x27;ll be glad when it&#x27;s used up and I can try something else.</li>
    <li> Love this non greasy, high sunscreen, perfect size to go through TSA carry on.  Lasts even though small size.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product and haven&#x27;t had time to see results but I love the feel on the product on my face.  I&#x27;m going to Haiti in a few days on a mission trip and also know I&#x27;ll be in the sun a good bit.  I&#x27;m exptremely happy it has a SPF of 50.  And more amazing is how it feels on my face, light, airy yet I can feel the little tingle that I know it&#x27;s working.  Yahoo! for Olay</li>
    <li> I loooovve this product!  I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks.  It keeps my skin soft and glowing. And it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy at all, unlike other mositurizers.  It is SPF 50 as well, protecting my skin from harmful UV rays.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mainly because of the high SPF. Most facial lotions have 15 or lower SPF and with all the health warnings, I decided to invest in something higher. It is recommended to wear daily sunscreen, even in the winter and reapply after several hours. I find most sunscreens to be sticky and greasy and have an off-smell. I don&#x27;t mind the smell too much but I do not want to put layers of greasy sunblock on my face, and I especially do not want to have to wash my face 3-4 times a day before putting on another layer. The Olay is not too thick and I don&#x27;t have any problems with grease. It absorbs well and I forget that I even have it on, at the same time is also moisturizes and leaves my skin feeling soft. It has a slight sunscreen-like smell to it but goes away after a few minutes. The bottle is very tiny and somewhat expensive but I honestly only use 3-4 drops each time. The lotion seems very concentrated and I put less than a grain size dollop and it spreads very nicely. I purchased this October 2011 and have used it almost every morning and I am not even halfway through the bottle. I think I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerating Lotion for about 4 years now, and I love the way it hydrates my skin throughout the day. It applies easily, asorbs quickly, and I don&#x27;t have to wait afterwards to apply my makeup. The SPF 50 provides excellent protection from the hot sun and keep my skin from getting sun burnt. I&#x27;m definitely gonna keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really notice a difference between this and my regular moisturizer, except that it costs more.  Does the same job.</li>
    <li> Protects my middle-aged skin from harmful rays while I work outside most of the day.  My skin feels soft and supple.  I&#x27;ve been an Olay user since I was 18 and my skin looks good.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and only used it once, but I like how it feels, not too heavy and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of the reviewers before me, I have allergies--and I&#x27;m sensitive to smell. I&#x27;m still looking for a nice sunscreen to put on my face without the bad smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell BAD persay, just like sunscreen. And certain smells give me a headache. But if smells don&#x27;t affect you, it&#x27;s probably fine.</li>
    <li> This face serum is not greasy at all, which is good when wearing during the day.  It doesn&#x27;t do wonders but it does the trick to add moisture to the face and neck.</li>
    <li> One of the only creams with SPF 50.  I use it every day/</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to artificial smells do not buy this product. It would be much better if it was unscented!</li>
    <li> This I have been using for a while now and I love how it makes my skin look</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned about trying this after reading some of the reviews because I HATE getting burning eyes from sunscreen products or moisturizers, but I didn&#x27;t experience eye irritation whatsoever. Thankfully, I&#x27;ve also had no issue with breaking out or with the smell of the product either.  The absolute best thing about this product is how lightweight it is! It goes on so smooth and evenly, and absorbs quickly without feeling heavy or sticky at all. My skin feels fully moisturized all day and I love the SPF protection. Yes, the bottle is small, but I&#x27;ve found just 2-3 pumps does the trick for face and neck, so I expect it will last quite some time. I&#x27;ve been using this during the day with the Regenerist serum at night, and I&#x27;d say both Olay products are well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m 41 and noticing fine lines I wanted to start using products that would slow the affects of aging. I ordered this after it was recommended as part of a complete skin care routine. I used the interactive feature that helped determine which products to use by my skin type and skin concerns. I love this moisturizer! It makes my skin feel soft but not greasy and it smells fantastic. It also absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait forever to apply my makeup afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love all my Olay Regenerist products!</li>
    <li> Heavy scent.  Love the Spf 50 and spreads easily and evenly, better than Olay ProX Repair Lotion Spf 30 which is harder to spread evenly.  But will not buy again until Olay makes a fragrance free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why Olay don&#x27;t you have a Fragrance Free lotion with Spf 50!!!!</li>
    <li> product arrived as spf15 instead of spf50.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. Works great for me. Being in my 60&#x27;s my face is dry. This takes care of that with the big plus of the SPF 50. Hope they never discontinue. Just wish price was a little less!</li>
    <li> i was highly disappointed that such a highly noted brand name product would spoil my face rather than mosturize it.im now searching for acne product after using olay for barely a week.i had to use the rest on my body and discontinue using it on my face.i never had problem with acne until i used the so called olay.im never buying it again.</li>
    <li> This was an item I had to get for my wife on the weekend.  They don&#x27;t stock it any more in Costco or Sam&#x27;s Club.  And, instead of going to the Pharmacy I looked on line for the best price. We got it just in time for the summer and it&#x27;s work great.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for few weeks now. Lines are much smaller if not gone. Slight burning at first but only lasted a minute and stopped all together after couple days of use.Very light not greasy. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have looked many places for this specific SPF and it is at least $5 more in a store. This is a deal!</li>
    <li> I have to say I love Olay product. but this product is not for sensitive people. My eyes burn and get red when apply it to my face. But my skin looks pretty. It maybe have hard  quimicals I do not know I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore. I ordered another cream for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used OLAY products since I was 16. Now I&#x27;m 42 and can easily pass for 30 not just because I was blessed with good genes:) OLAY products have played a role and UV defense regenerating lotion SPF 50 is no excepection. Most important is offers SPF 50 so I can go out with/without make-up and never have worry about sun damage&#x3D;wrinkles ladies. It hydrates and provides the anti-aging nutrients my skin needs to both prevent and correct any damage, ie: wrinkles, crows feet, sun damage, protects against free radicals. All the while making your skin feel refreshed, never sticky or shiney with a radient glow. Great under make-up. If you&#x27;re over 35, it&#x27;s time to get grown-up moisturizer because the mirror never lies unless you use OLAY UV defense regenerating lotion SPF 50 (lol).</li>
    <li> Good price, good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products with a high SPF formula, but many of them tend to be greasy and absorb slowly.  Olay&#x27;s formula hydrates my dry skin well and keeps it hydrated throughout the day.  I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive products, but always return to Olay.</li>
    <li> Olay products have always been good for me, but not this one.  If you have fair or sensitive skin, beware. My skin became red and irritated immediately. I removed the product but still broke out in red bumps that took nearly a week to heal. Just a word of caution - check the ingredients list and know your skin type before you purchase. Olay still ranks high with their other fine products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this previously and it makes my skin feel good.  No foul smell.  The SPF 50 works.  I&#x27;ve been in the sun constantly for a month now and have had good results.  Keeps my skin safe.</li>
    <li> Olay just great roducts</li>
    <li> This is a product that lives up to the hype. I have used it for years and noone knows my actual age when they first meet me.</li>
    <li> I wear this SPF50 moisturizer everyday and have for years.  I swear by it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Olay Regenerist Advance Anti-Aging UV Defense Regenerating Lotion SPF 50, by accident thinking I was purchasing Olay Regenerist UV Defense Regenerating Lotion SPF 15; big difference.  The SPF 50 formualation burned and cause me to peel and I developed a allergic reaction.  I had no such reaction with the SPF 15 formulation. Beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penelope</li>
    <li> This skin cream is strongly scented, causing my allergies to act up.  In addition, it made the skin around my eye area really burn.  I was careful to avoid getting it too close to my eyes, but this is supposed to be UV protection for the face.  My eyes are part of my face.  I&#x27;m headed to the sink to wash this off.</li>
    <li> ended up purchasing because of positive reviews on it by Paulas Choice for best of best Spf 50 moisturizer,  Paula is right about this one!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use to buy expensive creams and lotions.  Oil of Olay is just as good if not better then those other overpriced products.  It leaves my skin moist and feeling good.  The SPF is an added plus.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this stuff. It&#x27;s cheaper than the moisturizer with SPF I was using previously (Boscia Oil-Free Daily Hydration w/ SPF 15) and has a much higher SPF (though I remember reading somewhere that anything above SPF 30 isn&#x27;t any more effective). But this product just does not work well with my oily skin. I put it on, and less than an hour later, I&#x27;m shiny. I didn&#x27;t have this issue with the Boscia moisturizer. Cost aside, I decided to try something different because while I think SPF 50 is a bit overkill, I think SPF 15 is, well, underkill : ) I guess my holy grail is an oil-free moisturizer with SPF 25 or 30. Alas, my hunt continues.</li>
    <li> This is my daily moisturizer- and I LOVE that it has sun protection up to SPF 50 in it! I have a strong sensitivity to fragrances and am pleased that this one does not have one. (other Regenerist products DO have a strong fragrance... I can&#x27;t use them!) I have normal to oily skin and do not notice that this makes my skin more oily at all. I will keep using this and other Regenerist (unscented! ;P) products. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> As soon as i apply this cream my face starts burning and being in the sun/heat makes it even worse (unbearable). Terrible product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a great price on Amazon. Although it has a high SPF - which I like - it does not feel heavy on your face at all.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I have a history in my family of skin cancer.  This product provides a good moisturizer with a strong sun protection  I could nolonger find this product in the normal places ie Target, Walmart, Walgreens or Kmart. Very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this olay face moisturizer. It moisturizers well, but it doesn&#x27;t help the fine lines or scars on my face. I do like the high spf in this moisturizer. So this product is just okay to me, probably won&#x27;t repurchase. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different. So while this face moisturizer might not have worked for me, it might be great for your skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a lifeguard, and this works great for her nose in the summer. She has sensitive skin and can only use Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> This has become a standard product for me. It is very lightweight, and moisturizes without feeling greasy. It is as good as I have found for the money.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products, but not this one.  Awhile after I applied it, some got in my left eye and it burned terribly.  I had to pull over and flush my eye with water at a gas station!  I don&#x27;t want to have to use two products - one around my eyes and one for the rest of my face.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue with Olay products, just not this one.</li>
    <li> vary saisfied with the  price and having a schedule for replacement is a great service. It was delivered on time or even ahead of their estamit</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular Olay Regenerist Serum for years, ever since I read about it in [[ASIN:0553383302 The Skin Type Solution]] and [[ASIN:1877988340 Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me (Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me)]].  After recently being diagnosed with two pre-melanomas, though, I wanted to kick up the level of sunscreen that I wear on a daily basis, so I picked this up.  I really like it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before finding this Olay product, I had tried a few other sunscreens, but they all ended up pilling up when I applied my foundation.  This Olay lotion sinks right in, and I can apply my primer and foundation right afterwards, with no pilling or balling.  I also use it on my neck and upper chest -- basically, on any areas that will be exposed to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this isn&#x27;t available in a fragrance-free version as the serum is, the smell is really light and pleasant, and it dissipates shortly after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this a few weeks so it&#x27;s too soon to tell if the anti-aging benefits are working, but I&#x27;ll try to update my review after I&#x27;ve used it a bit more.  For now, I really like the smell and the high broad-spectrum SPF level.</li>
    <li> I heard good things about this line of products, so I tried this item. It is very heavily scented, which drove me crazy - I felt like I had dipped my face in cheap perfume. It also burned a little.  It does go on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave any residue, so maybe if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or a sensitive nose. Just know that others with you will probably smell it on you.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in good shape.  I use it twice a day to reduce the lines on my face and to moisturize my skin.</li>
    <li> Usually I have no problems with my skin, but I tried this in place of my normal SPF for 2 days, and it gave me tiny whiteheads and blotchy bumps all over my face and neck. Since I normally have clear skin, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s this. (I&#x27;ve not had a problem with either silicones or fragrances before, either.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also balls up and rubs off super easily -- if you try to apply anything else to your face afterwards, like blush or foundation, this sloughs off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it has a strong perfumey smell. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> When I use the Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream (purple jar) at night, and then this for the day, it works great.  I prefer it to the red regenerist Oil of Olay jar that is supposed to be great.  When I use it alone without the night cream, however, I don&#x27;t see the same strong results. It is pretty light and doesn&#x27;t seem greasy to me at all. A small amount covers well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now.  When I go even a couple of days without using both lotions, I can tell a huge difference in the elasticity of my skin, along with my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging UV Defense Regenerating Lotion based on the recommmendations from the olay.com website.  I have combination (oily &amp; dry) skin.  So far, I am happy with the results.  This product does moisturize while not causing my skin to become shiny or oily looking.  The only con I have discovered about this product is that it is not truly a \\&quot;lotion\\&quot;.  This product is much thicker that many other \\&quot;lotions\\&quot; I have used.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this lotion at such a great price almost half of the price at Ulta. But this was too heavy and I could always feel the product on my face. Didn&#x27;t get to see any long term effects so this may work great for other ladies. I was not able to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years. Other sunscreens with 50+ SPF seem greasy or tacky. It does not cause my skin to break out like some others. This one dries down without being tacky. Makeup goes on over it okay after a few minutes. For all day in the sun, I would recommend reapplying after several hours.</li>
    <li> great stuff, you don&#x27;t even feel as you have any thing on you face, love the product and will get more</li>
    <li> I find the product a little bit greasy.  The smell is mild and so far my skin didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction to the product.  Also, I noticed that the product is not really smooth on the skin. It&#x27;s a little bit gritty when I apply it on my face.</li>
    <li> MOISTURIZING&lt;br /&gt;A simple application keeps me moisturized during every season.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning with or  without make-up.&lt;br /&gt;The 50spf keeps my face safe from melanoma.</li>
    <li> Great cream. Light formulation so not too creamy. Easy to wear. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay Regenerist lotion with SPF50 for 10 years or more and have loved it. People say that I look younger than my age. I give the lotion the credit. I do not detect a smell. It&#x27;s also used close to my eyes with no burning unless it actually gets in my eye. The bottle stays shut if the pump is moved back to its original position when purchased, although it would help to keep it in a zippered cosmetic case if it&#x27;s carried in a purse. To me, if there ever was a 5-star product, this is it. I especially love the 50SPF.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and inexpensive light weight moisturizer with 50spf! Will buy this again and again! Hopefully I can find it w/ free shipping!</li>
    <li> I really like this face lotion, it isn&#x27;t greasy like some of the other lotions out there, you only need a little bit to do the job.  I have dry skin and this works better than some of the other lotions I have tried.  The only issue I had is that it is expensive and some lays in the bottom of the bottle so you either need to toss it or tip it upside down and try to put it in the next bottle your using.  Over all I&#x27;m very happy with the product</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years! I love that it as SPF of 50. It provides the moisturizing I am looking for. Does not clog pores and provided smooth base for make up. I use it year round.</li>
    <li> Love this for sunny days. This keeps me from burning while keeping my wrinkles at a minimum</li>
    <li> As a woman in her 60&#x27;s, I love this lotion! Only brand I have found at reasonable price that has 50 SPF.  I live in central Texas &amp; strong sunscreen is a must for a woman&#x27;s face!!</li>
    <li> This bottle is so small, you cannot pump any product out of it.  You get one squirt, and then it will not give any more product.  An attempt to provide so little actual product in a container that you cannot get any out.  I like Oil of Olay&#x27;s other products, but this packaging and small quantity is useless.</li>
    <li> Moisturizers nicely , not heavy or greasy like some lotions with sunscreen . Very high SPF of 50 which provides excellent protection. Highly rated by Paula&#x27;s Choice ,And an excellent value for such a nice vitamin and antioxidant enriched product.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, and finally something that feels good on your face and has a high SPF content! It&#x27;s not like globbing on sunblock on your face...the consistency isthe same as regular face lotion, and it absorbs pretty fast. It might be a smidge shinier than face lotion without SPF, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that smells nice, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, and give you lots of SPF for your face, this is a nice product.</li>
    <li> This is good. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and just right under my makeup during the summer. It has an SPF of 50, so I use it on my neck, front and back, where I&#x27;m exposed to the sun due to the cut of my shirt. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but they give me that heavy greasy look on my skin. Yuk! This absorbs beautifully, and it works to protect, and helps with wrinkles, too!</li>
    <li> I have had 5 skin cancers removed from my face so need to use SPF 50 to prevent possible future face skin cancer.  OLAY was recommended to me by a dermatologist.  I use it every morning, faithfully.</li>
    <li> I find this is the best sunscreen/lotion for my face and neck. No greasy feel, no clogging pores and it keeps the skin well moisturized even though I work outside all day every day.</li>
    <li> I have used this for the last t0 yrs. and I still get compliments on how I look, I&#x27;m really 84!</li>
    <li> Great sun protection, but feels bit gritty, presumably from having so much extra SPF ingredients.</li>
    <li> too small ，but the design of the bottle looks big，</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for over a year now and love it.  It moisturizes well without causing blemishes.  I particularly love that it&#x27;s SPF 50, which has done a fantastic job of protecting my skin and preventing further brown spots.</li>
    <li> Olay Regenerist Lotion with sunscreen is light and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly and completely.  I wear it all day, every day.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very smooth, I have rosacea and break out if I get too much sun but using this in the morning so far no problem.</li>
    <li> maybe you can see this at a local drug store but it&#x27;s really small for this price.    i hate typical sunscreen&#x27;s smell, especially when i put it on face. even they say fragrance free, usually some chemical smell there. the smell of this one is really mild.      no cap. so if you put it in the bag, possibly accidentally push the pump.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear when outside all day in the hot sun and I even apply it 1/2 hour before going out.  However, after a while in the sun it runs into my eyes and they start to burn and tear.  Also the EWG notes it contains 6% OXYBENZONE (Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Violations, restrictions &amp; warnings, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Persistence and bioaccumulation, Enhanced skin absorption, Biochemical or cellular level changes) but they don&#x27;t give it an avoid warning, just a low caution.  [...]</li>
    <li> Great protection (50spf for face), smooth application and it absorb easily. I would suggest it to those who have dry-normal skin. I have a sensitive skin and this one all right for me.</li>
    <li> I have used exclusively as a sunscreen for the past two years.  It does a great job protecting my skin without break outs.</li>
    <li> One product that does it all. My skin always gets compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this SPF 50. Easy size for travel too.</li>
    <li> bought this for the SPF only. kind of expensive for the size, and also tingles my skin, feels like its burning. maybe i just have sensitive skin? i dont know. probably will not buy another one.</li>
    <li> I have been searching awhile for a moisturizer that properly moisturizes my skin and protects it from the sun, as I feel like regular sunscreen has too much of an oily feel to wear on my face every day.  Note that all skin types are different so what works for some may not work for others.  I have moderately fair skin that is combination, somewhat oily and prone to break outs in the t-zone (still at 34! :/ ).  Anyway, the moisturizing has never been a problem, this works great for my face: not oily, doesn&#x27;t cause blemishes.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the protection until it was recently tested.  I apply this in generous amounts every morning.  One day I photographed an outdoor wedding and was out in the August sun much of the day.  My husband helped and neither of us remembered to apply sunscreen.  The next day his face was burned, but mine was barely touched by the sun.  I did however have a little burn on the back of my neck and some color on my arms.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out why he burned and I didn&#x27;t since typically my skin would be in worse shape, until I remembered my moisturizer.  Full protection after a day in the sun:)  Anyway, I hope this helps.  I worry a lot about too much sun on my face, early wrinkling and skin cancer, so this was a big decision for me.  This is the moisturizer I will stick with.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay SPF 50 for some time now as I normally use it as my main sunscreen for my face. It works great.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift to a friend. She loved it. She was thrilled when she got it. Great shipping and price as well</li>
    <li> Great protection (50spf for face), smooth easy application, best applied to just showered skin ( or semi-moist/damp skin as w/ most facial skin products) as it enhances it to absorb easieer. No break outs -I am happy, and would suggest it to those who have dry-normal or problem skin.  I am a RN and very picky about skin care, this one rates pretty high.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, no perfumy odor,works well.  What more is there to say?  This is my third bottle!</li>
    <li> I use this when I know I will be in direct sunlight and the SPF 15 lotion when I&#x27;m not. It is light on the skin and you don&#x27;t need much to get great coverage. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and can use this without problems. I like the clean smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Great product. Serves as a non-greasy sunscreen but also a smooth under makeup moisturizer. I use it every day without fail even if I go without makeup.</li>
    <li> Whilw other sunscreens start to drip into my eyes when I start to sweat, this stays put and provides excellent protection. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m happy to pay more for a product that feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to most high SPF sunscreens and this one is one of them.  It makes my skin break out starting on the second day after use.  I will not use this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is not too bad for every day. It does protect well when you are out and about, and has protected well when I was out for several hours out in Missouri summer sun. It also doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes like some other sunblocks have before. I just wish it didn&#x27;t feel and look so greasy on my skin, the only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me. I do prefer to use this over sunblock for being out and about on a normal day.</li>
    <li> Too heavy and sticky for my oily skin. Very shiny looking as well. The worst part is that it stings my skin when I put it on and I get small itchy red rashes throughout the day. I will return this.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!</li>
    <li> It works effectively, is not greasy, and smells nice.  The only lotion with SPF50 that works for me. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it has SPF 50, I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting sun screen on in addition to moisturizer. It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky like sun screen.</li>
    <li> Plan to put this on a subscription order. My wife uses this each day. She likes the fact that it has a good sunscreen in it and it works well as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this product - second time I&#x27;ve purchased it.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Great feeling - great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really finicky with face creams because I&#x27;m very sensitive to sticky or oily creams.  This is neither - completely top notch.  Nice thin formula, very light, great fragrance, and leaves less of that &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; SPF feeling than some of my SPF15 creams.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive but totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was very careful in selecting a high rated item, with the benefits and ingredients I wanted. I couldn&#x27;t use it more than once because the fragrance is so overwhelming it gave me a migraine. Why would they ruin a product with something so unnecessary? A waste of my money and I waited too long and can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 and I&#x27;m not even sure what kind of skin I have. It&#x27;s psycho. Sometimes it&#x27;s dry, sometimes it&#x27;s oily, sometimes it breaks out and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  I have been through a plethora of lotions including Neutrogena which worked the best for me for about a week.  THIS lotion, I have been using for over a month and i have never been so satisfied in my life. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion along with some olay cream facial wash. Every since I have been using this lotion my skin keeps a constant moistured level of awesomeness and i have seen improvements in my skin with an even skin tone. My occasional breakouts even seem non-existant.   I loooooove this lotion. The price is well worth it even though this is small, a little goes a LONG way.</li>
    <li> Like it for the sunscreen,  when I run out would like to order more at that price</li>
    <li> I always wear sunscreen.  I purchase the store brand with at least 30 SPF and broad spectrum period.  I have never had a problem with these inexpensive sunscreens and I use them on my face as well with very careful attention around the eyes because they are very irritating to the eye.  I purchased this Olay product because it popped up while I was purchasing another face product and it was a good price, had a coupon and boasted of moisturizers.  First off it did burn my skin.  Secondly after truly 20 minutes It got into my eyes and burned so badly I had to rinse them with water.  And beware it is small about 3-4\\&quot; in height total and about 3/4 of an inch wide I have small hands and I can hold the bottle in my palm less the top.  I won&#x27;t even use again.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, makes my skin feel great</li>
    <li> I actually enjoy the formula, my friend with dry skin says she&#x27;s not impressed with it because it sets on her skin, I don&#x27;t think that happens to me. I have combo/oily skin. But what bugs me is the strong and lingering fragrance!! It&#x27;s so strong, and does not go away for hours!!!!! Why can&#x27;t Olay make it fragrance free which is already highly demanded?! Please do so, and this will become a better review!</li>
    <li> really good lotion. works pretty well and it does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;put some on 15 mins before going out (don&#x27;t use this if going to the beach),&lt;br /&gt;day or night, and your ready.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers mentioned, the scent they put in this otherwise stellar lotion is just too strong. It makes my face sting and is overwhelming. I am using up the bottle on my neck, chest and arms and waiting for the unscented version before I purchase again. Really, Olay, consumers don&#x27;t always need their product to smell to be satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Bought for the SPF 50. Why don&#x27;t other moisturizers have a SPF in them. Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes. Not heavy, Good price.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out. I do find it a little greasy when I first put it on but that disappears when I apply foundation or powder</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I don&#x27;t understand those people that wrote about smell because this product has absolutely no smell at all! This is the best Anti-Aging SPF 50 lotion ever!!!</li>
    <li> Very good face lotion for the money, I have been using Olay for years and can&#x27;t tell the difference from the previous 20 years I used high end expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Have been using Oil of Olay products for 35 years, wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Now using Regenerist Lotion with SPF 50..absorbs quickly and feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> I shave my head daily, so use a lot of lotion on the advice of my dermatologist. This lotion is a great combination of reasonable price (compared to what you&#x27;d buy in a department store), high quality, and a high SPF level. The lotion feels great going on, and I can immediately see the difference. I just wish they sold it in a larger size, since I use it daily on my very large shaved head.</li>
    <li> Been using over 3 years.  This is a wonderfully formulated moisturizer that can double as a primer for me.  Love the high SPF, it sinks in quickly and doesnt leave my face greasy feeling or looking.  It doesnt break me out.  I do wish that so much product wasn&#x27;t left in the bottle that the pump cant get out.  I usually unscrew it and swish the stem around inside and pull it out to get alot more use out of it.  You could also cut it in half and put it in a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> i just started using this product and am waiting for the result..it burns my eye a little when i apply it but i think tthat will ago away as time goes on ..but i think is over price..</li>
    <li> What you would expect from an Olay product.  My face looks better!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Olay products since I was a teen, many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;This really does regenerate your skin!</li>
    <li> Olay Regenerist SPF50 was what I wanted to buy but it was not coming for less than $20 in any store. At Amazon its is coming for a very low price.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is good. It does make your skin smoother. Though you need a very little lotion to spreed evenly on the face and the neck, its quantity is still its downside. I do not know how effective is SPF 50 over SPF 15. But it does give me the confidence of going into the sun with out fear.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review after a month of its use.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading. take care.</li>
    <li> Good product. Skin does not feel oily after using.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the SMELL! Why is the fragrance so overpowering? Why is this scented at all? who wants their scent to come from a facial lotion? If half stars were allowed, I&#x27;d probably give this 3.5. The consistency is fine and it absorbs nicely into my skin. However, for the price per ounce (which isn&#x27;t terrible, but this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap either), I don&#x27;t expect to smell like I bathed in dollar store perfume.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greasy and makes my skin feel heavy and oily. I traveled with this little thing and it&#x27;s terrible for that. It constantly spills, squirts so I have to carry it in a plastic baggie. This thing really needs a lid. I thought this would be a good buy because I love the Olay Regenerating Lotion without sunscreen... but this is just a major disappointment. The sun protection in this product is pretty good though, but it&#x27;s certainly not worth the price. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> The lotion works well but its very perfumed and the pump quit while there was still a fair amount left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 2 star rating as the product I received was open. The packaging says you have to twist the top plastic cap to open - I have bought this in stores before and always had to do this to open the packaging. However, the one I received was already open on top. Has anybody else had this experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this for its SPF50 because I am treating my acne with topical ointment during the night and have to use very strong SPF for  my face during the daytime.  This was the only thing I could find and initially I thought the little burn was because of the acne that was in varying degrees of healing as my acne went away. Unfortunately, the burning did not go away as the acne went away. I have since replaced it with a new Moisturizers by Neutragena which also has SPF 50.  I really love it and it&#x27;s at Target.  Anyway,  this is I am happy to say I will try to finish it off and then just by the other ......</li>
    <li> I use it on my face, and keep some in my gym bag for after swimming. It&#x27;s light absorbs quickly and has a great spf.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with sunscreen to use in the summertime.  However the product that was sent had less than 3 months before it expires.  I will end up throwing most of it away because I cannot use it up in time.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Anyone worried about their skin and aging should see if this product works for them because the sun is one of the top dangers to skin and this is spf 50 which is the most protection I&#x27;ve seen offered from a moisturizer. Yes, it does have a smell. You know what that smell is? Smells like sunblock, doesn&#x27;t it?? Why don&#x27;t people understand on here that the higher the level of SPF, the higher the protection for your skin, the stronger the smell will be?? The smell you&#x27;re talking about is NOT \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; they&#x27;ve added in, it&#x27;s what is going to protect you from looking like a shriveled prune at 60. That being said, the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me- considering what a high SPF it is, the smell is actually not bad at all and goes away after about 10 mins of being on my skin, max. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and it doesn&#x27;t horrifically melt into my eyes and blind me. To the people that happened to, maybe use a bit less? I love this stuff, it is exactly what I was looking for and I plan to use it always. For me, the slight \\&quot;sunblocky\\&quot; smell is a no-brainer trade off for superior sun protection for my face.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and my dermatologist uses it also.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use in the morning, year round.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I use.  Definitely paid less than retail stores.</li>
    <li> used it for a long time and it&#x27;s a perfect lotion and sunscreen</li>
    <li> It has good review, so I chose it. Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s good enough, but gentle enough for my extremely sensitive skin! I bought a few bottles so far. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay for over 10 years and it works great.  The Spectrum Spf 50 is a bonus as well.  I recommend it. Great buy. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a couple of years and it was great. Then I hit menopause, and the product was insufficient to push back the cascade of wrinkles and creepy skin that was piling on.  I think if you are in your 20s to 30s this product is wonderful, but when dealing with really bad wrinkles, this product just doesn&#x27;t do it.  I am still using the Olay Regenerist Sculpting cream and the Olay Regenerist Wrinkle cream; those two still work great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great service and great prices</li>
    <li> Great lotion, great rice, great service.</li>
    <li> Outstanding facial moisturizer with broad spectrum SPF 50, including my very favorite sunscreen, Avobenzone 3%. Just after showering or washing my face, I apply 5 pumps of this moisturizer mixed with a sprinkle of mineral makeup (Laura Mercier) for a perfect foundation that lasts 8-12+ hours. I apply the rest of my makeup as usual, or none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned the stinging around their eyes (and I have some cranky old eyes, let me tell you), but I apply a simple eye cream on indoor days, or Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Baby Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 60+ stick around my eye area; no problems at all. Most general facial sunscreens are torture on eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy or dry by the end of the day. Nice matte texture which suits me fine. Really pleased with this product; solid anti-aging benefits, and high SPF.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now. My skin is very sensitive, so it was hard for me to find high SPF lotions that don&#x27;t give me any breakouts. I am so glad that I found this product and it&#x27;s great to see it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (previously with an SPF of 30) for many years &amp; was very pleased when the SPF was bumped up to 50.&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily, religiously, &amp; I believe it has been a significant factor in my skin looking considerably younger than others my age (62).  It works as both a moisturizer &amp; sunscreen, with the added plus of having anti-aging ingredients.  It is far lighter in consistency than other high SPF sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, has a barely perceptible scent, &amp; doesn&#x27;t irritate my fair, sensitive skin. Purchasing it through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program is both economical &amp; convenient.  Amazon&#x27;s S&amp;S price is still below the sale prices at my local stores, &amp; I never run out.</li>
    <li> I got the exact thing I as looking for at a good price!!</li>
    <li> Trusted brand in a high quality suncreen with moisturizer.  Absorbs into the skin very well and you can apply your make up almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Used for years.  Clears brown spots for me. Keeps skin moist and has a great sun block.</li>
    <li> I love Olay!  A great base and an excellent sunscreen.  Not heavy, doesn&#x27;t pill/rill under makeup...all the important points and no shortcomings that I can relate.</li>
    <li> and it continues to provide moisture and sun protection without irritating my ridiculously sensitive skin. For me, it provides the perfect balance between dry and greasy. I wear it under a BB cream for double sun screen action. It also has a lovely scent.</li>
    <li> This product meets nobodys needs. this is very small in quantity and to tell you the truth this is part of a raketeering, a cheat of the consumer&#x27;s money.</li>
    <li> Well priced, SPF 50 moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes when you perspire.</li>
    <li> This is just not good. Like another customer said it irritated my eye area so much and made it burn. For some reason, it even irritated my eyes themselves and not just the surrounding area. I didn&#x27;t know it would be so harsh. This is supposed to be a good product, but I do not want to use a lotion that hurts my eyes and skin. My skin is not that sensitive either, so I believe this is just a harsh product.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, only daytime moisturizer with sunscreen I could find which works for me.  Absorbs well and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> Very light andnon greasy. Feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market</li>
    <li> This product is great. It not greasy on my face, applies evenly, smooths out my skin and provides good spf protection. Its my new go to morning application. Its a small bottle, but a little seems to go a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It is so fine and it only takes a small amount to  cover my face. It lasts all day and is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> TOOK A TRIP TO HAWAII AND USED IT&lt;br /&gt;EVERY DAY  -  GOT A NICE TAN AND&lt;br /&gt;NO BURN  -  LOVE THIS LOTION</li>
    <li> Very Quick and I love the product it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been using the olay regenerist brand for over 4 years.  Mainly the serum, eye cream, and night moisturizer.  It is the first time with this lotion.  Not sure if it was because of the spf in it, but my face feels like its burning especially around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m outdoors most of my day and Olay Regerating Lotion SPF 50 protects and moisturizes my skin without fail. I use it everyday regardless of the weather and I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn on my face in years.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend buying this product. It leaves stains on clothes and I have found nothing which will remove the stains.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect SPF moisturizer for complete protection against the Australian sun. I apply this every morning after cleansing and after my vitamin C serum as part of my anti aging skin care routine for best results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> Very light and wearable. Great SPF factor. I would recommend it. Just make sure you apply enough of it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good coverage, although it&#x27;s a big greasy and thick for under makeup.  I don&#x27;t use it very frequently because of that.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for me, a little pricey though.</li>
    <li> El producto recibido cumple con las expectativas esperadas, si el uso continuo de este es satisfactorio lo recomendaré a mis amistades.</li>
    <li> This is an OK product for me. It doesn&#x27;t sink into my skin as easily as the Neutrogena lotions.</li>
