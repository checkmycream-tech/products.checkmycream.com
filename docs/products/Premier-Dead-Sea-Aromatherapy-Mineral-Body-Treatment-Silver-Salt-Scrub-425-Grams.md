    <li> My husband purchased this mineral body treatment as a gift and I love it! I use this for a facial scrub. Whenever my skin feels dry or I have a small blemish, I put a dab on a damp washcloth and softly scrub my face...the results of a smooth soft face are instant and any blemishes are gone the next morning! The product goes a long way! I recommend this highly and am purchasing a jar for my 84 yr old mom and 13 year old granddaughter!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin so soft and silky - very moisturizing.  Great product and much more reasonably priced through Amazon than at kiosks in the mall or on the Dead Sea Cosmetics website.</li>
    <li> I especially like using this on my feet.  After massaging it in and rinsing off, they feel and look refreshed.  I have also given it to others as gifts.</li>
    <li> I am on my fourth jar of this mineral body treatment! The first time I bought it at a kiosk in the mall, which cost me a lot more than what Amazon sells it for.  I love this because it works better at softening my hands.  After using this I use the Premier Dead Sea Body Butter on my hands and they make my hands softer than anything I have ever used.  I have also started using it on my feet and I can already feel the difference, because they aren&#x27;t as dry.</li>
    <li> Makes my feet so smooth</li>
    <li> Nourishes the skin while exfoliating without drying or irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for over a year and find it consistent.&lt;br /&gt;It would be 5 stars except the price needs to be less.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My skin feels wonderfully soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It really makes your skin feel super soft after you use it. I love to use the Premier Dead Sea Aromatic Body Butter- Milk and Honey Scent after I&#x27;ve gotten out of the bath. The combo makes for super silky skin!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but not as good as the salt scrub I bought at the mall.</li>
    <li> I will buy it over and over! I can actually feel it taking the stress away after a long day.</li>
    <li> Good product! Cheaper than the Malls!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of dead sea minerals and this is a great product. I&#x27;ve used this for the past year and love it. I will order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I use it on hands and feet my skin comes out so smooth! It can also be used anywhere else you have rough skin. After the scrub I use the body butter, and it&#x27;s as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Incredible.</li>
    <li> I use this during summer and winter.  Softens, moisturizers and takes away any rough skin. My arms and legs are always prepared to bare because of this product. I previously had dry skin on my upper arms.</li>
    <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product it works very good</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Found it at my mall at a kiosk, and then the kiosk disappeared!  So glad I found it here.  It keeps my feet and hands soft, fixes my shaving bumps on my legs, and helps heal broken skin on my dry fingers (though that burns).  It works!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works well</li>
    <li> Took a bit longer than expected but was well worth the wait. Plus I could keep track my delivery anyway. Loved the extras. Would recommend seller.</li>
    <li> I received it this evening. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
