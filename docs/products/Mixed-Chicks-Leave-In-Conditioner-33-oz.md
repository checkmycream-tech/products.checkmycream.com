      <li>It&#x27;s almost like the magic in curling mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>The whole mixed chicks line is amazing!!!!</li>
      <li>I must say i am very impressed with all of their products, will definitely purchase in the future:)</li>
      <li>it considering how long it lasted and how great our curls look.</li>
      <li>Works great for my grandson who has long curly hair!</li>
      <li>This brand is true to it&#x27;s name.</li>
      <li>there is tremendous</li>
      <li>It does start off crunchy when it dries but quickly softens.</li>
      <li>But honestly, after trying these two products I wish I had bought the bigger size because curlies, this is it!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Anywho, I first purchased this product after a long drawn out search for the perfect hair product that would let me wear my hair naturally, while leaving my curls defined and soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>I have tried all sorts of products on her hair to keep it healthy looking and not dry and frizzy.</li>
      <li>I was on vacation, when I first tried this product and I have to say it works.</li>
      <li>the product first dries</li>
      <li>Love this product, have used it for several years now.</li>
      <li>This leave-in conditioner makes my fine 3 b &amp; c hair feel so soft and silky smooth , and makes my waves and curls pop , pop , pop , I put coconut oil on my hair first , and Eden&#x27;s body works coconut leave in conditioner , than I put mixed chicks</li>
      <li>It really controls my daughter&#x27;s curls and helps keep them defined.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and this controls &amp; defines curls without any stiffness.  </li>
      <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my hair @my hair is very curly.  </li>
      <li>And I really detest cleaning brushes.</li>
      <li>Some days I don&#x27;t use as much product as others and those days</li>
      <li>Additionally, most products tend to keep my hair wet for much longer than I would like, and most give me a wet look or a jerri curl look.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>My hair is curly but very wispy, prone to frizz, My daughter&#x27;s curls are tighter, kinkier, and frizzier.</li>
      <li>may take a few weeks to kick in if you have dry hair, but it works great after.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m black and Filipina.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many hair products for my curls.</li>
      <li>But with other products i find my curls separate easily, then I finger curl sections.</li>
      <li>I really like how soft her hair is with it.  </li>
      <li>My 2 year old daughter is biracial and has very curly hair.</li>
      <li>Her curls normally just frizz and don&#x27;t hold their shape, but with this in, her curls are well formed and springy.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for people who want their curls to be soft, moist, frizz-free and natural-looking.</li>
      <li>but I was able to keep moisture in my hair and very little shedding.</li>
      <li>and I also use it on my 3 yr old son&#x27;s hair too!</li>
      <li>I have tried different combinations trying to find the right balance of allowing the waves/curls to stay without the really sticky feeling left in the hair after the product dries.  </li>
      <li>after trying a few different products, i really wanted a creamy conditioner that was light enough for my hair, but still acted as a powerful moisturizer.</li>
      <li>After seeing all of the positive reviews and comments about Mixed Chicks on Amazon</li>
      <li>therefore I am certain that it will last me throughout the summer.</li>
      <li>Her hair is soft as silk.  </li>
      <li>soft and not frizzy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not  a 100% all natural ingredients if you are looking  for product like that, because that&#x27;s what I look for</li>
      <li>A little thick and \\&quot;gloppy&#x27;  does not seem to reduce tangles more than other products and creates significant build up quickly.  </li>
      <li>b/c a little goes a long way with this product:).  </li>
      <li>I use John Freda&#x27;s Secret Weapon finishing creme ($5 at most drug stores) or SoSilk Silk Drops (about $10-12 here online and cool because it can be used on hair and skin- be careful</li>
      <li>It offers slight hold on my hair whereas it is absorbed by my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>So far, mixed chicks has been the closest thing to fulfilling all my haircare needs.</li>
      <li>Mixed Chics allows my hair to air dry in its normal time, and my hair is naturally shiny looking.</li>
      <li>and i have very curly/wavy hair that tends to become dry and frizzy occasionally.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to start this off by first saying that I am in no way &#x27;mixed&#x27;, just african american (although my mom always tells me that african americans are blessed in that we have literally mixed with almost everything over time).</li>

<li> An expensive bottle which is well worth</li>
<li> I wash my hair 1-3 times per week depending on weather, but every morning I wet with a conditioning mist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My 2 year old daughter is biracial and has very curly hair. I have tried all sorts of products on her hair to keep it healthy looking and not dry and frizzy. The whole mixed chicks line is amazing!!!! It works wonders on her hair without harsh fragrances. Her hair has never looked healthier and I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Definitely recommend it for any curly haired girls out there!  Great product.</li>
    <li> Your hair will love it. This leave-in conditioner makes my fine 3 b &amp; c hair feel so soft and silky smooth , and makes my waves and curls pop , pop , pop , I put coconut oil on my hair first , and Eden&#x27;s body works coconut leave in conditioner , than I put mixed chicks leave in on top . My hair looks so awesome .</li>
    <li> I have tried different combinations trying to find the right balance of allowing the waves/curls to stay without the really sticky feeling left in the hair after the product dries.  I believe this has given me what I was seeking.  Some days I don&#x27;t use as much product as others and those days my hair is fuller, but when I want my hair to lay flatter, I use more and I get what I want.  How many products can give you choices without the need to add another product to the equation??  I love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to start this off by first saying that I am in no way &#x27;mixed&#x27;, just african american (although my mom always tells me that african americans are blessed in that we have literally mixed with almost everything over time). Anywho, I first purchased this product after a long drawn out search for the perfect hair product that would let me wear my hair naturally, while leaving my curls defined and soft to the touch. After seeing all of the positive reviews and comments about Mixed Chicks on Amazon I finally bucked up and purchased the 33oz leave in conditioner and the 8oz can of Mixed Chicks deep conditioner (why? because I&#x27;m a starving college kid and not made out of money thats why!). But honestly, after trying these two products I wish I had bought the bigger size because curlies, this is it! I&#x27;m converted!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only one wash, my hair is softer, shinier, and curlier than it has ever been in my entire life. Before today I have been a slave to the flat iron, but now that I have mixed chicks I can literally wash-and-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product first dries I noticed it was a little bit crunchy but after I srunched out the crunch I had shiny beautiful ringlets of hair alllllll over my head, which has never ever happened to me before.  I cannot recommend this product enough. Mixed Chicks all the way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mixed Chicks Leave-In conditioner for years.  Love this product!!!!  I have very curly hair and this controls &amp; defines curls without any stiffness.  Always get compliments on my hair.  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to so many curly haired people, with great feedback from them.</li>
    <li> Like that it is in larger size!  My grand daughters love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my hair @my hair is very curly.  Did not define my curls at all..still look frizzy..waste of money on this product.</li>
    <li> This is truly amazing! It may be pricy, but the results are great, love showing my curls! This is a must!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while now and it is the only thing that comes close to helping tame my super-curly, thick hair. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the shipping was delayed quite a bit due to the product being out of stock. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with that, but the company never notified me of this and I had to contact them to find out where my product was. They finally got around to telling me that it was out of stock and would ship when they got it in. It wound up being about a week or two late. But, it was fine once it arrived.</li>
    <li> After reading all the glowing reviews on this product, I thought my prayers had been answered.  I was incredibly disappointed that the product absolutely did not work for my daughter. We still have yet to find a product that will put an end to the nightmare of fixing her hair!</li>
    <li> This brand is true to it&#x27;s name. Having mixed curly hair, I have been through numerous products. This works miracles. My curls come alive and are beautiful. Satisfied and loyal customer.</li>
    <li> My hair is natural, thick and looks like 1&amp;#34; barrel curls. I have naturally soft black colored hair. I wash my hair 1-3 times per week depending on weather, but every morning I wet with a conditioning mist. I&#x27;m black and Filipina.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many hair products for my curls. Every drug store brand, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Ouidad, Living Proof, Mizani, and others. I do try to use sulfate and paraben free products.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this product was overpriced when I found it at the local Target. I figured I would try it out, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It has the consistency of a leave in conditioning lotion mixed with a serum. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair tacky, weigh it down, it&#x27;s not greasy, or drying to my hair. Additionally, most products tend to keep my hair wet for much longer than I would like, and most give me a wet look or a jerri curl look. Mixed Chics allows my hair to air dry in its normal time, and my hair is naturally shiny looking. Probably the most appealing feature is it gathers my curls nicely. I&#x27;m not able to articulate how or what it does. But with other products i find my curls separate easily, then I finger curl sections. By some kind of magic, I disburse Mixed Chics, brush in the style I want, and it gathers the perfect strands and curls them. I don&#x27;t even need to scrunch up my curls. It&#x27;s almost like the magic in curling mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I have 4 stars because I find myself deep cleaning my brush due to residue in the bristles. And I really detest cleaning brushes.</li>
    <li> The best and only hair product I use for my curly hair.  I&#x27;m Hispanic and have long curly hair.  I&#x27;ve tried every product out there and was still searching until I found this.  Amazing, it reactivates with water throughout the day, if you find some frizz in your hair.  Target and walmart sell it, try before you by, then buy the 33 ounce one from Amazon.  I guarantee you won&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> In short, I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past two years and I love, love, LOVE it! It makes my curls feel so moist, and it is not sticky or crunchy when it dries. I finally broke down and ordered the 33 oz.  Although I found it to be a little expensive for a hair care purchase, I found that I don&#x27;t have to use it every day therefore I am certain that it will last me throughout the summer. I highly recommend it for people who want their curls to be soft, moist, frizz-free and natural-looking. The only other suggestion I have is to add a shine/finishing product on the hair when it finally dries just to give it some sheen, which this product does not provide. I use John Freda&#x27;s Secret Weapon finishing creme ($5 at most drug stores) or SoSilk Silk Drops (about $10-12 here online and cool because it can be used on hair and skin- be careful b/c a little goes a long way with this product:).  Just my suggestions...hope they help!</li>
    <li> Love this product, have used it for several years now. Tried other but always come back to Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner even before I finish the other</li>
    <li> I just started growing my hair out, havn&#x27;t done that for 10 years&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know I had such curly hair. This product helps keep the curls&lt;br /&gt;looking soft and not frizzy.</li>
    <li> I Love this product.  It&#x27;s non-greasy; does not make hair feel matted; does not cause hair to dry out like some alcohol based product do; and does not become flakey or cause itching when it dries out.</li>
    <li> A little thick and \\&quot;gloppy&#x27;  does not seem to reduce tangles more than other products and creates significant build up quickly.  Will use a while longer and hope for better results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of creole descent and i have very curly/wavy hair that tends to become dry and frizzy occasionally. I swear i have tried everything! I was on the verge of getting a relaxer when i stumbled across \\&quot;mixed chicks\\&quot;. I must say i am very impressed with all of their products, will definitely purchase in the future:)</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Great product for me...</li>
    <li> after trying a few different products, i really wanted a creamy conditioner that was light enough for my hair, but still acted as a powerful moisturizer. I wanted it to boost my curls, without making them crunchy. So far, mixed chicks has been the closest thing to fulfilling all my haircare needs. It is the only product i use besides shampoo and conditioner, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from other women who wear their hair natural.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 4 year old daughter (who is half black, half white-and has extremely curly hair which can get completely frizzy).  We put it on at night after her bath.  I comb it through and then braid her hair.  In the morning we take the braids out and she has long beautiful curls.  Her hair is soft as silk.  It fluffs out over the day.  She gets one good day out of it.  The next day we have to either reapply or just leave her hair in braids, which is what we usually do.  I really like how soft her hair is with it.  It does start off crunchy when it dries but quickly softens.</li>
    <li> works great and is creamy and smooth on the hair for all styles i have chosen....Also love the testure and scent</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair that tends to form ringlets. I bought this product on recommendation from a friend and it really does work great. It lets my hair curl naturally without feeling stiff or greasy. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and I really love it!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product however it does not have all the necessary ingredients I need for a leave in conditioner...</li>
    <li> I have used this for 7 years now on my daughter&#x27;s hair and I also use it on my 3 yr old son&#x27;s hair too!</li>
    <li> Works great for my grandson who has long curly hair! It keeps the twists all day long and doesn&#x27;t allow his hair to turn in to one big ball of hair by the end of the day. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was on vacation, when I first tried this product and I have to say it works. It&#x27;s not  a 100% all natural ingredients if you are looking  for product like that, because that&#x27;s what I look for but it didn&#x27;t disappoint i was in Punta Cana in DR and the heat there is tremendous but I was able to keep moisture in my hair and very little shedding. I feel like this product along with Crazy Shea mostiuzer help me with the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes I will recommend this product to any and every one.</li>
    <li> I am Puerto Rican, Italian and Irish and my kids add in Dominican. My hair is curly but very wispy, prone to frizz, My daughter&#x27;s curls are tighter, kinkier, and frizzier. This works for us both. It really controls my daughter&#x27;s curls and helps keep them defined. Her curls normally just frizz and don&#x27;t hold their shape, but with this in, her curls are well formed and springy. I use two pumps on her and only 1 on me since my hair isn&#x27;t as thick or frizzy. It keeps my curls nice and eliminates the flyaway frizz I get. It offers slight hold on my hair whereas it is absorbed by my daughter&#x27;s hair. This doesn&#x27;t work well on my youngest, making her curls hard as if we used a gel, but the kids&#x27; leave in conditioner works very well in her thin hair. This size lasted us a year with daily use of two pumps for my daughter and twice weekly use for me. An expensive bottle which is well worth it considering how long it lasted and how great our curls look. I&#x27;ve tried everything from gels to oils to creams and this is by far the best curly haired product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> i recommend watching their online video  about usage.. may take a few weeks to kick in if you have dry hair, but it works great after.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, this is a product for you. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years. A small amount put on damp hair will give you softer, shinier, no frizz curls. Well worth the money.</li>
