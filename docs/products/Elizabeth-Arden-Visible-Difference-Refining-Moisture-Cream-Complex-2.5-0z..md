    <li> Been using this cream for years and love it!  Very moisturizing!  Use night and day!  Hope Elizabeth Arden keeps making this product!  Price on Amazon best!</li>
    <li> Great non greasy face lotion for my dry skin that also is prone to break outs.</li>
    <li> I have been using Visible Difference for over 35 years and this cream don&#x27;t feel it all like the one I had before from the Elizabeth Arden counter!! very dissappointed!!! the texture was like lanolin!! it dind&#x27;t spread smooth like the other one!! terrible and upsetting too.</li>
    <li> just started using but like the feel and texture</li>
    <li> I would have no face without it!</li>
    <li> About 20 or 30 years ago, I read in my copy of Consumer Report that Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s moisture cream was rated #1.  I have been using Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference Refining Moisture Cream ever since.  I&#x27;m 79 years old and I&#x27;m told often how nice my complexion looks.  I wouldn&#x27;t switch for anything.</li>
    <li> It keeps my face moisturized and I can see the fine lines becoming less noticeable. I use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> wife loved the cream. she used it daily for herself.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years!  Only available online so order two at a time.  I look younger than I am.</li>
    <li> I like the thick creamy, yet non greasy formula.  It is soothing to my skin and nice smelling.  It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but it makes my skin soft and moist.</li>
    <li> I have some problems with face creams ingredients and perfumes. This one causes now irritation or rash and is a very good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Have used the product for years.&lt;br /&gt;It got to my home fast.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this at Marshalls, on clearance. I&#x27;ve loved it ever since. It is NOT greasy, and seems to disappear into my face perfectly. I have since purchased this item here on Amazon, and am so glad they offer this item quite a bit more reasonable than the department stores. Now if I could only find a non-greasy eye cream...</li>
    <li> My bathroom is full of products I found either way too heavy or that didn&#x27;t provide enough moisturizing.  I am happy to say that this one seems to be just right...light enough that I should be able to use it in the summer, and moisturizing enough to use through the harsh winters.  Nice fragrance, too...very clean.</li>
    <li> Have been using Visible difference  for more than 65 years and have been&lt;br /&gt;told numerous times that I do not look my age of 93.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is in her early thirties and she loves it!  Already asked for another one when this one is gone.  It is light and not greasy but makes her skin feel good, even living in dry Colorado.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly, so I was glad to find it on line at a reasonable price. It arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This moisture cream has made a great difference in the appearance of my skin and I will continue to make this purchase</li>
    <li> I use this cream all the time and it has a nice fresh smell, but the one I bought smelled like it was old and on the verge of rancid.</li>
    <li> Visible Difference is a wonderful hydrating cream.  I plan to use it as long as E.A. manufactures it. It is great,</li>
