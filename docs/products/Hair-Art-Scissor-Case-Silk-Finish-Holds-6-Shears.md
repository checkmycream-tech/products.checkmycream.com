      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Very good i recomended</li>
      <li>Ideal for any stylist.</li>
      <li>Its a very nice and excellent quality !!!</li>
      <li>LOL..</li>
      <li>Everything works great.</li>
      <li>Happy with my purchase and received it in two days.</li>
      <li>These are great for any hairstylist that is looking for a place to keep everything together.</li>
      <li>The shear case is a great price, and a great protector for my shears.  </li>
      <li>Everything fits in there perfectly :) Fits your scissors , thinning shears and razor perfectly :)</li>
      <li>Good seller.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good case, I like it</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving it</li>
      <li>but this is a nice gift choice..</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I am sure that my hair dresser has one that costs hundreds..for his $600-$1100 precious styling shears..</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to be a leather case, it looks so cheap to me, I did not like it!</li>
      <li>Love it and well made.</li>
      <li>This thing broke on me on top so there was no way for me to fix it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So go ahead and feel safe buying cheap this time.</li>
      <li>If you just need something slim to hold your shears in a safe secure position, then this is fine.</li>
      <li>Scissors fit securely and zipper is smooth.</li>
      <li>Hubby gets free hair cuts.</li>
      <li>And they are free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t list measurements for some reason, so if you&#x27;re a GROOMER like me and are wondering if this will fit your 8.5\\&quot; shears, it will.</li>
      <li>Perfect, exactly what I needed will be ordering a couple more in a few days.</li>
      <li>It works perfect for small spaces.</li>
      <li>not sure how durable it is but for the price I think it is perfect for me..</li>
      <li>It looks neat, clean, lite.</li>
      <li>She loves the scissors very professional and able to keep the scissors all in one place.  </li>
      <li>As soon as I opened this shear case, the zipper broke right off.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>thank you so much</li>
      <li>But the elastic straps are more than sufficient for holding them in place, yes the strap on the left side is sewn to make 3 individual slots (even though it doesn&#x27;t look like it), and like I said: unless you&#x27;ll be using it to play football with, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>paid $13 for it a few months ago, and I&#x27;m already in the market for something more substantial.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
      <li>I just need to buy another one to fit my other six shears.</li>
      <li>Even fully loaded it won&#x27;t bulge, it has a hard front and back cover that will look neat and remain slim and easy to fit into any supply case/bag/</li>
      <li>esp for us lay people who know little about what&#x27;s COOL in pro scissor cases!</li>
      <li>The only thing is, IF YOU DO use it for shears 7\\&quot; or above, you won&#x27;t be able to utilize the little built-in sheaths on the right side (just use the elastic and bypass the sheaths).</li>
      <li>image to advertise the product, can believe that you are buying the complete kit, this case is also very simple to the very high cost, for that price it should bring scissors</li>
      <li>My case looks so professional on my station with my shears in it.</li>
      <li>but its true value is not more than $13-$14 (with the shipping cost).</li>
      <li>Great little carrier for my wife&#x27;s cutting supplies.</li>

    <li> Look to be well made.  Scissors fit securely and zipper is smooth.</li>
    <li> The shear case is a great price, and a great protector for my shears.  Happy with my purchase and received it in two days.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a hairstylist and she purchased for supplies.  She loves the scissors very professional and able to keep the scissors all in one place.  These are great for any hairstylist that is looking for a place to keep everything together.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Thin enough to fit in my purse yet let me carry them anywhere. Ideal for any stylist.</li>
    <li> My case looks so professional on my station with my shears in it. I&#x27;m loving it thank you so much</li>
    <li> Very good i recomended</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened this shear case, the zipper broke right off. Not a good purchase. Definitely do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are the best!!!!</li>
    <li> image to advertise the product, can believe that you are buying the complete kit, this case is also very simple to the very high cost, for that price it should bring scissors</li>
    <li> This thing broke on me on top so there was no way for me to fix it. But I guess for the price what did I expect</li>
    <li> I have 8 pr of scissors in this case that I use for Machine Embroidery..not sure how durable it is but for the price I think it is perfect for me..</li>
    <li> Love it and well made.</li>
    <li> works too well haha. Hubby gets free hair cuts. But I cut it now. And they are free.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my hair dresser. It serves it&#x27;s purpose well without breaking the budget. I am sure that my hair dresser has one that costs hundreds..for his $600-$1100 precious styling shears..LOL..but this is a nice gift choice..esp for us lay people who know little about what&#x27;s COOL in pro scissor cases!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this item it makes you believe you are ordering the entire kit not just the case. It took almost an extra week to come in and during that time I had went out and got what I needed.They did reimburse me for all my money.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something heavy-duty survive-a-hurricane, then spend the 40 bucks on leather. If you just need something slim to hold your shears in a safe secure position, then this is fine. Even fully loaded it won&#x27;t bulge, it has a hard front and back cover that will look neat and remain slim and easy to fit into any supply case/bag/drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t list measurements for some reason, so if you&#x27;re a GROOMER like me and are wondering if this will fit your 8.5\\&quot; shears, it will. But probably nothing above 9\\&quot;. The only thing is, IF YOU DO use it for shears 7\\&quot; or above, you won&#x27;t be able to utilize the little built-in sheaths on the right side (just use the elastic and bypass the sheaths). But the elastic straps are more than sufficient for holding them in place, yes the strap on the left side is sewn to make 3 individual slots (even though it doesn&#x27;t look like it), and like I said: unless you&#x27;ll be using it to play football with, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So go ahead and feel safe buying cheap this time.</li>
    <li> Now my scissors are in order. It&#x27;s a good case, I like it but its true value is not more than $13-$14 (with the shipping cost).</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a leather case, it looks so cheap to me, I did not like it!</li>
    <li> I love it! It looks neat, clean, lite. It works perfect for small spaces. I just need to buy another one to fit my other six shears. I definitely recommended it to any one. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Its a very nice and excellent quality !!! Everything fits in there perfectly :) Fits your scissors , thinning shears and razor perfectly :)</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth 21 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;I paid $13 for it a few months ago, and I&#x27;m already in the market for something more substantial.&lt;br /&gt;Take it from me...pass.</li>
    <li> Great little carrier for my wife&#x27;s cutting supplies. She uses it everyday</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Good seller.</li>
    <li> Everything works great. Does exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> As described! Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect, exactly what I needed will be ordering a couple more in a few days.</li>
    <li> was not what I expected but I solved well</li>
    <li> I order this shear case to hold 5 of my shears. I was not impressed when I received it. Very cheaply made. My shears hit each other when I close the case. Not happy with the case and I will be purchasing another one somewhere else.</li>
