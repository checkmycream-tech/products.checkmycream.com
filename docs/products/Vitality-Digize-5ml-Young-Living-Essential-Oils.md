    <li> Hi - my parents received the deep relief roll on and she uses it for her knee - she had knee replacement surgery and is still in a lot of pain.  I also received the breathe again for my dad and he uses it quite regularly.  very happy with my purchases - thank you!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Use on neck and chest. Nice smell. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I would recommended Breathe Again Roll-On because every time that I get a  cold or a cough, Breathe Again really help.  I would rate this as a number 5.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I have horrible sinuses and allergies and when I put this on at night I can actually breathe easier. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>

    <li> I have not used this product too much but it did I noticed a difference it my breathing. I recommend anyone who has issues breathing and can not afford to see a doctor to try this.</li>
    <li> This roll on is so wonderfully scented and seems to clear the head very quickly.  Just breathing it makes you feel better. This company better stock up.</li>

    <li> Great for colds love it it&#x27;s in my purse always on hand</li>
    <li> Love this product, really helps clear my nose!</li>

    <li> The one and only thing to make us feel better during allergy season! I&#x27;m currently pregnant, and have two little ones who have an allergy each (ragweed and pine) but both of them have trouble sleeping when they take any kind of allergy medicine. I&#x27;d much rather use a natural remedy anyway, but I didn&#x27;t find much that helped in the weeks of their allergy season- until I found this Breathe Again roll-on! We used it twice a day and our symptoms were very much in control, with no side effects. I could put it on them with just a quick swipe, and it smelled good to both of them.

We used it on three of us for a total of about 4 weeks, and from what I can feel, I think there will be several years left to this little bottle.</li>
    <li> I used this product before a race to help with my breathing. It did not help, and after the race my nose was running non stop.</li>
    <li> It does NOT clear sinuses at all!!! The seller and Amazon will refuse a refund. Buyer beware!!!</li>
    <li> Tried prescription meds, but nothing works better than this!! Love this!</li>
