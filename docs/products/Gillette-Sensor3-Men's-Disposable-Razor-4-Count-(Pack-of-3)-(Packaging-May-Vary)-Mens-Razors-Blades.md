      <li>I tried something else, but decided this would fit me better.</li>
      <li>As always a fine , dependable quality product</li>

      <li>Product and package looks just like a better (and more expensive)</li>
      <li>then I just throw it away and grab a new one.</li>
      <li>Same exact Razors as I have always bought in stores but</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s great for me because I have thick facial hair and the touch of extra space</li>
      <li>Stepped out the shower and grabbed this one, that he had already used, and it was still a very close shave.didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical because they are a fair amount less expensive than my Excel cartridges but after a few weeks of use I am very happy.  </li>

<li> Before I gave it any thought, I was going to write that these are just 3-blade disposable razors and not worth a review.  </li>
<li> I am unhappy with the product as it is too light and the blades too dull.</li>
<li> I thought I&#x27;d try these as a less costly option than the Mach3.  </li>
<li> Basically, these ARE just 3-blade disposable razors except that the blades are slightly farther apart than on every other razor I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
<li> One shaver lasts me a few weeks</li>
<li> Only time I have ever been unhappy with something from Amazon.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the blade is not as sharp and tends to pull without shaving closely.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m done with expensive &#x27;permanent&#x27; shaver bodies and replacement blade packs.</li>
<li> But the handle is still awkward, i.e., slippery.</li>
<li> The worst part is when shaving my head, the pulling resulted in my slicing off a section of my scalp.  </li>

    <li> These are great and at a fantastic price delivered!  I love Amazon Subscriptions!</li>
    <li> That is the razor I will use all the time.  I tried something else, but decided this would fit me better.</li>
    <li> These razors last a really long time. I was using cheaper razors, but I went through them much faster. I am a woman and I can get about a month out of one razor, better than any I have tried before.&lt;br /&gt;My husband can only go about 1.5 to 2 weeks, but of course, he is a man with thicker facial hay than what I have on my legs.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try these as a less costly option than the Mach3.  Unfortunately, the blade is not as sharp and tends to pull without shaving closely.  The worst part is when shaving my head, the pulling resulted in my slicing off a section of my scalp.  I will look for other options.</li>
    <li> Upgrading this review to 3 stars. The blades do indeed have covers. Somehow the cover of the first one I used fell off as I removed it from the box. But the handle is still awkward, i.e., slippery. The Sensor 3s I purchased from Costco had a rubbery, non-slip grip making them stable in my fingers.</li>
    <li> Great razors and great price. Could not find these in walmart and the price on Amazon is better.</li>
    <li> The item was OK and would order again but I feel the quality of Gillette is not as good ad it used to be.</li>
    <li> I loved these. Bought these four my husband and some Gillette Custom plus regular and they sucked. Stepped out the shower and grabbed this one, that he had already used, and it was still a very close shave.didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times.</li>
    <li> I ran out of razors after purchasing these for my better-half and I must say that they were much better than the pink razors of pain and blood. Totally worth it and much cheaper than the lady razors.</li>
    <li> Tried these as a potential replacement to my trusty Sensor Excel.  I was skeptical because they are a fair amount less expensive than my Excel cartridges but after a few weeks of use I am very happy.  These give a close shave and no razor burn issues.  I will be using these from now on.</li>
    <li> As always a fine , dependable quality product</li>
    <li> They are great. He loves them</li>
    <li> Same exact Razors as I have always bought in stores but the price here was great. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good service and value for the money.  Like having extra razors on hand and this is the best price I could find.</li>
    <li> Before I gave it any thought, I was going to write that these are just 3-blade disposable razors and not worth a review.  Fortunately, I did think about it.    Basically, these ARE just 3-blade disposable razors except that the blades are slightly farther apart than on every other razor I&#x27;ve used in the past.  That&#x27;s great for me because I have thick facial hair and the touch of extra space makes the razors easier to clean in between strokes.</li>
    <li> Product and package looks just like a better (and more expensive) Gillete Sensor 3.  The only reason I bought it.  Product performs like a cheap knock off.  Only time I have ever been unhappy with something from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m done with expensive &#x27;permanent&#x27; shaver bodies and replacement blade packs. These shave every bit as good. One shaver lasts me a few weeks then I just throw it away and grab a new one. Easy, effective and affordable. Finally. And the three pack was not 3 razors, but three packs of 4… so 12 total… such a deal!</li>
    <li> As advertised I expected replacement sensor blades but received a bag of disposable razors with three blades not two. I am unhappy with the product as it is too light and the blades too dull. I shall not buy these again.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, this seems to be rougher and not as long-lasting as the 2-bladed variation it replaced.</li>
    <li> does the job,at a good price</li>
