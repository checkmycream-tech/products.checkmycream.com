      <li>It works great provided you stick to it</li>
      <li>it fits great</li>
      <li>The girl on the advertisement is smiling, so I thought, perhaps she is happy with the results of the face slimming mask...</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this product is good.</li>
      <li>Needs more compression in the chin area.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is probably OK for the Bearded Lady to wear it, but for the rest of us</li>
      <li>but I was glad to take it off.</li>
      <li>you are still reading this review, you are probably a lot like me - very patient, nice and easy going person, that&#x27;s why you will be rewarded with the most important piece of information:</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my face.</li>
      <li>It is not at all comfortable</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works, but it is worth a try!</li>
      <li>does not work or fit and tore right off the get</li>
      <li>It goes on pretty easily though.</li>
      <li>This one works pretty well by covering my chin and my cheek part!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a strange product.</li>
      <li>&amp; I chose large.</li>
      <li>Not worth the money even though it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>Did slept with voberry wasn&#x27;t nice,day after had a marked around my face</li>
      <li>When you take it off, not only your face is not slimmed, or tightened, or  beautified in any way, but you have a long, bright red, scar-like line drawn-out from your lip all the way down to your neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Because it was designed for chimps apparently.</li>
      <li>Ordered too large and a waste to send back</li>

    <li> the only thing wrong about this product is that a seam is directly pressing into the chin area.  Otherwise, this product is good.</li>
    <li> Did slept with voberry wasn&#x27;t nice,day after had a marked around my face</li>
    <li> material was not good at all, it ripped by the chin!  I had slimming mask face with a different material that lasted for eight years, just have to replace it because it was  all worn out!</li>
    <li> Some people heads are big &amp; I guess I&#x27;m one of them its too snug for me to sleep in this. It is not at all comfortable &amp; I chose large. Amazon do have different brands i may go with something else.  However I have worn it for 2 hours but I was glad to take it off.</li>
    <li> I got it today I hope it works it fits great</li>
    <li> This product is weird. The placement of eyes doesnt match. Couldn&#x27;t wear it and want my money back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of a strange product. It goes on pretty easily though. If you&#x27;re looking for a face bra and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot to try one out, definitely get this one.</li>
    <li> The girl on the advertisement is smiling, so I thought, perhaps she is happy with the results of the face slimming mask...Other reviews pointed out that the fabric is a piece of junk. I did not find it to be that bad for the price. The total lack of instructions did not bother me, because it is not really rocket science - even a chimp could figure out how to put it on.  The total lack of packaging did not faze me either; I thought one less piece of plastic to trash the planet. I am not even upset that it took 4 weeks to arrive; I figured out that it traveled all the way from China.&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect miracles, and it would not have been bothered if the mask did not deliver what had promised: &amp;#34;face slimming and skin tightening.&amp;#34;  Had it produced the slightest results, I&#x27;d have given it at least 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are still reading this review, you are probably a lot like me - very patient, nice and easy going person, that&#x27;s why you will be rewarded with the most important piece of information: Do NOT buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product deserves 4 negative stars! Why? Because it was designed for chimps apparently. The way it is sewn it has a seam that presses against the middle of the chin. When you take it off, not only your face is not slimmed, or tightened, or  beautified in any way, but you have a long, bright red, scar-like line drawn-out from your lip all the way down to your neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is probably OK for the Bearded Lady to wear it, but for the rest of us NO, I would NOT recommend it! Shame on you Voberry, how could you put out something like this on the market?</li>
    <li> Sizes are not accurate.</li>
    <li> It works great provided you stick to it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it enough to say if it works or not so I&#x27;d have to say if you know you&#x27;ll do the work then get it. It can&#x27;t hurt to try it you just have to use it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe it works, it leaves marks on the face. Velcro is sticking to the fabric, damaging it.</li>
    <li> I have received this mask and am wearing it to bed at night.  I don&#x27;t know if it works, but it is worth a try!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my face. To loose in areas and too tight in different areas. Not happy with it</li>
    <li> How does a product not come with instructions. This product is a waste of money</li>
    <li> Too complicated. Have not figured out how to put all those detach  bands together.  Moreover, the product runs small.  A mess!!!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money even though it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> Needs more compression in the chin area. Velcro sticks to your hair.</li>
    <li> I like it! I just had my double chin liposuction done last month, and had my regular face mask on each day, but it doesn&#x27;t cover the cheek part. This one works pretty well by covering my chin and my cheek part!</li>
    <li> does not work or fit and tore right off the get go</li>
    <li> Ordered two, paid for two, but only got one…Betty C</li>
    <li> Ordered too large and a waste to send back</li>
