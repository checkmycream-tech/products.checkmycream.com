      <li>This serum is great, I apply it only at night under my favorite night moisturizer</li>
      <li>But one thing is true, if you want beautiful skin you must take care of it all the time since young age.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It would be nice to see it even more competitive as the price is still quite high</li>
      <li>As do fine lines/wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>Just the thing I have been looking for for years to keep my pores clean.  </li>
      <li>cleared up my adult acne and leaves my skin looking amazing.  </li>
      <li>and I use it regularly with good results.</li>

      <li>I have been using this serum for a few months now and it has greatly reduced the pigmentation and uneveness of my skin.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the price</li>
      <li>I recommend this serum for every woman who is serious having beautiful skin.  </li>
      <li>As an adult nearing 30, it&#x27;s important to take care of your skin.</li>
      <li>I have tried lots of products and this is the only product that I can truly say that I love after using it for over 2 years.</li>
      <li>It has improved my face so much!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the only product I use for acne, but it is definitely a good one and the bottle lasts for a long time since it is very concentrated.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really help.</li>
      <li>It took at least a month to start seeing results but now after a year of using it, I&#x27;m pretty sure I will keep using it because it just zaps those pimples so quickly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>BEST HIDDEN SECRET skincare there is.</li>

      <li>Had adult acne.  </li>
      <li>I have combo skin (adult acne)</li>
      <li>but my skin loves it as a great daily staple and I have complex skin, big pores, occasional hormonal break outs and yet dry in areas</li>
      <li>Seller also sent in a timely manner which was appreciated as I was running low on my prior bottle I had.</li>
      <li>It also keeps pimples from forming if you catch them early enough.</li>
      <li>After getting my hormonal acne under control I was left with a face full of scars and uneven surface.</li>
      <li>this was highly recommended along with other products for my AM and PM regiment.</li>

<li> When all other &amp;#34;active serums&amp;#34; is over 70$ with the same volume?</li>

<li> and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of other products and this one is finally something I can use that actually works without loading my skin with crazy chemicals and preservatives.</li>
<li> I wash with the Cleanser, then use a small amount of Active Serum, wait a minute or two, use the Hydra-Cool Serum, brush my teeth and then finish with the moisturizer.  </li>
<li> Also, small bumps on my forehead are gone.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few years now and it has been a life saver for me!</li>
<li> I wish it helped with hyperpigmentation (the only thing that has ever worked for me is Obagi, but REALLY opposed to using those awful chemicals) .</li>
<li> Crazy reduction in acne scars in only 3 weeks.</li>
<li> What is wrong with it?</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive but it works with consistency!</li>

    <li> BEST HIDDEN SECRET skincare there is. Crazy reduction in acne scars in only 3 weeks. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product was recommended by a fiend who is a skincare freak and must admit it has changed my skin forever! My skin is glowing, help with acne breakouts along with evening out my skin tone and scarring from acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and it has been a life saver for me! As an adult nearing 30, it&#x27;s important to take care of your skin. This product works awesomely! My skin looks great! Seller also sent in a timely manner which was appreciated as I was running low on my prior bottle I had.</li>
    <li> I became addict to this serum! It has improved my face so much! Use it twice a day with a face cream.</li>
    <li> Just the thing I have been looking for for years to keep my pores clean.  This stuff is amazing!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> After getting my hormonal acne under control I was left with a face full of scars and uneven surface. I have been using this serum for a few months now and it has greatly reduced the pigmentation and uneveness of my skin. It is well worth the price and I will be purchaisng again and again.</li>
    <li> this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;It was around $100 previously so I am happy to see it become more like $60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice to see it even more competitive as the price is still quite high but my skin loves it as a great daily staple and I have complex skin, big pores, occasional hormonal break outs and yet dry in areas&lt;br /&gt;the case of wrinkles and pimples.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time.  I have dry skin and this gives my skin the long-lasting moisture.  I apply it to my face and neck after a shower and then apply my normal moisturizer on top of that.  It gives me great results and I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
    <li> My sister&#x27;s skin always looks amazing so I found out what she was using and this is it...now my skin it looking shinny and youthful as well. : )</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it works with consistency! I was introduced to this product line by the world renown Dr. Stevens of Marina Del Rey, CA. I was going in for a facial and this was highly recommended along with other products for my AM and PM regiment.</li>
    <li> cleared up my adult acne and leaves my skin looking amazing.  Worked on my son&#x27;s acne also</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s really help.</li>
    <li> Works good so far.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation after 2 weeks using it. I hope to see great result soon.</li>
    <li> delivered quickly. Excellent product</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE the IS Clinical products!  I have been using them since they were recommended to me over 10 years ago.  I wash with the Cleanser, then use a small amount of Active Serum, wait a minute or two, use the Hydra-Cool Serum, brush my teeth and then finish with the moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve tried other products just to &amp;#34;mix it up&amp;#34; a little, but I always come back to these.  I wake up to a refreshed, clean face with a very light amount of healthy oil that has been brought forward through my pores so no dryness and wrinkling and yet NO ACNE... just naturally clean and healthy skin!  I LOVE IT! It leaves me with a great palette for putting on my makeup.  I don&#x27;t have any connection with the company, I just use and love their products.</li>
    <li> This product does appear to clear skin.  I&#x27;ve struggled with closed comedones for years, and I seem to have fewer since using this product. Also, small bumps on my forehead are gone. BUT. I wish it helped with hyperpigmentation (the only thing that has ever worked for me is Obagi, but REALLY opposed to using those awful chemicals) . After six bottles, it remains. As do fine lines/wrinkles. So, this product is half-successful.</li>
    <li> Never had skin this good!  Had adult acne.  Never again since I used this.  Changed my life.  Sent to both my kids in school.</li>
    <li> Great price...wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend and I use it regularly with good results. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Can someone explain why it is 39$? When all other &amp;#34;active serums&amp;#34; is over 70$ with the same volume? What is wrong with it?</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!! I have combo skin (adult acne) and when I used IsClinical Active Serum daily I notice a difference in my skin - I breakout less and my breakouts are less severe.  I have tried lots of products and this is the only product that I can truly say that I love after using it for over 2 years.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin as well as acne and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of other products and this one is finally something I can use that actually works without loading my skin with crazy chemicals and preservatives. It took at least a month to start seeing results but now after a year of using it, I&#x27;m pretty sure I will keep using it because it just zaps those pimples so quickly. It also keeps pimples from forming if you catch them early enough. It does smell a bit like alcohol because it has alcohol in it, but it&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t last on your skin. It&#x27;s not the only product I use for acne, but it is definitely a good one and the bottle lasts for a long time since it is very concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it also lightens acne scars!</li>
    <li> I recommend this serum for every woman who is serious having beautiful skin.  I always receive compliments how my skin is flawless, almost wrinkle free and I am close to 50 and never had any surgery or Botox.  But one thing is true, if you want beautiful skin you must take care of it all the time since young age. This serum is great, I apply it only at night under my favorite night moisturizer and I do like to wake up in the morning and see the results.  Buy it, you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> takes about 2-3 days for your face to get used to it if you have stopped using it.  have been using on and off for over 3-4 years and am always glad to receive a new bottle.  one dropper does an entire face application.  no need to over apply.</li>
