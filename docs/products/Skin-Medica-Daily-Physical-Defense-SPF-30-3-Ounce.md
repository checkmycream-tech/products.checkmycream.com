      <li>Yes, you heard it right.</li>
      <li>Have not been able to shake and squeeze tube to get it mixed up correctly.</li>
      <li>I see many reviews now of customers who have had the same problem.</li>
      <li>This was not the first time I had encountered this condition with this product.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s not water/sweat-proof, I&#x27;ll switch to more stable physical sunscreens in summer time.</li>

      <li>I have very oily skin,</li>
      <li>The white cast is very minimal and not noticeable on my fair skin.</li>
      <li>This product has been returned from all most all of our patients due to the water/product separation.</li>
      <li>It has a rather solid, dry texture so it will take some time to spread it evenly on your face, but it feels much better than most physical sunscreens.</li>

<li> In other words, you don&#x27;t know where the products have been, what conditions they were exposed to, or how old they are.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had two tubes of this sunscreen -- both purchased on Amazon but supplied by different vendors -- break down and separate into clear liquid and lumps of white goo.  </li>
<li> So that I was not putting nothing on my face for the past two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using up the whole tube last week</li>
<li> Onto my review...at first this product appears thick and white</li>
<li> The same as other user.</li>
<li> I bought mine one week ago and it already dry everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> Consistency is dry then watery</li>
<li> If skin is dry it won&#x27;t blend , so a gel moisturizer solves for me after cleansing face.</li>
<li> It is absolutely inexcusable to have such a consistently poor product at this price range.</li>
<li> The rest of the tube, after so much water came out, became dry and very hard to spread on skin, especially when it&#x27;s about to be empty.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s just different texture from my previous one purchased in store.</li>
<li> Once you get a handfull of the watery substance then the creamy part after it&#x27;s a total mess.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup, but may purchase this again for days when I&#x27;m not really going anywhere.</li>
<li> When I squeezed the bottle, I got a lot of clear liquid, then thick globs of product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like the fact that it&#x27;s oil free, however, left a white residue on my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine at my dermatologist and the product separated into water and a white substance.  I called the Skin Medica customer line and explained the problem.  The representative acted as if she had never heard of this complaint and had me return it to my dermatologist for a replacement.  The replacement product did exactly the same thing.  They need to work on this formulation.</li>
    <li> Product separated after a month. Shaking, refrigerating, nothing worked so I ended up tossing it. It worked good while it was stable, but like others I will purchase it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> We sell SkinMedica at our doctors office/medi spa. We order directly from SkinMedica. This product has been returned from all most all of our patients due to the water/product separation.</li>
    <li> The handles are too easy to be broken.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen for your face, neck, chest, and arms.</li>
    <li> The same as other user. I bought mine one week ago and it already dry everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;The product is defective! Don&#x27;t buy from this supplier: QskinZone</li>
    <li> i have filed complained about this product , seller will not exchange , this cream will turn into total liquid and you can not use . all of my 3 of them were like that .  seller said this spouse to be happen . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!</li>
    <li> great products, use them all the time, they are smooth and clean and go on nice, you will be happy to give them a try.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen separates and squirts out liquid.  Had to return it.  This was not the first time I had encountered this condition with this product.</li>
    <li> This has the best ingredients for sun protection and causes no problems with my skin. I use it on my neck and it works there too. I would highly recommend this for sensitive skin types. I love it!</li>
    <li> Yes, very good product !</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product from a highly reputable dermatologist in my area - 6 times! Each time, sometimes in days, sometimes in a couple weeks if I&#x27;m lucky, the product separates into water and paste. You squeeze the bottle and pure water comes out. The dermatologist&#x27;s office thought at first it was a bad batch. Six batches later the same problem continues. Luckily my doctor was very good about not making me pay for each attempt to find a bottle that worked and they have tried to work with Skin Medica to rectify - so far unsuccessfully. I have written to the company myself to urge them to resolve issue but have received no response from them. It is absolutely inexcusable to have such a consistently poor product at this price range. I have tried their SPF 50 and so far (3 wks) no separation has occurred.</li>
    <li> This Was recommended by my skin professional,  this price was much lower,  I encourage you to purchase it as I did</li>
    <li> wonderful light and highly effective sun screen recommended by my plastic surgeon. I wear it daily under my makeup. It is fragrant free and is not sticky or greasy</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this online because you may be getting damaged goods. I&#x27;ve had two tubes of this sunscreen -- both purchased on Amazon but supplied by different vendors -- break down and separate into clear liquid and lumps of white goo.  I asked an employee in my dermatologist&#x27;s office about this (they are a Skinmedica-approved seller) and she started to tell me it was nnormal and I just had to shake the tube hard...because the product was &amp;#34;so micronized.&amp;#34;  But when she suggested that I could exchange it for a new one there in the office, and I told her I had bought it online, she changed her story.  She said Skinmedica products sold online by non-approved vendors are &amp;#34;buybacks&amp;#34; from approved sellers.  It&#x27;s old stuff that didn&#x27;t sell.  In other words, you don&#x27;t know where the products have been, what conditions they were exposed to, or how old they are.  I know that Skinmedica has changed the formulation of this sunscreen, so perhaps the separation issue was the product flaw that prompted the change.  After getting two bad tubes of this expensive product, I am not about to try their new formula, though.  I&#x27;ve found a better and cheaper sunscreen elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen had separated and first application was only water.  Have not been able to shake and squeeze tube to get it mixed up correctly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from my dermatologist and absolutely love it. Because it was thin I shook it up. It&#x27;s the consistency of low fat milk. I have oily sensitive skin and Sunscreens with chemical block cause oil production, stinging eyes, and break outs. Make up over? Forget about it. I absolutely love this stuff. Trick is small amount goes a long way. Smooth in well. If skin is dry it won&#x27;t blend , so a gel moisturizer solves for me after cleansing face. Minerals heal and this calms redness. Powder sunblock doesn&#x27;t stay put. I sought to purchase from Amazon for a cheaper price but it seems someone is selling fakes. As to the clinicians review below, I wonder if their supplier dupped them? This is bottle 2 and it does what it says.</li>
    <li> I believe some people over exaggerate on reviews... So I purchased... Mind you I use this product faithfully... This batch of product is horrible... Water and cream.. You don&#x27;t know what your gonna get..  Consistency is dry then watery..won&#x27;t even spread on your face...  To good to be true... As they say.. I use the 30 and 50 and never had a problem till this cream</li>
    <li> great product not heavy and white!</li>
    <li> Thought I did a thorough review for this product, but apparently I didn&#x27;t. If I had seen some of the complaints I&#x27;m seeing now, I would have never bought this product. It was great at first, but shortly afterwards it started separating. When I squeezed the bottle, I got a lot of clear liquid, then thick globs of product. It didn&#x27;t matter how many times I shook the tube, it wouldn&#x27;t mix. I contacted to company several times, but got no response. I see many reviews now of customers who have had the same problem. The product isn&#x27;t worth buying and should be taken off the market. The customer service is non-existing. Leaned my lesson the hard way.</li>
    <li> I have tried a sample, loved it.  Tried to buy it from DermStore, they sent me the wrong SkinMedica SPF chemical sunscreen twice, so returned it due to I gave them 2 chances to get it right!  This is a natural sunscreen.  Love the protection, the texture is light and smooth, not whitening..not greasy.  I lean toward oily skin so this one made me happy.  The SPF is 30+, is the 50spf of the chemical sunscreens.  NOTE the FDA is going to ban the &#x27;over rated spf&#x27;s&#x27; soon.  This one is the 30 that is a 50spf.  The ingredients block SPF&#x27;s (all UVA/UVB).  xoxo</li>
    <li> I purchased two tubes.  Within 6 months, the product separated.  I called Skin Medica and they refused to accept a return.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine about a year ago and it hasn&#x27;t separated at all and was never watery.  The negative reviews here make me think there are fakes out there, or may be well past the expiration date.  Product separation is a sign that it&#x27;s past the expiration date.  Even on the Skinmedica website it warns of purchasing from resellers.  I purchased mine from Amazon and got what I believe to be the genuine product that was fresh.  But there are various sellers here so I guess you&#x27;re taking a chance.  Onto my review...at first this product appears thick and white but once you pat it in, it&#x27;s very smooth and sinks in well.  The white cast is very minimal and not noticeable on my fair skin. I prefer tinted physical sunscreens though so I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup, but may purchase this again for days when I&#x27;m not really going anywhere.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from a third party seller through Amazon. It was a great price for good sunscreen. I did not experience water squirting out of the tube, as others have described. Nor did the product seem old or used. Nor did it have an odor. It does seem authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use skin medica products. I particularly like their moisturizers and sunscreens. This sunscreen is easy to apply and does absorb well into the skin. I use it over the skin media rejuvenating moisture cream. First I cleanse my skin, then I apply an antioxidant, then I apply the rejuvenating moisturizer and then the Daily Defense suncreen. It is a good morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be happy if I can use this sunscreen while I am swimming, and if it is actually water-proof, as represented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is well worth the $13.00 I paid on Amazon.</li>
    <li> SkinMedica SkinMedica Daily Physical Defense SPF 30+ was a bargain through Amazon.  It is a perfect sunscreen for the face.  I have very oily skin, so most sunscreens I can not wear on my face as they are oily.  Daily Physical Defense goes on smoothly with no greasy feel.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday light not greasy feeling moisturizer. However in the cooler months you might need something heavier. Didn&#x27;t clog my pores at all. Very satisfied, will buy again.</li>
    <li> The best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Not greasy and is light and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This product separates so you get a watery substance instead of the cream, and it don&#x27;t matter if you shake it.  Once you get a handfull of the watery substance then the creamy part after it&#x27;s a total mess. For the price it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
    <li> Yes, you heard it right. This sunscreen comes with free water in the tube so that when you&#x27;re out and about in the hot sun, not only are you protected from harmful UV rays, you can also quench your thirst with the water coming out of the same tube like a faucet! What else could anyone ever wish for in a sunscreen?</li>
    <li> I purchased this twice, from 2 different sellers on Amazon, because their prices were cheaper than those sold on SkinMedica&#x27;s website. Once in November 2012 and once in January 2013. The experience of these past 2 tubes were extremely similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll just describe my experience with the very last one I just used up last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 1~2 weeks of usage, as someone mentioned before on Amazon about the same product in a different size, when I squeezed the tube it started to split water. I used it everyday, and everyday I had to hold a tissue to absorb the split water, and yeah that&#x27;s A LOT. I checked the expiration date and everything seems to be alright. I just couldn&#x27;t solve the water issue. I sent email to SkinMedica&#x27;s customer services but there was no reply so I thought I&#x27;ll just go over to a store sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found a line in the instruction at the bottom of the tube: Shake well before use.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, my bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how you shake the tube it just won&#x27;t mix water with sunscreen. The rest of the tube, after so much water came out, became dry and very hard to spread on skin, especially when it&#x27;s about to be empty. ----Well, I hope it was at least a sunscreen. So that I was not putting nothing on my face for the past two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using up the whole tube last week, I ordered a new one from SkinMedica&#x27;s official website because I was also purchasing some other SkinMedica products. I received my new sunscreen of exactly the same brand and same type, but this time it&#x27;s smooth and NON-DRYING. NO WATER SPLIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started to read the instruction on the back of the tube. There&#x27;s NO sentence saying \\&quot;Shake well\\&quot; AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, just like my previous experience with the brushhead of Clarisonic brush. The cap of the brushhead won&#x27;t close properly, and the brushhead itself felt WEIRD, I cannot tell why but it&#x27;s just different texture from my previous one purchased in store. -----After 4 months, the blue circle that was supposed to suggest \\&quot;time to change your brushhead\\&quot; did not fade at all. Still bright &amp; new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if this sunscreen is also a fake product or what. All I know is that I&#x27;ll NEVER purchase it again from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below was my original review written months ago, for the first tube I purchased in store, not from Amazon. I still highly recommend this product; it&#x27;s one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended to people with acne-prone, oily skin. I&#x27;ve been looking for physical sunscreen for months for my sensitive, oily skin, and most of them (because of the nature of physical sunscreen) were greasy and heavy. This one turned out to be the best one I&#x27;ve ever met. The whitening-effect (another common problem of physical sunscreen!) still exists here, but it&#x27;s acceptable and can be solved by putting a thin layer of loose powder to balance the unnaturally white color. The best thing about this? It feels cool and dry so won&#x27;t burden my oily skin. It has a rather solid, dry texture so it will take some time to spread it evenly on your face, but it feels much better than most physical sunscreens. Since it&#x27;s not water/sweat-proof, I&#x27;ll switch to more stable physical sunscreens in summer time. But for the rest of the year when I&#x27;m not going to the beach or exposing myself in sweaty, sunny conditions, this one is totally enough. Will definitely purchase again.4 months, the blue circle that was supposed to suggest \\&quot;time to change your brushhead\\&quot; did not fade at all.
