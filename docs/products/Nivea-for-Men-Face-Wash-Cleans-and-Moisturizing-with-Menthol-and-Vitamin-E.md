<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Personal preference. Like it but not crazy abt it. Would buy again though.</li>
    <li> Nivea,men face wash does clean and soften your face on the second use,let me say I&#x27;m a forever buyer from this friendly seller.Thanks Mike</li>
    <li> Use twice daily. Won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Good bye face acne and good riddance.</li>
    <li> Cool and tingly. Works great. I use it before I shave. washes off nice no film or residue. Leaves my skin feeling fresh &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> make my face very clean</li>
    <li> Feels a little bit sensitive on my skin, but it&#x27;s a great product overall!</li>
    <li> Great daily facial cleanser and moisturizer</li>
    <li> This product makes my face dry...</li>
    <li> not very easy to wash off with water</li>
    <li> It smells so nice, feels so invigorating and really clears my face up! I use it in the morning and before going to bed and my face has drastically improved over just 3 months.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use this when I shower every morning.  It just puts the menthol feeling in your face, but it really feels good in the morning and cleanses the face to feel clean.  It&#x27;s also easy to rinse off and does not damage any skin.  It&#x27;s great to use before putting on lotion on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, will definitely buy once I run out.  It has run out already before, and I&#x27;ve bought it again already.  ;)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my brother.  He said it really conditions his skin and it is 100% soap free and dermatologist tested.  He said he would buy it again. I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Good price when it was on sale</li>
    <li> Nice face wash which isn&#x27;t too aggressive.  My face feels clean and not too dry and I like it as a daily face wash.</li>
    <li> This stuff is gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I can hardly feel the effect on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it works.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try this for a month and maybe I will get a clear answer later.</li>
    <li> great face washer, love the smell. keep face clean &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Great product ,must have for men .I use it every morning and I love the refreshing mint feeling .My face looks clean and shiny all day .</li>
    <li> And it&#x27;s not just for your face either. You can use it anywhere, any time - regardless of your gender! Seriously though, use it the night before a nice date and they&#x27;ll be wondering how the hell you can be so soft without being oily. I&#x27;m looking at you Jergans.</li>
    <li> Been using this for almost 2 years with no regrets or desire to change face wash. Its gentle and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores. Skin has looked better ever since starting to use this and haven&#x27;t had any flare ups. I use twice a day as recommended and it seems to be the perfect amount, not too harsh on the skin and doesn&#x27;t make it red.</li>
    <li> Good product, good value for money.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Nivea products so I thought I would buy this for a family member.  It cleans well and is does not have a scent that overwhelms one&#x27;s senses.  However, the results were disappointing.  Somehow he developed quite a bit of acne on his forehead and it dried out other areas of his face very badly.</li>
    <li> This is a decent face wash but literally smells like a bottle of cologne.  The scent is overkill and who wants to put that much fragrance on your face?  I wish this was un-scented or atleast less-scented.  Otherwise I have no issue with it, it lathers up good and washes off clean.....yet.....the scent lingers, so I find myself not wanting to use it.</li>
    <li> Cleaner leaves face feeling very clean and refreshed. Have noticed a less oily skin since beginning using this. Acne has never been a big issue, but is even less frequent now it seems with this facial cleaner</li>
    <li> Good but does not have cleansing beads</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I was finding myself breaking out after spending more time in the gym and needed a better face wash. This stuff smells great and doesn&#x27;t get crazy foamy which I hate. Beware it does dry your face out quite a bit which is fine but you may need a non oily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was no much into using face wash until I came across this on a Amazon deal as a filler.&lt;br /&gt;By far the best, awesome scent and a sense of freshness that stays for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended this, I will be surprised if someone doesn&#x27;t it, unless there is a condition.</li>
    <li> While I like the Nivea Face Scrub better, this is a great product. Just as it states it moisturizes and cleans. Nivea always has quality products.</li>
    <li> I actually got attention from Lucy...F off Linus you missed your opportunity! Next is Peppermint Patty, I am part Irish, too!</li>
    <li> I have mild acne at 24, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for regimens that will keep my face reliably clear. Before I bought this, I was using Oxy 10% benzoyl peroxide face wash at night and a salicylic acid face wash in the morning. The combo may have done some good, but I still almost always had a couple of blemishes. In any event, I felt uneasy (with respect to skin care) about staying with that combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this, I started using the Nivea in the morning and the Oxy at night. The results have been excellent. My acne has improved dramatically, and the wash smells and feels good to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a month, so I can&#x27;t claim these results are going to be lasting.)</li>
    <li> I use Nivea men face products and they really take good care of my face. Last time I had a facial my therapist told me my skin looked great.</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiancee and was worried that he would not use it, but he actually does and seems to like it; would recommend for picky boyfriends!</li>
    <li> Wish they sold this individually and not as an add on item.</li>
    <li> I like to use it in the morning</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve used it, It did very good face cleaning work for me. I think I will continue using it by myself.</li>
    <li> great price and product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30.  I&#x27;ve had pretty clear skin for years.  I used this and got some really bad zits/acne.  Once I stopped using this, it went away pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively oily skin, but not usually any skin problems.  This went right in the trash once I linked it up to my complexion issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed for the Nivea Men&#x27;s Chap-stick, I get the worst breakout on my lips.  It looks like I have cold sores, which is gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing any more Nivea for Men products.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!! Really makes my face feel super clean after using.</li>
    <li> Great face cleaning product, it keeps my face clean.</li>
    <li> I am Satisfactory with this product. I will buy it in the future after the one I am using running out.</li>
    <li> If you can get a good deal on it, this stuff is great. makes my face feel tingly after and not greasy.</li>
    <li> this is the first time that I bought moisturizer on the internet, whatever, it is very good, I like Nivea.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this wash for a few years now but only recently started using it nightly.  My face is a bit dry immediately after use but the next morning my skin always looks and feels soft and healthy.  If you&#x27;re an electric shaver user, shave as soon as you get up without getting your face wet or anything--you&#x27;ll be surprised how well your shaver works.  This stuff also has a nice scent.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Not as &amp;#34;mentholy&amp;#34; as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Use every morning when I shower.  Helps keep my skin healthy while feeling refresh.</li>
    <li> where&#x27;s the moisturizing effect? my face feels dry and tight after using it......</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. He likes how it gives him that cool and refreshed cleaning, it helps wake him up in the morning. Also, the smell is a plus.</li>
    <li> Well, good brand I always trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Nivea over Clean Clear now since it doesn&#x27;t use alchohol to dry out your skin. (i learned it from American Psycho)</li>
    <li> It leaves your face feeling soft and smooth and very clean. I use EVERY DAY. Try all the different ones. I especially like the face scrubs</li>
    <li> This product is good, keeps my face feeling fresh and clean after each wash. It has reduced spots and  pimples. This is my second purchase. The first was in UK and in a 100ml tube but it&#x27;s much bigger here in the USA (150ml)</li>
    <li> Provides good feel to the skin after use and menthol adds to the freshness</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel fresh. I use this in the shower. It kind of has a CK1 cologne smell to it, but it&#x27;s good. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing anything for my face, however it does feel fresh after the wash.</li>
    <li> Very nice skin care for men</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and his skin looks better.</li>
    <li> I have grown fond of this face wash. It is not to harsh and since it is a men&#x27;s face wash, it has a good scent!!</li>
    <li> Best face wash hands down, I have tried A LOT of others.</li>
    <li> good product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I give it a five because Nivea is and always was a great product for Men.  I highly recommend it.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> My face is brand new again.</li>
    <li> Cleans and moisturises as well as leaves a pleasant smell on a man&#x27;s face. Will be re-ordering !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he like it so far. He saids that leaves his face feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Not too dry for the face! Finally found the perfect and affordable face wash!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little bit to sticky and a little bit hard to make bubbles from it. But it surely clear my face from oil and dust. it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I work outside many hours of the day. During that time I collect a bit of dirt on my face. The Nivea moisturizer removes the dirt effectively.</li>
    <li> Love it very much. Smell good. Feel fresh after using it. I will use it daily and recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I never use Nivea to clean my face before, but when I used it, I feel very good, I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> It is just great and all oil-related things can be easily cleared and it can also make your face a little cool.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use product and shipping was good too.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this everyday and says he feels clean also say it helps after shaving</li>
    <li> I love their products, but I don&#x27;t really care for the gel-type wash. Doesn&#x27;t feel great on my abnormally dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 3 star product but since I probably should&#x27;ve been more careful, I&#x27;ll give them the benefit of their track record and hand them 4 stars.</li>
    <li> quite good, my face feel good</li>
    <li> Nivea for Men Face Wash Cleans and Moisturizing with Menthol and Vitamin E,...  I like how it makes my skin feel.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> works good, smells good, me likey</li>
    <li> I like so many things about this product.  It cleans well and  leaves a very refreshing feeling.  It helps keep my face moisturized.  It has a pleasant, mild fragrance.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  It lasts a long time - A little dab goes a long way and I&#x27;ve been able the same tube for a couple months.</li>
    <li> seems to work well.  Very thick and has a very manly scent.  Not sure the overpowering manly scent is needed.</li>
    <li> It is a typical face wash product, nothing special, but it is enough to handle most of the work. I would like to recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff. The price is right and the menthol gives you a nice tingle to wake you up in the morning. Unfortunately, anytime I used it, I&#x27;d end up looking like a vampire out of Twilight. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and my body wash is also menthol so I know that it can be done right.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and the similarly priced [[ASIN:B001B4Q5X0 Neutrogena Men Invigorating Face Wash, 5.1 oz)]]. This Nivea face wash seems to be by far the superior product. It is thicker - less diluted, and doesn&#x27;t make my face dry like the Neutrogena face wash does.</li>
    <li> Used some of this at a friend&#x27;s house on his recommendation. It&#x27;s ok, tingles a bit when putting it on, which I guess is the menthol but next day my skin was dry again. Seems OK for my friend though, so I guess it&#x27;s just down to personal skin type as to whether this product is for you or not.</li>
    <li> Good product..little more money...but it is a brand name...Received on time..A++++++&lt;br /&gt;Good product..little more money...but it is a brand name...Received on time..A++++++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really made it a point to pay any special attention to washing my face...usually just wet a washcloth and did it in the shower and after anything which required additional cleansing during the day.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews and having had excellent experiences with other Nivea products, I used a coupon and scored one of these. OMG...it is amazing what a difference it makes to my face. Shaves are much closer and faster.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s scented with menthol which is clearly stated but frankly, I like it especially before bedtime.</li>
    <li> This is my everyday facial wash, the one that I use in the morning and during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell and it lathers up nicely. I don&#x27;t need a whole lot and so each tube of this size lasts me between two and three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, and this facial wash leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh and soft without over-drying.</li>
    <li> my friend recommed this product to me and I decided to give a shot. It&#x27;s a little bit itchy during washing not like my previous cleanser CeraVe but not bad for price!</li>
    <li> I try to wash my face every night before going to bed and this stuff seems to clean me up real nice without drying up my skin so I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> feels very refreshing and minty.  Seems to keep my face clean and does no overly dry out my face</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the cleanser and the menthol adds a &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; feel. The texture feels like a soft gel. As with any cleanser, after cleansing, use a light lotion even if this is a &amp;#34;moisturizing cleanser&amp;#34;. I was my face 1-2 times a day depending.</li>
    <li> Compared to the men&#x27;s Neutrogena face wash, which I had been using the past few months, this stuff is a blessing. It is extremely mild on your face and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Nice fresh scent and cleans well.</li>
    <li> This stuff works for me...  Been using it for years now and no problems whatsoever...</li>
    <li> This is like breaking up with a long-term gf, but I have to do it. I have used this product for about 14 years now, and I am finally giving up on it. Since the formula was changed and cheapened a few years ago, this product has been a shadow of its former self. When I began using it in about 2002, it was wonderful. It contained no menthol. Back then it felt milder, lathered smoother, cleaned better, dried less, and was all-around of a much higher quality than it is today. It replaced my oily skin with well-nourished, moisturized skin. Then, the formula changed a few years back. The differences were immediately apparent, and very disappointing. Amongst other changes, the formula began including menthol; what a terrible thing to put on one&#x27;s face. The minty tingle made it feel like I was brushing my face, just like my teeth. It was so bad that I actually wrote a letter to Nivea begging they return to the OG formula, with no response.&lt;br /&gt;Part of the issue may be that my skin type has changed from oilier to drier over the years. However, it was still working great for me immediately up to the formula change, and immediately afterwards, began drying my face out far more. I will periodically review the ingredients hoping for the original formula to return, but for now I am searching out a new face wash, permanently.</li>
    <li> Does a terrific job .</li>
    <li> Feels cool on my skin, I love it. It&#x27;s non-drying and really cleans well.</li>
    <li> Great, the same as supermarket.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Leaves the skin smooth and fresh !</li>
