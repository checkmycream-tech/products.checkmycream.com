      <li>It covers scars very good.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased!</li>
      <li>but it still works great.</li>
      <li>If you put it on correctly, it&#x27;s great.</li>

      <li>Go to an ulta and test the colors to find your best match first.</li>
      <li>I have freckles, which many are now calling age spots!</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to blend  and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
      <li>May not be the best for near porcelain skin tones.</li>
      <li>I love Dermablend.  </li>
      <li>I love this dermablend for the face.</li>
      <li>Works ok on scars.</li>

      <li>Derma blend has helped significantly.</li>
      <li>Good product can over my scars totally on my legs!</li>
      <li>Goes on very nicely and dry quickly.</li>
      <li>Use a good brush-- I use Real Techniques by Sam &amp; Nic Chapman Expert Face Brush ($6-$8) for a professional airbrush finish, totally worth buying, don&#x27;t skimp on brushes.</li>
      <li>I have some burn marks on the back of my legs and this covers them nicely.</li>

      <li>Dab a little more on red areas for more concealer &amp; leave alone to dry</li>
      <li>This stuff completely covered them!</li>
      <li>It is too hot in Arizona to wear long sleeves here in the summer.</li>
      <li>I just want to look natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really the only coverage a girl would ever need.</li>
      <li>First stipple (meaning: dab it on without blending) it on to different areas, keep in mind if you need extra coverage only on a spot, start there first.</li>
      <li>The colors run a little light so I would order a darker color next time.</li>
      <li>Put the product on back of your hand, next gently dab at it with the brush, dab it on all areas on your face, cheeks forehead and chin--</li>
      <li>Now my wardrobe is not limited.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have facial tattoos and somedays I just want to look natural. This stuff completely covered them!</li>
    <li> Delievered on time and product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works ok on scars. Might need two coats. I get it off easily with baby wipes.</li>
    <li> I have freckles, which many are now calling age spots! This stuff perfectly covers them and stays put! It doesn&#x27;t move or cake. It&#x27;s really the only coverage a girl would ever need. I also put it on my legs chest, arms when I&#x27;m going somewhere where I care about my appearance.</li>
    <li> I have some burn marks on the back of my legs and this covers them nicely. It is very easy to blend  and doesn&#x27;t rub off. The colors run a little light so I would order a darker color next time. I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have been taking prednisone (steroid medication) for a long duration. One of the side effects is bruising. These bruises not only look bad but people stare at them sometimes. It is too hot in Arizona to wear long sleeves here in the summer. Derma blend has helped significantly. You can still see the bad bruises faintly but one has to look hard to see them. This is easy to apply and does not rub off and lasts all day sometimes longer. Now my wardrobe is not limited. I recommend this product highly</li>
    <li> Covers my spider veins and blemishes. Goes on very nicely and dry quickly. Hard to know what color to order but one needs several shades for the change in seasons.</li>
    <li> I love Dermablend.  Due to anxiety, I sometimes develop a red rash on my neck/chest area. I&#x27;ve tried everything and derma blend is the only product that works well to disguise red blotches and hives. The product stays on all day and does not rub off much on clothing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I kite this product. It does what it said it will do. kI discovered that I should use a shade darker next time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the product I had in a white tube. I think the formula has been changed. Coverage is mediocre. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Like it.  A friend of mine referred me to this.  Don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
    <li> Has orange - yellow undertones. May not be the best for near porcelain skin tones. Too yellow to balance pink skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this worked for me. It covers scars very good. The downside it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to choose your perfect shade unless you try it. The one I got was a tad lighter than my skin but it still works great. Go to an ulta and test the colors to find your best match first.</li>
    <li> This is not Tom but his wife.... I love this dermablend for the face. If you put it on correctly, it&#x27;s great. It helps with acne and doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin if you &amp;#34;accidently&amp;#34; fall asleep with it on. The trick is exactly what another person suggested that I read also. Use a good brush-- I use Real Techniques by Sam &amp; Nic Chapman Expert Face Brush ($6-$8) for a professional airbrush finish, totally worth buying, don&#x27;t skimp on brushes. Put the product on back of your hand, next gently dab at it with the brush, dab it on all areas on your face, cheeks forehead and chin-- wait a minute then blend. Dab a little more on red areas for more concealer &amp; leave alone to dry so it will be a little thicker there. Play with it. Once you master it, you&#x27;ll love it. First stipple (meaning: dab it on without blending) it on to different areas, keep in mind if you need extra coverage only on a spot, start there first. Some days, I look good and only have to stipple it on a couple of red areas or spots! (Great for Rosacea too!)</li>
    <li> Good product can over my scars totally on my legs! But abit dry</li>
    <li> Great coverup for vericose veins.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I have small, dark veins and sun damage on my legs. I dab this product on the spots and blend in. It is really water-proof and stays on all day. The color was exactly right.</li>
    <li> It covered the scars on both knees. I had a total knee replacement on each knee and this product covers and does not smudge after it is dried. It also provides sun protection.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not coverage at all</li>
