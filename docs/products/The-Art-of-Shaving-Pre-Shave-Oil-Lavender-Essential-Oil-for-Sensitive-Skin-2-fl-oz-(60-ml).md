      <li>I read that shaving oil was important and decided to get him the art of shaving pre-shave oil and see if it can minimize his shaving problems and the results were really good.</li>
      <li>I was kind of Hoping for a pump top like the sample bottles have</li>

      <li>This is easy to do.</li>
      <li>the how smooth his head is at the end.  </li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>

      <li>so now I hope to keep on with such a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
      <li>smooth glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good old fashion shave.</li>
      <li>Art of Shaving offers a superior quality for shaving products.</li>
      <li>He enjoyed the scent, but the oil just wasn&#x27;t right for him.</li>
      <li>I have a problem with pretty much most razors feeling like they are pulling my hairs as I shave.</li>
      <li>shaving oil isn&#x27;t cheap but it is worth the money if you care about your skin.</li>
      <li>and this particular brand quickly became my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>, the smell is strong and make your hand really oily</li>
      <li>My boyfriend has sensitive skin and can not shave more than 1x ever 3 days or so.</li>
      <li>I must admit it is pricey but well worth it.</li>
      <li>this is a product worth trying.</li>
      <li>It is rare to see him with cuts these days and he hasn&#x27;t touched his biotherm homme for months now.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t forgive a company that can&#x27;t put the right products for shipment to make up the set they advertise.</li>
      <li>if u massage it properly, the shave goes very smooth.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Have used other pre shave oil products and this one is really nice.</li>
      <li>The only thing some people might want to watch out for is the strong lavender smell.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, although it has a little too much castor oil (or similar) in it</li>
      <li>Absolutely must have.  </li>
      <li>Makes shaving so much easier and gives a closer shave.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Reading the book was very enlighting I did learn quite a bit from it</li>
      <li>my solution was a full beard, that is until I tried this (well Pre-Shave oils in general)</li>
      <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and have tried dozens of creams and soaps without success until i discovered the AOS Pre-Shave Oil which I accompany with the AOS Lavender Cream.</li>
      <li>The scent is light enough to shave with and not have anyone think you&#x27;re wearing perfume or something</li>
      <li>so I could  control how much I want to use.  </li>
      <li>Really helps to get that close shave.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much hair being pulled anymore.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Technically, it&#x27;s much more viscous then other oils, which makes it not spread like butter</li>
      <li>Preshave oil, Badger Brush, Shave SOAP, Straight Razor/Safety Razor, and a high quality post shave balm made all the difference in the world.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this really helps!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products because they have been a lifesaver for me.</li>
      <li>They have a dispensing top that lets you take just a little or a lot.</li>
      <li>AOS products are second to none and well worth the price.</li>
      <li>--My new recipe is AOS Pre Shave Oil, Cream, a high quality straight razor, and hydrocortisone after you complete your shave...bumps and irritation</li>
      <li>Pre-Shave Oil is critical for a smoother, more comfortable, less skin damaging shave... which is critical for someone like myself who is prone to getting razor</li>
      <li>I started using a safety blade and I shortly after that, I bought this and started using it right away.</li>
      <li>He shaves his head, which is very sensitive.  </li>
      <li>He will never go back to using other products after using the oil, which really does make a huge difference in</li>
      <li>Not sure on the price comparison to competing products but the lavender smell is a good one, and it works as well as other pre-shave oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I would also recommend a double-edge razor with a shaving cream to complete your shaving process.</li>
      <li>When your cheeks will be resting between a woman&#x27;s soft thighs, shave with this oil, she&#x27;ll appreciate it.</li>
      <li>My husband is a mans man, no frilly stuff; he also has sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>If you are the type with sensitive skin that gets lots of nicks</li>
      <li>fully prepares the heavy bird or light whiskers well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>use The Art of Shaving shaving lather (with the brush) and follow it up with the after shave lotion to complete the ritual.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased a bottle in store but when that ran out (I had a little travel version)</li>
      <li>I wash my face first, dry it, then apply this oil and then the shaving cream.</li>
      <li>Only need afew drops but with the cap off I usually get more than I need in my hand.</li>
      <li>terrific lavender scent promoting an early morning boost.</li>
      <li>This is not a self-righteous, humble brag review telling you how stupid you are to buy the pre-shave oil when instead you should make your own with my handy at home recipe of rendered bear fat, ostrich droppings, and duck pee.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Must have, good size. Will last months</li>
    <li> I have been using the art of share preshavel oil for a couple of years. It reduces the chances of cuts while shaving and allows the glad to glide smoothly.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has sensitive skin and can not shave more than 1x ever 3 days or so. He tried out a number of shaving creams and aftershaves including the expensive ones you find at department stores but still he had nicks and cuts and red patches constantly. I read that shaving oil was important and decided to get him the art of shaving pre-shave oil and see if it can minimize his shaving problems and the results were really good. The shaving oil allowed the razor to cut his beard without tearing up his face at the same time. It is rare to see him with cuts these days and he hasn&#x27;t touched his biotherm homme for months now.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaving oil isn&#x27;t cheap but it is worth the money if you care about your skin. My boyfriend even got a small travel container such that he won&#x27;t be without it when traveling abroad. If you are the type with sensitive skin that gets lots of nicks this is a product worth trying.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Softens the beard\\&quot;...sort of. Like one of the reviewers has said...you can get this softening effect at a fraction of the cost. 20 bucks? heck no. For 20 bucks I was expecting wonders.</li>
    <li> He shaves his head, which is very sensitive.  He will never go back to using other products after using the oil, which really does make a huge difference in the how smooth his head is at the end.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a great price. I love the way my skin feels and looks after use.</li>
    <li> I was kind of Hoping for a pump top like the sample bottles have but these folks had an even better take on it. They have a dispensing top that lets you take just a little or a lot. Does it quite well also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used a preshave oil before. After using this I will never go back to my old and dumb way of doing things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the book was very enlighting I did learn quite a bit from it so now I hope to keep on with such a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
    <li> Pre-shave oil is one of the best ways to start a perfect shave. If you are like me and take at least twenty minutes shaving, then this is a product you really need. I must admit it is pricey but well worth it. The oil is to protect your skin and prepare and soften your stubble for a smooth cut. I would also recommend a double-edge razor with a shaving cream to complete your shaving process. I tend to get razor burn or ingrown hairs. This oil is to help stop that. I have researched and used plenty of shaving products and found that this is the best method for the perfect shaving experience. Try it and you will feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Few drops before shaving makes shaving much smoother.  Smells great and lavender is antiseptic.  Arrived quickly. Will last a longtime since a little is needed.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with pretty much most razors feeling like they are pulling my hairs as I shave. I did two things to attempt to prevent this from happening. I started using a safety blade and I shortly after that, I bought this and started using it right away. I didn&#x27;t notice much hair being pulled anymore. I also noticed my skin looks and feels very healthy as well. I&#x27;m sure you could use this with any style razor and I would recommend using this before lathering up.</li>
    <li> Art of Shaving offers a superior quality for shaving products. It takes longer to shave following their remarks, but you can feel the difference. The fragrance is also my favorite among all the ones offered, and the product was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream on the market. Good old fashion shave. Moisturizers while avoid irritation! This shaving cream makes shaving enjoyable.</li>
    <li> The aroma is good. if u massage it properly, the shave goes very smooth. Needs only few drops per shave.</li>
    <li> I bought my husband an assortment of the Lavender scented Art of Shaving accessories as a gift. He loves everything except the pre-shave oil. He doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the oil still leaves his face feeling itchy for a long time after using it. He enjoyed the scent, but the oil just wasn&#x27;t right for him. He tried using less of the oil with each shave and had the same results. My brother in law was visiting recently and he had the same comment about the shave oil. Not sure if it is their skin types mixed with the oil or something in the oil that triggers that itchy feeling.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and have tried dozens of creams and soaps without success until i discovered the AOS Pre-Shave Oil which I accompany with the AOS Lavender Cream. I highly recommend these products because they have been a lifesaver for me. I have found a little bit really goes a long way and this pre-shave oil is necessary for that smooth glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically, it&#x27;s much more viscous then other oils, which makes it not spread like butter but it holds nicely after the cream/lather is applied with a badger brush. Without the oil, there is much more pull on the razor and causes additional irritation. Water soluble pre-shave oils I have tried (think Kiehl&#x27;s) just fall off the skin during cream application--My new recipe is AOS Pre Shave Oil, Cream, a high quality straight razor, and hydrocortisone after you complete your shave...bumps and irritation are a thing of the past. I&#x27;ve done my research and testing--could write a book! This is my top oil.</li>
    <li> This product might seem expensive, but it lasts forever. It is one of the best pre-shave oils that I have tried on the market</li>
    <li> This is a must for anybody who gets razor burn- take a hot shower-load this on where you get it-put shaving cream and wait 2-4 minutes to soak in then i shave with double blade-ie not to sharp and only thing that prevents it</li>
    <li> I order this monthly for my husband. He says it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Pre-Shave Oil is critical for a smoother, more comfortable, less skin damaging shave... which is critical for someone like myself who is prone to getting razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use The Art of Shaving shaving lather (with the brush) and follow it up with the after shave lotion to complete the ritual.</li>
    <li> I use this only when I skip a day or two of shaving. It does help make the razor glide a bit easier over the tough stubble. You only need a few drops. I wet my face and hands. Rub a few drops in my hands then smear it across my shaving area and let it sit for a few minutes while I prepare my shaving cream. Then rewet my face, apply cream and have at it. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product, he will not use anything but this!  Although it might be a bit pricey this lasts him an entire year and it doesn&#x27;t damage his skin!</li>
    <li> great price for the art of shaving line.</li>
    <li> Absolutely must have.  Makes shaving so much easier and gives a closer shave.  When your cheeks will be resting between a woman&#x27;s soft thighs, shave with this oil, she&#x27;ll appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Expensive for what it is, but I&#x27;d definitely buy again. The scent is light enough to shave with and not have anyone think you&#x27;re wearing perfume or something</li>
    <li> I ordered a three piece set. I never got the pre- shave oil. The company Art of Shaving ship me two shave creams and the after shave instead.&lt;br /&gt;The set was shave cream, pre-shave oil and after shave cream. I can&#x27;t forgive a company that can&#x27;t put the right products for shipment to make up the set they advertise. This is easy to do.</li>
    <li> To thick. It was like using car greese on your face.&lt;br /&gt;BUT it smelled good... BUT mabey it was me???</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I bought it for my boyfriend and it keeps all of the red razor burn bumps away! It is a little expensive, but it smells fantastic and works well. I may use it on my legs !</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this really helps! I used to get the no scent but I like this better</li>
    <li> I have gotten into the Art of Shaving stuff since I received some as a gift. This vendor was one of the least expensive ones on Amazon for this fairly pricy product. It seems to me though that the smell of the product was a little off. My nose isn&#x27;t that great though, so YMMV, and the oil functions well.</li>
    <li> Not for my skin...caused breakouts and extra oil. Now I use Cerave foaming cleanser and lather it up with a shaving brush</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product!!! Truly beneficial... I have a truly thick heavy beard, I dull a Gillette Fusion in a single shave, and get bad razor burn... my solution was a full beard, that is until I tried this (well Pre-Shave oils in general) and this particular brand quickly became my favorite.  Preshave oil, Badger Brush, Shave SOAP, Straight Razor/Safety Razor, and a high quality post shave balm made all the difference in the world.  This particular product is the best value for money out of the Quality shave oils on the market... its more expensive than the worthless &#x27;who knows what&#x27;s in it&#x27; bargain store brand, but one of the most affordable and effective, $5-10 less than the other Quality brands. I will continue to buy this product for as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> this shave oil is great. fully prepares the heavy bird or light whiskers well.&lt;br /&gt;however, the smell is strong and make your hand really oily</li>
    <li> Great product! Really helps to get that close shave. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a thick pre shave oil. I wash my face first, dry it, then apply this oil and then the shaving cream. The oil smells good and does its job. I dont know how I shave all these years without a pre shave oil.</li>
    <li> Not sure on the price comparison to competing products but the lavender smell is a good one, and it works as well as other pre-shave oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> this was a better price!!!  I would buy it again.  Don&#x27;t skimp.  This is thicker than the cheeper oils out there.</li>
    <li> Great product...terrific lavender scent promoting an early morning boost. The oil is amazing for an easy shave...I wish I had discovered it sooner. It leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is the oil you&#x27;d use before applying shaving cream. AOS products are second to none and well worth the price. The last a long time!</li>
    <li> Too pricey while similar quality products are on the market.</li>
    <li> Have used other pre shave oil products and this one is really nice. I wish it had a smaller opening so I could  control how much I want to use.  Only need afew drops but with the cap off I usually get more than I need in my hand. Product works well  and looks good on the counter also.</li>
    <li> This is a product every husband should use</li>
    <li> This is not a self-righteous, humble brag review telling you how stupid you are to buy the pre-shave oil when instead you should make your own with my handy at home recipe of rendered bear fat, ostrich droppings, and duck pee. Instead it&#x27;s just me telling you I love this stuff and often I&#x27;ll shave using the pre-shave oil alone during the week. If my beard is short I don&#x27;t need and therefore won&#x27;t use shaving cream. The lavender is nice and soothing to smell all day. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> My husband is a mans man, no frilly stuff; he also has sensitive skin.  I did buy him a sample kit of TAoS. and he LOVES this oil and it doesn&#x27;t break him out.</li>
    <li> It has a great strong lavender smell that I love. It just wakes me up in the morning. I originally purchased a bottle in store but when that ran out (I had a little travel version) I decided to buy it online. Really can&#x27;t say anything negative. The only thing some people might want to watch out for is the strong lavender smell. This is not a product for you if you&#x27;re looking for subtility .</li>
    <li> Perfect oil to go along with my lavender Art of Shaving shaving cream</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I use it in combo with the unscented shaving cream and I get no irritation, whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This pre-shave oil is saving my neck from irritation. Great stuff, although it has a little too much castor oil (or similar) in it but I still buy this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading a lot of reviews and also the purchase of the lavender after shave balm and shave soap. I can not compare this to anything else because there was nothing at the store other than your standard shave cream and aftershave. This oil is thick like STP but it did lift the hairs up even those fine ones, It did help with the razor in gliding and possibly reducing razor burn. I did use this with the shave soap and when I was finished with shaving, man baby butt smooth and no razor burn! The only complaint is that I did not find this stuff earlier.</li>
