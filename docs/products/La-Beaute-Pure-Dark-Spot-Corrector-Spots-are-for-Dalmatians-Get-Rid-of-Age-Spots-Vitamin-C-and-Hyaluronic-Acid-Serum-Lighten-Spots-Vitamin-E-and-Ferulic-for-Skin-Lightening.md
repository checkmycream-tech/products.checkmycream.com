<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this and i instantly was drawn to the eyedropper tool and the color of the bottle. It just looks nice and you can tell its a vitamin C product because of the oranges on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a while and the formula was quite nice, not too thick but not runny or watery and there was no terrible smell from this. It definitely tightened up my skin and gave me a bit of moisture (however you MUST put a moisturizer on after this because it will dry out your skin fairly badly) I have very young looking skin anyways so I am not so sure it worked to get rid of wrinkles or fine lines but I did enjoy using this and after the initial &#x27;getting used to it&#x27; point tit worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
    <li> I really liked this serum a lot because I felt it helped the texture and condition of my skin. This vitamin C serum also contains hyaluronic acid so it does double duty: help skin condition while helping with anti-aging!  The product comes in a sturdy glass container with a dripper to let you control how much serum you use.  The product itself is a clear liquid with a very light scent.  It is thin and absorbs very quickly.  I wash my face and apply this to my face &amp; neck.  Once it absorbs (30 seconds maybe?) I put on my moisturizer.  I normally use this at least 1x, sometimes 2x a day.  Overall I am happy with how this product has helped my skin.  It is gentle yet provides good results. #sponsored Visit www.SurveysByStephanie.tumblr.com for more product reviews.</li>
    <li> I want to give a big THANK YOU to La Beaute Pure for sending me their fantastic Vitamin C Serum to review for them!  If you follow my blog then you already know that I am constantly (at least it seems like it&#x27;s constant, lol) telling my readers that they should all be using Vitamin C Serum as part of their everyday skincare routines.  It is simply a MUST HAVE!&lt;br /&gt;I apply on my face, neck &amp; decollete every morning immediately after I wash &amp; tone my skin but before I apply any moisturizer and repeat every evening as well.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a little beauty secret of my own that I would like to share...I also apply the La Beaute Pure Vitamin C Serum to my shoulders!  I have to say for being 41 my skin looks pretty good, I don&#x27;t really have many wrinkles except for the usual fine lines around my eyes.  The place where I notice my aging the most is my decollete and shoulders.  As I age, the more time I spend in the sun I tend to get &amp;#34;freckles&amp;#34; on my shoulders and decollete.  Applying Vitamin C Serum to those areas helps reduce the appearance and in some cases completely remove those &amp;#34;freckles&amp;#34;.  Keeping your decollete and shoulders &amp;#34;freckle&amp;#34; free will help you looks years younger!</li>
    <li> This is a non-oily fast absorbing serum.  It is a little on the thin side, but the dropper makes it easy to control.  It has ferulic acid in it, so it has that characteristic smell (hot dogs), but it is not too strong and goes away after application.  It has great ingredients in it, but don&#x27;t expect to see over night results, except for with skin softening.  The bottle should last about two months, so give it at least half that.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Out of the myriad of serums and skin care products, including prescription, I&#x27;ve faithfully used over the years this 20% Vitamin C serum has been one of the most life changing. Not only has it firmed my skin and worked brilliantly with my Derma Rolling micro-needling device but has also faded acne spots and scarring. In the past these dark marks and bruising could take months to go away but with daily application of this serum the effected spots peel revealing new skin underneath. My overall skin tone brightened as well and became so much smoother. It&#x27;s also been great for plumping my lips and for under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to invest in only one serum it would be this one as a single bottle lasts a long time and a little of the watery gel like liquid goes a long way. I also like that this is clear so you can see that it&#x27;s fresh and the Vitamin C is still active. If the serum begins to oxidize and turn yellow it will not give the same results and is best tossed. This is one of the reasons I do not stockpile too many backups instead opting to order fresh new bottles off Amazon and keeping them refrigerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with anything topical it takes time to see the full results, six weeks in many cases, and this has worked on post-acneic spots within a week. For sun spots and melasma I personally can not comment because those are not things I suffer from but know others who are using this in conjunction with prescription Retin A and hydroquinone with great results. I look forward to seeing what positive changes will be revealed with enough time for a full cell turn over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La Beauté Pure provided a sample for review.</li>
    <li> I love this serum and especially like the way it absorbs into the skin without that oily feeling. Made my face feel tight and I was able to put makeup on right away.</li>
    <li> My grandma always told me to try to keep my skin looking young at a young age, she said, age creeps up on you and bam your stuck looking old and trying to gain back a bit of that look you always thought you had that slowly slipped away. She said, I started too late, and now I’m paying for it. Now back in her day they did all sorts of different crazy things to try to get their skin to firm up, a few are awesome, others I’m not sure I’d ever try. Luckily I’ve had the opportunity to work with amazing companies such as this one run and operated by a loving family trying to share their great products with the world! All I need for my face, to keep up the firmer skin, to keep up with those lines that may appear is in this bottle of awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the serum on in the mornings and then followed with a moisturizer. I used only a few drops and spread it around my entire face. It is almost odorless and if anything gives off a slight sense of orange zest, it absorbs nicely into the skin does not leave any oily or sticky feeling on the surface of the skin and moments after applying is dry to the touch. As always I state that I do in fact have very sensitive skin especially on my face and I did not have any break outs of any kind, allergic reactions or any ill effects following the use of the serum. It almost immediately makes you feel like your skin is firm, I noticed this especially around the cheek bone area and the skin under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise not only did my laugh lines, my chin, and my cheek bone area feel firmer but the horrible bags under my eyes started to get less um purplish looking! My entire face looks and feels like a million bucks 😀&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No blush, No filters, No makeup I think I’m looking awesometastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> Love this serum! It is really amazing. It dries super fast and does not leave my face oily feeling at all. It has worked really good on lightening up my dark sun spots on my neck.  My son has even used this on his acne. It is some amazing stuff! I will purchase this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Good product, works well if used daily.  Leaves your skin smooth not sticky or oily.  Great product to use on your face.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin dry and  after two weeks i don&#x27;t see any difference,  i am sorry but  it is a waste of money</li>
    <li> I have not gotten the chance to try the product enough to write a review, but I wanted to pop in to say that the product shipped to me very quickly. I don&#x27;t think it took more than 4 business days to get to me. So I was very pleased with that. The labeling and packaging were both professional standard. So, overall, i am pleased with that aspect of the product. I will report back with my review of the actual product. :)</li>
    <li> This came super fast with Amazon Prime shipping. It came in the bottle with a topper and also had a dropper. I definitely started using the dropper right away because droppers are my fave :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this and think it would be a nice gift to give too. The packaging makes it instantly apparent that it’s an orange serum and that’s exactly what you get. Some of the citrus serums I’ve used in the past have been too thick for my taste, but this one is really light, so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These types of products can help to fade skin discoloration, spots, signs of aging, and so much more. I like using this in the morning before my moisturizer and love that this is organic, 100% botanical, beneficial to the skin, and enjoyable to use.</li>
    <li> For the last month of using this I have noticed my skin feels tighter and the dark spots of my face have been fading a little bit. It&#x27;s not a HUGE difference yet though. When I say this is worth $28 dollars? No, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $20.</li>
    <li> I have been using it only for a week so far and I can feel the difference. My skin feels softer and the serum is helping me reduce blemishes which evens out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now. I feel I can honestly report that I see results. My complexion is brighter, my pores less visible, and there has been a slight tightening effect all over.&lt;br /&gt;I am 37 and just starting to see signs of aging. My main skin concern before trying this product, was a slight sagging of my skin. As I said, I am seeing a slight tightening all over. With only being a month in, I am pleased and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;It feels nice on the skin as well. I apply after shower. It goes on smooth and once dry feels no different than if it was not there at all. Because I apply at night, I put an oil based moisturizer on over it. I wake up with baby soft skin - more so than before I started using.&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients are important to me as well - this Vitamin C serum has it all. A++</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is actually packaged in a dark bottle to protect it from light exposure, and you can tell when you apply that it is a quality serum.  It is smooth and even carries a gentle scent.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> So, I try most anything that is going to anti-age me and most of it doesn&#x27;t.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me either but I do like the way it feels, it goes on smoothly, dries really quickly and something has helped my skin look better.  Wrinkles?  Well maybe a tad better but they are most definitely still with me..</li>
    <li> I wanted to make sure before I write a review. Using the serum twice a day certainly makes a difference. The lines on my forehead are almost gone; those at the corner of my lips are also on their way out. I am 65 and I certainly don&#x27;t look it anymore. Wish I could send a picture of my before an after only 10 days. I don&#x27;t believe my eyes. I sure will keep using that marvelous product. Thanks for making me happy. When I look in the mirror I have flashback of my youth. I noticed that in order for the product to work fast, it has to be used twice a day on a regular basis and on the 5th day, there will be a big improvement.</li>
    <li> I received this for a review and really liked it.  I did notice I was getting a bit more sun with it so make sure to use it at night and wear a good quality sunblock during the day.  My skin felt more plump like it wasn&#x27;t dried out.  You do need to keep using it.  I noticed an improvement in only 2 weeks but when I ran out I noticed a difference in only a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tested a couple of the La Beaut&amp;eacute; Pure products with discount codes and I&#x27;ve got to say, this company knows what they are doing.  Like the hyaluronic serum, this one is a very nice quality, no artificial scents added but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other products with this combination of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation which is the first thing I look for in any skincare product.  There are no crazy coloring or scents in this serum which I was thinking there would be with the oranges on the package.  Everyone&#x27;s face reacts different to these types of products, I&#x27;ve been using expensive face products for years and am thrilled to see quality products at an affordable price, not just gimmicky either, these ingredients are terrific for age spots, to increase firmness and moisture retention that helps smooth out fine line.&lt;br /&gt;I use this over a cleaned and toned face, following it with moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! Definitely changed how my skin feels and looks! And i love the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free and it&#x27;s gentle enough for my sensitive skin &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I am 32 years old with a very light sunspots, use this product for 5 weeks and seen no reduction in the dark spots at all</li>
    <li> The serum is doing what I want it to protecting my face.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial. &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;[...]&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 stars of this review accounts for all aspects of the product. It shipped quickly and came securely wrapped in a little glass bottle. Upon using it, I was pleased to discover it didn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which I had been worried about based on the packaging of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself was quickly absorbed into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy or tight, which I was also excited about. After consistent use, I noticed dark spots were fading and my face looked healthier in general. A lot more even and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WONDERFUL product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;[...]&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> it is a very good product..&lt;br /&gt;one of the best natural serums to help get rid of fine lines&lt;br /&gt;i will order it again</li>
    <li> I added this serum in to my daily routine when I received it at the end of March.  As soon as I put it on I noticed how nicely it glided on to my skin.  It dried very quickly and seemed to make my skin feel as though all the little pores had been filled in.  I believe that is do to the hylaronic acid that is in this serum.  I always use skin care with Hylaronic acid since it has the ability to hold 1,000 times its weight in water.  In the last 4 weeks that I have been using the La Beaute Pure I have noticed some evening out of the skin. I do not have hyperpigmentation but I do tend to get blotch and red in my checks. When I am getting over a pimple I tend to get a noticeable dark spot that usually takes a couple weeks to clear up.  While using this serum I did notice that my acne spots cleared up allot quicker.  This tells me that my cells are turning over quicker than before.  Overall this is a very nice Vitamin C serum. At a cost of $29.99 with free shipping on Amazon it is affordable.  I would recommend adding it to your regime if you are looking for a little brightening.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market. My skin is smoother, and wrinkles are noticeably diminishing. A little goes a long way so, considering what I have spent on products that don&#x27;t work as promised, this product is a bargain. Just try it once and you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this serum!  It seems to be working on restoring a glow to my face.  I have been using it about a month  so I will check back when I finish the bottle</li>
    <li> La Beute Pure has firmed my facial complexion just as I had hoped. I use it daily and skip weekends.</li>
    <li> I feel a bit of skin tightning but not so sure about how much it&#x27;s doing for wrinkles. I do notice my dark spots fading slightly so I will continue to use</li>
    <li> I thought I noticed a difference first couple of days, but guess that was wishful thinking!  Big disappointment.  But will keep using it til  bottle is finished. Disappointing since this product was pushed as recommended by Dr Oz.  Later when I went back to the site, there was another product using th very same dr Oz endorsement!</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple of weeks and I already see a difference. Skin is glowing. I&#x27;ve already had a few compliments on how beautiful my skin looks. Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for 3 days, but my skin already feels softer.  I&#x27;ll post another review after a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> A friend told me how good this product was, so I tried it and it worked GREAT!!!!  look younger already.</li>
    <li> I am asian and used this for product religiously for 2 1/2 months every morning.  The feel was good but nothing has changed in my dark spots.  I did not see even a slight change.</li>
    <li> This serum has woken up my skin and gives me a lively glow even when Im up early for work. The product arrived so fast. Very pleased</li>
    <li> This goes on so smoothly and right into my skin.  It isn&#x27;t sticky and there is no odor.  My face is smooth and no flakiness.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> So you hear of all these anti-aging products but you can never really tell if they work.  I worry about that but more importantly with sensitive skin, I worry whether or these products are as natural as they claim.  Nothing worse than your face breaking out from an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; product that you thought was safe.  It doesn&#x27;t take long for me to find out if my skin likes a product, but I can honestly say that I never had one single issue.  My skin has never felt softer.  I love putting this product on after taking a shower and first thing in the morning after washing my face.  I honestly felt like it was revived after suffering in this dry winter weather.  You have to give this a try for sure!!!  Excited to see where my skin will be a month from now.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels but gave it four stars as I&#x27;m not sure how many wrinkles are diminished...good for the price</li>
    <li> I recently tried the Organic Vitamin C Serum from La Beaute Pure and I really do like this skin product.&lt;br /&gt; Knowing Vitamin C is great for the inside of the body to help people feel better then I figured it must be great for the outside as well.&lt;br /&gt;I began using this serum 1 and 1/2 weeks ago and I can already see and feel a difference.  It goes on smooth, just a drop is all it takes, and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor, actually there isn&#x27;t a smell at all.  When applying it, I really paid attention to adding it to my laugh lines and Crows feet.  I can definitely tell that the lines aren&#x27;t as deep and noticeable.&lt;br /&gt; Organic Vitamin C Serum is not tested on animals, 100% organic and has no chemicals in it.  These are very important issues to me when using anything on my skin.&lt;br /&gt; The cost is very reasonable and shipping is fast.  It came very well protected - wrapped in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;  I definitely recommend you trying Organic Vitamin C from La Beaute Pure.  I think you will be very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Organic Vitamin C Serum by Le Beaute&#x27; Pure is an great product and a worthwhile Health and Beauty investment.  The product was delivered very quickly and well packaged.  The customer service and follow-up are efficient and courteous.  The fact that Vitamin C Serum is organic, natural, not tested on animals and is the highest concentration of Vitamin C were the reason that I was interested in this serum, as well as all of the amazing anti-aging benefits for my skin.  This is a very gentle, light and clean product that does not feel oily or sticky upon application.  There is no harsh texture or fragrance to this serum and the results after the first few uses have been pleasing.  I look forward to continued use and great results.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks since I received my Vitamin C Serum.  It&#x27;s definitely more watery than my experience with other makes of Vitamin C.  It&#x27;s also clear, which I&#x27;m not used to seeing.  Usually Vit. C has a golden color.  But, that being said, I really haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change.  Yet.  I know it can take up to 1 month for the body to react to products.  So, in the meantime, I&#x27;ll be using it everyday, day/nite.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing a more radiant &amp; hopefully, younger me!  :)</li>
    <li> I rated this a 3 because I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and it seems ok..I&#x27;m using it for discoloration from acne scaring..It makes my skin soft and smooth..I may order again haven&#x27;t decided as of yet..</li>
    <li> I really really love the serum. My skin showed a difference after one time use. My pores look smaller and my skin looks brighter and younger. The reason for 4 star is that the shipper sends too many emails asking about the product. I answered them once but they don&#x27;t stop. I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> No orange odor which is fine, some other products I have bought have a strong odor and this does not mean it&#x27;s always C! C serum can be odorless and genuine like this one. The added Hyaluronic acid is a plus and it goes on smoothly.The end result is a feeling of having used a toner not a moisturizer, so you may like to add your own moisturizer later after it dries. Sometimes I would get small areas of inflammation (tiny pimples) before I started using this.  Since I have used this pores are tighter and I have less inflammation.</li>
    <li> Love this product .. I feel it making a difference soon as I started using it .. It&#x27;s a great price too !</li>
    <li> By far the best serum I have ever used , I recommended to my friends and they seem to agree with me.best product</li>
    <li> Do you ever feel like buying a product means more then what is in the bottle. Like being cruelty free, made proudly in the United States, and made with no fillers, no alcohol, no parabens, and no chemicals? The product itself is critical but everything else what the difference. Here is a product that provides that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La Beaute Pure Vitamin C Serum is a complete product that delivers results, benefits plus makes you proud of shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer is on its way out and its time to lighten those sun spots, reduce those fine lines and wrinkles, and protect your face from future environmental attacks on your skin. Perfect PH balance, vegan base hyaluronic acid, and botanical enriched serum that gives you truly a soft, glowing, plump, and simply beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really impressive results. Plus get a FREE eBook filled with amazing Youthful Tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus they support the USA with their family owned and operated business here in the USA at a FDA state of the art facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So proud to shop this amazing product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> after years of tanning in the sun with no sunblock, at age 40+, and only giving up the sun for 10+ years, adding this to my daily routine has been wonderful. My skin is softer and the spots appear to be lighter but its been a short time that i&#x27;ve been using it. With longer use I&#x27;m positive that I will see better results</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for about 4 weeks along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and I do believe I am beginning to see a difference. It may even prevent the mini face lift I have been thinking about. How&#x27;s that for saving 6 or 7 thousand dollars.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I do feel like my skin feels somewhat firmer and the developing wrinkle on my forehead seems a little less &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34; looking.  :)  However, I spilled this all over my bathroom counter the other day and will have to order another bottle.  Just hard to swallow having to reorder another bottle so soon because of the price.  It hasn&#x27;t yet made a difference on my crow&#x27;s feet.  I am 38 and a minimalist when it comes to skin/aging care.  I like that this product is easy to apply and requires very little time.  I put it on in the morning and again at night before bed.  It&#x27;s lightweight and once absorbed, I never think about it again.  Once I reorder, I will be interested to see what my results are.  I use this product in conjunction with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Both are lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> - disappointed.really disappointed  I used for 6 -8 weeks, didn&#x27;t see ANY positive  difference.No glow, healthier look. I didn&#x27;t like the smell, like Cornhusk. Just felt like a starchy serum on my face. Preferred the smell like oranges, any citrus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the CSerums and this is my favorite so far! Feels good and I&#x27;m seeing results just 2 wks in! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is made with certified organic products and not tested in animals. How great is that? The best way to give your skin the vitamins it needs is to do it with high quality ingredients. 98% naturally derived. I am obsessed with serums since they make a huge difference in my skin. I normally get super dry in the winter soni have made it a habit to incorporate products that keep my skin looking healthy and glowy. This one is one of them. It will allow your make up to go on smoother. My honest opinions on receiving this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  highly recommend</li>
    <li> As an avid beauty blogger and makeup lover, I have used a lot of products out there! I am extremely careful about what products I use on my skin, for it is very sensitive and acne prone. I have used lotions, toners, serums, etc. and I will definitely be adding this to the list of my favorite products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I love about it? The packaging is amazing for one. I received this cute little glass bottle, filled with Vitamin C serum. The packaging came with two toppers; One regular black cover and an eye dropper (to extract the serum) that also screws onto the top of the bottle. It is great two have the two different options. The label has a picture of oranges, and on the back explains how to use the serum and what it can do for you. The Vitamin C serum can help your skin produce collagen. Using this serum will increase your skins structure and promote healthier skin tone and texture. This claim is definitely true for me, just after a couple days of use, I noticed my skin seemed to be calmed. My skin has less little bumps with a smoother feel, and a lighter pink tone and does not seem to feel harsh or irritated. One drop is all you need for sure, I take the dropper and use just a finger tip full and lightly dab it all over my skin. Once the serum has fully absorbed into my skin, I apply my moisturizer and makeup as recommended. This serum is a great skin base for other products, because it leaves your skin luscious and soft. This serum will last you a very long time, which is great because I am loving it!&lt;br /&gt;The buying process was amazing as well. Once I placed my order through Amazon, I received an order conformation right away. The actual purchasing of the item was painless and quick. Within a day I received a thank you email for buying the serum from La Beaute Pure. After 5 days, I found a little package upon my door! The feedback and response with my purchase was very professional and attentive as they even checked in to make sure I received my order within the shipping days they had predicted. I had no problems with my order and the shipping was very fast. I received my order to my doorstep, and upon opening the brown box in which it came, I received my serum protected by bubble wrap and with a nice thank you note from the company for my purchase. I am very pleased with the service as well as the serum I received. This is definitely a five star product for sure!hin the shipping days they had predicted.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C Serum now for a few days.  One important thing you should know is that a little goes a long way.  I recommend using the dropper so you don&#x27;t get too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has no noticeable odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is not oily nor did it make my skin oily.  I was surprised...&lt;br /&gt;To read the rest of my review and see photos of the product please go to&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of anti-aging products that are really nice.  I must say that while I&#x27;ve really liked the ones I&#x27;ve tried, Vitamin C Serum (as long as it has at least 20% Vitamin C) is more in my budget.  And to think that by the end of 6 months time of daily use I will have received maximum benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 1 week of using this, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin getting lighter...bye bye tanned face.  Not to worry, wrinkle free is much better.  After 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed more outbreaks on my face as I feel the serum is pulling out the infirmities in my skin.  After almost 3 weeks I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the fine lines disappearing. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 6 months.  The greatest improvement so far is the softness of my skin.  It is considerably softer without using any additional lotions or potions.  Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also comes with the e-book Anti-Aging Naturally.  This book is filled with all kinds of things each and every one of us can do starting today to keep us looking and feeling young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read my full review here:  [...]</li>
    <li> I really like this and can tell a difference.  Need to get some more.</li>
    <li> I received my product two days ago. It arrived in a timely fashion with standard delivery. The seller was prompt about shipping it. It was also packaged practically. The serum is in a glass vial with a dropper. They are both wrapped snugly in bubble wrap and then placed in a padded envelope. The envelope was small enough to fit in my mailbox, so the package did not have to be left out on my porch in the elements. I am completely satisfied with the shipping and packaging from the seller. The only issue I have had so far is that I did not receive the E book that is advertised with the product. I did contact the seller today via amazon on the product page to find out if I needed to do something to get access to it. It may be as simple as me following a link to get access. I don&#x27;t have any negative thoughts on the book as of right now, because I just do not know how to gain access to it. I will update my review as soon as I know. As for how well the product works, I have not yet had the chance to use the serum but I plan to begin using it tomorrow. I will get a full, extensive review on the product after I have used it for a month. I do have a lot of dark spots and some fine lines around my eyes. I will take before and after pictures and post a full review on the effectiveness of the product.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR ANTI AGING PROCESS</li>
    <li> I just turned 40 five days ago. With the start of a new year and a new decade I&#x27;ve become really aware of taking better care of my skin. I tried La Beaute Pure organic vitamin C serum in an effort to find a natural alternative that can slow the affects of aging and possibly rejuvenate a youthful complexion. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3-4 days, but so far I&#x27;m completely impressed! The thick serum is almost fragrance free which I love and applies easily. It is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling at all. I can even feel my skin  tightening where I apply it. I was thrilled to find the serum is packaged in a light blocked bottle and even comes with a top fitting dropper for easy application! This seller knows how to package and ship their products safely an timely.  I received it incredibly fast!</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial. &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;[...]\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I just received this product so I can&#x27;t discuss the effects at length yet, but I can talk about the fast shipping and excellent packaging. I received this quicker than expected and it arrived in excellent condition thanks to the safe and secure packing methods used. The packaging of the product is excellent with a quality bottle that adequately protects the content from sunlight exposure. The included dropper is also one of quality versus some others that are obviously very cheap in nature.  I&#x27;m excited to see the results I achieve after using this product over time.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;[...]\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I used this product along with a scrub that came with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleaning system and within the 3rd day I thought I saw some results. My curiosity was confirmed when a friend said,&#x27;Hey, did you do something to your face? it looks great!&amp;#34;.. I use it daily right before bed! Men.. this is some good stuff!</li>
    <li> I first wanted to mention how pleased I was with the fast shipping and delivery. The glass bottle was nicely wrapped in bubble wrap to prevent any damage during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C Serum for the past 2 weeks and have noticed a change in my skin&#x27;s appearance. It&#x27;s not a drastic change but I can see the difference it has made and I know that if I continue to use the serum, my skin&#x27;s health will keep improving. I love that it&#x27;s organic!&lt;br /&gt;I use a cotton ball to apply the unscented serum at night before bed. I believe this is the best way for your skin to replenish itself during your sleep. Overall, I enjoy using the serum and will order again once I run out and I&#x27;ll also recommend it to anyone who would like to improve their skin health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.*</li>
    <li> This is useless. Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I didn&#x27;t see  any  improvement on my face. Didn&#x27;t help for dark spots and wrinkles. Which i don&#x27;t have too many. Honestly I don&#x27;t recommend it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in my face.  It feels good going on but that is about it :(</li>
    <li> Another amazing Vitamin C Serum that I have recently been introduced by the &amp;#34;La Beauty Pure&amp;#34; company. I love Vitamin C serum for facial skincare. It has so many great benefit like anti-aging, collagen formula and etc.&lt;br /&gt;It is a 1 0z bottle which I am pretty sure gonna last for 1 and half months for me!! I have previously tried some other vitamin C that actually feels and looks like orange juice which I don&#x27;t prefer to apply as a serum. This unique formula of the serum is different than others. As you can see, it&#x27;s crystal clear with no harsh scent on it. Almost feels like water. Dab dab on the face before moisturizer and I am ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;I do love this serum but I don&#x27;t like the dropper that comes with the serum! The top of the dropper is kinda round shape which uncomfortable to use because every time i tried to pull the serum, it starts dropping on the surface! But I have more free dropper that I just replaced with this one. Other than that I have no complain about this serum. I love how it feels so refreshing on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;You should check out their page to learn more about this serum.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a big difference.  Will keep using it with expectations!</li>
    <li> it didnt work, it made me break out</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I are using it, we started about 14 days ago.  We are in our mid-60&#x27;s and have a lot of sun and age damage.  Skin appears and feels smoother and pores are more even.  We are hoping that the progress continues.  14 days is not enough time for correction in the sun damage that took 60+ years to accumulate, but we have our fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> Great product. After a week, I noticed my skin was softer and clearer. Some acne scars appeared lighter and the area around my eyes didn&#x27;t seem so dry and tight. Love that it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my skin. I use it in the morning before applying makeup. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> This serum is great!  Been using for 3 weeks and see a big difference in the texture and evenness of my skin.</li>
    <li> For this review, let me give you a little bit of info about myself and my skin. I am 25 years old, with dry skin. I also have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never really used serums on my face, so this was something new to try. The bottle is fair sized, with a good amount of product. It really only takes 10 drops to cover my entire face and neck. I followed the instructions on this as listed. Cleansed my face (it also says to use your toner before, but I don&#x27;t use a toner). I placed a single drop on each of my fingertips and worked it into my skin. After 5 minutes of letting it absorb into my skin, I applied my normal facial moisturizer. My skin felt clean, and hydrated. I did have a sort of &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my face, like my skin looked clearer and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 hours later I went back to the bathroom to check out my face in the mirror, and my forehead was very dry and flaky. But other than that, my skin looked pretty good. Very firm feeling. I do quite like that it is 98% natural and 72% organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this serum isn&#x27;t the best. When you think of Vitamin C, you think of oranges, but this does not have that kinda scent at all. I can&#x27;t really describe the smell of this, but it&#x27;s not something I was a fan of. However it&#x27;s not over powering or unbearable. There is just room for improvement there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this out, but if you have dry skin like me, this might not be something you will like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 60&#x27;s. My daughter asked me this weekend what I was using on my face. The answer is I have been using La Beaute Pure for over a month and I  am really beginning to see results.  I really like this product!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product so far. It has a smooth, light feel when applied. A small amount goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t have an odor, which is a plus for me.  I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts. This product has not caused a single problem for me! I appreciate that it arrived neatly and securely packaged. It&#x27;s a glass bottle, so I was happy when I opened it to find it tightly wrapped.  I highly recommend this product and plan to update my review after several weeks of use.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product and the price is very good compared to other products of this nature.</li>
    <li> Makes skin smoother and appear more plump and nourished.  Very good product.  Delivered and shipped with no problems.</li>
    <li> I was sent of vitamin C serum from La Beaute Pure to sample. I have never used vitamin C serum before, so I was not sure what to expect. This brand of serum contains 20% vitamin C, which is the maximum concentration one would typically find in this type of product. (anything with higher concentrations alters the consistency of the product, and makes it runny and difficult to apply)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my vitamin C each morning, after washing my face. The bottle comes with a medicine dropper applicator, so you are enable to dispense a small amount and apply it carefully. The serum has a viscosity which is slightly greater than water. It absorbs into the skin very easily. There was no tingling, burning, or redness after application. After the serum absorbed into my skin, I applied my day moisturizer followed by my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La Beaute Pure makes a serum which is free of parabens, formaldehyde, phthalates and triclosan. There are no genetically modified ingredients contained in this product, and it is not tested on animals. Their formulation also contains vitamin E (another antioxidant) and hyaluronic acid (which has a similar function to collagen).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very satisfied with my vitamin C serum, and I am eager to see how it benefits my skin over the coming weeks and months.</li>
    <li> I use this every day with my daily regimen. I think it works too. Would order again and recommend to my friends and family too.</li>
    <li> 2-in-1 Anti-Aging Facial Serum ,Vitamin C serum 20% with Hyaluronic Acid Serum 11% by La Beatue Pure, I was sent this Vitamin C Serum to try  it out and it is a great vitamin C serum it is a bit sticky at first but after it is applied but as it dries the stickiness  goes away and there is a tightness that is left behind  the tightness is a nice feeling  it  like my face has been lifted and is firmer. This serum boost collagen synthesis for tighter, firmer skin and that is why it feels like it is being firmer because it boosting the collagen in my body. It is a 2 in 1 anti aging serum. It  also helps with dark spots as it lightens the dark spots up.&lt;br /&gt;2-in-1 ADVANCED STRENGTH ~ 11% Hyaluronic Acid: 75% of people are dehydrated which causes sagging skin. Hyaluronic Acid Serum plumps up, regenerates, and firms, creating a more youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;FIRMING POWER ~ VITAMIN C (SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE), the stable form of Vitamin C is water soluble in a salt form . It is easily converted to Absorbic Acid by the skin&#x27;s enzymes and helps too reduce fine lines &amp; wrinkles, pore size &amp; discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that  it is  natural and organically made so I like knowing what I am putting on my face and body that it  doesn&#x27;t have man-made chemicals. I am trying to be healthy in what I eat so I want to also be cautious as to what I put on the outside as well. I like that they don&#x27;t test on animals as well. Animals don&#x27;t need to be hurt for us to look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> This is review of the product Pure Vitamin C Serum by La Beaute Pure. I have only been using this product for a little over a week now &amp; have noticed that my skin feels a lot softer. The Texas sun &amp; heat has been drying out my skin over the last 5 or so years, this product has helped bring back some of the softness &amp; has helped with redness on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pure Vitamin C Serum has a great scent to it &amp; leaves your skin feeling fresh &amp; clean. I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> In two weeks I see no change.</li>
    <li> I love this product. you can feel it working the min you put it on!</li>
    <li> This serum is way to runny and drippy for me. I have since found another Serum C which is much nicer. It is Isabiis!!! It feels silky and just the right consistency, My skin is very sensitive so I have to be sure not to use too much. I also used the Isabis around my nose and face when I had a cold. It stopped my nose from getting sore. It really helps my skin</li>
    <li> I feel you can&#x27;t get any better than this product, because once you put it on, it immediately absorbs int the skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with a film like sensation. The fact , that just a little of this product goes a long ways makes you get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of La Beaute Pure vitamin C serum to share my honest opinion of the product here and on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;The serum arrived quickly and packaged nicely.  I couldn’t wait to try it, and opened the bottled.  It smelled great.  I was please to see an eye dropper was used to dispense the serum, avoid waste, and make sure the bottle doesn’t become contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial patch test showed that my skin didn’t react. My face is very sensitive and most skin care makes my face angry, but my skin drank in serum La Beaute Pure vitamin C serum without any reaction at all. . It didn’t sting; I didn’t breakout; nothing itched!  Score!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, I didn’t look a decade younger, but my skin felt good.  My 8 year old, who tried it with me, didn’t see a difference in the patch test area either, so I planned a second trial.  That night, before bed, I added La Beaute Pure vitamin C serum to my skincare regimen. My skin again drank in the serum. Afterwards, I applied my usual moisturizer.  In the morning, my face looked brighter and very happy.  I know.  Sounds silly to say my skin was happy, but it really was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve applied the serum for a week now without any adverse response from my face.  That’s the first hurdle for me.  My face continues to look brighter and happier.  I’m still waiting for the long term aging impact.  On top of liking the product, and getting free sample (who doesn’t like free), there are no GMO’s or additives, which is really important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin c is a great antioxidant, and with age, stress, and ongoing battles with acne, I was pleased with the clearer, brighter complexion that greeted me.  My face doesn’t look a decade younger, but I do notice it is a bit brighter in just the week I’ve used.  Definitely recommend this product if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> This is great product and I love it!</li>
    <li> This item shipped in less than two days.  I&#x27;ve just started researching online about vitamin C serum, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does.  The packaging is a nice, sleek dropper, with a clean-to-apply glass tube.  It smells amazing, and I was happy to see that this product is NOT tested on animals.  I&#x27;ll update this review in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with how fast I got this product. I got this product in 4 days with the free shipping! I received a couple of emails letting me know it was shipped out  and a tracking code to follow it.  I also loved that this product was wrapped in bubble wrap to protect it from breaking. I enjoyed reading the Bonus book Anti-Aging Naturally which was attached( in pdf form) to the email that was sent to me. I can&#x27;t wait to try this product out. I will come back after I have used for a while and let you know how well it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I can only put so many things on my face so when my mother saw that I had received this item for review, she wanted it.... She has heard from me and others how Vitamian C is wonderful for the skin.  She has been using it and loves it. She wants to report that her skin is very soft and smooth.  It has decrease some of her wrinkles as it firms up her skin.  She has a nice glow.  She will be purchasing this as soon as she runs out.  She is calling it her youth in a bottle lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still looking for the best.  I had one i liked but can&#x27;t seem to get it again.  This one didn&#x27;t seem to measure up.  It does make my face feel nice but didn&#x27;t seem to even tackle the blemishes.  I may not have given it long enough and may try again.</li>
    <li> I personally like it.  Dr. Oz recommended it as part of some expensive ingredients in beauty creams.</li>
    <li> Definitely loves. i try out two night my skin look so clean and smooth. it&#x27;s seem more healthy than 2 days ago. i do really appreciate it. recommend others to try out too.</li>
    <li> The serum is very liquidy and goes on smoothly onto my skin but yet leaves my hands feeling a bit greasy i needed to wash my hands quickly after applying the serum onto my face. The serum is not bad at all it did clear up my discolorations and does hydrates my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using it nightly and have noticed my skin tone improving. It appears smoother and more youthful. I personally didn&#x27;t notice a drastic fading of my hyper pigmentation, but my Fiance mentioned to me and asked if I was doing something different because my \\&quot;spots\\&quot; are lighter. If he noticed then it must be different. I am very pleased and am excited to see what the upcoming weeks will bring. So far very impressed just from the 2 1/2- 3 weeks I have been using it. The serum has a convenient dropper and is easy to apply. Once you massage it in to your skin it dries fairly quickly without any oily feeling left on the face and is ready for your moisturizer. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions</li>
    <li> I am really amazed by this Vitamin C Serum. First let me say that I did not find it sticky or tacky. The advertising says for a few minutes, but I put it on and rubbed it in with no tackiness. I have sensitive skin but it did not burn or even tingle. It smoothed on easily and actually made my face feel hydrated. I love that it is not tested on animals. It&#x27;s natural and is full of wonderful things (like witch hazel and dandelion) that help to keep me looking young.</li>
    <li> I hate to give this product a bad review. I&#x27;m sure it works for a lot of people but it breaks my face out. I&#x27;ve tried to use it several times and it breaks out every time. My face is sensitive like that. I&#x27;m going to give it to my mom to try. Her skin is not sensitive.</li>
    <li> I got to test out this product and am so glad I did! I have been using this for the past week and couldn&#x27;t be any happier. The first thing I noticed was my skin was brighter and looked alive. I use to go tanning in the past and it has caused my skin so much damage. I have been using this every morning and my skin feel slightly tightened and moisturized. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it daily! The thing I love the most is that, this is a natural product! La Beaute Pure serum has No parabens, chemicals, preservatives, formaldehyde, phthalates, Triclosan, GMO, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance or Colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not make my face feel greasy or anything either, which is something I worry about when trying new&lt;br /&gt; products! After I apply this in the morning it immediately absorbs into my skin and you can&#x27;t even tell I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how much this has hydrated my skin! I haven&#x27;t even had to use my daily moisturizer this whole past week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say thumbs up product LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  I would like the Anti-Aging Naturally Vitamin C booklet in paper instead of e-book.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for caring about how I felt about the C Serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just received the Vitamin C Serum today and was glad it arrived on time. I ordered the Vitamin C serum last January 8 and it arrived on the promised time. It came in a small USPS box. The bottle and the dropper is wrapped separately into 2 small zip lock plastics and then packed in a bigger bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first vitamin C Serum I used and ever since I used it, I&#x27;ve been hooked to VitamiN C Serums. After using it religiously for 3 weeks, I noticed my acne scars lightened, my complexion brightened and glowed, my skin looked better than before. It actually made me look younger. I did a week by week review and I compared my picture from before I used it and after 3 weeks of using it and I saw a big difference. I love La Beaute Pure&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum and thanks to them, I began to take care of my skin more. :)</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial. &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;[...]\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    Hard to know how well this actually works since it would be long-term if anything, but the product came packaged quite nicely with quick shipping. The label &amp; bottle are very cute! There is no scent, which I prefer to having a bad or strong scent. It applies smoothly, I have sensitive skin and it not caught any breakouts or redness or any kind of reaction. I can&#x27;t wait to see what this will do for my skin!    I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;[...]\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really curious how this product would be. I&#x27;ve heard awesome things about using vitamin C on your skin -- to both treat wrinkles and dark spots on your face, but also to help prevent them from even appearing. This product shipped really quickly. I was thrilled when I received it just days after ordering it! The email with the bonus ebook also arrived quickly and was very easy to download.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service at La Beaute Pure is awesome! They&#x27;re so considerate and want to make sure you are satisfied with your product. A few days after I got this product, they sent an email asking if I had received it okay and if everything was satisfactory. Of course it was, and I really appreciated them taking the time to email me and ask. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They packaged this product very well for shipping -- in plastic bags and with plenty of bubble wrap. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since I got it, and while it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it helps my dark spots (it&#x27;s only been a little over a week), I do like how this applies. There is no distinct scent to it, that I can tell. It&#x27;s really easy to apply and absorbs into the skin quickly. It feels great when I apply it and I&#x27;ve started getting used to using this before my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to finding out the long-term benefits of using this product! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Ordering the product was easy and the company shipped it quickly (and free is the US). The company also wrote and asked how I was liking the product. I am big on customer service and La Beaut&amp;eacute; Pure is top notch! The product has a slight stickiness that disappears just a few seconds after you put it on your face. After that, you can&#x27;t tell anything is there. It absorbs nicely and gives my face a brightness that is fantastic. The label on the bottle is simple and to the point (directions and ingredients are listed in a simple format). For the picky shoppers, this product is gluten-free and not tested on animals. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients in this product!! It is very light Serum &amp; doesn&#x27;t have that sticky feel that some do. I will definitely continue to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> I have only used this serum for a few days and already notice a&lt;br /&gt;difference in my skin.  I will probably continue using</li>
    <li> After I used 3 days, my skin was dry and had break out. So I stopped using it.  Now my skin become better without using this product.</li>
    <li> I love the vitamin c serum but, I have not seen a difference yet.  I am glad you told me it takes a little bit.  How many times a day&lt;br /&gt;do you put it on.  I am using alpha hydroxy at night  and the vitamin c in the morning.  I will be ordering more when I run out .  I also&lt;br /&gt;did not received my Anti-aging ebook to tell me how to use it..  Thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruthann</li>
    <li> I must say so far great serum but I don&#x27;t know how the serum should feel on my face.  I apply a moisturizer after and my skin feels hydrated.</li>
    <li> I use this every night after my toner. my skin is firmer and my pores or diminishing. I recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  I used another brand for before and was pleased with that product.  I am very pleased with this product and glad I ordered it. I don&#x27;t believe in miracle products.  Nothing I&#x27;ve used has ever really helped so I purchased this hoping to slow the evidence of aging and a lifetime of neglecting my skin.  I have large pores from severe acne and evidence of years of being in the sun. But I am so very pleasantly surprised that there is a difference in my skin - it is smoother; the pores seem smaller, the coloration in my skin is more even in a healthy looking way and the brown spots have really lightened.  The really dark spots are much lighter and the lighter spots are so faded they look like they&#x27;ve disappeared!  And the staff seems to really care about the quality of their product.  I&#x27;ve received emails from them asking about my experience and sincerely wanting feedback.  So I can confidently recommend this product.</li>
    <li> **I received a product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This week there is a new serum on my face giving me this new complexion. This is the La Beaute’ Pure Anti-Aging Serum that I received a week ago and have been using. The serum is featuring a new formula and having tried other vitamin C serums I was very curious to try out this one. I thought the appearance of the bottle was more eye-catching then some of the others I have had and this immediately made me more curious to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately upon using, I could feel my face feel firmer and with more of a glow as I worked throughout the day after placing on in the morning after washing my face. The serum is free of alcohol so it was not harsh on my face with chemicals and it is 72% organic material. The skin appeared lighter complexion and with the firming of the skin it was like the collagen was being reproduced. There is no testing on animals which I ALWAYS look at because animal rights is something that I am very passionate about. The product can be used on men, women and children and can also be used against acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on drying quickly and stays on for hours. There was no scent really and the texture was almost like a lemon juice consistency that did not leave any stickiness on my face. A little of this serum will go a LONG way. Try this serum for a healthier complexion with fewer pores, less acne, tighter skin and rejuvenated appearance removing those old dark spots and years of tanning sun spots. The dropper application makes it easy to go on and stay on! If you are looking to reduce your appearance of aging the natural way, La Beaute’ Pure Anti-Aging Serum is the way to go!!</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked this good! Incorporating this product into my skin care routine has nearly eliminated my need to wear concealer and foundation. My skin feels smooth, my pores look smaller, and people tell me I look 8-10 years younger. I should say, I use this in conjunction with only natural products-dr bronners almond soap as cleanser, the serum, and pure almond or jojoba oil as moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is really good. Your&#x27;e skin really needs vitamin C, especially if you are older. This is so good for your skin, if you have sun damage I noticed a big chang in my skin from using this. I use it on different days, so my skin doesn&#x27;t get use to it.</li>
    <li> Great product...lovin it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still wrinkled but I&#x27;m still working on it.  lol</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel dry and broke me out. I&#x27;m going back to organic Rosehip oil.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Will be ordering more. Gives my skin a natural glow and my skin is so so soft.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this serum. I feel and see the face on my skin as plumper and brighter. I have also noticed my skin it isn&#x27;t as dry in some places since I have been using it.</li>
</ol>
