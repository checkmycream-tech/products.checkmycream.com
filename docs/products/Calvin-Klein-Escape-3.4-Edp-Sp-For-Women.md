<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am not sure whether this perfume is authentic or fake. I bought the same perfume from Macys so I know how it smells and the longevity of the perfume. This perfume which I bought from amazon seems fake and it last about an hour then I can&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Escape for over 20 years and this fragrance is the same as the department stores used to sell.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume--I have used it for years.  Unfortunately, it is no longer manufactured--but I do have a few bottles put away.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for years and when they stopped selling it in stores I found it online.  It is also much cheaper purchased online.  It is the same fragrance that I always purchased in store.  This is the only fragrance I get such great compliments on.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes this perfume.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this perfume after receiving I discovered it was old perfume &amp; didn&#x27;t even smell like this perfurme should smell.  Then when I tried to return, I am told that this is considered &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; and it cannot be returned.  How nice that it&#x27;s ok for Amazon to mail it to me but when I try to return because I&#x27;m not going to use a product that is old &amp; doesn&#x27;t even smell the way it should, now all of a sudden it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER ITEM OFF AMAZON!</li>
    <li> It is good friend who likes this product and she loves the fragrance, that is why i bought it. Personally it is not my kind</li>
    <li> My wife bought a smaller bottle and she said she wasnt only impress by its smell but also that if you do a quick laundry it you will be still be able to smell it really really little in a cool sort of way.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume,used it for years,my favorite, can&#x27;t find another kind I like.It&#x27;s a shame its discontinued!I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it still.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my woman because she has always liked the scent. Unlike the ones that I have bought inside of brick and mortar stores over the years this one the scent did not last long at all. I want to say that maybe it lasted for an hour maybe two at the most before you could no longer smell any of it. I guess that is why it is so cheap. I will never order this product for her from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> My Wife Loves it and so do I.This is a classic and a must have for her. Purchased from Amazon.com with no regrets!!!</li>
    <li> i love this frag. and cannot find it in my area. also the price was the best ever! and i had it at my door in 3 days!!!!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected and was well wrapped so it didn&#x27;t break.  Great Job Amazon another great save and the best Christmas ever!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne that I have  been  getting compliments for years .  I also love it because it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Never discontinue!  This of course is for my wife we share the same email.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and I have never had a problem returning anything so here&#x27;s my advice to you; buy it and try it, if it doesn&#x27;t work; return it for a refund, even if it is open and has been used. No other web site allows you to do this!</li>
    <li> My wife was extremely pleased that she received her favorite perfume for a very reasonable price through Amazon.com. I am sure I will continue to order more for her soon.</li>
    <li> Great price and great perfume! I recommend buying this item!  It smells very good. I receive compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> This was given as a Christmas gift, she loved it.  I would consider purchasing perfume online for other special occasions.</li>
    <li> Smells sooo good! This is my mom&#x27;s scent and she loves it! She&#x27;s been wearing it for 6 years now. It smells so good without being overwhelming and its lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> old and doesn&#x27;t even have a smell to it anymore. Out dated old stock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for over 20 years. I cannot longer find it at any retailers. I hope I can continue to find this on amazon. Absolutely love and always get compliments.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS COLOGNE, HAVE WORN IT FOR APPROX 30 YEARS.  ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WEAR IT.  CLEAN FRESH SMELL.</li>
    <li> An old favorite!  Love it!</li>
    <li> My ultimate fragrance!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Calvin Klein Escape for years. I get compliments on my fragrance all the time and I am always happy to tell them I wear Escape.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent. Its not over powering yet it lasts. It is a lot like Cool Waters. I think it reacts differently to everyones body chemistry. For me it is wonderful and my  boyfriend thinks so too. I suggest you try a small sample bottle first and then go for a bigger one if it passes the test.</li>
    <li> This had wonderful protective shipping materials, packed to ensure absolutely no breakage. I was very impressed with that. Better than most packaging. I love this scent yet had not used the lotion before. It has a beautiful scent also. The lotion is very nice as far as thickness: not too runny or too thick and not greasy. Excellent products.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected &amp; the price is very reasonable. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Got it for a gift. Great value! Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and hope to continue to buy.  I keep watching for the price to go down.  Will keep buying</li>
    <li> I have worn Escape for years, the description and pictures made me think it was really what it said it was. Strong alcohol  smell and touch of Escape. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited about this purchase. It came with lotion which I was not expecting. I&#x27;ve been wearing Escape for a really long time and think this smells great. Unlike some of the other reviews on this product.</li>
    <li> This is my sister&#x27;s favorite perfume and I puchased this for her as a gift.  I am going to buy this from Amazon whenever I need to because of the great price!</li>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes.  It was package great and you can&#x27;t beat the price for this size of bottle.</li>
    <li> was a present they loved it but it was a little strong scent would not get it for myself</li>
    <li> Estoy satisfecha con el perfume, definitivamente es una fragancia que me gusta para usarla con frecuencia. Me encanta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the perfume, it&#x27;s definitely a fragrance I like to use it frequently. I love it.</li>
    <li> got this for my mom n it was exactly like the one in the store</li>
    <li> Such a delicate fragrance... perfect!!</li>
    <li> Was truly looking for my Escape but could not use it as the spray pump was defective i was refunded my money but i had asked for a replacement. Not sure if they mis-understood me but i was not happy i did not get to use my escape and you cannot find them in the store</li>
    <li> Excellent product worth what you pay for, I am satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> I  always get lots of compliments when I wear Escape. People ask what I am wearing because I smell so nice. It also lasts a long time on my skin. Needless to say Escape is one of my favorite scents!</li>
    <li> When you have something you love it&#x27;s hard to find something wrong about it and the item was to me quickly!!! Which was a plus my dogs knocked it off of my dresser in the bathroom and I was surprised tha it even broke so I was excited to get it fast without paying extra for it.</li>
    <li> I have received and I do not know what I have to say more here it is as should be and as I expected!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this \\&quot;Escape\\&quot; by Klein for many years now.  It delivers a very welcoming and warm scent and is a great value.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It has a light, pleasant scent.  This perfume is a good choice if you prefer a lighter perfume.</li>
    <li> keeps smelling fresh and wonderful all day. even after a crazy day people think i&#x27;ve just sprayed fresh perfume! besides those who think they are allergic to it, only good feedback</li>
    <li> It has been years since my life partner (wife) smelled this good. The package came before the expected due date.  Wonderful perfume we both love.  Great purchase! Go me!!!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume..ive worn it for years. ..i get so many compliments when I wear it..im so glad they still make it..;)</li>
    <li> Beautiful smelling fragrance, one of Calvin Klein&#x27;s best.  Go light spraying; the Eau de Parfum form is strong.</li>

    <li> Just love it will order  more.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in perfect condition, I am very satisfied with the purchase. is what is described in the purchase, thanks</li>

    <li> Love this fragrance, one of my very favorites and great for anyone looking for a light scent that is not too strong.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I don&#x27;t wear any other kind of perfume.  It has a really nice fresh scent. Not too over powering of a scent.</li>
    <li> Bought as a xmas gift. Recipient loved it. This is a classic scent that she&#x27;s been using fo a long time.</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing. This is my favorite of all Calvin Klein perfumes. A wonderful scent that lasts all day. I will continue to buy this as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> excelent, everything was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Not quite the scent I remembered, but OK.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing &amp;#34;Escape&amp;#34; for 30 yrs and can not find another I like better or even equally. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be sold in stores anymore but I can still buy it thru the Internet thankfully.</li>
    <li> Smells great, im always asked what im wearing, i get lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Escape has been my absolute favorite for years...  you spray it on and it settles in for the day it&#x27;s light and I get more compliments on how I smell through out the day at work.... I work at a drug store so I HAVE to be careful what I wear as far as scents.... This is perfect once it settles down</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my mom who has been using Escape for many many years but ran out last year. She loved it and said it was exactly the one she used, but did mention that it seems not as &amp;#34;potent&amp;#34; as when she used to buy it from the department store. It&#x27;s certainly not fake (obviously, the seller being Calvin Klein), but was probably produced many years ago and has been sitting in a warehouse for some time. For the price and great smell, my mom gives two thumbs up :)</li>
    <li> I scored big..... my wife was very Happy i wish there were more stars</li>
    <li> Product of an impressive quality and durability, is excellent I recommend it</li>
    <li> great value and smells good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for my wife! She loves it and smells great when she wears it!</li>
    <li> hello, my friend! the product is of excellent quality and complies with all the features exposed by you. I have no complaints whatsoever! Thank you very much and happy day!</li>
