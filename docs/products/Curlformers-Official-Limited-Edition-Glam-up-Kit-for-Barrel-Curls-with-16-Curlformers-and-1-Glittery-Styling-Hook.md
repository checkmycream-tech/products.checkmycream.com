      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Works ok...</li>
      <li>I love my sponge rollers, but no way you can do that with them.</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>Really love curl formers.</li>
      <li>I love curlformers and I love the curls they produce, and I love the quality of them.</li>
      <li>It takes practice and time but my daughter really enjoyed these.</li>
      <li>So glad I got these.  </li>
      <li>I have never been able to curl my hair not even with an iron.</li>
      <li>A must have for healthy curls/waves.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re not, the results are, at best, mixed.</li>
      <li>I love curl formers</li>
      <li>My fine, stringy, frizzy hair never looked better.  </li>
      <li>Not the most comfortable to sleep in, but</li>
      <li>Works well, good quality and fast shipping</li>
      <li>She woke up with beautiful ringlets that lasted for a good portion of her very active day!  </li>
      <li>Plus they are easy to use once you get the hang of pulling the hair through the sleeve.</li>
      <li>The curl you get is awesome and lasts for most of the day (depending on your hair type) mine lasted a couple of days though they started to limp on day two.</li>
      <li>but, once you get going, it&#x27;s easy peasy.  </li>
      <li>I want ot get some smaller ones so that I can make it more full, but I loved these</li>
      <li>Love these curlformers they do exactly what they say they do.  </li>
      <li>Amazingly fun times with my daughter doing each others hair!</li>
      <li>I was excited to see that.</li>
      <li>However you are going to need more than one pack to do your whole head.</li>
      <li>I was really upset that I didn&#x27;t have the amazing experience that most other customers had, I was really excited about these but all the many attempts I made were unsuccessful.</li>
      <li>My hair dried beautifully and quickly.</li>
      <li>I slept in them pretty comfortably</li>
      <li>and it makes you look like a spiral perm, which can be fun</li>
      <li>but is worth it</li>
      <li>Took me about 3-4 times to get it right.</li>
      <li>My fine hair normally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
      <li>So if you have shorter hair, less hair, more curlers and more patience than I do--go for it.</li>
      <li>Not only would I need another box, but I&#x27;d require a whole lot more patience!</li>
      <li>, these are bigger and make beautiful loose curls.</li>
      <li>but the smelled funny</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend them!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, save your money for that blow out ;)</li>
      <li>These really work!</li>
      <li>This set was more than enough for my hair</li>
      <li>There is a positive.</li>
      <li>These were also much cheaper than the ones I&#x27;ve found at hair salon stores.</li>
      <li>Another 45 minutes if I had completed my whole head...</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give one star is because I could flip the side that&#x27;s poorly manufactured toward the bottom and use the good side at the top, where the hair goes.</li>
      <li>Other wise they work as expected.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something easy, low maintenance to give me the finished look I get from a blow dry and hot iron curl.</li>
      <li>When I opened the end on one of them it split right down the side, and some of the mesh on some of them go right through the plastic part.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>They work well on natural hair however there wasn&#x27;t enough for my whole head</li>
      <li>I have natural hair</li>
      <li>(My hair is naturally wavy).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of, sort of addicted to these.  </li>
      <li>It was kind of difficult sleeping with them</li>

    <li> These are NOT for thick, coarse hair. I have coarse textured hair and a lot of it! It took me multiple attempts and weeks of lamenting about the money spent on &amp;#34;these useless rollers&amp;#34; until I finally figured out that each roller only takes about a 1/4&amp;#34; of hair. Not only would I need another box, but I&#x27;d require a whole lot more patience! Once I got the hang of how to do it, it took me almost an hour to get them all in. Another 45 minutes if I had completed my whole head...no thank you! I was hoping for something easy, low maintenance to give me the finished look I get from a blow dry and hot iron curl. I spent the same amount of time and arm cramps on these curl formers. Wait! There is a positive. The curl you get is awesome and lasts for most of the day (depending on your hair type) mine lasted a couple of days though they started to limp on day two. (My hair is naturally wavy). So if you have shorter hair, less hair, more curlers and more patience than I do--go for it. Otherwise, save your money for that blow out ;)</li>
    <li> So ... If you want a way to curl your hair with almost no heat from wet, this is it.  They are a temporary inconvenience to sleep on, but you want your hair 100% dry before you remove them.</li>
    <li> I was really upset that I didn&#x27;t have the amazing experience that most other customers had, I was really excited about these but all the many attempts I made were unsuccessful.</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter who has the straightest hair ever and they work wonderfully. She woke up with beautiful ringlets that lasted for a good portion of her very active day!  Plus they are easy to use once you get the hang of pulling the hair through the sleeve. Took me about 3-4 times to get it right.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and this only covered half of my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the curlformers recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Love these. Definitely need two boxes for curly hair. I have long, thick 3c/4a curls &amp; one box barely covers half my head.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I love these.  I&#x27;m kind of, sort of addicted to these.  My fine, stringy, frizzy hair never looked better.  It takes a few times to get used to pulling your hair through the wand but, once you get going, it&#x27;s easy peasy.  So glad I got these.  I can change up my hair anytime.</li>
    <li> Great product! Did my hair justice and curled it approriately. Just try to get all the sectioned hair inside the hook so that you do not snag some of your hair strands. But beside that, if you&#x27;re patient, your curls will come out beautifully!</li>
    <li> It works as described.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I threw the box away and couldn&#x27;t return. Maybe you can become an expert on using these. But if you&#x27;re not, the results are, at best, mixed. Under my sink, never-to-be-used again til I can giving them away on Craigslist. I don&#x27;t want to donate them because I don&#x27;t want anyone else to have to pay to find out this won&#x27;t give you the curls you weren&#x27;t born with. Oh, well.</li>
    <li> I love curl formers and I would have given them 5 stars, my only issue was that they were too big. So make sure you have a lot of hair to fill them out for best results</li>
    <li> It takes practice and time but my daughter really enjoyed these. I had to help her put them in.  She is 9.</li>
    <li> I love curlformers and I love the curls they produce, and I love the quality of them. But I am really disappointed in these. The ends of these curlformers are poorly manufactured. When I opened the end on one of them it split right down the side, and some of the mesh on some of them go right through the plastic part. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give one star is because I could flip the side that&#x27;s poorly manufactured toward the bottom and use the good side at the top, where the hair goes. Get it together curl forms.</li>
    <li> They work well on natural hair however there wasn&#x27;t enough for my whole head</li>
    <li> Works well, good quality and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Really love curl formers. I have the other ones that are a bit thinner and it makes you look like a spiral perm, which can be fun, these are bigger and make beautiful loose curls. The great thing about them is you can put them in your hair DEAD WET and the hair will dry overnight and the curl will hold really nicely. I love my sponge rollers, but no way you can do that with them. This set was more than enough for my hair and I have bra-strap length hair that is not super thick, slightly fine but I have a lot of hair. They kind of stink to sleep in but beauty requires pain. Great price for this set!!! I was excited to see that.</li>
    <li> Works ok... but curls did not last as long as curls from curling iron.</li>
    <li> Ok,so it DOES deliver what it promises. . Is very easy to use  (once you get a hang ov it). . Ideal for reducing HAIR ABUSE (via hot tools). . Would recommend it to all those with a tad bit ov patience. . You will see results  (just don&#x27;t be hoping for miracles)</li>
    <li> Love these curlformers they do exactly what they say they do.  They don&#x27;t hurt your head if you sleep in them.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> You already know if you want the best you need the best. Settle for nothing cheaper, fake or the less.&lt;br /&gt;Love them and so does my husband. If I could give Curl Formers 10 stars, they would have 100 in our book. Thank you Hair FLAIR... thee best.</li>
    <li> Amazingly fun times with my daughter doing each others hair!</li>
    <li> My fine hair normally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl. These really work! I slept in them pretty comfortably but I only had 16 curlformers in. I&#x27;ve already ordered a smaller pack of the spiral ones to see if I like those as well</li>
    <li> Not the most comfortable to sleep in, but OMG I love the outcome, Best curls ever, 15 min to get my shoulder length hair in them. The hook can be awkward and frustrating, just be patient with yourself.</li>
    <li> These are made for long hair. I think they were a bit overkill for my shoulder length hair but they still worked great. I usually put them in wet hair at night and  in the morning I have big bouncy curls! These were also much cheaper than the ones I&#x27;ve found at hair salon stores. I would absolutely recommend them!</li>
    <li> These work well and I would have given 5 stars but the smelled funny I had to wash them in vinager to remove the odor. Other wise they work as expected. My hair dried beautifully and quickly.</li>
    <li> Love them the curlers worked magic, I loved the way the curls came out. I want ot get some smaller ones so that I can make it more full, but I loved these</li>
    <li> These are awesome. I have never been able to curl my hair not even with an iron. It was kind of difficult sleeping with them but is worth it</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Curlers longer than I expected, but work well and natural hair.</li>
    <li> I love them. They were easy to use, and I got really  beautiful curls. I have natural hair and I felt so happy when I got nice smooth curls. However you are going to need more than one pack to do your whole head.</li>
    <li> Used it when my hair was longer.  Gives awesome wavy curl definition.  A must have for healthy curls/waves.</li>
