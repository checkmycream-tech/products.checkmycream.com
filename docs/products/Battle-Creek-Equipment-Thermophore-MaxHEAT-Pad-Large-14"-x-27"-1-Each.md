      <li>yes, it does get warm very fast, but the temperature is no difference that the one from walmart, cvs or bedbath and beyond..</li>
      <li>The outside of the pad isn&#x27;t very impressive - it&#x27;s a heavy-duty muslin/canvas material, and the fleece case does start to \\&quot;pill\\&quot; right away with handling.  </li>

      <li>purchased this to help with a knee injury and experienced improved mobility and less aches and pain&lt;</li>
      <li>I really love this, at first the heat seemed too much</li>
      <li>and its made in usa..is it worth it to buy, no, not for this price...</li>

      <li>I had searched and bought several heating pads from CVS, Walmart,and Bedbath and beyond and all of them are made from china and they all get pretty warm to do its purpose</li>
      <li>I own one large moist heat pad for my back and am on my 4th neck pad since 1983.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large and gets VERY hot.</li>
      <li>It is a warm, moist thermophore (&amp;#34; moist, large, heating pad&amp;#34;) that gives you instant relaxing heat!</li>
      <li>I have gifted it several times to family members who now swear by it.  </li>
      <li>from the first time of use.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this for treating back and neck soreness.</li>
      <li>however, with sunbeam i would actually lay on top of it, with my weight on it, still would not penetrate the muscles.</li>
      <li>first two # stand for which of 52 weeks of the year ~</li>
      <li>first two # stand for which of 52 weeks of the year ~</li>
      <li>But I plugged it in &amp; draped the heating pad over my hip area - being sure to keep it flat as directed.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that it will cover the whole back and that it is self moisturizing (grabs moisture from the air</li>
      <li>I use the neck pad for multiple areas, but primarily my neck.</li>
      <li>A light becomes solid with each 5 minutes used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>that is not the case with this one, the thermophore max heat heats up to more than enough and the 20 minute time interval is usually enough, sometimes i keep it on longer than that, but i have to move it around from place to place because it really does get quite hot, and i dont want to burn myself.</li>

      <li>Many good reviews but Amazon&#x27;s shopping experience is a little confusing trying to figure out which models have the manual switch or timer.</li>
      <li>Just taking a brief break from the heat - and to get a cool drink of water - then will apply this MaxHEAT pad once again before bedtime.  </li>
      <li>I read most of the reviews and quite some reviews say its not worth it.</li>
      <li>it is such a nice relief to have something that actually gets hot enough, i&#x27;d</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Thermophore Classic style heating pad since childhood.</li>
      <li>but after getting used to itI can&#x27;t believe how quickly it relaxes my back</li>
      <li>If you have the $ buy the Classic model.</li>
      <li>I wish I had stayed with the Classic.</li>
      <li>but it takes a while to get to the high temperature of 130.</li>
      <li>Maybe a new version of the one I had before.  </li>
      <li>The cover is washable and comes out looking brand new.</li>
      <li>I bought the Thermophore Max as a replacement for an old Thermophore Classic heating pad.</li>
      <li>(Much nicer to use then Thermophore&#x27;s &#x27;Classic switch&#x27; (in their red boxes)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have arthritic joints, and this heat really penetrated deep into my joints.  </li>
      <li>I have been using products from Battle Creek for over 25 years for back pain, really helps.  </li>
      <li>The power switch flashed 4 green bars, but when I felt it was hot enough, I just pressed the pause button to allow the pad to cool a bit - then</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the switch and the material is not as pliable, but still would not have any other heating pad.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;Easy-Comfort Switch\\&quot; models might say Standard or Classic</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it for the above reasons.</li>
      <li>rather it get a little too hot, and move it to a different area than to have to keep laying on an inferior one that never gets hot enough.</li>
      <li>One has a dead-mans switch, which you depress until it gets hot enough.</li>
      <li>It is a little pricey as compared to cheaper heating pads, but I think it was well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no control of heat settings, such as high - med - low.</li>
      <li>While the interface is kind of odd (which heats up the pad and cools it down 4 times in a 20-minute period rather than merely being switched on or off), it&#x27;s fine once you get used to it.</li>
      <li>~ Small red light stays continually on to show it&#x27;s plugged in properly</li>
      <li>I chose the Max because it has an on/off button, rather than the switch you have to hold down as on the Classic.</li>

<li> Same as any other!</li>

<li> having to fork out money every single year for a new heating pad is ridiculous if you ask me.</li>

    <li> Wife likes it for her aching back.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come in a box! If this is authentic, the packaging is questionable. Heating pad is much heavier than I expected, but at least it works (for now anyhow!). Hard to recommend a product and supplier that leaves much doubt about it&#x27;s authenticity and the fact that it can&#x27;t be returned. I would have shipped it back immediately after opening package and not finding a manufacturer&#x27;s box.</li>
    <li> I really love this, at first the heat seemed too much but after getting used to itI can&#x27;t believe how quickly it relaxes my back</li>
    <li> This product quit working after six months. Trying to get the company to honor the year warranty. Will let you know how this works out for me.</li>
    <li> Battle Creek puts out the best moist heat pad available.  I have had five neck injuries.  Currently, I have RA.  I own one large moist heat pad for my back and am on my 4th neck pad since 1983.  I use the neck pad for multiple areas, but primarily my neck.</li>
    <li> Many good reviews but Amazon&#x27;s shopping experience is a little confusing trying to figure out which models have the manual switch or timer. Amazon should show the correct picture with each model so the customer can see what they are purchasing.   1) The \\&quot;Easy-Comfort Switch\\&quot; models might say Standard or Classic/Plus. These have the manual on/off switch and doesn&#x27;t have a timer, and is packaged in red boxes. The switch works by holding it down. Press the switch and the pad gets hot, quickly.    2) The MaxHEAT/Plus models come with the \\&quot;One-Touch Switch\\&quot; which means it has the 20 minute timer, and is packaged in black boxes.   Thermophore is made by (Battle Creek) Equipment.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this for treating back and neck soreness. Other heat pads just pale in comparison. While the interface is kind of odd (which heats up the pad and cools it down 4 times in a 20-minute period rather than merely being switched on or off), it&#x27;s fine once you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Was a gift to a grandson who was suffering from back pain. He said it worked well, heated up quickly and the size was perfect for covering the entire lower back area.</li>
    <li> The pad is gently warm in one minute, and reaches maximum heat within 3 to 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;With the pad laying on top the body it gets very warm, the pause and/or off button turns off heat at any point.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to not lay on the pad. When I tried laying my leg on top the pad, the captured heat was intensely uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious how hot?&lt;br /&gt;&gt; 1. I laid a candy thermometer between pad &amp; body &#x3D; 123 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; 2. Pad wrapped around thermometer &#x3D; 140 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;(Customer service says it can get up to 160 degrees if trapping heat by laying on it)&lt;br /&gt;&gt; 3. Pad wrapped around thermometer, with blanket on top &#x3D; 162 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads moist heat penetrates tissue and joints which is very effective in giving remarkable relief.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to help with a knee injury and experienced improved mobility and less aches and pain&lt;br /&gt;starting from the first time of use. (Two 20 minute sessions)&lt;br /&gt;I felt the treatments alleviated soreness and jump started a healing process,&lt;br /&gt;because the area was still dramatically more limber the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERVIEW OF PRODUCT ~&lt;br /&gt;&gt; 1. The 100% cotton cover is specifically designed to absorb moisture from the atmosphere between uses&lt;br /&gt;and release the moisture during heat activation. The moisture is obviously present because skin or clothing becomes slightly damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; 2. Auto Switch ~ Small red light stays continually on to show it&#x27;s plugged in properly ~ Aids finding switch in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;Switch has a bar of four blinking lights ~ one bar per 5 minutes. A light becomes solid with each 5 minutes used.&lt;br /&gt;Automatically turns off in 20 minutes. (Much nicer to use then Thermophore&#x27;s &#x27;Classic switch&#x27; (in their red boxes)&lt;br /&gt;which must be continually held down to heat)&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no control of heat settings, such as high - med - low. And no way to have it stay on continually.&lt;br /&gt;I phoned customer service to ask them why the product is designed this way, they said ~ safety reasons.&lt;br /&gt;Because it gets very warm/hot to provide good therapy, as hot as 160 degrees if covered or laid on top of,&lt;br /&gt;it can be harmful to a person ~ burns. And dangerous ~ electric shock and/or fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; 3. Large pad (14\\&quot; x 27\\&quot;) is weighted construction so it drapes better over the body. Pad with cover weights 2.12 lb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; 4. Latex free ~ On the box it says \\&quot;contains no chemicals\\&quot;. Instructions booklet under warnings says&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This product contains chemicals which are known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; 5.

    <li> I had searched and bought several heating pads from CVS, Walmart,and Bedbath and beyond and all of them are made from china and they all get pretty warm to do its purpose but it takes a while to get to the high temperature of 130. Despite of the manufacturers specification of 170.... None of them ever get to that temperature. So I looked here on amazon and saw this item on line but never could find it in any store. I read most of the reviews and quite some reviews say its not worth it. I listened to people&#x27;s review but I am in desperate of finding a heating pad that will help me with my shoulder knot that I decided to purchased this...yes, it does get warm very fast, but the temperature is no difference that the one from walmart, cvs or bedbath and beyond.. It only goes to 130 and it stay there until it shuts off 20 minutes later..and its made in usa..is it worth it to buy, no, not for this price...its too expensive.. Same as any other!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful way to get pain relief. It heats up so quickly it draws moisture from the room.  It is considered moist heat. There are 2 types. One has a dead-mans switch, which you depress until it gets hot enough. You then let go of the switch. Over an extended period of time it cools down.  The second type, you turn the switch on, it heats for 20 minutes then shuts off. I have had both types. It has warnings for those who are in-firmed or decompensated,or who lack feeling, to avoid injury.</li>
    <li> I have been using products from Battle Creek for over 25 years for back pain, really helps.  I like the size of it as this heating pad is much larger than other heating pads.  The cover is washable and comes out looking brand new.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past 15 years! I would highly recommend it for the above reasons. It is a warm, moist thermophore (&amp;#34; moist, large, heating pad&amp;#34;) that gives you instant relaxing heat! I can&#x27;t be without one! It goes wherever I go! I love the 30 minute automatic shut off. You must be careful not to bend it, sit on it, or lay on it! Elderly or those with memory confusion or have diabetic neuropathy have to be closely supervised! I could not live without it!</li>
    <li> I bought the Thermophore Max as a replacement for an old Thermophore Classic heating pad. I wish I had stayed with the Classic. I chose the Max because it has an on/off button, rather than the switch you have to hold down as on the Classic. I was irritated to find that the Max control has a light that is on any time the unit is plugged in. I like a very dark bedroom. I used to keep the classic plugged in and laying on the side of the bed for when I got cold during the night. The light on the Max is so bright that bothers me at night. Other than the constantly-on-light on the controller I like this heating pad. It&#x27;s large and gets VERY hot.</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist and I use this constantly! I love the fact that it will cover the whole back and that it is self moisturizing (grabs moisture from the air so you get warm moist heat). I also appreciate the auto shut off for safety. Great product.</li>
    <li> i have muscle spasms in my shoulders/neck area, and have gone thru so many heating pads from walmart (sunbeam, etc) and they only seem to last 1 year before they wear out because they just dont seem to get very hot, and i have to leave it on for hours at a time to penetrate my tense muscles.  that is not the case with this one, the thermophore max heat heats up to more than enough and the 20 minute time interval is usually enough, sometimes i keep it on longer than that, but i have to move it around from place to place because it really does get quite hot, and i dont want to burn myself. it is such a nice relief to have something that actually gets hot enough, i&#x27;d rather it get a little too hot, and move it to a different area than to have to keep laying on an inferior one that never gets hot enough. this one (thermophore), i do not lay on top of, it would scald for sure, you lay the pad on top of you, and it works plenty. however, with sunbeam i would actually lay on top of it, with my weight on it, still would not penetrate the muscles. hopefully this gives you a good idea of how good this heating pad is. my only hope is that it lasts longer than a year, then i will be super happy. having to fork out money every single year for a new heating pad is ridiculous if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Maybe a new version of the one I had before.  Not crazy about the switch and the material is not as pliable, but still would not have any other heating pad.</li>
    <li> Just received my heating pad today.  I was just so tired of the cheap models purchased at drug stores or Wal-Mart, and wanted something that put out a lot of heat and that wouldn&#x27;t get crumpled up on itself.  I may have found the perfect heating pad.  The outside of the pad isn&#x27;t very impressive - it&#x27;s a heavy-duty muslin/canvas material, and the fleece case does start to \\&quot;pill\\&quot; right away with handling.  But I plugged it in &amp; draped the heating pad over my hip area - being sure to keep it flat as directed.  There was IMMEDIATE heat - and I had on a light pair of jeans!  The power switch flashed 4 green bars, but when I felt it was hot enough, I just pressed the pause button to allow the pad to cool a bit - then when I was ready for another blast of heat, I pressed the pause button again, and the green bars started to flash.  It stays on for 20\\&quot;, then automatically powers off. This is awesome!  It is a little pricey as compared to cheaper heating pads, but I think it was well worth the money.  I have arthritic joints, and this heat really penetrated deep into my joints.  Just taking a brief break from the heat - and to get a cool drink of water - then will apply this MaxHEAT pad once again before bedtime.  This is definitely not for the faint hearted, as it delivers serious heat!  Please read all directions, and don&#x27;t sleep with this pad.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Thermophore Classic style heating pad since childhood. (and that&#x27;s a long time!) Decided to get this one because it seemed to be very similar in size and function but with different style of controls. It&#x27;s way different! Much lighter weight and kind of &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; sounding when you bend it. Don&#x27;t expect it to hold up for 20 years like my other one did either! But for the price maybe it&#x27;s an acceptable option for many. If you have the $ buy the Classic model.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and would not be without it!  I have gifted it several times to family members who now swear by it.  Please do not compare this to any other electric heating pad because there simply is no comparison.  The deep, penetrating, moist heat from this product produces relief from even excruciating, debilitating pain.  This is a must-have item.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FOR ALL MY ACHES AND PAINS...CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS PURCHASE.</li>
