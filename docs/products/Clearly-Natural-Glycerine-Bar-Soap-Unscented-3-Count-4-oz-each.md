      <li>This stuff is amazing -</li>
      <li>I use this soap to make my own bath cubes and cloth wipe cubes.</li>
      <li>will be learning how to make my own glycerin soap if this manufacturer is planning on changing the formula</li>
      <li>rose water</li>
      <li>(I read chamomile and licorice creams are great for dermatitis, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find any that are paraben/phosphate free).</li>
      <li>It grates and melts easily, washes smoothe when used on it&#x27;s own, and has no appreciable smell or odor.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena is better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok and I am using all 3 bars</li>
      <li>The soap was OK.  </li>
      <li>so I was glad to find this.</li>

      <li>I love this soap.  </li>
      <li>5 stars from me! :)</li>

      <li>but if it continues to be ok; then I will buy here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update; one day after use this; skin itching, stinging.</li>
      <li>This is cut in blocks and though the shape shows rounded edges on the ends, the sides square off with the top and bottom, giving 90 degree angles instead of a smoother shape that rolls better in your hand.  </li>
      <li>Great all natural soap to clean your make up brushes with!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fruit of the Earth aloe vera gel (the clear one (great primer before applying makeup and over developing blemishes))</li>
      <li>Great natural product.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is good quality, gentle soap.</li>
      <li>Nope, it was still drying and on top of that didn&#x27;t seem to rinse clean.</li>
      <li>For an unscented soap, this has a strong odor that does not allow me to use it because of my asthma.  </li>
      <li>I am guessing they re formulated it, because it now has a strong scent even though it says unscented.</li>
      <li>This is the first soap in years I have been able to use for more than 3 months at a time and not have any skin issues develop with long-term use.</li>
      <li>In its bar form, that&#x27;s accurate...</li>
      <li>It had a nice smooth feel, lather nicely and worked for the family members with various allergies.</li>
      <li>This is so important to me.  </li>
      <li>This soap is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Clean feel and easy on the skin.  </li>
      <li>The good one; the &#x27;clear&#x27; one has almost no scent.</li>
      <li>These are very nice, solid bars and clean well.</li>
      <li>I was excited to buy this soap, until I discovered it contains palm oil.</li>
      <li>Non-drying, clean &amp; fresh!</li>
      <li>The bar diminishes in size, but I don&#x27;t feel as though I&#x27;m getting clean.</li>
      <li>Does not irritate my skin and leave me feeling clean</li>
      <li>They are unscented, and I found that to be true.</li>
      <li>stars for the true product.</li>
      <li>This is not the true formula.</li>
      <li>The true product does not irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried many since they stopped making Free and Clear bar soap.</li>
      <li>Quickly shipped and well packaged.</li>
      <li>It is clear and scent free for sure, but it just doesn&#x27;t lather well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of the lucky people that&#x27;s allergic to everything</li>
      <li>To all my fellow Super Sensitives, please try these before getting too frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I melted them down to make coffee infused soap bars, and they did a great job.</li>
      <li>Good for those who cannot tolerate scented soap bars and have dry itchy skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, and although it&#x27;s unscented it naturally has a very light, sweet smell which I enjoy.</li>
      <li>, skin feels very nice, not dry or itchy, all natural,</li>
      <li>I like a soap which doesn&#x27;t have much residue, and doesn&#x27;t bath me in cheap perfume.</li>
      <li>My husband has terribly sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most of the perfumed and dyed soaps out there.</li>
      <li>Rose water is the ONLY thing in all the years of whatever it is my eyes are allergic to that has provided non-stinging and immediate relief</li>
      <li>I eventually moved a bar from my shower to the bathroom sink, on the theory that rubbing the bar directly on my hands will transfer more soap to the body rather than using a wash cloth as a cleaning medium.</li>
      <li>My friends that not have sensitive skin or allergies,  love it to.</li>
      <li>As you continue to use the bar, the edges wear down to a more rounded shape that makes the bar rotate better when you do that to get some lather - which I mentioned is nominal.</li>
      <li>The Neutrogena pump is more convenient, but I keep this in the master bath as a general use soap.  </li>
      <li>The lather isn&#x27;t very long-lasting, so be quick with your washcloth.</li>
      <li>reducing my original 4-star rating to 3 stars now because I&#x27;m experiencing even more bars with less than adequate cleansing ability.</li>
      <li>Many products just add additional layers of oils, without actually cleansing the pores.</li>
      <li>There is no odor that I can detect, the bars are extremely smooth and clear.</li>
      <li>(Pyrex bowl inside a pot of hot water), and added about 14 oz.</li>
      <li>When reading this, keep in mind this is my first experience with Glycerine soap.  </li>
      <li>low suds but gets you very clean</li>
      <li>Lasts a reasonable time, very gentle, and the unscented is just that.</li>
      <li>So there you go if you&#x27;d like a (hopefully) positive face regimen.</li>
      <li>Picture is the clear true product.</li>
      <li>It does not dry the skin as a cheap soap (like the ones from hotels).</li>
      <li>Her Fibromyalgia makes her very sensitive to most bath products &amp; this is the only soap she can use!</li>
      <li>I really like the soap but 2 stars for the price</li>
      <li>soap was supposed to be gentle</li>
      <li>Never seen soap prices jump this much in 40 days.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t feel that it cleans very well.  </li>
      <li>Few weeks ago my caregiver used a popular liquid soap with SLE  </li>
      <li>I have purchased this product countless times over the years and am more regularly experiencing bars that, for some reason, don&#x27;t lather much at all.</li>
      <li>; version lathers very nicely, particularly if you use a body puff.  </li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s delicate, it&#x27;s a gentle and effective cleanser for oily and normal skin.</li>
      <li>I used to buy this in Fresh and Easy, but my local store closed, so now I buy it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Overall I have been pleased with this, though haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if I like it better than the beauty bars such as Dove and Tone.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never complained to the company.</li>
      <li>Right now this is the only soap I can use on my face.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this soap for whole body use because you may have to lather your washcloth multiple times to get your entire body clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent soap! Odorless, non-drying. I will definitely add this to my Subscribe &amp; Save items.</li>
    <li> The soap was OK.  It is clear and scent free for sure, but it just doesn&#x27;t lather well.  I just don&#x27;t feel that it cleans very well.  Neutrogena is better.</li>
    <li> This soap is great!  I have sensitive skin and this is the only soap (other than Neutrogena unscented) that leaves my skin feeling great.  These are a better value as well, they are larger and last longer than Neutrogena and they are less expensive, WINNING!:)</li>
    <li> Very gentle, and did not dry my skin in my hard well water.</li>
    <li> This soap is &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34;.  There&#x27;s nothing fancy about it, but it gets the job done.  My skin is senstitive to most fragrances, additives, preservatives, etc.  I read numerous reviews that say this soap doesn&#x27;t lather well.  In its bar form, that&#x27;s accurate...however, I slowly melted my in a &amp;#34;double boiler&amp;#34; (Pyrex bowl inside a pot of hot water), and added about 14 oz. of water to one bar.  I shook it up and let it settle in a bottle over night.  Basically, I made a body wash with it.  The &amp;#34;body wash&amp;#34; version lathers very nicely, particularly if you use a body puff.  Since I added water to it and no harsh preservatives, it should be used fairly quickly, as it will not have a long shelf life. 14 oz. usually lasts me the better part of 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> These worked great for what I needed them for! I melted them down to make coffee infused soap bars, and they did a great job. Turned out a little sweaty, but I think all glycerine soap is that way. These are very nice, solid bars and clean well. Would purchase these again to make more. They are unscented, and I found that to be true. No strange odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive skin of the face; add several years now of contact dermatitis on the skin of my eyelids and around the lower lash line. Glycerine (unscented) is the only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t agitate the raw areas of my face, nor suck all the moisture out. There is no odor that I can detect, the bars are extremely smooth and clear. I wish I&#x27;d left salicylic acid based face washes alone a long time ago, instead of all the back and forth. To all my fellow Super Sensitives, please try these before getting too frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just this past week I also bought rose water and vitamin e oil, the former for relief to the eyelids, the latter as part of a lash lengthening serum. However, combined or apart, these two are excellent naturals for your skin and hair. Rose water is the ONLY thing in all the years of whatever it is my eyes are allergic to that has provided non-stinging and immediate relief (I read chamomile and licorice creams are great for dermatitis, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find any that are paraben/phosphate free). I can&#x27;t stress it enough: I&#x27;m so very grateful to find out about its effects. So there you go if you&#x27;d like a (hopefully) positive face regimen. Expanded, I recommend:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly Natural glycerine bar (wash)&lt;br /&gt;Costas rose water (toner)&lt;br /&gt;Trader Joe&#x27;s vitamin e oil (at night, directly to face)&lt;br /&gt;Fruit of the Earth aloe vera gel (the clear one (great primer before applying makeup and over developing blemishes))</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap that has truly been the safest for me, someone who has switched soaps countless times due to skin allergies and irritations. This is the first soap in years I have been able to use for more than 3 months at a time and not have any skin issues develop with long-term use. It&#x27;s gentle, and although it&#x27;s unscented it naturally has a very light, sweet smell which I enjoy. Some of the other brands of unscented soaps I&#x27;ve used in the past tend to have that sterile, &amp;#34;hospital-y&amp;#34; smell, which I don&#x27;t prefer. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like other soaps have done in the past and it cleans well. 5 stars from me! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s slippery, it sweats, and it melts. Although it&#x27;s delicate, it&#x27;s a gentle and effective cleanser for oily and normal skin. I use it for the oiliest part of my body: my face. It cuts down on my facial grease and rinses away easily. However, this soap is not a master of lather. If your washcloth is wet enough and you&#x27;re a determined soap applier, your efforts will amount to a sufficient lather to get the job done. The lather isn&#x27;t very long-lasting, so be quick with your washcloth. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this soap for whole body use because you may have to lather your washcloth multiple times to get your entire body clean. I have purchased this product countless times over the years and am more regularly experiencing bars that, for some reason, don&#x27;t lather much at all. Defects in the manufacturing process? I&#x27;ll never know. I&#x27;ve never complained to the company. Other users maintain that Clearly Natural have changed their formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this may seem paradoxical, keep this soap away from any water NOT used to wet your washcloth. If this soap is kept in the shower or exposed to extra doses of water, it will melt and become gooey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be some confusion among customers about whether or not this unscented soap has a scent. For those ultra-sensitive to fragrances: None have been added, however, there is a very, VERY slight trace of a natural glycerine scent. (3.5 stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: November 3, 2017&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m reducing my original 4-star rating to 3 stars now because I&#x27;m experiencing even more bars with less than adequate cleansing ability. I have 1 and 1/2 bars left, but instead of scrapping them, I&#x27;ve decided to use them only for mild hand washing. (2.5 stars)</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Does not irritate my skin and leave me feeling clean</li>
    <li> I bought the unscented glycerin soap and for the record there was no coconut anything listed. I&#x27;m saying that because someone claimed the formula was changed and the one I bought recently was not. Here are the ingredients for the unscented only: Glycerine, Palm Stearic Acid, Palm Oleic Acid, Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Sodium Hydroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap was supposed to be gentle but I found that it caused me to break out very badly and clogged my pores right up. I was previously using a glycerin based soap which kept my skin clear (but was a bit drying) so I thought this one would be less drying. Nope, it was still drying and on top of that didn&#x27;t seem to rinse clean. I tried it for a few weeks but it was just getting worse, I don&#x27;t know what the issue was so I tried to use it as a body soap. i should have known the fact that it leaves a film would irritate my lady parts quite a lot. I also started breaking out on my chest. I would not recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Best soap I have ever used! It does not dry your skin nor does it leave a film feeling on your skin! I wish I found this soap sooner!!! I never do reviews but I thought this soap deserves some praise.</li>
    <li> This soap is fantastic.  Clean feel and easy on the skin.  I have sensitive skin, and this is the only soap that I use anymore.</li>
    <li> I use this soap to make my own bath cubes and cloth wipe cubes. It grates and melts easily, washes smoothe when used on it&#x27;s own, and has no appreciable smell or odor. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Hard to get it to suds on your washcloth!  Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> When reading this, keep in mind this is my first experience with Glycerine soap.  Overall I have been pleased with this, though haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if I like it better than the beauty bars such as Dove and Tone.  I don&#x27;t notice a smell/odor like the other user does.  My husband won&#x27;t use it in the shower but will at the sink (since that&#x27;s the only bar there). I find it difficult to suds up.  The shape of the bar is a bit awkward, as it is slightly too large for comfort in my hand.  This is cut in blocks and though the shape shows rounded edges on the ends, the sides square off with the top and bottom, giving 90 degree angles instead of a smoother shape that rolls better in your hand.  As you continue to use the bar, the edges wear down to a more rounded shape that makes the bar rotate better when you do that to get some lather - which I mentioned is nominal.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very good for the ones looking for a soap without a scent. When using it it feels that it does not clean as much as a regular soap but it does. It does not dry the skin as a cheap soap (like the ones from hotels).</li>
    <li> Great all natural soap to clean your make up brushes with!</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive. I&#x27;m one of the lucky people that&#x27;s allergic to everything weird.&lt;br /&gt;I use Clearly Natural soap all the time. I recommend trying this product. My friends that not have sensitive skin or allergies,  love it to.</li>
    <li> Since I have quite oily skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts, I&#x27;m always careful about the type soap I&#x27;m using. Many products just add additional layers of oils, without actually cleansing the pores. It&#x27;s really quite frustrating. Glycerine is brilliant at cleaning without stripping the skin or leaving an oily residue. I&#x27;ve used it for years, and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Non-drying, clean &amp; fresh!</li>
    <li> Great natural product. We loved the quality of this soap. It had a nice smooth feel, lather nicely and worked for the family members with various allergies.</li>
    <li> I like a soap which doesn&#x27;t have much residue, and doesn&#x27;t bath me in cheap perfume. I used to buy this in Fresh and Easy, but my local store closed, so now I buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> low suds but gets you very clean, skin feels very nice, not dry or itchy, all natural, no harsh chemicals, no strong perfume smell either :-)</li>
    <li> I been using this soap for over 10 yrs, very sensitive skin body/face. Few weeks ago my caregiver used a popular liquid soap with SLE  it, I had ugly blisters on upper back, rash everywhere. Decided that Clearly Natural is the &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; soap for us. No perfume, SLE nor chemicals. Ordering unscented lotion today.&lt;br /&gt;keenpetite aka Carmen</li>
    <li> This is so important to me.  I have very sensitive skin.  Right now this is the only soap I can use on my face.  I have tried many since they stopped making Free and Clear bar soap.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:e44540eacc5b7528a3100d47f048d81e]]Not as pictured. Picture is the clear true product. (Ask Amazon for that one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the true product. 3 star for the yellow-brown colored one they sent me.&lt;br /&gt;Its the other type that has a yellowish light brown color to it. If it stings my skin like the yellow-brown color did in the past I will add that to my review.  UPDATE; it did not sting my skin so far. So; maybe this is a good product. Are there different forms of glycerin that have different colors? I know some is taken from food-vegetables, plant sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true PURE product I have bought in the past is not yellow or brown. It is clear. The true product does not irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be learning how to make my own glycerin soap if this manufacturer is planning on changing the formula but if it continues to be ok; then I will buy here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update; one day after use this; skin itching, stinging. This is not the true formula. Its the yellow one that gave me same problem 2x in the past. It also smells weird. Sorry but have to put it back to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAME label, list of ingredients but this is not the product advertised.  The good one; the &#x27;clear&#x27; one has almost no scent. And the scent it has is pleasant. I bought it somewhere on Amazon in the past.</li>
    <li> I like this soap and bought this three pack bar soap for $3.89 almost a month ago and now its $5.69. Never seen soap prices jump this much in 40 days. I really like the soap but 2 stars for the price hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will check out other soaps that are clear and natural</li>
    <li> Good for those who cannot tolerate scented soap bars and have dry itchy skin. My mother uses it because of her sensitive skin,  She suffers from dry, itchy skin and allergies to scented soap bars. Her Fibromyalgia makes her very sensitive to most bath products &amp; this is the only soap she can use!</li>
    <li> Not sure I like the fact that it just doesn&#x27;t suds at all.  It&#x27;s ok and I am using all 3 bars but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I was excited to buy this soap, until I discovered it contains palm oil. Help save the rain forests and don&#x27;t buy products containing palm oil, as the plantations result in massive rain forest destruction. I look forward to a product with no palm oil from Clearly Natural in the future.</li>
    <li> For an unscented soap, this has a strong odor that does not allow me to use it because of my asthma.  I had been using this soap for years with no scent.  I am guessing they re formulated it, because it now has a strong scent even though it says unscented.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena pump is more convenient, but I keep this in the master bath as a general use soap.  Some have mentioned there is an odor but that is not my experience.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS IS WHT I LIKE ABT THIS &amp; IT REALLY DOES FEEL CLEANER THAN OTHER SOAPS - IT CN DRY UR SKIN OUT IF U SHWR W IT REGULARLY SO BEST USED 4 HAND SOAP</li>
    <li> This has been our preferred soap for some years. Lasts a reasonable time, very gentle, and the unscented is just that. My spouse likes both the unscented and the version with aloe vera (but it has an odor I find disagreeable).</li>
    <li> I use to produce products with E.O.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand of soap my husband likes.  He loves the unscented version but tyring to span out and try different types in this line.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing - I&#x27;ve had dry, scratchy skin for years and using this soap has cured that.  Noticed real results in a few days and it just keeps getting better - my skin is soft, smooth and feels like a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
    <li> Will be using this soap</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have always used Ivory bar soap. I tried this while on vacation and have been using it for 5 months. I don&#x27;t itch and it is not as drying as Ivory. I do stick with all unscented products so I was glad to find this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed with this soap. I received it as a gift. I had asked for bars of glycerine soap after having bought some fancier glycerine soap bars at a specialty soap store. I loved how those other bars cleaned well and moisturized my skin without harsh chemicals, but I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep paying $6 or $7 per bar. I was excited to receive a six-pack of Clearly Natural unscented glycerin soap bars as a gift, thinking they&#x27;d be similar to what I previously had purchased for myself, but I&#x27;m finding that&#x27;s not the case at all. Mostly, I&#x27;m frustrated by how little cleaning power these bars seem to have. They do not suds up, as other reviewers have commented, and some think that&#x27;s a good thing, while others seem disappointed as I am. Even if suds aren&#x27;t necessary for cleaning, as one reviewer claims, these bars don&#x27;t seem to offer whatever else is necessary for sustained or economical cleaning either. When I rub them vigorously on my wash cloth, it still feels like almost no cleaning agent is on the cloth, and I end up rubbing a wet, not-soapy cloth on my body. The bar diminishes in size, but I don&#x27;t feel as though I&#x27;m getting clean. I eventually moved a bar from my shower to the bathroom sink, on the theory that rubbing the bar directly on my hands will transfer more soap to the body rather than using a wash cloth as a cleaning medium. It seems this soap is better used as a sink bar than as a bath bar, but I&#x27;m still disappointed, because that&#x27;s not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My local Safeway quit carrying this soap. The only other glycerine soap they had was way too expensive. I did not expect to find it here, but I am very glad that I did. It is good quality, gentle soap. My husband has terribly sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most of the perfumed and dyed soaps out there. This does the job and keeps him happy. Quickly shipped and well packaged.</li>
    <li> This is the best glycerine soap I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Great soap. timely delivery.</li>
