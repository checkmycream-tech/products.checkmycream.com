      <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
      <li>Took me 3-4 coats to get a nice, opaque finish.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very easy to see through.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a nice color, but the picture for this item could be better.</li>
      <li>This was just as described and arrived very quickly!</li>
      <li>It does a great job of covering and looks exactly like the enlarged version on the Gelish website.</li>

      <li>I can&#x27;t comment on this polish since I gave it away, but I love the Belisha products and use it all the time</li>

      <li>I love this Gelish nail color.  </li>
      <li>I love the nail polish</li>
      <li>love the Gelish product.  </li>
      <li>Love this color and have received many compliments.</li>
      <li>It looked like if I put another coat it would lean more to a silver.   </li>
      <li>the polish didn&#x27;t stick as well and started peeling at the top edge.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own to give you that prefectly smooth look.</li>
      <li>Love how this stuff just evens out on</li>
      <li>Would be interesting to see how it would look alone vs over another color.</li>
      <li>This color is very sweet, its very light and needs 2 coats .</li>
      <li>The color is a light glittery silver and of course the glittery water field color makes it even more shiny.</li>
      <li>Love it by itself or great to make a flat color have a top shimmer coat.</li>
      <li>is one of my favorites because it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>Also, this seller was very quick with shipping.</li>
      <li>Beautiful shimmery silver and NOT giant</li>
      <li>It will wick up under the skin, and as it grows out you&#x27;ll have a huge ridge.  </li>
      <li>I love this brand and own many different shades.  </li>
      <li>so you get a smooth finish.  </li>
      <li>You will require an LED or UV curing light.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a pretty polish, but I wouldn&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>Fun color!</li>
      <li>This polish is lovely, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This is a very fine glittery silver, very dressy.  </li>
      <li>I may try an opaque grey underneath, but can&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars on its own.</li>
      <li>I am looking forward to getting more colors very soon.</li>
      <li>It is more dense than a normal glitter with a lot of coverage.</li>
      <li>Make sure to really clean the nail up near the cuticle.  </li>
      <li>It could also add a nice silvery shimmer to a color that you put under it, as with only one coat</li>
      <li>I have recently started doing my own gel nails at home.</li>
      <li>Wearing this right now.</li>
      <li>i was looking for a solid silver, this is a fine silvery glittery look, very cool also, can be sheer or opaque, depends how many coats you would like to do, i do 2</li>
      <li>In the photo, it seems to be more of a shimmery white, but in fact it&#x27;s a shimmery silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is just more Sheer than I thought it would be, but still pretty.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and</li>
      <li>it was pretty but not what I was looking for</li>
      <li>Unlike many of the Gelish products, this one actually looks just like the picture!</li>
      <li>Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
      <li>This was one of the first colors I bought.</li>
      <li>and shinny but also good for everyday my fav color</li>
      <li>Opaque in two coats and it&#x27;s subtle silverly white tone with lots of shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Not really impressive</li>
      <li>i think it will look great as a twist to my typical french manicures.</li>
      <li>Thanks VIPolish, appreciate you ripping me off.</li>
      <li>This is just a straight up silver polish.</li>
      <li>this color is not white but a sparkly light silver.</li>
      <li>One coat gives a shinny cover over any other color or alone you can use two or more coats for a very silver color.  </li>
      <li>I use it over the Tutti Frutti and it looks like a whole new nail color!</li>
      <li>Decent.</li>
      <li>This is a nice subtle color to wear alone or it is great over other colors to tone them down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more silverly than that picture.</li>
      <li>I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  </li>
      <li>It takes a few coats to get full coverage, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>I found the Harmony Gelish products to be thinner than normal nail polish</li>
      <li>I love the shimmer effect on the plain color.</li>
      <li>This was my first Gelish purchase, but it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
      <li>Clear polish with silver glitter.</li>
      <li>I thought that it was a frosty white color, but it&#x27;s actually a very glittery silver metallic.  </li>
      <li>I was concerned that it would look too white or grey, but it is a true silver.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this color, but the coverage is just not there, even with 3-4 thin coats.  </li>
      <li>Nice &amp; thick, long lasting.  </li>
      <li>It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  </li>

<li> I do all kinds of gardening work and house remodeling projects, so there are plenty of chances to mess it up.  </li>
<li> if it does - just wipe it off but to avoid it just keep a little on the brush.</li>
<li> You can layer it over another color for a very subtle glitter effect (I put it on over pink smoothie).</li>
<li> When you apply the polish, since it&#x27;s a thick gel, it settles out any brush strokes before it cures</li>
<li> It is a thick silver glitter with a silver undertone.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s base color is too dark.</li>

    <li> I really wanted to love this color, but the coverage is just not there, even with 3-4 thin coats.  I may try an opaque grey underneath, but can&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars on its own.</li>
    <li> This polish is lovely, exactly what I was looking for. It looks like a cross between a shimmer silver and white or pearl. Very pretty and looks great!</li>
    <li> Beautiful shimmery silver and NOT giant flakes of glitter........just silver metallic.  It is awesome for Silver French tips on red nails for Christmas or New Years!!!!!!!!!  I also use it for nail art!</li>
    <li> This is a nice subtle color to wear alone or it is great over other colors to tone them down.</li>
    <li> Opaque in two coats and it&#x27;s subtle silverly white tone with lots of shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Not really impressive and I honestly don&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a solid silver, this is a fine silvery glittery look, very cool also, can be sheer or opaque, depends how many coats you would like to do, i do 2 and it is enough coverage to hide nails underneath, you know like where the nail changes color at the tip, ect. very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and own many different shades.  When I saw this online I thought that it was a frosty white color, but it&#x27;s actually a very glittery silver metallic.  It&#x27;s still a nice color, but the picture for this item could be better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Gelish! This color was not exactly what I was expecting. It is a thick silver glitter with a silver undertone. It does a great job of covering and looks exactly like the enlarged version on the Gelish website. However, don&#x27;t even think of layering. It&#x27;s base color is too dark.</li>
    <li> This was just as described and arrived very quickly! Will be buying again from this seller for sure! This color is silver in tone.  One coat gives a shinny cover over any other color or alone you can use two or more coats for a very silver color.  It is more dense than a normal glitter with a lot of coverage.</li>
    <li> This is just a straight up silver polish. The flecks are tiny. Would be interesting to see how it would look alone vs over another color. Decent.</li>
    <li> Clear polish with silver glitter. Not silver as pictured. You can layer it over another color for a very subtle glitter effect (I put it on over pink smoothie). But if you are expecting silver glitter polish dont buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and knew what to expect.</li>
    <li> I put three coats on and it still just looked like a frost instead of silver it was pretty but not what I was looking for</li>
    <li> i am looking forward to trying this color. i think it will look great as a twist to my typical french manicures.</li>
    <li> love the Gelish product.  Lasts for weeks if applied properly and if taken  care of can last 2 weeks or longer</li>
    <li> Bought 3 and haven&#x27;t used this one yet. It&#x27;s next.  I love the shimmer effect on the plain color.</li>
    <li> I have had this on for 8 days and it is not lifting, chipping, or peeling off. It is still shinny and looks as if I did it yesterday. I only used one coat of the Night Shimmer and it is whitish silver looking. It looked like if I put another coat it would lean more to a silver.   I found the Harmony Gelish products to be thinner than normal nail polish so you want to be cleaning your brush often otherwise it runs onto your skin. No problem if it does - just wipe it off but to avoid it just keep a little on the brush. Love how this stuff just evens out on it&#x27;s own to give you that prefectly smooth look.</li>
    <li> Love wearing shimmer silver. this color is not white but a sparkly light silver. Love it by itself or great to make a flat color have a top shimmer coat. Definitly a must have color.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item as well as two other polishes from VIPolish and paid for all three items, however this item wasn&#x27;t shipped to me.  I tried contacting the seller but they ignored me, even when I contacted them multiple ways.  If you want to actually receive it, maybe try a different seller.  I&#x27;m sure it is a pretty polish, but I wouldn&#x27;t know.  Thanks VIPolish, appreciate you ripping me off.</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the Gelish products, this one actually looks just like the picture! The color matches pretty perfectly. This was my first Gelish purchase, but it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
    <li> I love gel nail polish! I bought this in combination with some other gelish products, so that I didn&#x27;t have to keep paying $30ish everytime I wanted my nails to look great for 3 or so weeks at a time. Also, this seller was very quick with shipping. I was on a bit of a time crunch to get this, but I went with the regular shipping anyway - and I still got it in time! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wearing this right now. I out two coats and put two coats or the color water field over. Love this color and have received many compliments. The color is a light glittery silver and of course the glittery water field color makes it even more shiny. Fun color!</li>
    <li> It takes a few coats to get full coverage, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. This silver is beautiful, and it was just what I was looking for. It could also add a nice silvery shimmer to a color that you put under it, as with only one coat it&#x27;s very easy to see through. Took me 3-4 coats to get a nice, opaque finish.</li>
    <li> awesome color great wear&lt;br /&gt;would def recommend&lt;br /&gt;nice and shinny but also good for everyday my fav color&lt;br /&gt;I wear it all the time</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on this polish since I gave it away, but I love the Belisha products and use it all the time</li>
    <li> Love this gel nail polish.  It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  I&#x27;ve had my current polish on for 2 weeks without a single chip or loss of shine!  And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  I do all kinds of gardening work and house remodeling projects, so there are plenty of chances to mess it up.  The best thing about this type of polish is it adds thickness and strength to your nails.   I have very weak nails and I haven&#x27;t had a single one break or tear while I&#x27;ve had this polish on.  When you apply the polish, since it&#x27;s a thick gel, it settles out any brush strokes before it cures so you get a smooth finish.  There are a couple of things to be careful of when applying.  Make sure to really clean the nail up near the cuticle.  I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and the polish didn&#x27;t stick as well and started peeling at the top edge.  I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  The other thing to be mindful of is to be careful when applying near the cuticles.  It will wick up under the skin, and as it grows out you&#x27;ll have a huge ridge.  If you try to stay a little ways away from the base of the nail it won&#x27;t be a problem.  Finally, as you&#x27;re working on your nails, just ignore how awful the cuticles look.  The cleaning solution drys them out, but the nourish oil fixes it all up at the end.  Read the directions on the Gelish website.  You will require an LED or UV curing light.  I think I saw someone else complain that the polish never dried on this product or one of the other Gelish polishes I was looking at on Amazon.  Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
    <li> I love this Gelish nail color.  I use it over the Tutti Frutti and it looks like a whole new nail color!</li>
    <li> This is a very fine glittery silver, very dressy.  I was concerned that it would look too white or grey, but it is a true silver.  Nice &amp; thick, long lasting.  Also nicely opaque.</li>
    <li> Great Transaction, Harmony Gelish Gel Polish is a great Product. I am looking forward to getting more colors very soon. I love the fact that it makes your nails look great for two weeks. Thank You</li>
    <li> I have recently started doing my own gel nails at home. This was one of the first colors I bought. I love the nail polish but it&#x27;s not quite the color in the photo. It&#x27;s a little more silverly than that picture. In the photo, it seems to be more of a shimmery white, but in fact it&#x27;s a shimmery silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like the color and the Harmony gel polish is one of my favorites because it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> Now I love Gelish so don&#x27;t get it twisted!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just more Sheer than I thought it would be, but still pretty.</li>
    <li> This color is very sweet, its very light and needs 2 coats . Also stays on long, thats why I like shimmer gel polish, last forever!!</li>
