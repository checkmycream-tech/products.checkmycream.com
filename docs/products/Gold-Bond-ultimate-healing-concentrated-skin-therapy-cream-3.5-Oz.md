      <li>I&#x27;m so glad it still exists someone.</li>
      <li>perhaps, better - than some of the &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>face moisturizers I&#x27;ve used, including ones that cost more than $150.  </li>
      <li>so I love that I can come onto Amazon and find it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I found it.</li>
      <li>I usually love Gold Bond products.  </li>
      <li>I have used many products,  including my own hand made body creams with shea butter,  but none has been as therapeutic,  scent free and non-greasy as this.  </li>
      <li>was pleased to see it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I wash my hands many times a day, and at night I use this hand cream.</li>
      <li>Love this lotion, works so well in the Winter for my uber-dry hands</li>
      <li>I love this cream and use it for my feet.  </li>
      <li>Unscented, rich, easy to apply - your skin will love it!  </li>
      <li>The best solution for dry chapped hands.  </li>
      <li>My hands and fingers on my palms crack and bleed from being too dry and this product takes care of both problems perfectly.</li>
      <li>The best lotion there is for chronically dry skin.</li>
      <li>so I am very happy that they are available here on Amazon and with such affordable price.</li>
      <li>Although it hasn&#x27;t completely prevented cracks, maybe I need to applied it more often, it has greatly reduced the number of cracks I get and haven&#x27;t had any cracks on my hands yet.  </li>
      <li>I tried many other creams before and found this one to be best.</li>
      <li>This is the best healing crenels for very dry or cracked hands</li>
      <li>This is a winning combination, and you would do well to make the lotion in the pump bottle available as unscented also.</li>
      <li>My thumb&#x27;s cracked skin is fully healed and smooth.</li>
      <li>No annoying scent, absorbs and without a greasy feel.</li>
      <li>But this smooth skin from the mani, pedi lasts 1-2 days.    </li>
      <li>It also works surprisingly well on my chapped lips, leaving them plump and soft.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it does the job without being greasy because I can put my shoes on right after I use it.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it is fragrance-free and worked great on my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s dry, sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>I am definitely an avid supporter of this lotion!!</li>
      <li>From the first time I applied it, I knew this might help because it didn&#x27;t hurt when I applied it and most of the pain disappeared.  </li>
      <li>Great for dry cracked hands.</li>
      <li>Works great on feet, hands, elbows, anywhere your skin is overly dry.  </li>
      <li>It works fantastic, never stings, has a pleasant scent, is nice and thick and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do think this would be a good protective lotion for someone who is going to be outside.</li>
      <li>so I am thankful that I can get it from amazon and even better I received it fast.</li>
      <li>This thick cream is the best for cracked skin on my hands.</li>
      <li>I like the Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Lotion with Aloe, in spite of its strong floral fragrance, and hoped this product would also be effective.</li>
      <li>Great Brand, intended to purchase another product though that I had used previously which I like better than this particular item.  </li>
      <li>My leg was looking and feeling normal in a week, and the fragrance free formula was a blessing because it didn&#x27;t burn my skin!  </li>
      <li>, I just liked the other healing Gold Bond cream better.</li>
      <li>Good moisturizer for those with really dry, chapped hands.</li>
      <li>(that make my hands too hot!).  </li>
      <li>Love this on my feet at night with socks to keep them soft.</li>
      <li>I walk a lot worth buying</li>
      <li>Get a much better fragrance free lotion that moisturizes your skin instead of just retaining moisture by blocking it from the outside world.</li>
      <li>Quickly absorbed with mo odor.  </li>
      <li>I use this right before bed and it keeps my hands moist throughout the night.</li>
      <li>Does not seem to wash off right away, which is also a plus.</li>
      <li>No other product match the gold bond&#x27;s magic.    </li>
      <li>This product works amazingly fast!</li>
      <li>My first time to use this product.  </li>
      <li>I love that it locks the moisture in the skin and lasts for a long time even after I wash my hands, and I can barely smell any strong fragrance after applying.</li>
      <li>I get dry skin very easily,  and the gold bond lotion helps so much</li>
      <li>Thick cream, good right before bed.</li>
      <li>It is very good for anyone who gets cracks (tiny open areas) on fingers especially during the winter.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it does sink in pretty fast, my hands tend to be a bit slippery for a while after application.</li>
      <li>I love it, not greasy and really works on very dry hands.</li>
      <li>Scentless and protects your hands really well.</li>
      <li>cream really, really works.</li>
      <li>Really helped with the roughness and cracks in my hands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product.  Really softens really tough areas.  Quickly absorbed with mo odor.  Keeps my hands, feet, elbows soft and looking great!</li>
    <li> Great for healing dry/damaged skin without a smell or greasy feel.</li>
    <li> My hands get very dry at night. I use this right before bed and it keeps my hands moist throughout the night. Does not seem to wash off right away, which is also a plus.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, but thick and creamy. A life saver in the cold weather.</li>
    <li> I cannot list the number of lotions, moisturizers, gloves (for nighttime use), etc. that I have bought and tried over the years for the dry skin on my hands.  Upon taking on a childcare crew this past school year and changing a multitude of diapers each day, a lotion that worked inspite of the constant hand washing was necessary.  I was so tired of bloody, cracked, painful hands, fingers, and fingertips.  This lotion does just what it claims...stays on inspite of hand washing!  My hands are no longer an embarrassment to me, and I get to sleep w/o having them coated in some greasy/oily mixture with gloves (that make my hands too hot!).  I&#x27;ve found this product at every grocery in town, and it runs around $6-$7/tube; and occasionally there is a coupon available.  I&#x27;ve even been using it on our daughter for all-over protection.  She has eczema and this soaks in w/o a greasy mess all over her clothing.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Tis lotion is so thick!  I works great to heal chapped hands in the winter.</li>
    <li> This is for my Hubby. He is diabetic and has a lot of drying to his hands. After many products he discovered this and won&#x27;t use anything else. I signed up for the monthly delvery so I won&#x27;t have to go all over town looking for it.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes really well, and is much thicker than the traditional Gold Bond Ultimate Healing with Aloe. It&#x27;s almost too thick, though, and a greasy, somewhat sticky residue collects in-between your fingers after application. This residue and sensation does disappear over time, but it took a good while (perhaps 30 minutes) for it to go away. It is for this reason that I gave it four stars versus five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product. Good moisturizer for those with really dry, chapped hands.</li>
    <li> I got a tube of this cream as an impulse purchase at the drugstore, but I was desperate for something that would keep the rough skin on my fingertips at bay. I like the Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Lotion with Aloe, in spite of its strong floral fragrance, and hoped this product would also be effective. My hands get so rough in the dry winter air that things catch on them. Working with fabrics and textiles becomes impossible. Think how Laura Ingalls&#x27; hands looked after the long winter of twisting slough hay to burn for warmth after the family ran out of coal during the Hard Winter of 1880-81. This is the stuff she would&#x27;ve craved for relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream really, really works. It&#x27;s very thick, so just a dab a couple of times a day after washing my hands keeps my fingertips soft and my cuticles free from hangnails. My elbows don&#x27;t look like a reptile starting to shed. I can wrap a knitted scarf around my neck and not have it catch on my index finger and pull the threads out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it does sink in pretty fast, my hands tend to be a bit slippery for a while after application. There&#x27;s no odor I can detect (sometimes \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; means a somewhat medicinal odor that hasn&#x27;t been covered up with another scent). It&#x27;s such a relief to find a product like this that does what it promises on the box.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond has a winner here. This creamy hand lotion is thick and leaves the hands feeling smooth after its applied. I get very dried and chapped hands during the winter and this hand lotion is just the ticket to keep my skin from cracking. A little goes a long way so I don&#x27;t have to use as much as the cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> Great for dry cracked hands. Prevents splitting.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find the &amp;#34;concentrated therapy in the stores anymore, and it&#x27;s the only thing that works for my daughter. Glad I found somewhere to get it again!</li>
    <li> Great lotion!  I have been searching for something to sooth dry skin and this did the trick!  It&#x27;s not greasy and it l really  liked how my skin felt  using it! I highly recommend.  I should also add that as I get a little older, I am a tad sensitive to scents.  No problem at all using this!!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and my doctor recently convinced me it is also dry enough to be causing the eczema signs and symptoms I&#x27;ve had for a number of years.  I also have a sensitive nose and don&#x27;t want to cover my body with smelly stuff.  I started putting this stuff all over (it&#x27;s easier on wet skin right after a bath/shower), and in a few weeks time the lesions on my skin disappeared. The itching stopped immediately.    I had a little panic when my local drug store stopped stocking it, and I found the other drug store in my town doesn&#x27;t stock it either.  I tried a number of different brands. Some say \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; but still smell perfumy.  And none stopped the itching as this stuff does.    TO CHATTEM (and whoever acquires the Gold Bond brand in the future) PLEASE!!!!!!!  Don&#x27;t ever discontinue GOLD BOND ULTIMATE HEALING CONCENTRATED THERAPY CREAM!!!!!!  And DON&#x27;T ADD SCENT TO IT EITHER!!!!!!!!!  You added scent to the pump lotion and I will not buy it.  True unscented lotions are hard enough to find.  This is a winning combination, and you would do well to make the lotion in the pump bottle available as unscented also.</li>
    <li> Works like Aquaphor but without as much greasy feel.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, and this is the only thing that works.</li>
    <li> This really soaks in and helps winter-weather hands. Just what you expect from Gold Bond.</li>
    <li> This is the best of many brands we have tried.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. The only cream I have found to help with my overly dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, works so well in the Winter for my uber-dry hands</li>
    <li> I usually love Gold Bond products.  However, this one is the work of a genius after suffering a sever blow to the head.  I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s brilliant idea it was to make a moisturizer that is one third silicone and petrolatum (3% silicone, 30% petrolatum)and then add a bunch of thickeners so that the cream gets to the point where you can not spread it at all.  I had to let it sit for a little bit so the ingredients that would actually moisturize my skin instead of just coating it could set in and I could wash off most of the occlusive ingredients that make my skin so slippery it would need a caution sign.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this hand cream ever.  Get a much better fragrance free lotion that moisturizes your skin instead of just retaining moisture by blocking it from the outside world.</li>
    <li> a product that works--lovely</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I can say anything about this product that has already been said but I will repeat that it is the only product that I have found that really works for extremely dry skin.  I have tried them all and this one actually works.  I am sad that I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so I am thankful that I can get it from amazon and even better I received it fast.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin moisturizer I used in my life. No other product match the gold bond&#x27;s magic.    My hands &amp; feet would be so dry, I used to file down the callouses &amp; dry skin on my hands &amp; feet &amp; cuticles to get the rough areas out.I would go to get aroma mani &amp; pedi &amp; paraffin to remove my extreme dry skin. But this smooth skin from the mani, pedi lasts 1-2 days.    Gold bond help my skin smooth all day long. I go to get mani &amp; pedi less often. I wish I knew about this sooner in my 43years of life.     I will keep buying this lotion that really work.</li>
    <li> This is way too thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin. Their other lotions are so much better than this one.</li>
    <li> I had eczema on both palms.  The cream the doctor prescribed cured it, but did not resolve the mess left from all the peeling.  Gold bond ultimate healing concentrated coated my skin, making the peeling much less visible, and healed them inside of a week.  I also use the ultimate with Aloe, but it did not work anywhere as well.  Gold bond ultimate healing concentrated lasts through hand washings and, unless you&#x27;re dealing with a problem like my eczema, only needs to be applied once a day.  For the peeling I had, I used it twice a day.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick lotion, but it is basically petroleum jelly.  We bought it to use frequently because we are washing our hands a lot through the day.  It doesn&#x27;t work to use frequently, because it&#x27;s so greasy.  I do use it at night, but I still have to rub off some of the lotion.  I do think this would be a good protective lotion for someone who is going to be outside.</li>
    <li> This cream relieves and nourishes my skin from the dryness and cracked area on my body and lips during cold, winter weather. The cream is rather thick but it absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling heavy or oily. I love that it locks the moisture in the skin and lasts for a long time even after I wash my hands, and I can barely smell any strong fragrance after applying. After a few uses, my skin is soft and supple, and I can see the reduction of cracks on my hands, elbows, knees, and feet. It also works surprisingly well on my chapped lips, leaving them plump and soft. This cream is a savior for nourishing and moisturizing skin during the harsh cold and windy weathers.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and it works as well as being priced lower than the other Gold Bond Products. Gold Bond works on the principle of softening and moisturizing skin but it&#x27;s just too expensive for me.</li>
    <li> Works great on feet, hands, elbows, anywhere your skin is overly dry.  Rub into feet at bedtime, put on clean white socks.  After a few nights of this treatment, your feet, especially your heels, will look and feel better.</li>
    <li> Uses this cream whenever I fly or during winter time. Scentless and protects your hands really well. This are very hard to find in Walgreen&#x27;s or CVS so I am very happy that they are available here on Amazon and with such affordable price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase! Thank you!</li>
    <li> The best lotion there is for chronically dry skin. In my expertly dry-skinned opinion. Not greasy at all, unlike most other brands.</li>
    <li> This is actually the only thing that I have found that works on my skin problem. I&#x27;m just glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it is pretty thick.  But it works.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion!  It lasts through a hand washing.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything better, for hands, elbows, and feet. This product disappeared from the shelves for a little while, so when I saw it available again, I bought several. Gold Bond has an &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; foot cream, but I found it didn&#x27;t work on my feet. This Ultimate Healing Concentrated does. If you wear sandals a lot in the summer, or go without socks, the skin on your heels can get very thick and callousy; this product softens your feet up overnight. And a little goes a long way. It works wonders on my hands too--they get very, very dry and cracked to the point of bleeding--and I&#x27;ve found it safe to use around my pets (i.e., putting on hand cream and then petting, feeding, caring for pets, can be dangerous if you&#x27;re not careful about what you&#x27;re using). There&#x27;s almost no &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; residue, and it&#x27;s unscented. Everybody has different skin, so not every skin cream or moisturizer works the same for all people. But for me, this paricular Gold Bond product works the best.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer. If you have very dry or chapped skin, this will bring relief. It is a very thick cream so it is not as spreadable as other creams. But it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> The best solution for dry chapped hands.  Used nightly it healed my dry cuticles when nothing else helped.  Originally bought it on clearance in a local drugstore but now can only find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly fast! I&#x27;d accidentally bunrned my whole face and I thought nothing could repair it. My face was so rough and so then, my parents toke me to Walmart to find a cream to repair my face. This cream exactly worked the next day! My skin is almost back to normal!</li>
    <li> My first time to use this product.  Was really surprised by it&#x27;s effectiveness.  Less is better.  Very heavy.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> I broke my leg and was in a hard cast for 5 weeks.  When it came time to take my cast off, my skin was extremely dry and flaky.  As the doctor cut my cast off, he actually cut my leg.  This gave me the added drama of searching for a moisturizer that would moisturize my leg without burning my open wounds. This lotion was a lifesaver!  My leg was looking and feeling normal in a week, and the fragrance free formula was a blessing because it didn&#x27;t burn my skin!  The texture is kind of like a creamy Vaseline paste, which feels awesome on dry skin!  I am definitely an avid supporter of this lotion!! Inexpensive and effective!!! Five Stars!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream and use it for my feet.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have never had a problem with dry or cracked skin on my feet.  I used to buy it at Winco and Walmart but they no longer carry it so was pleased to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best Hand Cream EVER!!!  I wash my hands many times a day, and at night I use this hand cream. It works better than anything!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I suffer from extremely dry calloused feet and I was not able to find any relief until I tried Gold Bond Ultimate. Not only has it softened my dry skin and helped remove the callouses, but it is nice and thick too, so I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it to get results. I love the fact that it does the job without being greasy because I can put my shoes on right after I use it. This is definite a must have.</li>
    <li> This is the best healing crenels for very dry or cracked hands</li>
    <li> Very thick and soothing lotion. I love most of the Gold Bond lotions but this one is extra thick.  My hands are dry all the time and I&#x27;ve found that this really helps especially if I use it at night with gloves.</li>
    <li> Excellent handcreme.  A little goes a long ways.  My favorite.</li>
    <li> Of all of the hand lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried, this is the ONLY product that relives my dry winter hands. Just a little bit goes a long way, too- I have been using the same tube for 9 months and only just now need to order a new container. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little greasy on the fingers, but I get around that by only putting it on the backs of my hands when I&#x27;m at work/ need to type or use my hands. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery of as-described item ~ Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this on my feet at night with socks to keep them soft. I put on my hands before bed as well. Non greasy.</li>
    <li> This thick cream is the best for cracked skin on my hands. I have used many products,  including my own hand made body creams with shea butter,  but none has been as therapeutic,  scent free and non-greasy as this.  I typically use the cream a couple times a day and am surprised by the long lasting effects. My thumb&#x27;s cracked skin is fully healed and smooth.</li>
    <li> This brand really works in healing the cracks, cuts, and dryness that I get from having to wash my hands often due to my work environment. I wish I could still buy it at the stores. But I am very grateful that it is here. I&#x27;m so glad it still exists someone.</li>
    <li> does not break my face out</li>
    <li> Started using this Gold Bond product several years ago. It is very good for anyone who gets cracks (tiny open areas) on fingers especially during the winter. I tried many other creams before and found this one to be best.</li>
    <li> My hands feel the effects of frequent washing and sanitizer use and this is very soothing and does not feel greasy, is absorbed very quickly and the moisturizing protection lasts for a long time. I use it on my feet too, works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other more oily feeling lotions, but always felt like I had to dry my hands off after. Not so with the Gold Bond</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE VERY BEST LOTION YOU CAN BUY. I tried everything, Vaseline &amp; gloves at night. Working hands. Neosporen &amp; Bandaids in oven mitts. Everything you can think of I have tried to heal my cracked &amp; bleeding hands. This is the only product I have found that works. It changed my life. I think everyone knows about it as well, because the slot on the shelf for it at the store is always empty. I have resorted to buying it online. I can&#x27;t live without it. You will never need another lotion again. I cannot recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> My husand didn&#x27;t like this because he felt it was too thick. He likes his lotions to feel like water. I, however, did like it and I am writing this review so there you go. It is thick but I guess I expected that as it is concentrated and healing. Winter skin is the worst especially in the midwest and this product works well. I like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazingly well for dry skin, especially excema</li>
    <li> One of the best hand creams I have ever used. Really helped with the roughness and cracks in my hands.</li>
    <li> Only Hand cream that works for my dry/cracked/bleeding knuckles, period! I tell everyone I know about this product.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the store so I love that I can come onto Amazon and find it.</li>
    <li> This is super thick and creamy. It absorbs well and does not leave greasy residue. This is a great hand cream to use before bed. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I have a skin condition which my doctor prescribed an ointment to use.  My feet and hands would become extremely dry and cracks would appear.  Because my feet would hurt so much from the cracks and my hands would also hurt a lot whenever I washed it, I covered it with liquid bandage which temporarily gave some relief from the pain.  I would use my medicine, and a moisturizer, for 10 days or so before it cleared up.but it always reappeared after a couple of weeks. I saw this lotion at Walmart and decided to try it since it said it heals and prevents cracked skin.  From the first time I applied it, I knew this might help because it didn&#x27;t hurt when I applied it and most of the pain disappeared.  Instead of having painful cracks on my feet for about five days, my cracks started healing after one day or two using this lotion.  Although it hasn&#x27;t completely prevented cracks, maybe I need to applied it more often, it has greatly reduced the number of cracks I get and haven&#x27;t had any cracks on my hands yet.  I&#x27;ve been using this, without my medication, for over a week and I an so happy with this lotion and results.  I can&#x27;t tell you how great it feels to no longer suffer from painful cracked feet and hands!</li>
    <li> This product really seals moisture into your skin so you can go about your day.  My chapped hands immediately felt soothed after using it. Best of all, it is fragrance-free and worked great on my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s dry, sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> My hands and fingers on my palms crack and bleed from being too dry and this product takes care of both problems perfectly.</li>
    <li> Unscented, rich, easy to apply - your skin will love it!  I bought this product for my hands and heels - but have ended up using it on my face on my wrinkles and extra dry areas.  Truthfully, it works as well - perhaps, better - than some of the &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; face moisturizers I&#x27;ve used, including ones that cost more than $150.  I&#x27;ve heard that this particular product is - or will be - discontinued.  Too bad because it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, you may wish to try this Gold Bond ultimate healing skin lotion. I walk a lot and my feet get dry. And we have a wood burning stove which dries the air. I tried the Gold Bond cream for my feet and liked it. It didn&#x27;t sting as some other lotions with more scent in them do. I also bought this Ultimate Healing Lotion to keep around the house to use on my feet and skin. It works fantastic, never stings, has a pleasant scent, is nice and thick and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds a protective layer of moisture. It is hypoallergenic. It has worked for me. I apply it to my feet when I go out to walk, get on the treadmill or return from walking. Or it&#x27;s great to put on just before bedtime.</li>
    <li> I get dry skin very easily,  and the gold bond lotion helps so much I haven&#x27;t had any since I started using the lotion.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for my exema</li>
    <li> This is a very thick lotion that works well.  It stays on somewhat even when I wash my hands.  I also use it on a scar that is healing and it seems to protect it.</li>
    <li> great  it is super thick I use it on my feet I walk a lot worth buying</li>
    <li> Best cream for those stubborn areas, heals, elbows, cuticles. Gold Bond is the cream of choice for me. I use the lotion as well as a regular hand cream. No annoying scent, absorbs and without a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Thick cream, good right before bed. I&#x27;m not sure I wil use it during the day.</li>
    <li> Great Brand, intended to purchase another product though that I had used previously which I like better than this particular item.  It did work well though, I just liked the other healing Gold Bond cream better.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding this exact one.  I love it, not greasy and really works on very dry hands.</li>
    <li> This cream is very thick, and good for winter time use. I just received it in the mail today and applied some to my hands and face went outside for about 1-2 hours and i still feel the moisture very good product</li>
    <li> Gold Bond Ultimate healing cream finally healed my dry crackled hands during this cold winter.</li>
    <li> Very good for sensitive skin. Moisturizes skin without burning like some of the scented lotions do on extremely dry skin.</li>
