<li> these scissors work very well for kids with difficulty with fine motor, young children, or even people who want ease of cutting!</li>
<li> My 3 yr old Down Syndrome daughter&#x27;s teacher recommended these to me for my daughter as a pair of scissors for her to have around the house.</li>
<li> My son has low muscle tone and struggles with fine motor skills, like paper cutting.</li>
<li> I needed to mount scissors for my son who has limited use of a hand to use to cut.</li>
<li> My daughter has Down syndrome and these work terrific!</li>
<li> Exactly as expected and what we needed.</li>
<li> , she&#x27;s four years old but has very, very small hands.</li>
<li> These scissors will work as a first step (training her hand muscles to the cutting process) and then we&#x27;ll move to the larger pair.</li>
<li> Finally, my child, who is a very small hand due to missing joints and muscles, can cut in her nursery classroom like the rest of her peers.</li>
<li> They are very sharp though.</li>
<li> But, the truth is I still use them for opening little things around the house, although they aren&#x27;t very sharp at all.</li>
<li> We love this pair of scissors, they made my son&#x27;s life less complicated when it comes to cutting.</li>
<li> Cutting is so much easier for him with these scissors.</li>
<li> They were recommended by his OT and not easy to find.</li>
<li> They are small, but do the job.</li>
<li> My son has very poor fine motor skills and has a very difficult time using scissors.  </li>
<li> Scissors are hard for her to manage.  </li>

    <li> My daughter is a lefty with some strength issues in her hands.  Scissors are hard for her to manage.  She loves these scissors and can cut with them like a pro.  They enable her to cut while still holding the scissors in the right direction.  All she needs to do is squeeze the scissors.  They open on their own.  Soon she will be able to move on to more traditional scissors but for now, she can still have the fun of creating by using scissors that she can open and close.</li>
    <li> awesome for my students to use to cut and learn how to</li>
    <li> I teach kindergarten/1st grade special education. These scissors are great for little hands. They are sharp, but I stay right beside the kids when they use these scissors. The scissors come with a cover.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected and what we needed. Going to use these to teach my son how to cut.</li>
    <li> this product worked well for my 3 1/2 year old grandson who does not yet have the hand strength to use regular scissors.</li>
    <li> Purchased these scissors in addition to a larger pair for my daughter who is Downs. Due to her small hand size these scissors fit her hands much better. She&#x27;s more able to focus on what she is cutting vs. the manipulation of the scissors. These scissors will work as a first step (training her hand muscles to the cutting process) and then we&#x27;ll move to the larger pair.</li>
    <li> good for toddlers and small children.</li>

    <li> Bought these for my grandson and he can cut with these better than the regular scissors.  Like the automatic spring that opens scissors back up!</li>
    <li> Great starter scissors for little ones.</li>
    <li> Our developmentally delayed daughter is learning to color, write and cut. We are still in the works but all the &amp;#34;kid friendly&amp;#34; scissors in Target, Toys &#x27;R&#x27; Us and whatnot have not been helpful for her. We learend of these from her OT (occupational therapist) and ordered a pair for her. They are much easier to help teach the concept to her.</li>
    <li> Wonderful easy grip for any person.</li>
    <li> very good for beginning cutters</li>
    <li> best thing I could have boughten for my grand children...they love them</li>

    <li> My son has low muscle tone and struggles with fine motor skills, like paper cutting. When he got these he was so excited. He now loves to cut and uses them daily. He is now never asks for me to cut things for him, when it comes to crafts. I now need a pair for my daughter, as she loves them too! Great product for children struggling in this area. They are small, but do the job. I even enjoy using them.</li>
    <li> My son has very poor fine motor skills and has a very difficult time using scissors.  His hands are very small, and these scissors fit in his palm very well and it is easy for me to help him cut things for art and craft projects.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a special needs child and these are perfect for his small hands.  Would highly recommend.  Is a quality purchase.</li>

    <li> I love to do crafts with my 2 year old grandson. They have sturdy construction and cut well. I bought 2 pair so I can model for him and we can do the projects together. I like the blunt ends to the scissors, but recommend adult supervision since they will cut just a cleanly as adult scissors</li>
    <li> I should have known when it said, mini I could possibly have problems with these. But, the truth is I still use them for opening little things around the house, although they aren&#x27;t very sharp at all. I will probably keep these just in case I have a another flare up.</li>
    <li> Cheap and broke quickly.</li>
    <li> Good quality, heavy duty, helps a lot with decreasing the frustration a kid feels to cut shapes. I recommend this scissors.</li>

    <li> Small enough to fit  in a purse or pocket, and with the blunt tips, not as much worry about poking yourself. Very colorful!</li>
    <li> These are great to help kids get used to scissors.</li>
    <li> FOund out about these from son&#x27;s occupational therapy.  They are good for developing hand eye coordination and reducing initial frustration by my toddler.</li>

    <li> Much smart than they appear.</li>
    <li> Excellent for kids who need help with fine motor skills.</li>
    <li> I purchased these scissors for my son last year when he was 5 years old.  My son has CP and uses these type of scissors at school with his Occupational Therapist so i wanted to get a pair for home as well.  Although he needs to use hand-eye coordination to control the scissors to close, they automatically open back up.  Another plus is that they work just as well for left and right handers.(a big deal for us lefties)  I tend to misplace my own scissors and find myself using these to open items, etc. also.</li>
    <li> MINI LOOP SCISSORS&lt;br /&gt;I have a special needs daughter, she&#x27;s four years old but has very, very small hands. These work great for her!&lt;br /&gt;The school had a pair for her but they were much bigger, too big for her to make them work. These are just her size!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my son. They were recommended by his OT and not easy to find.</li>
    <li> I love it. Very easy to use. I&#x27;ll recommend all the teachers. Childers. Children loved it .they said it is easy to use</li>
