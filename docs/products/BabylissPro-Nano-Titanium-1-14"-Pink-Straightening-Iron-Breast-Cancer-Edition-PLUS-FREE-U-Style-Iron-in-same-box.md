<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love love it.&lt;br /&gt;Can make the most beautiful curls and super shine straight hair ever</li>
    <li> It worked ok. My hair kept getting stuck in the plates though</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get these and tried them as soon as they came.  I tried the U styler first and was presented with burned hair on the first try. This isn&#x27;t the first iron for me but wanted to try it and I had hope.  I then tryed the other one on the other side of my head and it was better but it really pulled my hair and pulled strands out. I couldn&#x27;t go all the way to the ends of my hair without the pulling. It didn&#x27;t burn it though so that&#x27;s a plus.  I am returning these as soon as possible. I now have burnt smelling hair on one side. Yea!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else! The straightener works great even on medium heat and the u-styler is works great!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my BabylissPro Nano Titanium. It is the better flat iron. Absolutly. I really Love how my hair look after i use it.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron i have ever used.  my hair is naturally curly and this flat iron makes my hair perfectly straight all day.</li>
    <li> The Babyliss flat iron is terrific. It heats up quickly. Makes your hair very shiny. The price was terrific. You get two irons for the price of one. I would definite recommend this product.</li>
    <li> im a hairstylist and i can tell you i would never use a different iron! way better than the chi irons!</li>
    <li> This item is excellent, heats up and cools off fast, long cord for easy maneuver, two items for low price. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what anyone is talking about.  The u-shaped iron is wonderful.  All it is is this: the flat iron extends to the sides of one side of the iron.  That is the \\&quot;u\\&quot;.  When you iron your hair, make sure that the \\&quot;u\\&quot; is turned in towards the scalp.  Then you flat iron as usual.  Which means that the \\&quot;u\\&quot; may end up \\&quot;away\\&quot; from the scalp, as you turn the hair under or flip the hair up.  THAT&#x27;S IT... SERIOUSLY!  The iron heats up immediately, and does get hot.  I do follow all the warning instructions, and when I lay the iron down, it is on the pink side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, Love, Love this iron.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product!!! I love how it works on my hair. Better than the Chi.  Product was shipped out next day</li>
    <li> I loved the flat iron, it worked great! As for the U-Styler, I don&#x27;t care for it. It snagged my daughter&#x27;s hair and mine. I thought maybe it was the was the way I was using it or what not, but no matter how I held it, it still snagged my hair. I even thought maybe it was my daughters hair type (thick curly) so I tried it on mine (thin hair)and it still snagged.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightner I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all and it straightens my hair so quickly! I would highly recommend this to anyone~ I&#x27;ve had tons of straightners and this is by far the best!!!</li>
    <li> After several years of using and loving the Chi, it finally gave out and I needed a new flat iron. I spent a few hours researching flat irons online and in stores to find out what had changed over the years. I talked with my hair stylist, who used the Babyliss PRO Nano Titanium and loves that it heats up to 400+ degrees with options for lower settings and works great on her client&#x27;s hair, including mine. Then she told me about the U-Styler that her coworker used. I was intrigued by the idea of a flat iron that could straighten my thick, natually curly hair but also add a bit of curl and style as I often try to use a flat iron to do this anyway. It does a nice job of adding a little curl to my ends. Sometimes I use the U-Styler exclusively for both flat ironing and style. When I saw this pairing, I couldn&#x27;t resist asking for it as a Christmas gift from my husband. I also like the pink color and that this is the breast cancer edition. So far, I like the pair of irons very much. I think it is a great deal! It is working as well as the Chi did for about the same price but with the bonus of the U-styler, so I am very happy with this purchase. Excellent value.</li>
    <li> Both are great! It even leaves your hair shiny! Though it&#x27;s a bit slower than the blue one, its great. I use the blue one when my clients needs to hurry and finish with the pink one to leave their hair shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And its not true that the U styler is crappy, its great for everything! Mostly for curles and short hair!! You can manipulate short hair with the U styler even better than the normal one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a salon like i do, i stongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a terrific price. My daughter swore she would never use anything besides a Chi...guess what, now she wants one of these.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and rapid service. I recomended this Babyliss PRO Nano Titanium Pink Breast Cancer Edition. Is a wonderful and very good</li>
    <li> does just what it say :) hair is smooth and shiny, and it heats up really quick, worth the money!</li>
    <li> I like this iron and it made my hair feel really healthy. My hair would get caught it it somehow and I didn&#x27;t like that. It is good for giving a little curl at the ends. As for the U-Styler....I am not good with hair so I have to say I had no idea how to use it. I sent this iron back because I didn&#x27;t feel I needed both irons and the hair pulling thing bugged me. I am sure it was just me and I recommend this iron to anyone. Babyliss is a great brand and I love my hairdryer from them!</li>
    <li> I previously have had 2 CHI straighteners.  One broke after a year &amp; my 2nd still works.  However, when my new stylist used a BaByliss I was amazed at how smooth it felt on my hair &amp; how smooth it made it.  I use the U-Styler much more than the regular straightener because the U-Styler can create more volume if used properly.  The U-Styler is also great at creating curls in your hair.  It takes a lot of practice &amp; some work, but it can make great spirals or normal curls.  I do have a hard time making the curls on one side of my head look like the ones on the other because of how I hold the U-Styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The titanium straightener is far superior to the ceramic that the CHI boasts.  I&#x27;m sure that CHI will start producing titanium in the future because of it&#x27;s great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this set because it is a great deal to get 2 straighteners for $100.  The far inferior CHI that I had purchased  a few years ago was $130!  The pink is also a very cute, girly color.  The blue is cute too, if you&#x27;re not a pink girl.  I didn&#x27;t NEED a new straightener, but am willing to invest more money in my hair&#x27;s health.  I would recommend anyone buying a new straightener to purchase a BaByliss Titanium.</li>
    <li> I intended to buy a Chi as I used a family members a couple of times. But after reading reviews,I decided to try this one instead. I LOVE IT!!!!  It gets my thin,wavy hair super straight in no time at all. The U-Styler is awesome too in that I can straighten and add a little flip on the ends. I received my order within a week so that was very impressive as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener that I have ever owned. I have owned a Chi as well as a Remington straightener before this one and both of them were not able to get my hair as straight as this one. The extra 50 degrees makes a huge difference! I have also cut down my time by about 15 minutes as it typically took me anywhere from 20-30 minutes to do my hair before and now it only takes me 15 minutes at the maximum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the baby pink color and that I got the U-Styler with it as well. Just the straightener alone at my local beauty store retails for $189.99. Buy it online and get the added U-Styler included for half the cost that it should at your local beauty store!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I would highly recommend. I&#x27;m a former Chi user and would not go back! It&#x27;s super smooth and does not pull hair at all--not to mention that it gets my very naturally curly hair straight as when I go to salon.</li>
    <li> I give it 4 stars only because the blue Babyliss U iron is the BEST!  This one (the regular) is very heavy in comparison.  But, in saying that it really does a great job in straitening the hair.  And, the C iron is easy to use and lighter.  For a 2 for 1 deal, you can&#x27;t beat the price and the items work great.  Fast delivery and items are as shown.  Thanks Babyliss for great products and Amazon for outstanding delivery services with Prime!!!</li>
    <li> This straightener is wonderful! I was excited about getting this in the mail and I was not disappointed! I use to have a HerStyler straightener (which cost $100 at the mall) that heated up to 450 degree and definitely does not work as well as the Babyliss does on my thick frizzy hair. It does not only have one setting, they have 4 on the little digital screen and it comes with a guide so you don&#x27;t burn ur hair. It usually takes me 45-60 minutes to straighten my hair and now it takes 30-35 minutes. It is a miracle! I only have to go through it once or twice to make it sleek and shine. They come in a cute box with two drawers for each tool. I haven&#x27;t tried the ustyler yet but i still recommend this breast cancer one instead of the individual straightener because it&#x27;s only 20bucks more and it could be used as an extra straightener even if ur not good at making curls or waves with it. Also, i love the pink over then blue. It&#x27;s so cute! The only downside i see so far is it comes with a 1 year warranty and i believe the blue ones come with a 4 year. Anyways this works better on my hair than the chi turbo which i also loved. Buy it. DO IT!</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this to me and she was right! This is a great line of hair styling products. I&#x27;ve felt a difference in my hair texture and it reckon it performs better than the leading (and more expensive) brands! :)</li>
    <li> These are the best strightening irons I have used.  The service was quick and professional with this seller.  The irons are just the best.  The work well with my fine hair and I can control the heat level.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. This product is perfect, it has all characteristics indicated. I have long in use it, and work  correctly.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, precio competitivo con el mercado, la edici&amp;oacute;n especial de color rosa no es tan elegante como la edici&amp;oacute;n original azul de la misma marca, pero su funci&amp;oacute;n es igual, espero haber colaborado en la ayuda contra el c&amp;aacute;ncer de pecho aunque en la publicaci&amp;oacute;n no lo indican mi esperanza es que as&amp;iacute; sea y valga la pena</li>
    <li> It is a great value for the money.  I am having trouble getting use to it.  But think I&#x27;ll like it once I&#x27;m familiar with it.  I have previously owned two Chi&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m waiting to receve mine but now i wonder if is the original brand of babyliss :s&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;ll give you all my opinion as soon as i have them in my hands. So for now i&#x27;ll rate with a \\&quot;it&#x27;s ok\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I really like this iron. My two sisters have it and it does do what it says. The two for one combo- is a great deal!</li>
    <li> Muy buena oferta.... no hay planchas como estas...!!! son las mejores..!!! Yo he probado muchas... y estas son las mejores..!!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT BUY!!!! i love them, soo cute and such an awesome quality, and last but not least 2 for 1!!!!</li>
    <li> The first hairstyling tool I have found that will actually keep my hair curley past 30 min. Seems strange to curl your hair with a flat iron, but it works. I borrowed one from a friend and after one use was sold on the product. Good deal too!</li>
    <li> exc product... It was a gift and she loved it, works great and price was very good,,, thanks for everything,,, very good christmas present</li>
    <li> My customers all love how it works, all you can do with this article and is the best brand BABYLISS</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair straightener I have ever owned. I have received so many compliments on my hair being super shiny. I&#x27;m still getting used to the u styler but it is nice to be able to make waves with it but I still use my Curling iron for tight curls. I would definitely recommend this product to someone.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron, my first time using the Babyliss Pro! I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use the curling iron, but it actually straightens my hair pretty well too! I have 4a type hair and it works really well on my hair and I don&#x27;t even use the highest heat setting either!</li>
    <li> I used to have a Solano Sapphire straightener I could also curl my hair with, but after it broke I needed a replacement. I had heard great things about the Babyliss products, so I got this set because it was a great deal. They heat up quickly and give you shiny straight / curly less damaged hair. At first I did not pay much attention to the U-style because after my first try I failed miserably. I am glad i started watching YouTube tutorials (instead of the DVD it comes with which did not help me) and gave the U-style another chance because it is my go to styling tool now. I get perfect curls, waves, straight hair every time! (to be honest I use it more than the straightening iron).&lt;br /&gt;As an extra plus, you help Breast Cancer Research. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I bought this for the U-styler, and let me say it was no where near worth the $99 I paid.  The U-styler does not work the way the video claims it does, and the video that comes with it is NOT helpful.  I tried a number of times to get \\&quot;wavy\\&quot; hair as the video shows and it just looked like a bad crimping job.  It curls decently, but I have a Babyliss curling iron, so there was no need for me to keep a $99 product just for curling.  I was not impressed with the straightener either.  I again have a Babyliss straightener (the PRO Porcelain Ceramic BABP2555, which I LOVE!) and that works way better.  The Nano does not have a heat setting option, it is just always on 450, which is way too hot and damaging for many hair types.  Over all, just not worth the money.  Buy a good  Babyliss straightener 1 inch curling iron instead  and save some money.</li>
    <li> Professional hair salon quality. The included two drawe storage is a great idea. Great to see a product that also brings attention to the fight against breast cancer.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for quite some time now and I have no problems with it whatsoever. I previously owned a Chi which broke at exactly the one year mark, received my replacement Chi which then also broke to the one year mark (fyi the year warranty does not start over). So after shopping around I found this straightener, it gets as every bit as hot as my Chi did in the same amount of time &amp; it is every bit as cute. My hair is not tight curly but definitely has a wave going on, this takes care of it in no time. I would definitely say it is a must buy in the straightener world.</li>
    <li> I really bought this for the U Styler and as much as I love Babyliss products I was just not impressed with it.  It really didn&#x27;t do anything different than the regular flat iron.  I was hoping that it would give a little \\&quot;shape\\&quot; to my ends when I wear my hair straight but it did nothing.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service! Both irons work great, love the size very easy to handle. Also love to support the Cure for Breast Cancer any way I can. Would definitley purchase again!</li>
    <li> This staightner is literally the break threw of all hair straightners!! Best I&#x27;ve ever used. I could not have spent my money any better. Very light weight, Thin, Sleek and has a high heat seting. If your thinking about buying this straightner, Theres not one single flaw that I can say about it. BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used a BabylissPro Nana Titanium iron for several years and loved it, when it quit working I immediately ordered a new one.  My previous iron was the same model as the 1¼\\&quot; one, just a different color.  I thought the pink would be fun and the U-Style looked like a nice bonus.  Unfortunately the 1¼\\&quot; iron completely quit heating after only a few uses (I am hoping I just got a bad iron and the Babyliss quality I am used to hasn&#x27;t changed).  The U-Style seemed like a nice product until I actually used it on my hair, my hair got stuck in the plates, didn&#x27;t like this product.  I have returned this and reordered the original version I previously had.</li>
    <li> This flat iron holds up well! It gets super hot and straightens beautifully. A little big and cumbersome though. Just don&#x27;t forget a heat protectant serum or spray!</li>
    <li> I have other Babyliss Pro straighteners &amp; love them.  Not the case with these ones!!  The straightener DIDNT work at all-wouldnt heat up!!  Didnt like the way the U-Syle Iron worked..wasnt very good!  Returning both.  Must say Amazon makes returning VERY easy!!</li>
    <li> The product itself is amazing. I cut my hair straightening time down by 30 minutes. I have never been so happy with a purchase and the curler works really well once you get use to it. Takes a little practice. The seller was very prompt and accurate with the shipping and product. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Tried several, this is the one that works best. 2 for the price of one. Plus, you&#x27;re helping Breast Cancer Research. It&#x27;s a no-brainer, really.</li>
    <li> I ordered the BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium Straightening Iron and what I received from Mid State Beauty was a knock off. First BaByliss products all have a \\&quot;mirrored\\&quot; plates that keep hair from being pulled and avoiding burning. The flat iron I received has a dull rough plate. Secondly, I purchased the pink- breast cancer edition thinking I was contributing to a worthy cause. After receiving this item and researching I discovered that Babyliss does not even offer a pink version of any of their products and the extra cost certainly was not going to a charity to help support Breast Cancer research. Please be aware and DO NOT order anything from MID STATE BEAUTY. I&#x27;m out $165 with no recourse.</li>
    <li> I have very very thick, curly, dry and damaged hair, and prior to buying this product, if I wanted my hair straightened, I would make an appointment with a hairdresser. I have tried every kind of straightener, including a 200$ CHI, and nothing compared to the effectiveness of this product! I absolutely love it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other product, especially if you have ethnic hair. Get this straighter, it really works!</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this straightener after having one of those horrid ones from the mall start to sizzle my hair.  My hairstylist uses this one at her shop.  Got 2 for less than the usual price of one with this deal.  My hair feels so smooth after using this.</li>
    <li> calidad insuperable muy buen material . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Thanks I really liked the product and is of great quality and I still use that even I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> These flat irons do an amazing job!!! I have compared them to my old Chi flat iron and it is actually better, because they leaves your hair silky smooth and not frizzy. Babyliss is an excellent brand.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality of these TWO irons!!!&lt;br /&gt;i am pleased in every way.&lt;br /&gt;i have created so many different looks with these irons.</li>
    <li> I love these irons!! Ive used mine for 2 years  and they still work perfectly</li>
    <li> They are of good quality .</li>
    <li> The same as my hairdresser uses at a much better price.  One for me and one for my daughter!  I love the curved plates.  Gentle on hair.</li>
    <li> These irons are both totally awesome!  I love both of them!  They are the best I have ever used.  They get my hair straight faster &amp; better than any other iron I have ever used.</li>
    <li> i wish this was the newer edition the blue baby nano tec u styler for the curling works much better smh my old one broke i thaught this was a good deal , guess not</li>
