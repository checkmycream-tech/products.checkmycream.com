    <li> Great product; easy to order;/no issues</li>
    <li> Neutrogena products can be trusted.  This shower gel has a pleasant, clean and fresh scent without smelling harsh or fake.  I can stop shopping around for bath gel -- this will be it!</li>
    <li> This is the best shower gel, reasonably priced, soaps up good with very little so it lasts about 3-4 months. It is also very hydrating to my skin. I would recommend.</li>

    <li> I buy this once every two months, and have been doing so since I was in my earl teens. It&#x27;s more expensive at my local stores, so I buy from Amazon at an amazing price, added Amazon is great with shipping it out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with Neutrogena Sesame Oil during shower/bath and after, while my skin is damp. Together, my skin and very soft, healthy looking with a nice glow, and smells great. I even use it on my six-year-old daughter.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rainbath is the best Bath Gel, It has a nice fragrance, makes you feel fresh and clean. Love it.</li>
    <li> Not much to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said.  I&#x27;m normally an Irish Spring guy, but my mother had this in her shower, so I used it when I visited.  My skin felt clean, but moisturized after using it and I very much enjoyed the smell.  My wife and I love this stuff.  We&#x27;re converts.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product and love the smell!</li>
