<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This full size clipper is typical good Wahl quality, as expected.  The motor, being stronger than other models chops though the thickest hair without a problem and stays cool throughout the day!</li>
    <li> Great hair clippers! My boys ages 7 &amp; 5 get hair cuts by their dad and these give a professional cut. Our youngest hated hair cuts by dad with old clippers (loud and got hot) but now let&#x27;s dad cut his hair. Lots of attachments included. Money well spent and will save us so much money too!</li>
    <li> this is nice!! I have always wanted to own some clippers when I can just spend like 4-5 minutes cutting my hair. And this Wahl ICON delivers on that!!!!! I love it.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Lightweight &amp; more power</li>
    <li> Just wanna check with u, the power cord of this clipper can be use in Singapore?</li>
    <li> Awesome clipper! I bought these clippers 3 weeks ago, and must say that they deserve 5 stars hands down!  I am a African American who is also half asian. My hair is curly, coarse, and can very challenging to cut. I decided to try these clippers based on the reviews on Amazon and other sites, and am glad I made this choice. I recently decided to save some money but cutting my own hair.  There are not many negatives at all on this clipper.  The only downside, if you can even call it that, is that the blade when closed is not at a 0, but slightly more than that.  But, if you are looking for a zero blade, options are available regarding getting another blade, or one should purchase a edger clipper than can be adjusted to a 0 gap ( I highly recommend the Andis Styliner 2 for the neck skin fade, or the side bald fade of your haircut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, there are many excellent features!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. **Stays cool!**-Clipper can be on for many many minutes and it seems like the clippers get only slightly warm, but that is if its on for over 30 minutes or so.  These clippers stay the coolest of just about any other clipper on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Has multiple attachments.  Has all the attachments one needs. I typically use a 1\\&quot; attachment for my sides and a 2\\&quot; on top.  Other attachments are included which should fit any person&#x27;s needs.  Comes with a small brush, and some oil for lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The design, color, and style of the clippers are great!  Not too heavy and just right when cutting.  The shape of the clippers are contoured perfectly. Great black and white border for the design. They are cool and look cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Great price!  Here on Amazon I got the clippers for less than $45. Great deal considering the clippers do great cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Great company! Wahl is one of the most reputable manufacturer of clippers and have been around for many many years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Great for beginners! Since I just started cutting my hair, I have felt confident and have cut my hair nearly as great as my barber did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  Save money! I save money now that I cut my hair and these are a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  Powerful motor! 40% more powerful motor than most standard clipper motors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there are many other great clippers out on the market today, however, don&#x27;t hesitate to get these clippers today. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review.felt confident and have cut my hair nearly as great as my barber did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  Save money!

    <li> My husband is gonna love these clippers!!</li>
    <li> Really good product for every day work good quality and perfirmance. Light and easy to manage happy with this product</li>
    <li> If your haircut is simple like mine.. You are really just going to the barber for the experience... These are fabulous! Doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly and extremely precise.</li>
    <li> Excellent pair of clipper smooth cutting.very light,</li>
    <li> Very well built, probably more quality that I needed but it will last me a lifetime. It has plenty of attachments, I will likely only use two of them.</li>
    <li> This thing cuts through your hair like a knife through warm butter. No hair pulling. If you&#x27;re considering a cheaper unit, don&#x27;t. This thing is rock solid. I have used it every other week for the last 4 months and love it.</li>
    <li> Distributer took care of me. Dry well very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Noisier than I thought it would be.  Cut good though.</li>
    <li> There great but the motor that isnt supposed to get hot gets REALLY HOT!!! Good size</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the money.  Cuts through hair no problem .</li>
    <li> I was actually was excited to purchase a US made Wahl clipper after about 25 year of cutting my own hair 17 year old son #1, 4 year old son #2 and as for my one and only 11 year old daughter, well let’s say Professional stylist only. Sad to say I was disappointed, first clipper, the bottom portion of the blade came severely canted. So much so that there was almost a 1/8 inch difference from the right to the left side of the blade with no possible way to adjust to make work (I sent back for another). Second clipper, came severely out of whack and needed extensive adjustment which was also a pain but got it after sometime. Cuts buttery smooth, but very loud and runs VERY hot after on and off operation (changing clips) for 3 to 4 minutes in hair cutting time. Mine you, this is only comparing to overseas produced Wahl’s and so far don’t see is worth for the higher price other then I prefer to buy American made.</li>
    <li> I am mostly happy with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is more powerful than a previous, less expensive wahl model.&lt;br /&gt;The clips are the exact same as that model however, and do their job, but I don&#x27;t know if they are exactly barber quality.&lt;br /&gt;For household trims and fades, this is a good unit.</li>
    <li> Does the job!, works great. able to do clean fades and tapers. gets hot pretty quick tho.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I received faulty unit, it was too noisy &amp; vibrating like a farm tractor. Could not tune it to be silent and smooth. After several effort, I had to return it to Amazon for a full refund.</li>
    <li> I was originally going to buy a pair of clippers for 4x the price of these Wahl Icon&#x27;s. After a bit of thought though I decided to try these to save a little money. I am actually glad I got these instead of the much more expensive option. To test them out I shaved my head with them and you can feel the power in them. The blades are ultra sharp and leave no stray hairs sticking up anywhere. Instead of the 10 minutes it took using my old dull and much weaker clippers these Wahl&#x27;s had my entire head shaved perfectly in less than 2 minutes. I simply couldn&#x27;t be any happier.</li>
    <li> Powerful motor, but disappointing cut consistency. Need to glide it over the same area 5 or 6 times, and even then it still leaves a couple hairs. Everything about it is great except that it doesn&#x27;t edge or cut consistently at all.</li>
    <li> light weight, stays cool and doesn&#x27;t heat up. but the only thing wrong is that the blade gets dull quickly. great for home use but not professional.</li>
    <li> Powerful! what else do you look for?  A smooth vibration to the professional grade motor with a very nice plastic housing that is smooth and well executed.&lt;br /&gt;The included guides are nice (I go no guide) but lack any type of storage. Amazing bang for the buck!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Love it. For the price and quality its a no brainer. Will definitely recommend this product to anyone. Whal makes good clippers and i love it</li>
    <li> Easy to use, cuts well.  Doesn&#x27;t heat up.  It comes with a bunch of guards to suit your needs and a small container of oil.  You may want to buy additional oil to keep these clippers running smoothly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buzzing my hair for almost two decades. This is a very good quality clipper, it&#x27;s heavy and powerful. I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the Wahl 84900 Icon Clipper :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1)It is designed for use by professional hair cutters, doing many hair cuts a day.&lt;br /&gt;  1-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2)Its motor is more powerful than the most powerful Wahl clipper for home use and Norelco clipper. The clipper stays cool, does not get hot during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3)Its high precision blades cut thick hairs like a knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4)It is not as noisy as other clippers I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5)It has an adjustable taper lever to change the closeness of the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(6)Amazon&#x27;s price of $47 is much less than the $60 to $90 charged by other sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included  : 1 comb, 8 cutting guides, 1 small bottle of oil, 1 blade guard.&lt;br /&gt;Not included : carrying case, cape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning : Oil the blades after each use to prevent \\&quot;rusts\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes time to research these information.&lt;br /&gt;Please click \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; below this line if this review was helpful to you.</li>
    <li> Cuts great.  Good quality clipper.</li>
    <li> This clipper was very loud and could not be adjusted to a normal quiet running haircutting tool.</li>
    <li> I had used the Andi&#x27;s speedmaster 2 to cut my hair and my sons hair for a couple of years when the the speedmasters konked out on me.  I purchased the Icon on advice from a friend and I have been impressed.  The Icon is in the same cost ballpark as the speedmaster but has a more powerful motor for a smoother faster cut.  It&#x27;s a little bigger than I&#x27;m use to but it is not heavy at all.  The only con is that it does heat up when I&#x27;m cutting my younger son&#x27;s hair but if you&#x27;re just cutting one head you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> The clipper cut easily through thick hair.  Very powerful motor.  Long cord is helpful.  So far we couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> These clippers are something serious, I mean serious, I needed some better clippers for my hair and my sons hair I was using wahl designers but I was not completely satisfied with my son&#x27;s hair cut using them, but these icons man! Wow! These are serious, and light weight and they cut so smooth, they cut like Wolverine blades, I love them</li>
    <li> Use these clippers for my boy&#x27;s haircuts.  Work great and have no issues with them.  These replaced a set of Oster Fast feed that did not work well at all.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a adjustable clipper that was powerful as an detachable blade clipper. There isn&#x27;t and as a professional barber, this Icon clipper is more powerful than most adjustable clippers on the market. It is also lightweight.</li>
    <li> The clippers works good.  They cut pretty low.  However, if you need to do some balding on the side, or your whole head you will need some balding clippers.</li>
    <li> As a professional barber I&#x27;ve used various clippers from Andis, Oster &amp; Wahl over the years. These are one of the best set on the market in my opinion. Good weight, nice feel in the hand &amp; great power. Runs smooth, cool, quiet &amp; efficiently. Excellent choice for cutting all types of hair &amp; styles</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother who really loved it. It cuts through hair very easily and doesn&#x27;t get very hot in your hand. it doesn&#x27;t vibrate a lot either which lends to longer cuts. It feels professional and looks good. It&#x27;s not zero-gapped, though, which is a feature I&#x27;d prefer, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty good clipper.</li>
    <li> I use this clipper to cut my husband and boys hair.  This is the first one I own, and overall I love it.  It is a little heavy and does get warm after a while, but nothing major; To me, it&#x27;s just proof that it is well built and extremely powerful.  It easily cuts through thick long hair without having to go over the same area again and again.  Most importantly, they are great quality and resonably priced.  It has paid itself with the money I&#x27;ve saved from haircuts at the salon.</li>
    <li> I use these clippers to cut my hair.  Holds nice on hand than my previous pair.  The motor is so powerful it cuts through my hair like a hot knife through butter.  It makes cutting my hair a breeze and super fast.  We&#x27;ll see how long the blades will still stay sharp</li>
    <li> I just recently bought this clipper. It has an extremely powerful magnetic motor. I upgraded from the Wahl Chrome Pro, which has a really good rating as home clippers go. It&#x27;s lighter than the Senior or Legend, but has the v9000 motor which you will really enjoy using. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this clipper. I would recomend this clipper to anybody, amateur or pro.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Replaced some cheapo clippers with these. You&#x27;ll notice the difference.</li>
    <li> After extensive research, I chose to purchase this clipper and Ive been very satisfied. It cuts very well and is rather quiet compared to many others. Like all clippers, make sure to keep the blades properly lubricated. Many reviews online claim the slider feels flimsy but I disagree. While it is flexible, it shouldnt break easily unless someone blatantly misuses it aggressively. In that case, anything will be breakable. All in all, this is great for the person who performs their own haircuts at home or just touches up regularly. It definitely works well for simple fading. It also bring a great assortment of clipper add-ons, including a 1/2 and 1.5 size.</li>
    <li> Very good clipper.Smooth,very nice design and stay cold for long time.It is not as noisy as other clippers I have tried.Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of clippers over my years, all have seemed to lose performance within a few months.  None have been able to tackle my sons&#x27; thick hair, they groan and moan and vibrate.  This set, at $50.00 is a steal, and they work amazing.  They cut through my sons hair like BUTTER.  No need to run through the same patch over and over and over again.  One run and a touch up run does the job.  And they stay warm, not HOT.  Best $50.00 ever spent..</li>
    <li> I m not a professional but I am very happy with the clipper, I gets warm but not hot, I have been using it a few times already...no issues. Does cut the skin. The cord is longer than usual. The clipper is probably a little bit havier than a standard commercial clipper but it never misses a hair.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Quite heavy and the industrial power cord is not very flexible.</li>
    <li> Seems like a \\&quot;run-of-the-mill\\&quot; kind of clipper..not all it&#x27;s hyped up to be. The powerful motor makes the clipper VERY hot when its been running off and on for about 20-30 mins. Not all that helpful when you&#x27;re cutting your hair and you need to concentrate, but your hand is burning! Plastic guards from Wahls aren&#x27;t very useful..some were mis-shapen and I didn&#x27;t like the intervals between number \\&quot;3\\&quot; and \\&quot;2\\&quot; ... it makes blending difficult. If you buy this clipper, be prepared to buy your own guards separately. I think I&#x27;ll try my luck with an Oster clipper. I hear they&#x27;re better? I&#x27;ll find out..</li>
    <li> everthing went perfect!!! will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Way better than my Conair Walmart clippers. I have thick hair and these never bog down.</li>
    <li> I waited until now to provide a review because I wanted to use them a few times.  They were a great price and work fantastic.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a cheapie we had been using.  It seems very well made, with great cutting action.  Holds the plastic guards firmly and just plows through thick hair.  It has a heavy duty cord that is plenty long.  It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as warm as the old clippers did.  I witheld one star just because it seems to vibrate my hand a bit more than I&#x27;m used to, but that may be the price of more power.  Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a pair of clippers that can slide right through hair pretty easily and this is the one. so far it has functioned exactly how I wanted to it&#x27;s very precise and has very unique guards and I like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the price. Light weight and don&#x27;t run hot like the metallic versions. Powerful motor cuts like butter. If you don&#x27;t want to spend $100 get these you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Pros: Seem like quality clippers&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Pull hair a little (even when just oiled) and the half sized guides (.5 and 1.5) are garbage and pop off as soon as you put the clippers to your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get scalped because the guides fall off, these are great clippers.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a number of months now and they contune to work great.  I am a very light user, maybe once a week, but I don&#x27;t have anything to complain about</li>
    <li> Great quiet motor, but comb attachments are low quality. I need to buy an after market set. Why the poor quality warped clipper guards? Kit was billed as professional grade, why include low quality attachments? I really think after Wahl put together a well made, quiet running, powerful , professional grade clipper, that the attachments should be better than flimsy plastic. I would like to see Wahl offer a stainless steel set of attachments to fit this clipper, but they only do that for pet clippers. Why?</li>
    <li> My 2nd set of Wahl clippers - I like the clean cut.  The guards are solid and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth cuts. Stay a lot cooler than other clippers. Worth the money spent. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a tool that produces nice and sharp cuts.</li>
    <li> I really like the clippers, they are powerful and cut good and fast. Most of all they do not get hot.</li>
    <li> I love this clippers and use them all the time and i use them more then any other pair of clippers I have, I would buy from seller again</li>
    <li> Definitely a profession tool. Quiet, stays cool, powerful and good looking.  I just just it to give myself a buzzcut once every 2 weeks.  If I&#x27;m being lazy I&#x27;ll use it on my face to get a quick 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.&lt;br /&gt;Has a bunch of attachments but no carry case so get yourself a big gallon sized ziplock bag and keep it all together.  I don&#x27;t even other to go to the barber anymore, this thing pays for itself after 3 cuts. I have a weird swirl in my hair directly on the top of my head, now I don&#x27;t have to feel like im being a pain in the A$$ when I ask the barber to go over my head again a few times to get the hairs he misses when he goes too fast or simply isn&#x27;t paying attention. I love this thing 10/10 would buy again</li>
    <li> Great clippers, work smoothly through Men and woman&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> i would give this clipper a five quick strong v9000 motor is no joke.only problem is the leveler.wat i did to fix this problem was that i switched the leveler from an old wahl seniors that i had laying around.clean machine and clean cuts once u zero gap them</li>
    <li> My father has been using the same Wahl clippers for over 40 years.  I just retired my Wahl Senior (which I used for over 20 years), and bought this as its replacement.  \\&quot;The good\\&quot; is that has a very strong (almost scary-strong) motor.  Although it doesn&#x27;t come with \\&quot;zero gap\\&quot;, you can adjust the blade to make it so if desired.  It&#x27;s also nice and light in the hand.  \\&quot;The bad\\&quot; is that it&#x27;s definitely noisy and both the lever and plastic portion of the case feel depressingly cheap.  By-the-way, there are a bunch of cool/interesting YouTube videos by professional barbers that review the Wahl Icon.  Bottom line, I&#x27;m happy with this product, but they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.</li>
    <li> Loved my icon! Similar to the sterling 9.</li>
    <li> I have cut my own hair for 17 years. These are the best clippers I have had to date.</li>
    <li> Bought this to cut my son&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s an excellent clipper, feel solid and cuts very smooth. The price was very reasonable and I got it very fast.</li>
    <li> Great little machine. The only drawback is the poor quality of the large guide combs and the paucity of the sizes and shapes I need.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite wahl clipper very powerful but as being a barber I bought 3 of them  one with fade blade one with taperblade and one with wedge blade.  So now I have every kind of blade ready to go with a great clipper.</li>
    <li> I love these things. Strong, and accurate. I haven&#x27;t been able to bog them down yet.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful clippers and a vast improvement over cheaper models.</li>
    <li> Slices through hair like BUTTER. Professional Barber Clipper. Amazing clipper, come with the standard blade which is a little better for bulk than the fade blade on the wahl 5 star senior. You need both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Believe me? Check out: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re WELCOME.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because of the reviews and I must say that the unit does do a great job of cutting hair BUT and a HUGE BUT...after 1 hair cut and cleaning the hair off I put the clippers back in the box and stored away until needed. I took them out yesterday and the unit has oxidization! RUST is setting in on the blades. So not impressed. AND when I looked at the clippers the blades had shifted (crooked) and were no longer lined up! I have not done ANYTHING to the clippers but use them and clean them and store away.</li>
    <li> Daughter works at a hair place.  Bought this for her to use and she is very happy with the performance.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Let me preface, its cuts hair just fine.&lt;br /&gt;The three stars is bc I have used 3 other cheaper hair cutting machines that seemed to do just as good of a job. As for all the ranting 5 star reviews.... I have no idea what theyre talking about.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, don&#x27;t get hot, cut well. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since purchasing these and they&#x27;re already proving to be a great investment.</li>
    <li> nice powerful clippers good deal</li>
    <li> This hair cutting tool GREATLY out performs my previous set of clippers. It runs strong and is well made!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this clipper for about a year and it still works as good as new. Wahl builds a great clipper and this is it!</li>
    <li> Great clippers, we finally retired our first wahl&#x27;s clippers after 35 years of hair cuts. These work great and we look forward to another 35 yaers with Wahl.</li>
    <li> Powerfull&lt;br /&gt;Dont cut skin&lt;br /&gt;A great selection of guides&lt;br /&gt;Cuts short hair evenly and I rarly need to go over one spot more than twice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No case to put the clippers in&lt;br /&gt;Slightly slippery when they get greasy, but it doesnt bother me&lt;br /&gt;I needed one more guide number 12</li>
    <li> Wahl Icons should last you a long time I have had mine for two years now and have used them almost every day. I&#x27;ve used many Wahl clippers and can definitely tell these have a bit more power to them compared to the majority of other Wahls. Also, these blades in particular are quite sharp so you need to be careful fading without a guard. I will continue to buy Wahl clippers because I&#x27;ve only had the best experiences with their products as well as their superior customer service.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Icon clipper is great so far, which I have had about 3 months now.  As with all products, there are good &amp; bad points, so I will jump right into it instead of giving long winded or a drawn out review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-THE GOOD-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are very sturdy and are well built.  Which I have to take into account that others may be rougher on their belongings, I know it happens.  But for me, if I pay for something I take care of it.  I have my own little bag and box set to house the clippers &amp; attachments guards, which don&#x27;t come with the set in the box[which I will explain later in the bad section].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cut of the clippers is very good, although not precise professional grade.  I&#x27;m sure you can buy a more expensive set of clippers like the Oster 76 or the professional grade of Wahl clippers, but I bought these for the value and the positive reviews I seen on Amazon for the Icon clipper.  For the most part, they cut very well and even although you might have to make a few passes to ensure no stray hairs were missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor on these clippers are very powerful and seem to hold up well.  In the past I have owned clippers that had very weak motors and sounded dull.  These do not sound weak, nor do they have an abrasively loud noise but you can definitely tell when they are on by the sound and the ensuing hair that falls when you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl Icon cuts through very thick hair effortlessly and does a good job even with attachments being used.  I had a set of Oster Fast Feeds and those didn&#x27;t leave an even finish because the attachment guards were spring loaded and didn&#x27;t fit snug.  The Icon attachments fit perfectly and leave a very even finish.  You may require a few passes but they really get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-THE BAD-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment combs are not a full set: although they have rare guard sizes like 1/2 inch or 1 1/2 inch not found in other sets of Wahl clippers, it is missing guards like number 5 and 7.  This wasn&#x27;t a big issue for me since I have owned a previous Wahl set of attachments and had the missing 5 and 7 guards but to some people this might be a big deal.  I know you can purchase a set of attachment guards through amazon, although if you are looking for all of them in one clipper the Wahl Icon might not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are corded clippers and not cordless as many modern sets are.  Some will not purchase just because of this but I&#x27;d rather get a more powerful motor in my clipper and have to plug them in as opposed to buying a cordless clipper which has an inferior motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set does not have a barber&#x27;s cape, a box to use for attachments, or anything to store the clippers in which means you either keep them in the box it came in or simply use something you already have.  I have probably purchased two other Wahl clipper sets, so I had a box to store the attachments and a bag to hold the clippers in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl Icon does get extremely hot after 10-20 minutes of use and if you are like me, you have a full set of thick hair.  If you are using them to buzz all your hair off, you may not have to worry about them getting very hot.  But if you like leaving length and styling your hair then these will indeed get hot.  The handle area is the part that heats up and you may have to turn them off and let them cool before proceeding to finish, but again it&#x27;s not a big deal to me since there&#x27;s a trade off for getting such a strong motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I gave the Wahl Icon a 5 star rating because they do the job very well and seem to be built to last.and 7.  This wasn&#x27;t a big issue for me since I have owned a previous Wahl set of attachments and had the missing 5 and 7 guards but to some people this might be a big deal.

    <li> expected more but stil notl a bad purchase</li>
    <li> I have been through 2 &amp;#34;Wahl Chrome Pro&#x27;s&amp;#34; in the past year. I have also used Conairs in the past. I bought them from a large local retailer for roughly half the price of this item. The ICON is leagues better than what is offered at the store level. I&#x27;m no expert at motor or blade configurations, etc...but I do cut my head every 2 days to maintain a short stubble. This clipper along with the 1/2 guard are just perfect. The cutting experience is much smoother now. There is no pulling and I&#x27;ve noticed I can go about 20 minutes before it begins to heat up at all (the Chrome would heat up after 5 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;  I docked 1 star because the maintenance directions ask you to apply oil to the blade after every cut. I find when I do this, the oil sits there and makes the entire head assembly much dirtier than it should be as hair &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; to it. Also, the cord is heavier than I thought, and is too long for my taste. NO deal breakers here so far though. Bottom line: If you looking for the next step up, you&#x27;ll be very satisfied with this clipper.</li>
    <li> This lives up to the Wahl reputation, works as advertised.</li>
    <li> What I really like of this clipper is its precission and comfortability. It doesn&#x27;t heat that much in comparisson with other non professional models. It looks like very well constructed and cut precission is outstanding.</li>
    <li> This is my second pair wahl icon absolutely love this clipper cutz luke butter only thing i didnt like was the flimsy lever but i oderd some new ones that go to a 5 star senior and thew work great now!</li>
    <li> I am a pro  barber &amp; these Icons have all the power you need. They cut thru thick bulky hair with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;They also give a smooth, tight fade! You don&#x27;t need oven mitts either like you do with Andis Masters because these run cool.&lt;br /&gt;These are my go to clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Wahl please design a guard like the Andis Nano guard!</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers about a month ago, right away I noticed the clipper blades were crooked so I had to fix it myself.&lt;br /&gt;It pulls and tugs on my hair and it sucks.&lt;br /&gt;Worst clippers I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I highly recommend the oster powerline clippers, price difference is about $100 dollars but it is so worth the money if u cut ur hair frequently.</li>
    <li> Good  fast services excellent product</li>
    <li> These clippers are great.  Just be sure to keep them clean and oil them.  Also you can chang the settings and adjust the clippers so you can get a closer cut.  You can find videos on you tube.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, use them for work everyday</li>
    <li> Great clipper! Better then expected quality...</li>
    <li> My wife has been cutting my hair for 50 years. This is our third clipper.  The first one (perhaps a Wahl - not certain) lasted for decades. The second, a less expensive Wahl for only about 5 years -- and it was always very temperamental&lt;br /&gt; when it first started out, this one so far is working great and without any problems of the second one.</li>
    <li> Bought the Wahl icon clipper NEW from Amazon, but returned it right away. I also bought a Wahl detailer at the same time and they both came used. The wahl detailer was in worse condition as well (looked like it was dropped). I read a lot of reviews and many said they got their product used, and thought it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me but I guess I was wrong!  It disgusts me that I was sold an item and not knowing where it&#x27;s been. This seller needs to know that they can be transmitting disease/bacteria even though they probably tried to clean the blades thinking that the buyer won&#x27;t notice the difference because they won&#x27;t look close enough before they first use them. The blade on this wahl icon was also tilted when it was screwed back, not sure if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to be from the manufacturer. To make sure, I swabbed the blade with an alcohol pad and noticed small black hairs. Not only items were used, but they were missing parts. I believe it comes with 8 gaurds and they were missing. The clipper cover was full of small hairs in the corner, and I noticed that when I opened the box and knew right away it was used before I even touched the clipper. I should have listened to other people&#x27;s comments that have the same complaints. I will not be buying from Amazon any longer!</li>
    <li> These clippers are solid !!!  I had a cheap one from Walmart that lasted me 5 years.  I can only imagine that these are going to last me 15 years if I don&#x27;t drop them.</li>
    <li> I like the clipper a lot. It cuts just like my seniors. Gets a real tight fade with these clippers, and they stay cool pretty long. My only concern is that the lever on the side feels REALLY cheap.</li>
    <li> I looked at a bunch of reviews and decided to go with this one. No complaints here. I only cut my hair and my two little ones. Did them all in the same day and never had a problem with them heating up. Fading is simple with these as well and I&#x27;m not a pro.</li>
    <li> Out of all the plastic wahl models this is easy number one the v9000 is as strong as my wahl sterling reflections senior and wahl senior doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly either I was also able to zero gap these easy it comes with a super taper blade which is the same as the wahl senior grey model</li>
