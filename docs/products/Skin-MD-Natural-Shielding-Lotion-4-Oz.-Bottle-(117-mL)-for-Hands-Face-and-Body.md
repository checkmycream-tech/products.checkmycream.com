      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.</li>
      <li>What more can I say???</li>
      <li>and my skin is so smooth!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my legs and arms.</li>
      <li>Maybe because I like moisturizers to have a nice smell--that&#x27;s part of why I enjoy applying them.</li>
      <li>It seems smoother and more supple.</li>
      <li>fine lines are more noticeable.</li>
      <li>I picked this up after hearing good reviews of it and have been pleased with it so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine lotion</li>
      <li>This lotion works fine but isn&#x27;t a standout product to me.</li>
      <li>I used it for a few weeks and wasn&#x27;t really impressed.</li>
      <li>I love love love this product for my sensitive skin on my face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*I received a free sample but was not obligated to post a review on Amazon</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible product by any means and may be worth giving it a try.</li>
      <li>It is not thick, it&#x27;s a nice smooth lotion.</li>
      <li>worth the money!</li>
      <li>After about a week of using this lotion, I can notice a significant difference in my skin even before I put the lotion on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, has no offensive scent, absorbs quickly and leaves no film on your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different moisterizers and this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>My skin is very dry and this is a great moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>After hearing some good reviews, I purchased this product to be a night time facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>it absorbs quickly without being greasy and there is no smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has quickly become my lotion of choice.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using this exclusively for about five years, and we&#x27;ll stay loyal to Skin MD lotion.</li>
      <li>Seems to moisturize adequately, even in drier climates.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A couple dots work great to moisturize my face and less</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and readily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Works really well!!  </li>
      <li>Its green for the environment and its great for me.</li>
      <li>a great year round lotion.</li>
      <li>It honestly reminded me of watered down lubriderm or some cheap lotion.</li>
      <li>This lotion did what no other product has been able to do.  </li>
      <li>This lotion really does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your hands feel greasy or oily.  </li>
      <li>Tuesday night, I realized that my fingertips were no longer red, and that most of the bleeding cracks were sealed over.  </li>
      <li>Non toxic, no hormones or synthetics that are present in so many cosmetics.</li>
      <li>If I apply a serum first and layer this over</li>
      <li>This is most likely because it contains aloe vera which regenerates</li>
      <li>I am almost done with my first bottle and am re-ordering soon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I actually prefer Cerave lotion products over this, which are around the same price but more widely available.</li>
      <li>It does leave a slight sheen, so fans of the super matte finish may not be as pleased.</li>
      <li>but if you have dry sensitive facial skin, this is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Really like this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Works very well, with no burning sensation or rash from application.</li>
      <li>The formula was very watery.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>It arrived home soo fast, no problems at all.</li>
      <li>This was really a disapointment.</li>
      <li>Great for eczema, dry skin, acne prone skin, no fragrance, and you only need a tiny amount.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to others.</li>
      <li>I guess I was just expecting a little more.</li>
      <li>As of this morning (Wed.), my hands feel almost normal.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing, you only need less than a pea size to moisturize your face.</li>
      <li>For a facial moisturizer, I would say it&#x27;s better for summer or skin that isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
      <li>It makes her hands feel very soft but not tacky or oily.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t work on my dry hand so if you have dry hands and you are looking for a good lotion this isn&#x27;t it for you it might work on normal skin but not on dry skin.so would not recommend this product.</li>
      <li>first came across Skin MD last year.  </li>
      <li>It completely absorbs.</li>
      <li>When it dries, my skin feels incredibly soft and not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>It cleared up my skin, stopped the dryness on my nose and chin, and faded old scars.  </li>
      <li>I have acne-prone, sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using Skin MD Natural, I haven&#x27;t felt the need to apply lotion as frequently.  </li>
      <li>I tried the samples, but no place near me carried it and there was no way I was paying $25 for a 4 ounce bottle.  </li>
      <li>Usually my face is dry and itchy around my forehead, and oily on other areas, but this moisturizer has my skin great, not dry nor oily anymore.</li>
      <li>This lotion gets right into your skin and instantly relieves cracks and dry patches.  </li>
      <li>Instead, I tried a similar product medical types swear by - but it really didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hands are horribly dry from constant washing (jeweler and dishwasher here, so my hands really take a beating!)  </li>
      <li>I had some dry areas on my ears and this took it completely away.  </li>
      <li>It is odd how after using it for several days in a row, you can feel a real difference in your skin.</li>
      <li>I have noticed decreased fine lines in my forehead as well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different moisterizers and this one is by far the best. I can apply it under my makeup and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or make my makeup look dewey. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> After about a week of using this lotion, I can notice a significant difference in my skin even before I put the lotion on. This is most likely because it contains aloe vera which regenerates</li>
    <li> My daughter gets bad dry skin spots in a chlorinated pool. If she applies this lotion it clears up and keeps her skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> One of the best lotions on the market. Yep, it&#x27;s sort of expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. You only need a pea-sized amount and it makes your skin feel like silk. We&#x27;ve been using this exclusively for about five years, and we&#x27;ll stay loyal to Skin MD lotion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too expensive for the amount you get and still haven&#x27;t really figured out, \\&quot;what&#x27;s the point?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love this product. Non toxic, no hormones or synthetics that are present in so many cosmetics. It repairs tissue as well as shielding the skin. Easy to apply and readily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice.  I have had other products that are 60 spf that have done way less than what they say about this product, which only has 15spf.  Its green for the environment and its great for me.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve tried every lotion known to man... not really because I have bad or difficult skin (only slightly during winter months) but because I just get sucked in by advertising and possibility. Then I use it a few times and then the lotion goes under my sink to be found during spring cleaning. pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product I used for about a week and my skin is so smooth! I can&#x27;t stop touching my legs and arms. It claims to work over a period of a week or something and within a week, it was like they said it would be! I found this stuff at my pharmacy counter one day while I was waiting in a crowded prescription line... and now I get it all the time! worth the money!</li>
    <li> i bought this product last week i used it and didn&#x27;t like it at all.it doesn&#x27;t work on my dry hand so if you have dry hands and you are looking for a good lotion this isn&#x27;t it for you it might work on normal skin but not on dry skin.so would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really like this moisturizer. It is odd how after using it for several days in a row, you can feel a real difference in your skin. It seems smoother and more supple. I have noticed decreased fine lines in my forehead as well. All of this is more than I typically expect from a random moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thin and absorbs quickly. It does leave a slight sheen, so fans of the super matte finish may not be as pleased. Seems to moisturize adequately, even in drier climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has quickly become my lotion of choice. I have acne-prone, sensitive skin and it works well with my topical treatments, as well. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had major issues with dry skin on my hands for the past few years.  I spend lots of time outdoors and in a stable - and I *hate* wearing gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, my fingers are red, sore, and the skin peels.  Once winter hits, they get so inflamed and painful that it hurts to move my hands - even typing is painful. When I get up in the morning, the skin over my knuckles splits if I make a fist.  This is in spite of faithfully using Dr. recommended moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first came across Skin MD last year.  I tried the samples, but no place near me carried it and there was no way I was paying $25 for a 4 ounce bottle.  Instead, I tried a similar product medical types swear by - but it really didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the weekend, my fingertips and knuckles started splitting and bleeding again.  This past Monday (Oct 20) I visited the Skin MD site, saw that the price came down, and that there is now a local supplier.  I went out at lunch and got a bottle for 1/3 of what they were charging last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the remainder of Monday, I applied it every 2 hours.  By bedtime, my fingers weren&#x27;t quite as sore as usual.  Tuesday, I applied it after my shower and at 4 hour intervals.  Tuesday night, I realized that my fingertips were no longer red, and that most of the bleeding cracks were sealed over.  As of this morning (Wed.), my hands feel almost normal.  My fingers were not swollen or ouchy when I woke up, and I didn&#x27;t even use one of my other &#x27;miracle&#x27; lotions before bed!  I wish I took pictures so people could *see* the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll never be without a bottle of this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my family doctor for my dry skin, after local drugstore products seemed ineffective. Works very well, with no burning sensation or rash from application. Plan to keep product in my home. Highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Had to buy it in big and small bottles for home and travel. a great year round lotion.</li>
    <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin since I started using this lotion. I was expecting great things after reading the reviews. as soon as I first put it on, I felt as if it just wasn&#x27;t heavy enough for my poor abused hands. i&#x27;ve been using quite often for over a month now, i&#x27;ll continue until its gone but I think i&#x27;ll try gloves in a bottle next.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using Skin MD Natural, I haven&#x27;t felt the need to apply lotion as frequently.  Now I use it a couple times a day instead of after every handwashing! This lotion really does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your hands feel greasy or oily.  A couple dots work great to moisturize my face and less than a dime sized amount covers my hands and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4oz bottle should last 1-2, maybe 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample but was not obligated to post a review on Amazon</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry and this is a great moisturizer.  I also purchase the one with SPF.  Great fo face and body.  If you use it on your face, you can skip primer.</li>
    <li> The formula was very watery. I used it on my arms and it didnt help at all. I also tried it on my face and it made me break out. It honestly reminded me of watered down lubriderm or some cheap lotion. This was really a disapointment.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, you only need less than a pea size to moisturize your face. Usually my face is dry and itchy around my forehead, and oily on other areas, but this moisturizer has my skin great, not dry nor oily anymore.</li>
    <li> This lotion works fine but isn&#x27;t a standout product to me. I ordered it because of some recommendations from other people. I used it for a few weeks and wasn&#x27;t really impressed. It&#x27;s a fine lotion but I actually prefer Cerave lotion products over this, which are around the same price but more widely available. It&#x27;s not a terrible product by any means and may be worth giving it a try. I guess I was just expecting a little more.</li>
    <li> I heard about this lotion on a youtube beauty channel so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisturizing without feeling greasy and leaving a sticky residue on the skin.  I will definitely get the big bottle and try the one with spf!</li>
    <li> I had some dry areas on my ears and this took it completely away.  I had tried moisturizers but nothing worked.  I am not using this on my at night.</li>
    <li> To priceyfor my big family. but excellent product.</li>
    <li> Works really well!!  My hands are horribly dry from constant washing (jeweler and dishwasher here, so my hands really take a beating!)  This lotion gets right into your skin and instantly relieves cracks and dry patches.  Make sure to use on a consistent basis for best results.</li>
    <li> I picked this up after hearing good reviews of it and have been pleased with it so far. I am almost done with my first bottle and am re-ordering soon.&lt;br /&gt;It hydrates but isn&#x27;t oily, which is awesome for us combo skin folks.&lt;br /&gt;Has a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of good things about this product. It&#x27;s light, has no offensive scent, absorbs quickly and leaves no film on your skin. It really is a great moisturizer and I really like it. But for some reason, I don&#x27;t love it. I constantly forget I have it and forget to use it. Maybe because I like moisturizers to have a nice smell--that&#x27;s part of why I enjoy applying them. I like using it for hands and legs, but I didn&#x27;t like it as a facial moisturizer. It didn&#x27;t break me out, but it didn&#x27;t feel moisturizing enough.</li>
    <li> After hearing some good reviews, I purchased this product to be a night time facial moisturizer. I like that it absorbs quickly without being greasy and there is no smell. However, I have quite dry skin and this alone is not enough. If I apply a serum first and layer this over it works well enough, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to purchase it. For a facial moisturizer, I would say it&#x27;s better for summer or skin that isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product for my sensitive skin on my face. It is not thick, it&#x27;s a nice smooth lotion. if you need something thick and heavy for dry patchy spots say on less sensitive spots such as your elbow this isn&#x27;t going to be the best choice. but if you have dry sensitive facial skin, this is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. I hope they never stop making it because I have no fallback product!!!! Yes I worry about stuff like that with the economy the way it is!!!</li>
    <li> My wife likes this lotion a lot. She uses it on the back of her hands when they get dry in the winter. It makes her hands feel very soft but not tacky or oily. It&#x27;s amazing. I like to hold her hand now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Draws in moisture, not greasy, great under makeup! What more can I say??? Great freakin&#x27; stuff!!</li>
    <li> I had seen reviews of this lotion online an on YouTube. I decided to give it a try since I have dry and acne prone skin with patches of moderate to severe eczema. Acne is clearing up, eczema is less inflamed, and my skin isn&#x27;t flaky like it was. I do feel like fine lines are more noticeable. The consistency of this lotion is strange. It is much thinner than the heavy creams I was using but it&#x27;s very smooth. It almost has the texture of a makeup primer. When it dries, my skin feels incredibly soft and not greasy at all. At all. It completely absorbs. Great for eczema, dry skin, acne prone skin, no fragrance, and you only need a tiny amount. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> This lotion did what no other product has been able to do.  It cleared up my skin, stopped the dryness on my nose and chin, and faded old scars.  I love this product and I will never be without it!  I reccommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I wAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. I LIKED THAT IT WAS NOT GREASY, BUT IT DID NOT MOISTURIZE AND DID NOT WORK FOR ME.</li>
    <li> moisturizing but not great, kind of sticky, i hate it on my face because it breaks me out, i only use it on my body</li>
    <li> Feels great on skin, it even works great in the face!!! I have dry skin and it has worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is my everyday face moisturizer. It arrived home soo fast, no problems at all. I will be ordering more!</li>
