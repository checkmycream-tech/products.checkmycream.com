      <li>There are a nice variety of colors and items in this set.</li>
      <li>It seems to be a nice compact kit, ideal during travelling,also has a good combination of colors that are frequently used along with the brushes, mascara etc.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m pleased -</li>
      <li>And the brushes it comes with (The blush and lip) are okay.</li>
      <li>I love this make up kit an</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to return it for sure.</li>
      <li>Please be aware buyers!!!</li>
      <li>My daughter received this item as a gift and was very excited -</li>
      <li>I was really excited when it came, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the assortment and</li>
      <li>and it was kind of clumpy, but again, not bad.</li>
      <li>The product was shipped promptly, and arrived right on the wife&#x27;s birthday (gotta love Amazon Prime!)</li>
      <li>I got this makeup kit for my teenage daughter and she loved it!</li>
      <li>They are also verry sticky and rub off easily.</li>
      <li>However, the thing I like most about this is that it is a great backup kit if I run out of any item of my regular set.</li>
      <li>The makeup is average quality at best.</li>
      <li>But it does [even if it doesn&#x27;t have the press powder] make the set more travel worthy.     </li>
      <li>I thought that this would be the perfect little set.</li>
      <li>Its about a 5\\&quot; square product, and really quite amazing how they fit everything so compactly, yet it doesn&#x27;t at all feel cramped.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a great product.</li>
      <li>They fit a lot of make-up in this case.  </li>
      <li>The kit came with several color options and was great for someone my age.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic makeup kit, it has everything one needs for a novice makeup-artist.  </li>
      <li>but it is fantastic for traveling.</li>
      <li>A simple solution for the manufacturer would have been to place a fitted plastic sleeve over the makeup trays so makeup can&#x27;t fly about, and would probably cost them 2 cents to do so.</li>
      <li>the size is little and easy to handle very good for traveling</li>
      <li>First and the foremost, my wife liked this right out of the package.</li>
      <li>I love this so much!</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I am planning on getting one for me as well!</li>
      <li>However, if you do not like wearing bright shades of eyeshadow like greens and blues (and a yellow or two!)</li>
      <li>But, overall, this is a good product for makeup beginners and people who travel.</li>
      <li>I bought this item for my daughters sweet sixteen.</li>
      <li>Simply a great price on such an item I have paid normally around 40 bucks, this is a steal!!</li>
      <li>but if the price is still that high, you can probably find better kits for the price.</li>
      <li>First time the cheap plastic broke.  </li>
      <li>but if the price is still that high, you can probably find better kits for the price.e a great kit, and I&#x27;m thankful it arrived in tact with little issues.</li>
      <li>Easy to carry and looks very neat.</li>
      <li>in all, for the price, this seems like a great kit, and I&#x27;m thankful it arrived in tact with little issues.</li>
      <li>i think if your looking for a makeup case it is worth the money</li>
      <li>It is a fun item to have so you can play around with colors.</li>
      <li>I think it was worth the money</li>
      <li>It would probably be a nice gift for the right person, especially a teen or preteen.</li>
      <li>Its a good kit if you&#x27;re starting out with makeup and want to experiment, or if you enjoy makeup that is not \\&quot;traditional\\&quot;, but for many of us, your money is better spent on a single eyeshadow palette of your preference.  </li>
      <li>I mainly got this kit for special occasions.</li>
      <li>The item was exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I opened it and the make up is cute, but I thought this would be larger for some reason.</li>
      <li>first off, yes, it arrived on time.</li>
      <li>No, I didn&#x27;t look at the dimensions, I don&#x27;t even think they&#x27;re listed, and in many ways being small is a good thing; portability is easier with it being smaller than I thought.</li>
      <li>like I said, really take a minute to think over if you&#x27;re willing to take the risk with shipping (and look at the 1-star reviews).</li>
      <li>like I said, really take a minute to think over if you&#x27;re willing to take the risk with shipping (and look at the 1-star reviews).</li>
      <li>I thought after seeing these many complaints, BR may have taken it seriously and taken some actions to make it better, but</li>
      <li>the whole box got spilled with powdered powder cake....    </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t pick up the eye shadow very well.  </li>
      <li>The make-up kit when closed is about the size of a DVD case on top with the height of about 2 or 3 inches.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I really really like this product.</li>
      <li>It breaks really easly, dosen&#x27;t</li>
      <li>To add insult to injury, the price I paid is a fraction of its current price; at its previous price ($15) it was worth the risk and the quality was more than fair for the price, but at the moment it is currently doubled that cost, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d personally risk it.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend this for women that travel or just don&#x27;t like a bunch of makeup</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a miracle that nothing is broken or mixed, so good luck when you buy it!</li>
      <li>She was able to share with her little sister as well.</li>
      <li>Should have taken a little more care while shipping this product..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the makeup wasn&#x27;t too dark I think it was worth the money i think if your looking for a makeup case it is worth the money</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic makeup kit, it has everything one needs for a novice makeup-artist.  I know very little about makeup, so this is a great learning kit when I use it on the models.</li>
    <li> first off, yes, it arrived on time. I was really excited when it came, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the assortment and how well they work. The colors are wonderful, and the eyeshadow works wonderfully. However, it was badly packaged, and whether it had been this way before or during the shipping, upon opening the package, I noticed the chalky substance covering the wrapping.     The press powders were in complete ruin, and absolutely unusable. It took a good chunk of time cleaning it [and my shirt where the press powder had settled] out. I was very disappointed by this, and the fact that the actual case was broken [the hinges had been snapped]. Due to the other reviews, this may have been a one time thing and a chance you have to take with purchasing anything online.     Yes, the item is smaller than some may believe. But it does [even if it doesn&#x27;t have the press powder] make the set more travel worthy.     Overall, I&#x27;d say be wary when purchasing, since you may end up with a broken kit!</li>
    <li> It just arrived and let me tell you, I&#x27;m very very disappointed seeing the powder and blushes outside the pacakging :(  It is a big mess, all powders and blushes have spread over the lipsticks, eyeshadows and all over the place. I had read the reviews about poor packaging however thought I might be lucky, but I was very wrong. I thought after seeing these many complaints, BR may have taken it seriously and taken some actions to make it better, but NO!!! Amazon should not sell this product as it is worthless. How can anyone use it when it&#x27;s completely messed up???? I&#x27;m going to return it for sure. Please be aware buyers!!! and BR do something about it!!!</li>
    <li> returned ,come break to pieces</li>
    <li> I got this kit for mothers day. Mom loved it the minute she laid eyes on it. The kit is smaller than expected but it has everything well organized! The only problem was that the box cracked a little on one side but that detail is no problem in my point of view! I love this make up kit an I recommend it to every woman! I love it so much that I am planning on getting one for me as well!</li>
    <li> I got my make-up kit for me. I am a preteen and don&#x27;t wear make-up everyday. I mainly got this kit for special occasions. The kit came with several color options and was great for someone my age. I recommend it for every age though. The condition and quality of everything (except for the mascara which was a little clumpy) was far better then I expected. Everything was shipped on time and intact. But like another review mentioned, some of the blushes got powdery after I used them. Overall, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a gift to my mother. First one arrived with broken box. I returned it. While going through the reviews, I noted that few more customers had similar problem. I also noted that the merchant accepted the responsibility. Therefore I decided to give the product another try.   Second time, the product came in same shabby packaging, with colors plates broken and scattered. Obviously, I am returning it and left with no gift to present. The product itself seems to be good, but it is being sent in poor packaging. I wish I would have believed the reviews and bought something different.</li>
    <li> My daughter received this item as a gift and was very excited - she loved receiving the product and said she really likes it - however, as it was just in a letter size padded bag with no other packaging, it was completely broken when she opened it.  The plastic container was cracked and broken and all the powder make up completely shattered.  We have returned product - this is the reason we have given only 1 star.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift yto my neice.  The product and design is good but would have been more better if the packaging was handled in a better way . I got it in an envolope packing. the bottom slides broken and part of compact powderd. the varirty of eye shades lipsticks, press podwer is good. the size is little and easy to handle very good for traveling BUT what is the use if it arrived in peices and powder??</li>
    <li> The makeup kit I got came.and had great eyeshadow colors. Yet, when I opened it the whole inside including the powder cake and blush was cracked and it was a giant mess. I think maybe you should check your product before you send it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was much larger. I opened it and the make up is cute, but I thought this would be larger for some reason. The colors are great, but the make up is cheap so if that is what you need, this product is great. Just look at the dimensions so you are not surprised like me.</li>
    <li> First, let me say I&#x27;m a guy, so the actual product review itself is coming second-hand to me; in other words, I haven&#x27;t personally tested out the makeup itself. Here&#x27;s another pre-qualifier: I don&#x27;t really understand the difference between $4 mascara and $40 mascara, but I&#x27;ll do my best for the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the BR 44 Makeup Color Kit for my wife for her birthday. The product was shipped promptly, and arrived right on the wife&#x27;s birthday (gotta love Amazon Prime!) After receiving the item, here&#x27;s a few things of note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Its smaller than I thought. No, I didn&#x27;t look at the dimensions, I don&#x27;t even think they&#x27;re listed, and in many ways being small is a good thing; portability is easier with it being smaller than I thought. Its about a 5\\&quot; square product, and really quite amazing how they fit everything so compactly, yet it doesn&#x27;t at all feel cramped.&lt;br /&gt;2. The case itself is fairly well made. It is cheap plastic, and a little shard popped off on the side of a tray, probably got banged around in shipping, but the trays themselves slide very well.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has a lot of variety. I don&#x27;t know what all is expected in a kit like this, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine needing much more colors than this, especially for a portable kit.&lt;br /&gt;4. The wife says the makeup is decent quality (not amazing). Like I said, I have no way to personally vouch for this, she could just be saying that, but she did note the little flower imprints and logo imprints in the makeup, something she says is what decent makeup manufacturers do.&lt;br /&gt;5. Shipping almost killed the product. Everything arrived in-tact, but there was makeup dust all over the case/kit. A simple solution for the manufacturer would have been to place a fitted plastic sleeve over the makeup trays so makeup can&#x27;t fly about, and would probably cost them 2 cents to do so. I can imagine others getting a botched kit because shipping could be damaging the product. So, there are risks with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the price, this seems like a great kit, and I&#x27;m thankful it arrived in tact with little issues. I&#x27;d recommend, but only to those willing to take a risk with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 11/20/2011***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it looks like the manufacturer hasn&#x27;t changed their shipping method, or improved the product for shipping, so like I said, really take a minute to think over if you&#x27;re willing to take the risk with shipping (and look at the 1-star reviews). To add insult to injury, the price I paid is a fraction of its current price; at its previous price ($15) it was worth the risk and the quality was more than fair for the price, but at the moment it is currently doubled that cost, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d personally risk it. YMMV, but if the price is still that high, you can probably find better kits for the price.e a great kit, and I&#x27;m thankful it arrived in tact with little issues. I&#x27;d recommend, but only to those willing to take a risk with shipping.  ***Update 11/20/2011***  Well it looks like the manufacturer hasn&#x27;t changed their shipping method, or improved the product for shipping, so like I said, really take a minute to think over if you&#x27;re willing to take the risk with shipping (and look at the 1-star reviews).

    <li> First and the foremost, my wife liked this right out of the package. Box is very compact and has the necessary colors and tools. Easy to carry and looks very neat. Recommended.</li>
    <li> The make-up kit when closed is about the size of a DVD case on top with the height of about 2 or 3 inches.  When you open it, it folds out.  The top \\&quot;level\\&quot; are eye shadows, the second \\&quot;level\\&quot; is blush on the left and powder on the right, the bottom \\&quot;level\\&quot; has mascara, liquid eyeliner, eye pencil, lip pencil, lip gloss, brush, and lip brush.  They fit a lot of make-up in this case.  It&#x27;s wonderfully compact.    The only thing I don&#x27;t like are the eye shadow applicators.  They don&#x27;t pick up the eye shadow very well.  I prefer my eye brush instead.  Otherwise this was a great deal.</li>
    <li> I received the kit in good condition. I bought it to gift it to my sister. It seems to be a nice compact kit, ideal during travelling,also has a good combination of colors that are frequently used along with the brushes, mascara etc.I am yet to gift it to my sister, so not sure of quality of the product yet.apparently it seems to be good. I received the kit in a good condition.</li>
    <li> Hola, siempre quise tener un Kit de maquillaje , pero nunca imagine que fuera tan poco practico....  Es muy grande para mi gusto.  Aunque tiene todo lo necesario... Lo recomiendo para estilistas profesionales del maquillaje, es decir para las personas que trabajan en esa área. Para el maquillaje diario seria mejor comprar uno mas pequeño.</li>
    <li> As another buyer wrote, I&#x27;m also a guy who bought this for my wife... I don&#x27;t know anything about the quality of the products, for me it&#x27;s normal, but I write this focus on the package.     The product came in an envelope, inside has tiny air pockets. It&#x27;s a miracle that nothing is broken or mixed, so good luck when you buy it! In the product packaging feedback I said this too...</li>
    <li> This kit provides a great deal of variety for a very reasonable price. However, if you do not like wearing bright shades of eyeshadow like greens and blues (and a yellow or two!), the variety is actually a downside. It&#x27;s almost as  the kit tries to appeal to too many tastes and preferences that it ends up falling short for a single individual. For example, I am fair skinned so most of the blushes and many of the eyeshadows are unusable for me. Its a good kit if you&#x27;re starting out with makeup and want to experiment, or if you enjoy makeup that is not \\&quot;traditional\\&quot;, but for many of us, your money is better spent on a single eyeshadow palette of your preference.  Other Notes: The makeup is average quality at best. The size of the box is smaller than a mouse pad.</li>
    <li> I got this makeup kit for my teenage daughter and she loved it! It was a little smaller than expected though. It is about 5\\&quot; 5\\&quot; and the hight is about 2\\&quot;. It arrivied in great shape and looks exactly like in the photo. I would reccomend this to teens or adults.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my daughters sweet sixteen. It arrived in an envelope, and I could hear all the peices moving around before I even opened it. All of the pressed powder makeup was destroyed into fine powder and was all over the place and the case was broken so that the trays were no longer attached. She really wanted this, but we will have to go someplace local and look for a repalcement.</li>
    <li> The kit is OK for the price.Eye shades,blush and compact powders are good but the pencil eye liner and pencil lip liner are not creamy at all.They cannot be applied.Liquid Eye Liner is good.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Grandbaby loves it. Would defiantly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this so much! Its great to just have but it is fantastic for traveling. I travel a lot and i just brought this along with me and it prefect for on the go! I highly recommend this for women that travel or just don&#x27;t like a bunch of makeup spread-ed all over their sink! Simply a great price on such an item I have paid normally around 40 bucks, this is a steal!!</li>
    <li> I opened up the Beauty Revolution Make Up Kit with runaway colors and got covered with powder. I would like one in one piece please.</li>
    <li> The poor packaging resulted in 2 of the blushes to be broken, rendering the blush unuseable and blush dust on the whole set.  Amazon somehow does not recognize that I purchased the item through their system, so I am unable to obtain a RMA for a refund.  Sadly, I had given the whole purchase as a gift and when the recipient opened it, was disheartened that 1/2 (and the most important element) of the gift was unuseable.  Sad.</li>
    <li> Make-up arrived intact.  It is intended for my 14 year old daughter to learn to apply make-up and it&#x27;s just about perfect for that purpose.  I&#x27;m pleased - I got what I expected and paid for.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly what I needed. I am very satisfied. No problems to receive the item as well. Very good for travel purposes</li>
    <li> all busted up when I opened it, I couldn&#x27;t use any of it.</li>
    <li> This shipped very quickly and arrived with a hard plastic over the makeup, totally intact. There are a nice variety of colors and items in this set. It would probably be a nice gift for the right person, especially a teen or preteen. It is a fun item to have so you can play around with colors. However, the thing I like most about this is that it is a great backup kit if I run out of any item of my regular set. If my lipstick uses up, or my blush breaks, I have another option. Also good to keep at work for touchups.</li>
    <li> This came broken in the mail and the set had 2 blushes missing and the mascara was poen when I opened the box all I&#x27;m trying to say is don&#x27;t waste your money on this and go get a coastal scents palette instead.</li>
    <li> I gifted this for my friend. this kit includes various colours and all required shades. I like it! and I hope she enjoys it.</li>
    <li> I look so classy and sassy.... They thought I was beyonce twin sister... Great look. I even got a job at a bank .. It prob wasnt because of the make up but I do make this makeup look good. :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter for dress up....opened up the package which had no protection at all,t he powdered blush was decimated to dust.  Guess you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;ll still give it to her for play, but not as a gift.  And it&#x27;s a hassle to send this low price item back :(</li>
    <li> Not sure whether it is a shipping defect or product quality defect , got disappointed a lot.....the whole box got spilled with powdered powder cake....    Should have taken a little more care while shipping this product..</li>
    <li> I really really like this product. I&#x27;m just starting out with makeup, so I thought that this would be the perfect little set. It took a few days to come in, (But i didnt get one day shipping or anything) and when it did, there were so powder loose in the case. They just shook off tho. I usually use only 5-6 of the eyeshadow colors, and i only use one blush and 1 powder. I dont really like the lip gloss colors, and there a little to matte for me. They are also verry sticky and rub off easily. The liquid eyeliner is good, perfect for a beginer, and I&#x27;ve only used the mascara onece (I&#x27;m addicted to the Maybelline \\&quot;The collasal volumn&#x27; express!!!) and it was kind of clumpy, but again, not bad. But the pencil eyeliner SUCKS!!!! I hate it so much! It breaks really easly, dosen&#x27;t fin in my sharpener, and you have to press really hard just to get the faintest line. I did like the lip pencil though, untill it broke and the case didn&#x27;t come with a sharpner. (I didnt have one at that time.) And the brushes it comes with (The blush and lip) are okay. The blush brush sucks at picking up the blush and powder and it all comes off so easilly, and the lip brush is really stiff. I had to soak it in water when I got the set. But, overall, this is a good product for makeup beginners and people who travel. Good buy for the price. :)</li>
    <li> I needed to get this as a gift.  I ordered it twice and both times the items came damaged.  The item is poorly packaged and definitely needs more bubble wrap.     First time the cheap plastic broke.  Second time the makeup itself was dry and spread all over the place.  I learned my lesson and will go with something else.  If the item would have arrived intact, it is a very nice kit.</li>
    <li> a lot of make up for a good price very nice</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to receiving this product and when I got it in the mail today I found crushed makeup all over the place. The colors pictured are not the colors I actually received. Not too happy with this product.</li>
    <li> the order came fast, but when i opened it all of the blushes and foundations were broken all over the place, so the only thing i can still use is the eye shadow and lip gloss. it is a perfect size though so it would have been convenient.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my niece for Christmas. She was really happy with all the choices. She was able to share with her little sister as well.</li>
