      <li>They also provide a nice sturdy travel case that fits the brush nicely, but not the charger.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regarding Oral-B&#x27;s electronic toothbrush (which I own)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 weeks, and it does an excellent job with cleaning, even better than my older Oral-B.  </li>
      <li>That is to say, they are all incredible at cleaning your teeth and if you&#x27;ve never used one, you are in for a real treat.  </li>
      <li>The box says “optimized for stain removal”, I will have to use this more, but I get good results just in the “Clean” mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Having once had gum surgery, that is a very important aspect of the Sonicare.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does an excellent job cleaning your teeth and makes a sound when it is time to move to a new section of your teeth.</li>
      <li>The box states that it removes 100% more stains and up to 2 shades whiter in 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I guess unless you are going away for more than three weeks you can leave the charger at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>By this time, 2005, Braun had updated their product line to better compete with Sonicare.  </li>
      <li>This brush solved all those problems and more.  </li>
      <li>This one has more features.  </li>
      <li>I truly love it so far.&lt;br</li>
      <li>– I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess unless you are going away for more than three weeks you can leave the charger at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>how do I love thee?</li>
      <li>Many dental professionals of the time recommended the product to their patients, with some even selling them from their practice.  </li>
      <li>I wish Philips did a better job explaining this mode.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using it the first time, I noticed that my teeth were remarkably smoother than brushing with a manual brush.</li>
      <li>This one has more features.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not dentally gifted and you&#x27;re subjected to dental work - what have you got to lose by using a better toothbrush</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is fast and easy and does a great job.  </li>
      <li>There are many models now available and just as many price points.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a circa 2010 Oral-B Rechargeable toothbrush with good results (so says my dentist), but it&#x27;s really showing its age, so I was happy to have an opportunity to try out this new Philips HealthyWhite</li>
      <li>You just thought your teeth were clean!</li>
      <li>I love it because I love how clean my teeth feel when I leave.  </li>
      <li>The vibrations of the unit, calculated at over 31,000 brush strokes per minute by the manufacturer, make my teeth and, more importantly, my gums feel cleaner and healthier.  </li>
      <li>The angle of the brush head works better for me than the original did.  </li>

      <li>The unit still accepts a recharge, but replacement heads are no longer easy to find.  </li>
      <li>I can customize how strong I want the power.</li>
      <li>The design was very effective and many professionals endorsed its claim to even help prevent gum disease when used properly.  </li>
      <li>Any preventative investment for dental care is almost always worth it - any dental work required will require more $$ and more time (not to mention good old fashion pain &amp; suffering)</li>

      <li>The battery light indicates how well charged the unit is.</li>
      <li>One can also set an intensity level for both the cleaning and whitening mode, with three intensity levels available for each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brush&#x27;s body is slimmer and more comfortable to hold, and the case is useful and easy to clean.</li>

      <li>When I felt the surface of my teeth with my tongue it was as if a Zamboni went over them, it was that smooth.</li>
      <li>for me, I use the Sonic too - my dentist is a great guy and is a great source for local fishing tips but the less I see of him and his drill the better.  </li>
      <li>Obviously that&#x27;s better, but honestly, going two weeks is fine.  </li>

      <li>It takes about 2 minutes to completely clean your teeth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice, but I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth twice</li>
      <li>Indeed, I have noticed my own teeth appear whiter and more polished since I began regular use of the Sonicare.  </li>

      <li>And a word of advice, be careful when opening your mouth with it in there...especially on the high settings, unless you want your best rendition of a toothpaste Jackson Pollack painting on your mirror.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a Sonicare brush, quadpacer is basically a timer that encourages the user to brush for a full two minutes, with a signal every 30 seconds that it&#x27;s time to move from one area of the mouth to another.  </li>

      <li>The factory presets the toothbrush to stay on for a full two minutes before it turns itself off.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I’ve always viewed electric toothbrushes with a fairly jaundiced eye because it didn’t seem as if they could be much of an improvement over normal brushing.  </li>
      <li>Ever since I became pregnant, my gums have been more sensitive, so the option to use a lighter setting to avoid bleeding or further irritation is a great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I immediately noticed with this new brush that the buzz is almost gone - and if you look at the photo I&#x27;ve attached you can see that the brush head sits significantly closer to the top of the handle than on the Series 2.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I drink four cups of tea each day and use two tea bags per cup.  If you’ve seen what tea can do to the inside of a white china cup, then you can begin to picture how discolored my teeth are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve always viewed electric toothbrushes with a fairly jaundiced eye because it didn’t seem as if they could be much of an improvement over normal brushing.  Different in degree, but not in kind.  But after just ten days with the Phillips Sonicare, I can see I was very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of factors compelled me to try this.  I’ve never liked a soft toothbrush because they don’t seem to get my teeth clean.  I use a medium firm brush but still tend to brush overly hard which has caused some gum recession over the years.  Plus, the head size of a normal toothbrush makes it seemingly impossible to get the backside of my front teeth properly clean.  This brush solved all those problems and more.  The head is small enough that it fit neatly behind my front teeth and covered every area of my mouth handily.  It was firm enough and the brush action was so vigorous that my teeth felt as clean as they do after my semi-annual cleaning at the dentist’s office.  Almost too vigorous, in fact.  My advice to anyone using this – stand well back from the bathroom mirror if you don’t want a spray of foam all over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the whitening aspect, while I can’t say my teeth look any whiter, they’re definitely much less dingy.  Perhaps I’m splitting semantical hairs here because less dingy is probably synonymous with whiter.  They’re definitely way cleaner than before.  I don’t think I’ll ever go back to using a manual toothbrush again.  Good thing it comes with a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A first rate product.</li>
    <li> This is my first introduction to the new electric toothbrushes.  These have come a long way!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it is very quiet.  And the base that it fits in to charge is amazing.  There is no metal connection, which is odd.  But when you set it on the base, the little charge light goes on.  You have options for regular cleaning or whitening.  Different speeds and pressure.  I&#x27;ve just been using the cleaning program.  The cleaning program starts you off with a lower setting of vibration.  Then as you continue using it, it increases to the 2nd highest mark.  I would imagine it would then reach the third and highest mode of cleaning.  This is to get your gums and teeth used to the motion.  I really like this unit.  I&#x27;m looking forward to the other different type of heads.</li>
    <li> Having used dental tape and regular tooth brushes to clean and brush my teeth all my life, I was curious to try out the Philips Sonicare 5 Series Sonic Toothbrush. This toothbrush comes complete with a durable travel case, a battery charger, a three speed brush head that has diamond shaped bristles that gently reach between the teeth to clean away stains and plaque without damaging the gums. The operation of this toothbrush is controlled by two simple buttons on the toothbrush handle. After using this toothbrush for only a week, my teeth are definitely whiter and I feel like I have a much cleaner mouth. I am quite pleased with this new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Three strength settings: Low, medium and high. There are also settings for cleaning and whitening. This is a light toothbrush, but powerful. It does a very good job cleaning.  Teeth were whiter in five days as advertised. It stays charged for two days of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a circa 2010 Oral-B Rechargeable toothbrush with good results (so says my dentist), but it&#x27;s really showing its age, so I was happy to have an opportunity to try out this new Philips HealthyWhite Plus model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!  A lot has changed in 5 years in toothbrush technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks like your basic electric/rechargeable toothbrush, but appearances can be deceiving.  There are 2 &amp;#34;modes&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;white,&amp;#34; each of which has 3 intensity settings.  There are two &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; settings -- the &amp;#34;Smartimer&amp;#34; tells you when you&#x27;ve been brushing for 2 full minutes, and the &amp;#34;Quadtimer&amp;#34; which signals every 30 seconds so you can change &amp;#34;quadrants (my old Oral-B has this, too, and it does come in handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The footprint is very small, so it doesn&#x27;t occupy a lot of valuable bathroom counter real estate, and it comes with a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does it perform?  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 weeks, and it does an excellent job with cleaning, even better than my older Oral-B.  I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; mode a few times, and I do notice a slight brightening.  The whitening results might be a little more dramatic if I used the whitening mode more consistently.  But I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with only 1 brush head, so you might want to consider investing in a couple of replacement/extra heads.  Philips recommends replacing the brush head every 3 months.  You can find &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush heads that will fit, or go for the Philips DiamondClean &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; brush heads.  Lots of options, but obviously the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush heads are less expensive but probably won&#x27;t perform as well as the DiamondClean heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with how this performs.  I like that it takes up so little space (less than 1/4 the space of my Oral-B) and the performance is really excellent.</li>
    <li> Any preventative investment for dental care is almost always worth it - any dental work required will require more $$ and more time (not to mention good old fashion pain &amp; suffering) - multiply that by Total Cost of Ownership over your life for tuneups, replacements, emergencies for cracked fillings, etc, etc, etc.  So at current price of $105 this SonicCare HealthyWhite+ is well worth it in my book - just for the fact that it gets my 9 year old daughter brushing her teeth more.  She tries her best but her penchant for secret late night (notso)Jolly Rancher candies (as evidenced by crumpled wrappers under her bed) has resulted in some unfortunate dental work for her (and hundreds of $$ out of pocket for Dad even after dental insurance coverage).  Besides the fact that sonic toothbrushes are clinically proven (if what I read is accurate) to do a better job than the old fashioned elbow grease toothbrushes - the timers are also useful for my daughter (who tends to rush) - total timer alert after 2 minutes, 30 second &amp;#34;quad&amp;#34; timer to alert change location in mouth...these timers really help my daughter brush better and hopefully that will show in her future dental checkups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I use the Sonic too - my dentist is a great guy and is a great source for local fishing tips but the less I see of him and his drill the better.  You may be thinking &amp;#34;gross, this weirdo man is sharing a toothbrush with his daughter&amp;#34; - well I&#x27;ll have you know that I use the adult diamonhead brush and I bought her a separate kidshead brush which also fits onto the same base - so shame on you for ass-uming.  The actual soniccare unit is great - lighter than my old one, easy to operate, battery life better than ever - several weeks.  This model comes with nice travel case.  This toothbrush has multiple modes but from what I&#x27;ve read &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; mode is the most effective mode you should be using (which also means a soniccare model next pricepoint down would be fineas well if it still has quadtimer feature).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a no brainer.  If you&#x27;re not dentally gifted and you&#x27;re subjected to dental work - what have you got to lose by using a better toothbrush (sidenote - your manual toothbrush was in use before man invented flight).  I&#x27;m amazed by the range of model #&#x27;s in the Sonic lineup - really for me the key features to have are &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; mode and &amp;#34;quadtimer&amp;#34; which I&#x27;ve noticed are features offered (as of now) on next model down with lower pricepoint.  Still - whatever the model# - a very worthwhile investment if it helps reduce your dental work.  5-STAR rating from me in consideration of price/value.</li>
    <li> This is my first Sonicare Rechargeable Toothbrush and I&#x27;m really impressed.  Still 6 weeks until my next checkup before I can get a professional opinion but I can tell a difference in how my teeth feel right after brushing.  My teeth feel just from the dentist clean after each use.  Just wish it had a stand other than the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to add that the head seems smaller than other Sonicare toothbrushes which I like since I have a smaller mouth.</li>
    <li> This set comes with one brush head, and is suggested to be replaced every three months.&lt;br /&gt;The handy travel cap is perfect to use continually for a dust cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll get my one &#x27;con&#x27; out of the way. Others may not care, which is why I still gave 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;But this brush is 2 1/2&amp;#34; longer than manual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom end is the usual weight of electric brushes, but the length makes it feel more cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Two categories of cleaning &#x3D; &#x27;clean&#x27; &amp; &#x27;white&#x27;, both have three speeds.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, at a glance no brainer functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush does a very good job cleaning, it moves up/down on teeth with a good bit of vibration &#x3D; therefore&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; For those who may need to get use to the more aggressive brushing versa manual brushes&lt;br /&gt;this Sonicare has an  &#x27;easy start&#x27; feature which increases power over the first 14 brushing (of at least one minute).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; To activate &#x3D; sit brush in charger &#x3D; press &amp; hold on/off button 2 seconds &#x3D; till two beeps &#x3D; battery indicator&lt;br /&gt;lights up green indicating feature is activated.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; To deactivate &#x3D; sit brush in charger &#x3D; press &amp; hold on/off button 2 seconds &#x3D; till one beep &#x3D; battery indicator&lt;br /&gt;lights up yellow indicating feature is deactivated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also activate OR deactivate&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; &#x27;Smartimer&#x27; for proper length of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; &#x27;Quadpacer&#x27; to signal  proper length of time for each  of the four sections of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Charger conformation &#x3D; to signal brush is on charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the small size charger footprint, only 1 1/2&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34; so takes up very little space by the sink&lt;br /&gt;and the 4ft cord is plenty to reach an outlet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things to remember about the battery.&lt;br /&gt;1. Solid green &#x3D; full charge&lt;br /&gt;2. Flashing green &#x3D; moderate charge left&lt;br /&gt;3. Flashing yellow &#x3D; low charge&lt;br /&gt;4. 5 beeps &amp; battery indicator flashes yellow &#x3D; must recharge, it turns off when completely empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes nice storage/travel case.&lt;br /&gt;Warranty &#x3D; 2 years/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes nice storage/travel case.&lt;br /&gt;Warranty &#x3D; 2 years</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare.  I bought an earlier generation Sonicare back in 2000.  At that time, they were the new brand on the block.  Their claim to fame was the high speed, twisting motion of the brush head.  The design was very effective and many professionals endorsed its claim to even help prevent gum disease when used properly.  Many dental professionals of the time recommended the product to their patients, with some even selling them from their practice.  The only drawback was the purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company became &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare&amp;#34; a few years later.  The product today work on the same principle as the original model.  The brush head has a small amount of travel, but it does so at a very fast speed.  Instead of a circular rotation of the handle perpendicular to the handle, the Sonicare moves the brush head moves from side to side, perpendicular to the handle.  The Sonicare product line has grown.  There are many models now available and just as many price points.  You can now find many models for much less than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my early generation Sonicare for about  five years.  The replacement brush heads were quite expensive.  At one point, I must have ended up with a defective replacement brush head.  By this time, 2005, Braun had updated their product line to better compete with Sonicare.  I decided to try one of Braun&#x27;s medium-priced model.  The replacement brush heads were cheaper and easier to find at places like Wal-Mart.  Generic replacements were also readily available.  I switched to Braun and found them to clean teeth just as well.  I have had several Braun models since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have the original Sonicare and it still works after ten years of storage.  The unit still accepts a recharge, but replacement heads are no longer easy to find.  The fifteen-year-old unit can be put back in service with a simple brush head replacement.  An opportunity came along through Amazon to get a new Sonicare.  So, here we are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new model has a different design than the original.  The original was basically sealed and it only had one control; a sealed button.  This one has more features.  It is also lighter and the brush head design is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this new power brush.  While it does not have the heavy duty feel of the original unit, the newer brush head works even better.  The angle of the brush head works better for me than the original did.  The charging base is much smaller and it no longer encases the bottom of the handle in order to charge.  It also comes with a plastic travel case.  This model still works on the same principle as the original; side to side movement and high speed.  The unit is well-built and if it follows the same standards of quality as the original, it should deliver many years of service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me admit to you that I have not gone shopping for replacement brush heads.  I do not know their cost.  My assumption is that they will be priced competitively with the ones for the competing products from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  This is another excellent product from Sonicare.o, here we are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new model has a different design than the original.

    <li> You just thought your teeth were clean! This toothbrush has been amazing. It does an excellent job cleaning your teeth and makes a sound when it is time to move to a new section of your teeth. It takes about 2 minutes to completely clean your teeth. After one use my teeth were noticeably whiter and felt like a post-dentist visit. My only disclaimer is that it takes a bit to get use to the vibrations. I used several different brands and the vibrations on this toothbrush are a little more intense. It is well worth the clean to get past the initial sensation though. I HIGHLY reccomend this toothbrush and we have even gone on to order one for my oldest son and my husband.</li>
    <li> I am going to write two reviews the first review will be comparing this toothbrush to a manual toothbrush in the second review will be comparing this toothbrush to Oral-B&#x27;s electronic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a conventional toothbrush this toothbrush will clean your gums, between teeth, and clean the surface of your teeth much better. When you first start using this toothbrush it is not uncommon to have a tingling sensation. Rubbing your tongue over your teeth hours after brushing them you should notice a significant smoothness. I still do use a manual toothbrush if I want to brush my teeth for 20 seconds just to get some food debris out of them. You also need to consider when purchasing this toothbrush that the replacement heads are not inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding Oral-B&#x27;s electronic toothbrush (which I own) there is not a clear-cut winner but I favor Phillips. Both toothbrushes clean my teeth very well but I feel Phillips might have the edge when it comes to cleaning my gums. There is a tingling sensation when you first start using the Phillips that takes getting used to. Your gums should adjust after two or three bushing&#x27;s. Phillips feels like it&#x27;s improved its brushing efficiency over its older models. When it comes to diamond care the only difference I see that is noticeable is one model comes with a ultraviolet head cleaning case which is beneficial. That leads me to one of my main reasons I like the Phillips over Oral-B, the Oral-B head collects toothpaste and saliva even after rinsing sometimes. The bacteria in the head will smell and occasionally it will slowly drip out onto the counter after it&#x27;s been sitting on its charger.</li>
    <li> This rechargeable battery powered toothbrush offers a refined way to brush your teeth. The brush head is small and easy to maneuver and it does a more precise job of brushing than manual brushing can do. This comes with a charging base and a carry case and it really performs well. You do have to adjust to using an electric brush and learn how much time to spend in any spot. You&#x27;ll want to be careful to not overbrush, especially if you have sensitive teeth and gums. It appears that the quality of electric brushes has evolved, so if you haven&#x27;t tried one before or if you were a bit disappointed by one in the past, now may be the time to give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I’m one of a rare breed that LOVES going to the dentist.  I love it because I love how clean my teeth feel when I leave.  This toothbrush gives me that same feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three different speeds… for the cleaning and whitening settings.  I have not made it past the first speed.  The other two speeds rattle my brain too much and aren’t comfortable at all for me.  I do not feel like I am being short changed in the cleaning department because the brush isn’t at full speed.  I think it does a fine job – I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how easy the head comes off the handle – my medicine cabinet shelves are too short for it to be all put together and be able to stand up.  So I just pull it apart before I put it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had this for a couple of weeks so I haven’t really utilized the whitening portion of it so I can’t speak to its powers on that – only it’s amazing cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of this brush and plan on purchasing one for my each member of my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherise Everhard, August 2015</li>
    <li> My husband has been trying to convert me to the benefits of an electric toothbrush, so I was happy to take this opportunity to see how I liked this model. It turns out that my initial reluctance was confirmed -- I&#x27;m just cut out to use them.  There is a feature on this toothbrush that is supposed to ease new users into the transition, but I so disliked the buzzing sensation that I had no motivation to give it a try, especially given that some of the crowns in my mouth are almost 30 years old. Although the instructions are clear that the toothbrush is safe to use for my dental work, I decided I&#x27;d be happier with a regular toothbrush and some dental floss,  all things considered  My teeth did feel extremely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story has a happy ending.  I passed it along to my husband, and he is really likes this toothbrush. His old brush was another Philips that he&#x27;s had for five years. This brush has a smaller head and the size and angle make it easier to clean the teeth. The choice of three speeds makes it possible for it to be gentler than his older model (I am so whimpy I shudder to think  of the higher speeds -- I was testing it on the lowest setting). He didn&#x27;t find the Quadpacer signal to be particularly helpful, but I can see where it would be quite useful to help kids develop better habits. The brush&#x27;s body is slimmer and more comfortable to hold, and the case is useful and easy to clean. it takes up very little counterspace,, which I count as a very good thing.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Sonicare toothbrush nearly 20 years ago.  Surprisingly, this model works about the same as the first one I bought.  The main differences are that it has a &amp;#34;whitening mode,&amp;#34; but it seems like the only distinguishing factor is that that mode is 30 seconds more brush time.  One can also set an intensity level for both the cleaning and whitening mode, with three intensity levels available for each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the same?  The &amp;#34;quadpacer&amp;#34; is still here.  If you&#x27;ve never used a Sonicare brush, quadpacer is basically a timer that encourages the user to brush for a full two minutes, with a signal every 30 seconds that it&#x27;s time to move from one area of the mouth to another.  If you&#x27;re like me, it will seem like brushing for a full two minutes is a long time, but that definitely results in cleaner teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue I always have with Sonicare if I haven&#x27;t used one for a while is that certain areas of my gums tickle a little bit when I use it, particularly the roof of my mouth.  When I continue to use Sonicare, however, I get used to the sensation of the brush head&#x27;s quick movement in my mouth and this no longer bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any whitening of my teeth using this product, but I&#x27;ve never noticed any whitening using any other product, either.  I&#x27;ve tried whitening toothpastes, white strips, and at-home bleaching trays.  I think I just have teeth that are slightly yellow due to previous antibiotic use, and I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t help that I&#x27;ve been a daily coffee drinker for more years than I can remember.  I still think this is a good brush, however, since it does a very good job at cleaning my teeth.  I just thought I would point out that one shouldn&#x27;t necessarily expect dramatic whitening of one&#x27;s teeth, regardless of what the manufacturer claims.</li>
    <li> For me, the &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite Plus Rechargeable Toothbrush&amp;#34; is a definite winner.  Many years ago, I tried an electric toothbrush but quickly discontinued it due to its cumbersome size, noise, and inadequate cleaning.  I returned to using a manual toothbrush until I received this Philips Sonicare.  I truly love it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is slim, lightweight, and easy to maneuver in one&#x27;s mouth--all the facets that were a concern to me in my previous attempt to usse an electric toothbrush.  The vibrations of the unit, calculated at over 31,000 brush strokes per minute by the manufacturer, make my teeth and, more importantly, my gums feel cleaner and healthier.  Having once had gum surgery, that is a very important aspect of the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims that it removes up to 100% more stains and that it removes 7 times more plaque than a standard toothbrush.  It has a clean and a white mode ostensibly for different purposes.  The clean mode is for a normal brushing and cleaning for the recommended 2 minute use (timer included), and the white mode is designed for teeth whitening with product claims that of two shades whiter in one week.  Indeed, I have noticed my own teeth appear whiter and more polished since I began regular use of the Sonicare.  Similarly, the unit comes with a &amp;#34;DiamondClean Brush Head&amp;#34; that is designed to wipe away stains and plaque; however,even though I find it effective, it should not be used exclusively-especially if you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with a charger for the lithium ion battery and claims a 3 week usage on one charge.  A two color battery charge indicator visually cues users into recharging.  It also boasts of 3 intensity settings for the unit to meet cleaning and comfort demands of individual users but I have not tried them mush as I enjoy and am satisfied with the standard setting.  I periodically will employ a manual brush just as a change of pace and as a monitoring of the effectiveness of the electric unit--but I am totally committed to the &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare&amp;#34; for my cleaning and whitening needs at present.</li>
    <li> According to specs, all Sonicare toothbrushes are essentially the same - they all vibrate at the same speed (31,000 strokes per minute) and can all use the wide range of available brush heads (except for the older Essence line).  That is to say, they are all incredible at cleaning your teeth and if you&#x27;ve never used one, you are in for a real treat.  The difference between models is sometimes negligible, and often more than a little vague - all the bells and whistles are of dubious value.  Often, the simpler the toothbrush is, the better it is - there&#x27;s less buttons to break and less to pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In practice however, there are some features that may be worth paying for, but it really depends on your needs and the openness of your pocketbook.  I have been through several Sonicare brushes, and the model I was using prior to this one is the 2 Series, pretty much the barest-bone model there is.  I really like it, but I prefer this new HealthyWhite Plus (AKA Series 5) - not because of the buttons or features, but because I think it is actually built better.  Moving to the Series 2 from the model I had before, I had noticed (as had many other people) that the brush had a loud rattle (or buzzing) when it wasn&#x27;t in your mouth.  It was a little distracting, but I honestly thought it had to do more with the brush head than the handle.  However, I immediately noticed with this new brush that the buzz is almost gone - and if you look at the photo I&#x27;ve attached you can see that the brush head sits significantly closer to the top of the handle than on the Series 2.  I tried them both with a variety of brush heads, and always got the same result: the new model is much quieter.  It&#x27;s nice, but I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has a few superior features as well. It has a &amp;#34;Quad-pacer&amp;#34; which alerts you every 30 seconds to change to another area of your mouth.  All the brushes have a 2-minute timer, and you can definitely do without the 30-second alerts, but it is nice just to note the passing time.  It also uses a Lithium battery instead of the NiMH battery, which gives it three weeks between charges instead of two.  Obviously that&#x27;s better, but honestly, going two weeks is fine.  This model also has three power levels and a whitening mode.  Whitening is really just an extra 15-seconds of brushing that get tacked onto the end of the 2 minutes, and unless you have sensitive gums, you will probably never use the lower power settings. Philips touts this as &amp;#34;6 different modes&amp;#34; which is a really just the math of 3 power levels x 2 cleaning modes, and it&#x27;s really nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the new Diamond Clean brush head that is included with this set - but you can put any head on you like.  The charger and travel case are the standard-issue Sonicare accessories and will also work with most other Sonicare brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, it&#x27;s the better build that has locked this in as my daily toothbrush, but if I had to pay (I was provided both these brushes free for review purposes) I don&#x27;t know if I wouldn&#x27;t rather pay $30-$50 for the more basic model.thout the 30-second alerts, but it is nice just to note the passing time.

    <li> I’ve never had an electric toothbrush before and I’m impressed.  I didn’t know if I would like it or not and how awkward it would be to brush my teeth this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fast and easy and does a great job.  My teeth feel very clean and are white despite the amount of coffee I drink.  The factory presets the toothbrush to stay on for a full two minutes before it turns itself off.  This is the recommended time by dentists.  I’ve always brushed my teeth for a while, but never quite this long.  I like the fact it keeps track for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions also say to split your mouth in quadrants for brushing,  I’ve never heard the prompting sound to move to another section of my mouth because I’m partially deaf, but it still works just fine and I’ve never run out of time before I’ve brushed my whole mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking care of your teeth is so important and now it’s easier than ever.  I can say so many good things about this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself looks great.  It’s sleek, compact and white.&lt;br /&gt;It has three speed settings for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;It has the built-in timer.&lt;br /&gt;There’s a clean function and a white and polish function.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice case so you can take it when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;It’s very quiet while running.  You won’t disturb anyone else using it.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is small and the unit is lightweight but well made.&lt;br /&gt;It has a two-year warranty with an extra-added six months if you register it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m awed with how good this works and can’t imagine using my regular, manual toothbrush again.  I leave the unit plugged in all the time so it’s ready to go, but the manufacturer says a charge will last up to three weeks.  I’ve never tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Phillips Sonicare- how do I love thee? Let me count the ways...&lt;br /&gt;1.  Cleans well---I like the feeling of spotless teeth, like the feeling after you&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a good cleaning.  This toothbrush gets my teeth the closest to that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Gets between the teeth in hard to reach areas:  To get a conventional toothbrush in the areas in the back and between the teeth can require some wrist and jaw contortions that make it difficult to then scrub well.  This brush does it without requiring any special wrist acrobatics.  The neck is long and thin enough to reach and then the power of the brushing gets those hard-to-reach places nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Strength options:  I like that I can customize how strong I want the power. I can do a light clean after lunch or a deep clean before bed.  Ever since I became pregnant, my gums have been more sensitive, so the option to use a lighter setting to avoid bleeding or further irritation is a great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Attractive design:  it is light and not bulky.  Very easy to use and looks good on my counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other comments:  I can&#x27;t say too much about the whitening mechanism because I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but I have high hopes.  And a word of advice, be careful when opening your mouth with it in there...especially on the high settings, unless you want your best rendition of a toothpaste Jackson Pollack painting on your mirror.</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush before, and it does take some getting used to. It was difficult at first not to go through a brushing motion and let the brush do the work. Once you are used to it, you wonder why you waited so long to switch. Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite + 5 Series really does make you mouth feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it the first time, I noticed that my teeth were remarkably smoother than brushing with a manual brush. When I felt the surface of my teeth with my tongue it was as if a Zamboni went over them, it was that smooth. I got the same feeling after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a frequent tea drinker, so staining is a problem with my teeth, and after using the Sonicare for a awhile I noticed a big difference in my teeth – they were getting whiter! The Sonicare has removed a lot of the yellowing that my manual brush could not possibly remove. It certainly will keep the staining down, so I am happy about that. The box states that it removes 100% more stains and up to 2 shades whiter in 2 weeks. I don’t have a shade chart, but I definitely see a difference. There is a whiten mode on this device that is “To brighten and polish your front teeth”. I wish Philips did a better job explaining this mode. The box says “optimized for stain removal”, I will have to use this more, but I get good results just in the “Clean” mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare HealthyWhite 5 series has three intensity settings, with 3 LEDs that correspond to each level. I started out on low, but worked my way up to Medium. High is a bit too much for me, especially when the back of the cleaning head hits another tooth, the vibration may be disturbing to some. There is a feature called “Easy-Start” to get you used to using the Sonicare, but I jumped right in and avoided this feature. The smartimer shuts off the toothbrush after two minutes, and the quadpacer beeps every thirty seconds prompting you to move to a different quadrant in your mouth (top outer, top inner, bottom outer, bottom inner). The quadpacer can be shut off, but the smartimer cannot.&lt;br /&gt;Philips states that the Lithium Ion battery can last three weeks without charge, but it is so easy just to put back on the charger that I never tested that out. The battery light indicates how well charged the unit is. They also provide a nice sturdy travel case that fits the brush nicely, but not the charger. I guess unless you are going away for more than three weeks you can leave the charger at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare comes with a two year warranty which can be extended for six months if the device is registered online by 12/21/2016. It also comes with coupons to buy other Sonicare devices, but unfortunately not the brush heads. There is also a $50 coupon towards professional Philips Zoom! Whitening done by a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With whiter, smoother and cleaner teeth, I highly recommend this product.outer, top inner, bottom outer, bottom inner).
