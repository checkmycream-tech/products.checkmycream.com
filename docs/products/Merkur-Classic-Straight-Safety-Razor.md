<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After years of tearing my face up with multi-blade gimmick razors (looking at you, Mach-5), I finally tried going old-school and bought this one and some Feather blades, based on the Sweethome.com review. Couldn&#x27;t believe the difference - my shaves are silky-smooth, no more razor burn, and I&#x27;ve saved a crap-load of money since switching. Seriously, get this, some Feather blades, some shaving soap (I like Col. Conk World Famous Shaving Soap) and some coconut oil (cheap stuff from Trader Joe&#x27;s works great), and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my old merkur long handle great razor.</li>
    <li> Simple, straightforward, with no fuss. There are no butterfly closures to get gummed up, no fussy mechanics, just a screw and post. This razor is well-balanced, easy to use, practically bulletproof.</li>
    <li> Very nice safety razor for the price....would recommend.</li>
    <li> great product if you want a superior shave for the rest of your life!</li>
    <li> After years of using 2 blade and 3 blade systems, I went back to the good old safety razor.  I have been using this razor for 7 months and love it.  I am getting excellent shaves and saving money to boot.  I usually get 10 shaves per blade, the Atra&#x27;s I used only gave me 6.</li>
    <li> What a great shave...</li>
    <li> good weight balance, overall good product. just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My only real complaint is that I would have liked to have the handle be slightly longer.  Shaving with a safety razor takes some practice and you will probably nick yourself a couple times.  However, the savings of replacing your blades at 10 cents each is worth it.</li>
    <li> This razor works very well. Three piece, solid construction--looks like it will last forever. Good weight, good grip on handle. Only criticism: handle is a bit too short.</li>
    <li> I just got into DE shaving, and the more I learn about it, the more I appreciate this razor. It&#x27;s a great price, looks damn good, and has a good weight to it. Definitely recommended for beginners and experienced DE users alike. Those with larger hands or longer fingers might consider getting the longer handled model.</li>
    <li> Disappointed by the product</li>
    <li> Handle is a bit short, but shaves unbelievably close at a fraction the cost of those 5 blade monsters. My wife and I both will never go back to another razor.</li>
    <li> I guess I am spoiled by other Razors that don&#x27;t drag a pitch fork across your face. Maybe I had a bad blade but after one shave I have yet to return.</li>
    <li> I was using a Dovo shavette for the past 5 years, till airport security tossed it away for me.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed shaving with the Dovo but feared getting cut whenever I put in a new blade even after 5 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t cut me, only the hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming and shaping is also easier than with the shavette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months later and still going strong</li>
    <li> I think that this safety razor is OK, but I personally prefer a longer handle for better balance while shaving. For small hands this razor will do, but even so when shaving cream gets on the handle it can get pretty slippery.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I prefer the butterfly edge over this one. It also comes with a longer handle and is more convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this in addition to a Parker 99R, as I was just starting \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; after years of using electrics and disposables. This razor (with a good blade) shaves closer than any electric or disposable ever did. This is the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; weight model; they also make one heavier. I bought the \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; Parker model. Honestly, I don&#x27;t yet have a preference between weights. I think it is just what feels better for you to hold. The one small issue that  causes me to slightly favor the Parker over this Merkur is the fact that the Parker has a \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot; blade opening, that is, you twist the end of the handle and the blade cover swings open, like double doors. On the Merkur, you have to unscrew the head from the handle, which is a bit more tedious and puts you at a slightly higher risk of getting a cut on your fingers from the blade, as you have to be careful to only grasp the head at the ends. But overall, not a significant complaint.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as my butterfly opening razor was beginning to show some major wear. While the finish and construction of this razor are great the 3 piece design can be a little cumbersome, especially if you forgot to change your blade before getting into the shower. My only other complaint is that the handle feels very small in my hand, but I only noticed that in the few days after switching from my previous razor and quickly adapted. While I will probably buy another butterfly style razor in the future it will have to be before this one wears out because I don&#x27;t see that happening anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Go for it. One of the best purchases I have done.&lt;br /&gt;Tried many Safety Razors. These are amongst the best. May be a bit expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> this is a well built razor handle. the cost of 100 razors was 9.95. It takes a bit longer to shave, but the shave was close and comfortable! a pack of 4 of my name brand razors were 28.95 plus tax. they didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice razor. My advice is to consider the long handled version. The &#x27;standard&#x27; version is shorter than I expected ans is a little hard to handle. I don&#x27;t have huge hands, but still fumble from time to time with this one.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a starter handle and it was between this one and the long handle.  The thinking by me about the long handle is that the gillette and shick handles are all long which give your four fingers to manipulate the blade and apply extra pressure to those light weight cartridge systems. But after looking all around about using a DE, I came to the conclusion that -- since you&#x27;re supposed to let the weight of the handle do the work -- a longer handle might cause me to use bad technique. I made a good choice.  I&#x27;m taller with hands that match, so this handle fits in two fingers and my thumb while I gently pull the shaver across my whiskers.  Though I&#x27;ve had problems with a couple of facial moles getting sliced on occasion with Mach 3 and Fusion blades...No problems whatsoever thus far and still getting the whiskers right next to the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that the included Merkur blade wasn&#x27;t one I&#x27;d recommend. With my particular whiskers/face, there&#x27;s a lot of pull even after proper prep.  But with the same prep (shower first, wash face in shower, pre-shave oil/prep and quality foam) Personna blades gave me a much more comfortable shave..very close, no irritation and FAR less pulling.  I&#x27;ll probably experiment with more blades before I ever consider changing handles.  I do like this shaver.</li>
    <li> bought this + 100 razors and haven&#x27;t bought any razors in over a year and not even half way done with my pack of razors... great investment.</li>
    <li> As my title says. Before my skin would tolerate shaving once in three days. Going more often and I would have irritation. Going less often and I would look like a muslim. Now, I can enjoy a clean shave every day and I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, with the cost of double-edged blades, there&#x27;s no need to &#x27;save&#x27; the blade. I replace it every two or three shaves, but at 1.76 per 10 blades (Wilkinson Swords) at local Walmat... I can throw them away after each shave.</li>
    <li> Ok retro razor. Should have looked at it closer. Wanted one that the top actually opens and you drop your blade into it. This one you have to take all apart.</li>
    <li> Very mild, well made razor.&lt;br /&gt;It is lighter and less aggressive than some of my other razors such as EJ or 40&#x27;s style Gillette superspeed.</li>
    <li> I have been using long handled razors thinking tat they provide more control and leverage. Well I was mistaken I can get much greater control and just \\&quot;a better feel\\&quot; for what I&#x27;m doing with the shorter handle. This one is a beauty,in looks and functionally. Beautiful finish and weight,gave a great shave in 2 passes with no razor burn or nicks (used an Astra razor).</li>
    <li> Love the shave, and not having to spend a bundle on blades just wish the handle was a little larger and longer, but I&#x27;ve got really big hands.</li>
    <li> Makes a superb travel razor. Rather than the ones &amp;#34;designed&amp;#34; as travel razors, the separating head and handle stows easily and still feels solid when assembled. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> You better slow down when using this razor...otherwise you&#x27;re be in for some nice cuts on your face. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good clean cut and it&#x27;s WAY cheaper than Mach3 ravors...srsly.</li>
    <li> awesome replacement from my grandfathers.</li>
    <li> It was first time I bought a safety razor but it was very easy to use and provide great shaving experience. One picky side of it was razor holder was a bit short for my taste but thats just my preference. Other than that, the razor feels very solid and well built.</li>
    <li> Great quality, wish it was easier to change the blade, but so far this razor has been very useful for my partner</li>
    <li> Everything was in the excellent condition and arrived on time. I bought this product for my brother for his birthday, and he loves it.  So great product.</li>
    <li> This razor seems cheap and low quality unlike my Merkur 34C, I honestly have my doubts if this is really a Merkur and not some fake knock-off</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than modern razors</li>
    <li> Great razor. Good balance and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Nice heavy weight, short handled razor.</li>
    <li> love the feel of it.just the right size get a great shave</li>
    <li> If you want to start shaving with a safety razor or like me try again I recommend the Merkur Classic Safety Razor.  I started out with a Gilette 32 years ago in basic training.  It was probably a great razor for my my dad and uncles, but I nearly cut my chin off a couple of times. I was even complemented by a sergeant for a really close shave. I guess when you cut yourself nearly to the bone, that&#x27;s a close shave.  That was my first experience with direct pressure and stopping bleeding. Well needless to say I switched to two blades, three blades, etc. for many years looking for that close shave.  I made various attempts to go back to the safety razor and tried a straight razor twice.  This looks cool in the movies, but if you&#x27;re like me a novice don&#x27;t try this at home.  I was afraid of that cool looking razor my dad and older brother used. The Merkur has allowed me to transition back to the safety razor and enjoy the experience.  I have had little or no problems.  I have no serious cuts.  Those cuts were from POOR technique.  The best advice I can give is go SLOW.  Take time.  Enjoy the ride.  I read a book, I recommend doing the same.  It is amazing after shaving almost everyday for 32 years how much I did not know.  Try different techniques, I prefer shaving last after my face has a long soak.  I use shavesoap or shave cream in a tub.  I now take my time, about twice the time I took before. I strated with Merkur blades.  They are very good.  However; I purchased a variety pack and we will see how that goes. The Merkur is a great razor provided you take your time and your face is soaked.  It is a great razor and I do not plan on going back to the 12 blade gonzo deluxe model.  If you had a bad experience and want to give the straight razor a go, try this razor and some blades of your choice.  Read a book on shaving and give yourself triple the time what you normally allow for shaving.  Then adjust accordingly.  When I get really good with this razor I plan on an upgrade, but will keep this one for trips.</li>
    <li> got this thanks to a review on thewirecutter.com. it&#x27;s as good as promised. beautifully made. does exactly what it was promised to do: a clean comfortable shave. my only error is i probably should have got the longer handle version.</li>
    <li> I own four DE razors. The Merkur 33c is slightly more aggressive than the others and I love it! A clean, close shave with a variety of blades.</li>
    <li> Daily use and has cut down on razor bumps by 95%.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the refill blades are cheap, a lot cheaper than buying the razor heads on other brands.</li>
    <li> The difference is truly night and day from my old razor. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve garnered better skills at using a safety razor ...just using the razor&#x27;s pressure and taking the time, but nicks and cuts are a thing of the past. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this razor. If you are considering purchasing a double edge razor and are not sure which, this is very much recommended by this user.</li>
    <li> The Merkur safety razor is well balanced in one&#x27;s hand while shaving and provides a close, comfortable shave. In summary it performs exactly as one expects from a razor.</li>
    <li> I have the long handle version of this but have a finish flake off problem.  Merkur did not stand behind the product stating it was my water.  I have a very old Gillette.  Guess what no flaking/same water.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Look here...&lt;br /&gt;Badger and Blade forum topic 135882&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Followup.........After more than a year of battling with Merkur they finally replaced my razor.  I sold it as the original was so bad and if it were to have the same finish issues I would not want to battle with Merkur again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that Merkur never admitted to anything being wrong with the razor.  They kept blaming it on me.  At one point they even suggested I had acid come in contact with it.  All in all very ridiculous in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Was amazed to discovered that an &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; razor and double edged blade could give me a better and closer shave than my &#x27;modern&#x27; alternatives.  And with the blade cost, I get more good shaves for less money.  A great investment and a better shave1</li>
    <li> Wow at first I was a little disappointed with my purchase, my first shave felt like I was shaving with a lawnmower. After say my third time shaving with my Merkur Classic I started noticing it feeling better and I most definitely was getting a cleaner and closer shave. After watching a few how to videos on youtube I adjusted my techniques and slowed way down. Now I shave almost everyday and get a great shave pain free.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this really. I use it every week and haven&#x27;t had any troubles. Anyway, that&#x27;s the idea, it&#x27;s so simple that it requires little cleaning/maintenance, and is very hard to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t come with blades&lt;br /&gt;- Real metal (great build quality)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband! He absolutely loves it! It is a great shave and he barely has to change the blade. Awesome purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I use a strait razor and got this for a clumsy friend, I tried it first and cleaned it before giving it to him. Anyway, works great. Moles and pimples aside, you pretty much have to be an idiot to cut yourself with this. Hefty design and will last forever if you take decent care of it. Clean, smooth, and effortless shave! (Besides, it looks classy in your bathroom when the ladies come over.)</li>
    <li> Who would have thought technology and evolution had nothing to add to this product for so many years.  No fancy name or unnecessary extra blades.  My Grand dad was using this thing and still is the best thing out there.</li>
    <li> I, like many other people, have recently switched over to a simpler method of shaving for mainly the economical reasons - cartridge razor refills are ridiculously priced (probably to help pay people like Clay Mathews to be in their commercials to try to sell you a Fusion). I have used my father&#x27;s DE safety razor a few times growing up and well I never really thought it to be something special. I went online and realized I was doing it wrong and after getting my own razor and doing it the right way a few times now; I have to say, this is the best way to shave period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never really had a lot of irritation and I don&#x27;t have to shave very often. I am half Korean (my mother&#x27;s oldest brother didn&#x27;t grow facial hair until he was like 30) so I shave about once a week if not a tiny bit more frequently - I am half American after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure it takes a little longer and if I had to shave everyday, it may get to be a hassle... But I am actually truly enjoying my shaves now. I take my time and go once with the grain, relather, once across the grain, relather, and finally against the grain. Finish off with a little aftershave and post shave balm and I now have the smoothest shaves of my life, and all with a single bladed razor (take that Fusion ProGlide - no one needs 5 blades scraping across their face...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact if you suffer from razor burn or irritation from shaving this may be the reason - along with the chemicals they put in aerosol shaving creams. Only the first blade that contacts the skin is making lubricated contact with the skin and is also scraping off the shaving cream that is supposed to be lubricating your skin for your shave leaving the other 2-4 blades to scrape against your dry unlubricated skin. Which can cause that nasty razor burn and other irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the technique of wet shaving comes into play. You have a single blade and after each run over your face you reapply your shave cream/soap. Sure it takeslonger. But to me it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in getting into a healthier way to shave your face I suggest checking out Badger and Blade - it is an online forum dedicated to the art of wet shaving either with a double edged safety razor or a straight razor. I went with the safety razor because it seemed simpler than trying to maintain a straight razor to me, but before I read some of the articles on their site (along with their wiki) I was completely ignorant to how right my father had it with his simple single bladed razor and mug of William&#x27;s. There is a lot of information on there to get you started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a little off topic there, but yes I highly recommend this razor. It isn&#x27;t too aggressive for the novice shaver like myself. It seems built to last a lifetime in Germany. It is a 3 piece razor, meaning that you unscrew the handle from the top which is two pieces that come apart when you do so and you put the blade in between those two pieces and screw the handle back on and you are good to go. A lot of people seem to prefer Merkur&#x27;s Heavy Duty version of this razor which is a heavier 2 piece version of this razor. I have no experience with that product so I will leave it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for the price of one pack of Gillette&#x27;s five bladed monstrosity&#x27;s refills, you can purchase a beautiful german made razor that will last a lifetime that you can pass on to your children if you so choose. What are you waiting for?</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a double edge razor since the 1950s.  I originally had Gilette Razors--eventually owning three of them--an ajustable--I think it was called the \\&quot;fat boy,\\&quot;-- a standard size butterfly opening Gillette, and a long handle one I believe was called the \\&quot;knack.\\&quot;  When double edge razors no longer were available in stores I thought I had better hang onto the Gillette razors because I believed double edge razors were extinct.  Only in about the last five years have I learned that double edge razors are not extinct after all.  Since that time I have accumulated three different Parker razors, three English razors (I don&#x27;t recall the name at the moment), and four Merkur razors.  At first I thought the English razors were going to be the best, but the more I used the Merkur Razors the more I loved them--except for the adjustable model.  That one is too large, ackward to use, and no setting I have tried comes close to the standard Merkur Razors.  I have the Merkur Classic, the long handled model, and also the heavy duty one.  I love them all except for the adjustable.  I have recently compared them with my old Gillettes.  The Merkur razors win out, hands down.  I really mean it when I call the Merkur razors the best in the world.  They give amazingly close shaves--nothing gets closer, in my opinion--and they do it very safely.  I almost never nick myself.  I truly love these razors, and with more than 50 years of shaving experience I feel I know what I am talking about.</li>
    <li> Get away from the pricey 3,4,&amp; 5 blade razors...invest in one of these Merkurs, grab some Feather DE blades and some quality shaving cream (Taylor of Old Bond St. or Proraso.)  You&#x27;ll get the best shave you can have. Between this Merkur and my Dovo Shavette, I get the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had apart from my barbers Straight Razor.</li>
    <li> With a forgiving blade exposure and angle, the Merkur Classic (33C) can provide a comfortable shave, when paired with the right blade for your face. It&#x27;s a great daily shaver! It is a mild shaver, however, with the blade edge within the protective cove of the top cap and safety bar. With my skin and beard, though it&#x27;s a mild shaver, it gives me the best shave of the many DE razors I&#x27;ve used and own. When I use a milder razor, I can&#x27;t get as close a shave, but actually often get more irritation. When I use more aggressive designs, to actually get a closer shave, I end up with wounds, but when I am careful to not nick, cut or scrape, I don&#x27;t get as close a shave.  This is the first new DE razor that I bought, and I had to buy and try many others before I came to appreciate how well this razor suits my beard and skin. It is now my most-often-used razor, and, when I use a different razor, it&#x27;s always a pleasure to return to my Merkur 33C again -- like coming home.  Some have voiced concern about the lack of heft when the 33C (57g weight) is compared to its heavier, more-aggressive cousin, the 34C.  I, personally, find that the weight of the 33C razor is more than adequate.  For example, the Lord L6 razor is a longer-handled, likely-less-durable (due to the more fragile aluminum threads of the handle) razor similar to this Merkur, and both razors shave well even though the Lord L6 is 13 grams lighter.  Also, some have expressed a preference for a longer handle.  I have long- and short-handled razors, and find handle length to be inconsequential.  This is a razor, not a hammer, nor a paint scraper;  therefore I use, and recommend, a finger-tip grip, just holding it with the pads of your fingers and thumb. (For pictures of razor grips, search Internet for ShaveLikeGrandad; more info below.) More important to me than handle length is the traction that the handle provides in my fingers, and the knurling on the 33C is excellent -- a great grip with even the most wet and soapyhands!  If you are comfortable with the modest cash outlay and the mildness of its shave character, this is a great razor that can last more than a lifetime.

    <li> First time shaving with it, I didn&#x27;t draw any blood.  That&#x27;s a great thing.  It&#x27;s a little heavy.  I think a longer handle would be better for my hands, easier to hold.  I&#x27;ll stick with it for now, maybe upgrade after 10 or 20 years when this thing wears out.  Honestly I think it will probably be in a flea market cabinet long after I&#x27;m gone.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Note to replace blades you need to unscrew top instead of butterfly open like some of them. I knew this coming in and am fine with it, so 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> Too heavy which takes longer to shave.</li>
    <li> I just got the Merkur and had to try it out. It came with one Merkur blade which I thought was going to be a little aggressive, but it wasn&#x27;t. I did see a great video on YT about how to use a safety razor which helped me out immensely. DO watch a video about these products if you haven&#x27;t ever used onE! My first experience was great. I know if I didn&#x27;t, I would be in the ER by now based on what I used to do while shaving with one of those disposables.&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur cleans up REALLY well. Doesn&#x27;t clog like the multi-blades which is what I am used to. Easy to load and easy to get right with no fiddling. No nicks or cuts what so ever which I will owe to the video instruction.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it you want babys-ass smooth which some multi-blades provide, its going to be different. Its REAL close but keep in mind, they don&#x27;t rip the hair up like multi&#x27;s do. You might have to do two or three passes.&lt;br /&gt;Else, I am VERY impressed with single blade razors now and am glad I got a great razor for my first.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this product has a very short handle. I wish it had a longer handle. You will initially think that there is an attachment somewhere in the box to make the handle larger; there isn&#x27;t. I have used two blades in the razor so far and found the product to be excellent.</li>
    <li> Tired of triple blades and ingrown hair. Learning curve, but it isn&#x27;t insurmountable. Lighter touch is required. Wish I had discovered safety razors earlier, and $0.25 a blade is a deal when compared to other conventional shavers.</li>
    <li> smaller than I was imagining but good and quality made.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i have used a safety razor.  I will have to say I am very impressed with the way it shaves.  It does take a little bit to get use to, but after the first few times I got the hang of it.  It does weight a little more than disposable ones, but I have got use to it in a short period of time.  After 3 weeks I am still using the blade that came with it, it still shaving like new.  I have coarse thick facial hair and would end up clogging up the disposable blades to the point that they would not cut cleanly any more.  I would have to change them about once a week if not more to get a smooth shave. With this razor I do not have that problem, it cleans out all the cut whiskers each time I rinse it off.  I have to do about three passes to get to a very clean shave, but I do not mind the little extra time needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con for this razor, is the handle is a little shorter than I am use to with the disposable razors.  After a few weeks I got use to it and its not a big deal to me.</li>
    <li> It is a shorty, make sure you know what you&#x27;re buying.</li>
    <li> The handle is too short and hard to hold onto.</li>
    <li> Just got this, I was really impressed with the feel of it, my only gripe is I wish the handle was linger but I&#x27;m sure I can get used to it. Feels good shaving, the ridges let you push as hard as you want without the blade cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> There are better products out there for the money. Looks cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Very economical with fewer moving parts than even a butterfly safety razor.  Although it comes with a blade, I have purchased 100 blades for less than $20 (good ones too), so I am pretty much set for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll get one for my girlfriend later on.  She uses my old VanderHagen one for now, but those are not very good and I would like to get her a better one later.</li>
    <li> This is your simple 3 piece safety razor design. The thing I like about it is the handle is actually hollow. This may help prevent moisture build up in the threads (although you should probably dissasemble and let your razor dry out after shave). Hopefully Merkur uses better metal than the cheap metal used on the Edwin Jagger where I saw it&#x27;s threads disintegrate and the head eventually broke off altogether from the handle. I also like the knurled handle on this Merkur. Weight seems fine; I think the HD would have been too heavy for my liking. Slightly overpriced but of course massive savings in the blades.</li>
    <li> Handle is short.  I think I would have gotten the long handle if I could do it again.  With soft water you feel the oils of your skin so everything is slippery when wet.  This gets real slick.  I wrapped a rubber band around it for grip and feel.</li>
    <li> Shaved for decades with disposable razors. Never again. I am very fond of my new razor. I have 400 blades stashed away! I have never enjoyed shaving more. I have never had as close a shave as my new razor does. Very happy..</li>
    <li> Lives up the it&#x27;s durability and potential.  I haven&#x27;t had and issues with, however I do recommend you get a stand for it.</li>
    <li> What can you say? It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
    <li> The perfect weight and size. The material is of great quality and it takes any double edge razors, very good quality. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend love this old school razor. Will recommend it to friends and family! Keep up the good work!!!</li>
    <li> Decided to give the old school DE razor a try. Wow, what a difference from cartridge razors and I was using Gillette Fusion ProGlides. This razor is nice looking, handles well and is everything I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> I made the switch about 6 months ago to this safety razor. To date, I have been very impressed.  The razor itself it great.  Nice heft and easy to change the blade and clean.  The shave quality has been excellent.  When I first started, I did nick myself much more than I had been with a 5 blade disposable.  Once I figured out that I needed to change the blade after 2 or three shaves (2xweek) and be a little more careful around my chin this stopped .  It sounds silly but after years of Mach 3 and fusion, it takes a while to get used to shaving carefully and changing the blade. Since then, it has been an excellent experience.</li>
    <li> I just got a Merkur razor for Christmas after using disposable razors for the better part of twelve years. Merkur just laughed at every disposable and proved just how good a shave you can get! First off, the razor itself is stainless steel so there&#x27;s some weight to the razor. Also it is incredibly durable. I think I&#x27;ve managed to drop the razor three times without a problem. Shaving itself is relatively simple. Just put the curved head against your face and adjust so the razor&#x27;s edge is shaving hair right off. You should have to apply very little pressure and should feel very little irritation. When I shave with my Merkur, I feel like I&#x27;m getting a better shave than I&#x27;ve ever had. As for blades, I&#x27;ve heard a blade a week for everyday shaving is normal. To change a blade, unscrew the head from the handle and wala! Drop a new blade in and you&#x27;re good to go. Also, blades are dirt cheap when compared to a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo or a Bic of some sort. For guys out there on the fence, go get a Merkur. You&#x27;ll be satisfied and probably kick yourself for having used disposables for years!</li>
    <li> i have thik hire and i actuly enjoy shiving with this&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super happy with the performance.</li>
    <li> I just started wet shaving with a D/E razor and this Merkur provides an excellent shave. I used a Feather blade and it really provided a quick, excellent shave. The handle is short and looks too small when you get it out of the package but in hand and during use, it is completely balanced and works excellently. High recommend for a great shave.</li>
    <li> Vastly different angle to my Edwin jagger kelvin.  Caused a fair deal of razor burn the first use.  Its a very very mild shave that tends to make you overconfident on sensitive areas.  However if this is your only razor i think it would be just fine.  Just dont over shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update found out why I had discomfort. The razor I got was a little defective the blade dips on the end on one side</li>
    <li> I switched to a safety razor from cartridge razors about a year ago and I&#x27;ve loved the change. There is definitely a learning curve for the first couple of weeks (check out YouTube for good how-to videos), but once you get comfortable using it you&#x27;ll love the smooth shave and the incredible money savings on razors. Every article I read when researching safety razors recommended the Merkur and I can see why. Great quality, easy to replace the blades, and a classic design. Love my Merkur.</li>
    <li> Ok, so after catching that Pawn Stars guy Rick Harrison hawking the Micro One Touch razor on TV, I started thinking and realizing that he had valid points  about razors these days. So I popped online and started reading reviews about safety razors and started researching the different styles (say no to the Micro Touch) and settled on this one. With it I picked up the &amp;#34;16 FEATHER DERBY 7 O&#x27;clock ASTRA NACET BIC BLUEBIRD Blade Sampler&amp;#34; also offered since blade quality was a frequent topic and placed my order on a Thursday.  Now, I have a difficult time with razors as my stubble will kill any razor I tried if I go over 1 days worth of growth. Since I ordered it on a Thursday I figured I would challenge this razor when I received it. I stopped shaving and received the razor Monday afternoon and waited until Tuesday morning to shave. Being the brilliant person I am, I decided to make it more of a challenge so I jumped in the hot shower, washed my face as usual and when I got out proceeded to shave using no lubricant at all and a 4 day old beard. The razor took it. I loaded the Feather razor blade turned on the water and started shaving with no cream or soap.(This  NOT RECCOMENDED)  Having never used a safety razor before I was tentative but the upper cheeks went well and I started the chin and neck. The razor took it, not only worked well but thrived. I ran it under the water and the stubble washed right out.  My hard to hit areas are the best they ever were and I walked away with no cuts, scrapes, or razor burns. The unit is solid and I was a little leery that the 3&amp;#34; handle was so short but it turned out to be a non issue. The handle length turned out to be a real benefit, especially under the jaw where other razors have scraped. Clean up was a breaze, I just loosened the handle a bit and rinsed. I did remove the handle and take out the blade to verify the hair was cleaned out but needn&#x27;t have.On the whole I am very pleased with the razor and consider it a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Solid razor, good heft and well built&lt;br /&gt;- Handle unscrews easily and inserting the blade was a snap.&lt;br /&gt;- The alignment posts were meaty and didn&#x27;t allow the blade to shift. (Was worried after reading about issues loading the butterfly style.)&lt;br /&gt;- Handled 4 day old growth like a champ&lt;br /&gt;- Super easy cleanup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment on blades right now since I have used one style of blade exactly once so I have no reference as to how long they last or which is better.reat investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Solid razor, good heft and well built&lt;br /&gt;- Handle unscrews easily and inserting the blade was a snap.&lt;br /&gt;- The alignment posts were meaty and didn&#x27;t allow the blade to shift.

    <li> my first non commercial razor.  im enjoying the expderience.  assembling and disassembling easy.  easy to clean but requires disassembling to do so. that might be because of my homemade lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor for me. very smooth and gentle.  with a little proraso soap and some clubman aftershave, makes for a great shave.  you owe it to yourself to try out this razor.</li>
    <li> This product is the best razor I have ever used.  It is well constructed and offers the closest, most painless shave I have experienced.  As an added bonus, replacing the razors cost only seventeen cents a piece and you can use them multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and it truly makes you wonder why anyone needs five blades...</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Works great either at the sink or in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to rinse clean and blade change only takes seconds when replacing a dull one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exceptionally more economical than buying packages of disposables.&lt;br /&gt;Every man (and any interested women) should have one.</li>
    <li> My first DE razor was a old 1969 Gillette super adjustable. I just completed my first shave with the Merkur classic and I love is at least just as much as my first razor. When I bought it i thought I made a mistake by not getting the HD version. But after using this razor I can not imagine actually needing the extra weight.  I shave my head with it as well and it does a fine job. I am African-American and I find that DE razor&#x27;s are best at eliminating the dreaded razor bumps that are common because of coarse hairs. Learning the proper technique is key. Us younger guys under 35 need to join the DE movement.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to use a multiple blade razor on anything like a daily basis without tearing up my face with bumps, cuts, and razor burn.  I have used an electric for years, accepting a less close shave to save my face.  This Merkur safety razor has made it possible to return to using a blade most days without the former discomfort.  I use this with a real boars bristle brush and a good quality shaving soap and coated BIC blades.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick, dense beard that feels like shark skin or sand paper in a day after shaving. My wife teases me by saying I should get laser hair removal for my beard to thin out some of them, and no problem with this razor/blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;m using a double edge razor and I was nervous with all sorts of warnings about nicks and cuts, but let me tell you, no problem what so ever, butter smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before i bought this razor I did a good amount of reading on various models and as a teenager I have played around with couple of the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; top opening style models, but never shaved with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up I always heard folks praising the quality of cutlery made in Solingen, Germany, and this Merkur razor lives up to that fame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think one of the reason why it&#x27;s so good (and Germans might be onto something here) this is a screw type 3 piece design. It&#x27;s not as convenient to load the blade as a butterfly top loading models, but I think the blade aligns more precisely on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was playing with couple of the top loading butterfly models, i&#x27;ve seen the flaps does not close uniformly, leaving one side of the blade more gap, or blade sticking out farther from the left or right, forming a slight wedge. This inconsistency of the closing mechanism on the butterfly top loading razors offsets their convenience when replacing the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I know all Mercur brand razors are made in Solingen, Germany and all are three piece bottom loading designs where you have to remove the handle completely to replace the blade. As I said, this is less convenient but it loads the blade more consistently and aligns the blade more precisely which results in a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the knurled handle prevents slippage and feels comfortable in the hand. At first look, after using many Gillette (fusion and mach 3) products over many years the shorter handle on this razor looked a little strange, but it works great so no complaints about the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the razor for the first time I love it. I&#x27;m planning to update my review in a month or two and after that I will throw away 15-20 of brand new Gillette Fusion and Mach3 cartridges i still have laying around in the drawer or maybe give them to a nephew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people talk about saving money using these razors but aside from saving money, the multiple blade craziness has gone out of hand over the years. When it was switched from 2 to 3 blades (Mach 3) i started to question the benefits of the third blade, but the open back design of Mach 3 cartridge made it very easy to rinse, now I&#x27;m using 6 blades (5 in front +1 on the backside for fine touch ups) and the damn fusion still does not shave as good as this razor. I intend to replace the blade as frequent as my time permits (takes about 45 seconds) and it glides over my skin like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final word: Don&#x27;t cheap out and try to use the same blade too many times, specially in the beginning when you&#x27;re still getting used to a real razor as opposed to the toy models (Gillette, etc)d a little strange, but it works great so no complaints about the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the razor for the first time I love it. I&#x27;m planning to update my review in a month or two and after that I will throw away 15-20 of brand new Gillette Fusion and Mach3 cartridges i still have laying around in the drawer or maybe give them to a nephew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people talk about saving money using these razors but aside from saving money, the multiple blade craziness has gone out of hand over the years.

    <li> I found out almost all Merkur razors have the same Head, Just different handles. I still like all of my Merkurs</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVE EVER!!! and very EASY to use. If you can shave with Gillette and Bic razors,this will be no different. Try it!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know if it was the 34c or the 33c model. It was not even on the box. Had to google each model to figure out what I bought.</li>
    <li> a lightweight version of a Merkur I&#x27;ve used for years. This one will give an excellent shave. Hope my son likes.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have had yet. Feels nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> very great product: recommended.</li>
    <li> First de safety razor for me. Good bye disposable razors. Great experience feels great holding a quality product that you can appreciate.</li>
    <li> Just kidding, but this thing is great. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a few years now and you&#x27;d have no idea it&#x27;s taken a beating already. I&#x27;ve flown with it (the razors not in the blade, obviously), dropped it all over the place, left it sitting in pools of water, and it still shines just like new. This review is on my second purchase on one of these razors, for my younger brother. It&#x27;s certainly helped with his acne now that he isn&#x27;t tearing at, and making his skin inflamed. With proper technique, the shave is beyond comparison to disposable razor. It&#x27;s to the point where if I don&#x27;t have access to my razor, I&#x27;d rather just sport my bad facial hair. Why punish your face because your hair is not so great?</li>
    <li> Its a well built razor</li>
    <li> I read a review which I thought was objective and it raved about the closeness of the shave of the steel Blade vs these new &amp;#34;tinfoil&amp;#34; substitutes. When I got the razor the shave was disappointing in every way. Closeness flexibility and risk of cuts. I went out and bought a fusion and the difference was dramatic. New technology is vastly superior</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Merkur now for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m overwhelmingly pleased.  It&#x27;s taken a little time to get down a technique appropriate to the nuances of shaving my face (this razor will cut you in soft spots easily), but overall I like the result.  I hope this product comes to serve me for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is any negative, it&#x27;s simply that you need to make time to shave...you can&#x27;t run this over your face when you&#x27;re in a hurry, because a good straight razor blade will cut you unforgivingly.  Take your time, develop the right technique for your face, and you&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a variety pack of blades. The first time I used this, it was great. it shaved my face great and I had no razor bumps or burns. I hope this lasts many years and saves me a lot of money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I made the switch to the wet razor and have not looked back!  This razor is built solid and has a great weight.  I&#x27;ve already realized a return on the purchase price by no longer needing to buy expensive replacement blades, but most importantly the quality of shave with this Merkur is worthy of 5 stars.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I wanted to see how this razor worked over the disposable 3 blade shave heads that I use. I still need some practice with probably but I do not get as close of a shave. The handle is too short for my liking also.</li>
    <li> Switched from a 5 blade normal razor to this and My skin is already feeling the difference. I would say that the irritation is down at least 80 percent after only 2 shaves. Once you get the hang of shaving with a safety razor, you will never go back .</li>
    <li> I decided to toss my Mach 3 and start using a safety razor to save money and experience shaving the way our grandfathers did.  Managing the amount of pressure is key to a good, bloodless shave with a safety razor.  The handle is short and light, allowing you to apply just the right amount of pressure and easily achieve the right shaving angle.  It made the switch from cartridges seamless.  I plan to order a second one for travel.</li>
    <li> I had never considered switching from Gillette Fusion to a safety razor until recently. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think there was even a market for them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin especially on my neck where it seems to grow the thickest. Even combining trimming with an electric razor and then moving to the Fusion for a close shave I would constantly have a red and irritated neck that was embarrassing to say the least.  A co-worker convinced me to give the Merkur a shot and it is the best decision I have made.  The added 5-10 minutes of shaving provides an infinitely cleaner shave with NO irritation.  The fact that I can get 100 blades for $10 from Derby or Astra only sweetens the deal. I spent more in a month on Fusion blades then I will spend over the next 2+ years with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and always had trouble getting a close clean shave with expensive disposables, do yourself a favor and grab a straight razor ASAP!</li>
    <li> Five blade razors are a waste of money. I have a thick beard and thought there was no way anything less than five blades could be good for my face; even though I constantly had five or more ingrown hairs. This razor is now saving my face and money. A five blade razor needed replacement every week and by Friday my face hurt. The single blade Merkur needs a new blade about every 2 to 2 1/2 weeks. I love it and so does my wallet and face.</li>
    <li> I recently got back into the safety razor shaving method.  I bought the Parker heavyweight 99r I believe and tried different blades as they say.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I should try this standard lighter Merkur razor and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Wilkinson Sword, Personna and Shark blades with both razors and I think I will stick with the Merkur classic.&lt;br /&gt;Remember! angle and pressure.  These two words are the secret in my experience to a good safe clean awesome shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. You need to be careful at first. It takes a little getting use to but now.... it is the best razor I have even owned. Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> got this razor for my dad - he had not used a safety razor for years but he picked it back up right away - no cuts, no problems - great razor for a beginner.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor, but for a reason I can&#x27;t figure out the 34C is way better. The 34C shaves more comfortable and closer???</li>
    <li> Handle too short. You will be more comfortable with the longer handle razors because you are used to the longer handle on the disposables!</li>
    <li> Great razor. In retrospect I should have ordered the long handle which I am about to do after I finish this review.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Excellent weight. Very good quality workmanship. I expect this razor to be passed on to my son and his son one day.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing. I rarely cut myself even when pressing hard during my shave. I love the way my shave turns out and I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t get too close to the skin so there isn&#x27;t razor burn and my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow returns quicker and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left the fusion for this blade and will never go back. I personally recommend shaving with the beard and not against it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying out straight razor shaving after years of cartridge use.  This handle is easy to use, change blades, and clean.</li>
    <li> Got this after reading the recommendation on thesweethome.com ([...]). It is sturdy and weighty, and should last years. I wish I&#x27;d got the one with the longer handle, though. I am average size, but the shaver still feels a little small in my hands. Still, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> The handle is too short</li>
    <li> these beautiful razors were great groomsmen gifts; my son had done the research and amazon delivered them quickly right to his doorstep; one more detail checked for a perfect event;</li>
    <li> My son really liked this, great shave</li>
    <li> great weight and quality. my first safety razor and probably my last for a long time(i can&#x27;t see any reason this thing will die)</li>
    <li> Elsewhere I&#x27;ve rated the Omega shaving cream/brush set and the 40 pack sampler of blades.  This classic safety razor is, of course, where the blade meets the beard.  It is easy to use and comfortable in the hand.  The Merkur blade that comes with the razor is sharp, but comfortable.  Even though I hadn&#x27;t used this type razor in more than twenty years, I only nicked my chin once or twice in the first week.  I may purchase the long-handled version of this razor later. It may fit my style of shaving better.</li>
    <li> This the Maybach (?) of razors.  Maybe the Bugatti.  Man can not shape metal any better and Merkur obviously invests in jewelry quality stainless.  It is a joy just to hold in my hand, but even greater when in combo with good preparation and Feather (not Merkur) stainless blade, one could not want a superior or more comfortable shave.  My only caveat, is possibly the handle could be a couple of MM longer.</li>
    <li> I am still a little scary of cutting myself, but expect to enjoy it more axs I use it more.</li>
    <li> I used a Gillette Sensor Excel razor for better than a decade but kept getting in-grown hairs.  I decided to make a switch and chose Merkur Classic razor after reading it was a top rated razor.  I&#x27;ve been using the razor now for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t had one in-grown hair, wish I would have made the switch sooner.  As a bonus, the Merkur Classic is far cheaper than buying replacement blades for the Gillette Sensor Excel.  Do yourself a favor and buy the box of 100 razors and you&#x27;ll be set for at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have one regret, it would be that I wish I had bought the longer handle razor.  I have since adjusted and am now use to the shorter handle but initially I think I would have liked the longer handle better.</li>
    <li> If you are interested in getting a safety razor, this is one of the best to get. It is extremely well constructed, safe and handles great. I have been using this for about two months now and I am extremely pleased with it. I was worried that it would be hard to get used to a safety razor, but after the first couple of shaves, it felt natural and I was able to get close shaves. I was considering getting the one with the longer handle, but the 3&amp;#34; works great for me for handling. Razor blades can be changed easily and are much cheaper than regular cartridges. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This razor is well worth the price.  I spent a lot of time worrying about which safety razor to buy, and that was unnecessary.  If you&#x27;re new to double edge razors, buy this one and some merkur blades.  There may be other, more expensive razors that are also worth the money, but this is a great starting place. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this  product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;- It is much cheaper than Schick and gillette&lt;br /&gt;-It shaves really good for my sensitive skin and I have been using it for 2 years.  Don&#x27;t not buy the cheap razor because i tried and failed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;-It takes 3 to 4 times to get use it without getting cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation&lt;br /&gt;-I use feather blades 50 packs for under $15 . Blades are good for 2 shaves in my experience&lt;br /&gt;-Sandlewood shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I use this thing everyday!  It is such a delight to shave with and I actually look forward to shaving with it.  Nice and heavy and really well made.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> After nearly all my shaving life (read 14 years) of using an electric razor and the last 10 a $300 one; I&#x27;ve made the switch forward/backward? To a safety razor. I&#x27;ve been seeking a smoother shave, less skin irritation, and closer shave. After the learning curve everyone talks about, I wouldn&#x27;t switch back. Ever. Also, get the Merkur Classic here. Plenty of razor and they&#x27;re all very basic. No sense in spending big bucks. Do yourself a favor if you&#x27;re new and get an alum block. You&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
    <li> Single blade razor just can&#x27;t compare to a modern razor with multiple blades an contour head. The shave is not close.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a Merkur as I had heard so much about them.  They are from Solengen Germany, the home to great blades.I expected more I guess.  It is a pretty good razor, but noticeable not as good, smooth or clean a shave and my Edwin Jagger D89 or Parker C26.  I would have expected it to be at least as good a shave, it was not, using the same Wilkinson blades.  Yes it is an &amp;#34;inexpensive&amp;#34; Merkur but that is no excuse, we have over 100 years to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the build, it is a well built razor, the handle is a bit small, thin, but well knurled so it is easy to grip.  I like the build, I just wish it shaved better.  It is much better designed and built than my $10.00 Baili, but shaves about the same.  A disappointment to be sure.  If you are in the market for a $20 - $30 razor there are better offers available, I&#x27;d pass on this one.</li>
    <li> My first shave or two with the Merkur razor was a bit less-than-perfect. I&#x27;ve never used a razor like this one before, didn&#x27;t really read up on how to use it, and assumed I&#x27;d be able to figure it out without a problem. The fact of the matter is, I should have done my research because I ended up with a super patchy shave that looked dumb and felt worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem was doubled since I shave my entire head with it, not just my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know what I&#x27;m doing only a week later, however, it&#x27;s great! I get a clean, close shave with no razor burn and only one or two very small nicks, usually on the back of my head where I can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a great product and I will never go back to conventional razors with fifty-bajillion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m rating the Merkur razor a four instead of a five is that if I purchase another one I&#x27;ll pick up the long-handled version. This handle feels a bit small in my hand. I&#x27;m getting used to it and I&#x27;m sure with a little more practice it won&#x27;t even matter but I think a longer handle would just fit me better.</li>
    <li> In my intro to wet shaving, i am one of those who loves to research and learn as much as i can to make hopefully the best decision i can.  (of course along the way you learn things that help you make better decisions after your initial decisions, and realize some things you didnt know to factor in in your original decision).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read around the internet, you will hear a lot about these 1 razors (Merkur 34c/Safety Razor vs Edwin Jagger de89).  Many will claim one or the other is better for different reasons (with seemingly the Merkur being the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; choice and established choice while the EJ the &amp;#34;flashier&amp;#34; of the two and seemingly the &amp;#34;newcomer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally chose the ej de89 b/c of how &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; and forgiving everybody said it was, while yet giving an exceptional smooth shave *(thus satisfying for both the beginner and pro).  It definitely delievered.  But unfortunately my iKon Bulldog handle for it (to add some weight and grip) one day broke the securing screw on my EJ DE89.  I was devastated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However that gave me a chance to then try the Merkur 34c (albeit I ordered the classic safety razor (3-piece instead of 2-piece razor) so I could use my iKon Bulldog handle to basically &amp;#34;frankenrazor&amp;#34; it to be just like a 34c.  I had foudn some obscure personal review where a similar shaver like me (thick coarse hair, sensitive skin) claimed the Merkur provided a &amp;#34;closer shave&amp;#34; due to it being slightly more aggressive than the EJ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that is the backstory and setup for this review,  In a nutshell, if you are deciding between the Merkur 34c/33c or similar vs the EJ de89 series as a starter.. the Merkur is definitely sturdier, better grip, and a moderately more aggressive shave.  That has been IMMEDIATELY clear in my results after only a 2-3 shaves with the Merkur after a month with the EJ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, however, the &amp;#34;moderately aggressive&#x27; shave meant more irritation.. MUCH MORE and not nearly as close of a shave. (My girlfriend absolutely complies with me on how the extreme difference in closeness/smoothness to the tough post-shave).  This is also in testing the top top blades Ive come down to in myh testing as well - the Astras and the Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear hands-down winner for me is the EJ de89 series.  So much smoother, and forgiving, and the shave is much closer to boot - MUCH.  I believe it is because the EJ&#x27;s head design somehow hits the sweet spot on how to hold razors (be it angles, flexing, something) that it just cuts a lot cleaner and with far less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the EJ i was having a lot of difficulties narrowing down my blade of choice between Astra and Feathers (although Wilkinson and Personna also performed very well and provided very close shaves).  Now I know why.  For some reason it just makes many razors perform SUPERBLY that you could pick a few (mild or super sharp) blades and still get that great same smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Merkur unfortunately, its been nothing but trouble and worse irritatin than i ever got with an EJ even in my first week.  Even with an industry recognized &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; razor such as Astra.  And this is after over a month of technique development and practice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody in wet shaving will tell you personal results will vary so the thing people should take away from this review is this (which you won&#x27;t hear anywhere except in one review at a forum i &amp;#34;stumbled upon&amp;#34; that convinced me to try the Merkur to get a closer shave....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur 34c/safety razor is more aggressive than the EJ de89 series.&lt;br /&gt;It does have the ability therefore to get a closer shave for you.... but it is definitely more noticeably harsher on your skin in the process even with a mild blade loaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is pretty tough and you want closeness, choose the Merkur between these two.&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is sensitive or your #1 priority iscomfort and avoiding skin irritation - get the EJ de89 series and know that even using Feather blades will feel comfortable in an EJ de89 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Having begun my shaving career using a safety razor and later transitioning to the assortment of two, three and even four blade models, I have returned to the original to obtain the closest and most comfortable shave. The Merkur is an excellent choice with fine machining. The Merkur or Feather blades last at least a week. The shave is close but very smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setting the blade and removal of a used one takes but a few moments...to be sure the old Gillette that opened and the blade carriers that you didn&#x27;t have to touch would be safety improvements, but really not necessary. A good buy that will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful single blade double-sided razor. It came highly recommended to me and I pass on and renew that recommendation. Also, the blade that is included with the razor to try was fantastic. No razor burn, no nicks, just smooth shaving. Keep up the good work Merkur</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say a bad thing about this razor, or the Personna blades I got with it.  I cook professionally and need to be clean-shaven every day, so just from a financial standpoint it&#x27;s a winner.  But the balance and heft is great.  Gives me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I chose to switch to a safety razor for three reasons: (a) environmental - I really hated all the plastic associated with the big names razor manufacturers, not only from the razor but the packaging; I also hated all the toxic/complicated formulas of the shaving creams (switched to soap, but that&#x27;s another review); (2) costs - I&#x27;ve spent at least close to a grand on buying disposables (if note disposable razors, then the blades); and (3) aesthetics - all this plastic, weird foams and costs had just turned shaving into this into an ugly chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy the Merkur Classic after reading reviews here and on the web. I was a bit overwhelmed by the opposing views/advice to newbies, and ultimately bought this one because I figured it was German, so at least well made (...and I hate stereotypes too). I was hesitant in general to switch because I still have images of my dad leaving the bathroom after shaving looking as if he&#x27;d been in a knife fight and just accepted that I&#x27;d nick myself a lot as the beginning. Man, I was wrong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave was so incredibly easy. I went slowly and had watched videos on line (thanks Manticore59 and Thomas of Denmark on YouTube). Although I didn&#x27;t get a very close shave on my first try (only did one pass), it was adequate and with a single nick. I have thick growth and coarse hair, and shave my head as well. Initially thought I&#x27;d master shaving my face before moving on to my head. But shaving my face was pleasing that I took the plunge and did the dome--no nicks there also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten better in the week since and now get an incredibly close shave that surpasses anything I&#x27;ve gotten using Gillette or Schick&#x27;s high-end razors. As to whether this is better than other brands/models, I&#x27;m in no position to say. I just know that it has been a satisfying switch, and I look forward to all the money I&#x27;ll save in the years to come.</li>
    <li> Nice weight. I was hesitant about the size at first but now I think it is a better option than the long handled version because this feels so maneuverable. The image made it look to me like the lower metal has &#x27;teeth&#x27; but it&#x27;s actually just grooves in a solid/straight piece of metal. Happy with the purchase and would probably opt for the more expensive HD version if I bought again since its extra weight of the blade would make it ever easier to shave.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both own one of these. It is much better than the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; door style.</li>
    <li> After using a cheaper no name brand for a year, I switched to this and noticed that the slight difference in angle of the heads have drastically improved my shave, and I have not cut myself at all using this.  Changing the blade is a little more difficult than my previous version because the whole base comes off and comes apart in 3 pieces, but it seems like a foolproof method that will work for years, versus my old safety razor which had issues twisting the head open to change blades after one year.</li>
    <li> great razor! cant think of any complaints. weight is awesome and the chrome finish makes it look sharp! the short handle is surprisingly easy to adjust to. do not hesitate.</li>
    <li> Its a wonder the world ever left these type shavers. This is what I learned to shave on when I didn&#x27;t really have anything to shave. 30 years later I&#x27;m back and could not be happier. Its the closest shave ever. This is a wonderful shaver and I won&#x27;t ever own anything else. There isn&#x27;t a manlier way to shave and the fact that you save MAJOR money over time not finding cartridges for the &amp;#34;latest 9 blade shaver invention&amp;#34; is awesome.</li>
    <li> After I&#x27;ve had several days to use it, I love it!  I don&#x27;t mind using the short handle; it&#x27;s easy to manuver.  Nice solid construction.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Very nice, high quality razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first attempt with something other than disposable razors and I was initally afraid that I would cut the crap out of myself. Well I didn&#x27;t and I like the weight. I wish I would have bought the one with the longer handle. I shave my head and I think having a longer handle would be a little easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a while now and I love it. I will never go back to using multi blade razors, the only issue I had when I first got this thing was it takes a while to get the technique down... Until you get the technique down, you&#x27;ll have really bad razor burn, but once you get it right, it&#x27;ll be the best shave you&#x27;ve ever had, I suggest buying a shave brush and mug with this razor, because regular shaving cream doesn&#x27;t seam to work well with this razor, but a bar of shaving soap applied with a shave brush works great, I highly recommend buying this razor, the blades are dirt cheap and it works better than any multi blade razor out there</li>
    <li> if you cut your self with it, its not the razors fault. You really have to take your time at first to get use to it. After a couple of months i shave just as fast with this than my Mach 5 Gellet razor.  It will take some time and its saving me toons of money.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t just a razor. It&#x27;s a machine. It&#x27;s like going from a Ford Pinto (any of the multi-blade junk) to a Mercedes. Sturdy, good weight, and very sophisticated. Love it.</li>
    <li> I kept touting my own Merkur razor and my girlfriend finally wanted one of her own. I got the closed comb since she won&#x27;t be trimming and detailing a beard like me, and am very pleased with the results. There is a slight learning curve from a more modern razor of course, but once that&#x27;s past it&#x27;s a much better shave. It&#x27;s just different enough from mine that they don&#x27;t get swapped, which is also nice. Get yourself some feather blades, shave oil and proraso shaving cream and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> A nerd maybe, but I am no hipster. I decided to get into wet shaving based on an article I read in The Magazine. The author made such a good case for it, both financially and experientially, that I had to give it a try. The Merkur looked like the best safety razor for the price based on reviews, and photos, so ordered it. No regrets. I love wet shaving now. And this is a great razor to do it with. Side note: The blade it came with wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfy for my face as the Feather brand blades that I purchased separately, but that opinion may be pure novice experience talking, so don&#x27;t judge this razor by my opinion of the blade it came with. (and who cares about a starter blade anyway)</li>
    <li> Once you get used to it the single blade works just as well as the 6 blade or however many they have on them now. But now I get to spend about 40 bucks a year in razors compared to 40 bucks a month. I have really thick beard hair and don&#x27;t like shaving everyday, I also used to get razor burn not with this though would recomend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was a little intimidated to start using a safety razor but am not looking back!  Super smooth shave, fewer nicks than I ever got while using a regular cartridge razor.  Blades are inexpensive.  I would highly recommend investing in a good badger hair (not boar hair) brush.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! While I wish I had the one with the split open top for an quick drop in razor replacement, I cannot deny the quality of this razor. The weight of razor lets you know that you&#x27;ve just purchased something of quality. The handle is completely metal and come with one blade in the box. The shaving experience took some getting use to, but once I got it down It quickly changed my mind about multi-blade razors. They do not work nearly this well. Found a nice shaving cream and a badger&#x27;s fur brush for application of the cream and this razor produced the closest and most even shave I&#x27;ve ever had.The added bonus is that to replace both the cream and 10 blade pack is less than $10. I use to shave only using water because I didn&#x27;t like any of the popular creams, plus buying that and 5 replacement shaving cartridges cost about $30. If you have any doubts that this will last have no worries. This is a solid well built product and I have not been more pleased by any purchase I&#x27;ve made  for shaving.</li>
    <li> This razor is excellant quality, definately worth the money. It gives a great, baby butt close shave. Some men with big hands complained that this handle was too small and too short. However, if you have small to medium hands the grip on this razor is just fine. I recommend this razor to any man who is looking for a reasonably priced, great quality, close shave razor.</li>
    <li> Just love this razor. It feels so solid. It is a little short, which I enjoy, but some people may prefer a longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is amazing and the solid metal feel of this thing is just enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could really consider this a lifetime purchase. I can&#x27;t really see it getting beat up unless you drop it super hard multiple times.</li>
    <li> Well made.  Durable.  Simple straight forward compact design that is easy to use, maintain, and reload.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;This was my first safety razor and am still using it after 2yrs.  Still looks brand new with no signs of wear.  Being the travel size, it has a shorter handle.  I love the compactness, but at times have wished for the extra control that a longer handle provides.  Overall, no regrets, would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Been using it for 2 months now - feels solid &amp; works great.</li>
    <li> I love this razor after months of use is still as good as new.</li>
    <li> The handle is a bit short for me to find a comfortable position.</li>
    <li> the 3&amp;#34; handle was too light for me, I had to replace it for a bit more weight, head construction was top notch and the shave is better than my EJ 89L</li>
    <li> Works well, especially if you have a few days growth as it doesn&#x27;t pull out the hair like a Gillette style does.</li>
    <li> After the first shave with this razor I wonder why I ever used the multi-bladed type with the expensive refills. This should be everyone&#x27;s first and only razor. Very close shave and once you make the initial purchase the refills cost nothing.</li>
    <li> Great for first time DE shavers. Very forgiving. Have since upgraded to the Merkur Progress.Wife has used the classic on her legs and loves it.</li>
    <li> Excellent German engineering. Forget Shick or Jillete! This will last your entire life if you keep it well-maintained,.</li>
    <li> Excellent housing. I also purchased a 100 pack of Astra blades. I love my shaving experience. This is a wonderful product, with plenty of heft. Shorter then I was anticipating but I quickly got used to it&#x27;s length. I now see it as an advantage.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I thought about getting an extra one so I can bring along when I travel. It was my first time using this type of razor. I have always used either disposables or gilette twin blades. The replacement razors are a fraction of the cost of replacement blades for any other razor. It is easy to clean and easy to maintain. The blades are extremely sharp of course. I have to be careful when I shave because I can easily cut my face. I use a nice cream that my gf got for me. It works very well. In fact, I have began using it when I shower. I swear by it over the Mach3 and Schick razors out there with their multiple blades and all. I always felt that there was no need for so many blades. Using this razor is proof that you can have a sharp and effective single blade razor that is cost effective. A pack of 10 blades runs anywhere from $5-$10 dollars depending where I buy them from. They last longer and save me money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone that wants a great shave.</li>
    <li> Solid construction, as you would expect from the Germans. Comes apart very easily (in a good way). Quite heavy and nice finish.</li>
    <li> Love the look and feel of this razor!  It&#x27;s solid and easy to handle.  Admittedly I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to since this is the first safety razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but so far I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.  And it looks like it will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I bought for my nephew at Christmas.  He likes it a lot and said it was good quality.</li>
    <li> The Merkur Safety Razor is my first safety razor since switching from the Gillette Mach 5 and is simply the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. Going &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; is a blessing for my face and my wallet. The only thing I would switch is the length of the handle but that can easily be fixed by buying one. I actually look forward to shaving again. So I highly recommend going to safety razors.</li>
    <li> Super cool!! I just recently got into the traditional wet shaving, and this was my first razor. I was very happy with the price, quality, and performance. Feels great on the skin, and worked very well on my head. No cuts at all the very first time I tried it. For the money, I would highly recommend trying one out.</li>
    <li> Last year I purchased this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend.  He absolutely loves it!  He has used it ever since.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me this as a gift when she took a trip to London. At the time, I thought double edge razor where a thing of the past (My grandfather used to shave with this I thought). It did look elegant and nice so I thought I give it a try...Of course I cut myself all over my face but I did like the fact that it was sharp and it would cut clean (when I wasn&#x27;t bleeding). After 2 shaves I got the hang of it and I&#x27;ve never gone back to disposables. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this before, wasted so much money the MACH 1, 2, 3 who knows what number they&#x27;re on right now. I recently bought 100 blades here on Amazon and they came off to a few cents each! UNBELIEVABLE...The razor came with 10 MERKUR razors that you can use 2-3 times (with my kind of use). Christmas time came and I knew exactly what to give my father for Christmas...he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 years after using the razor, the top part where you screw the handle to came off. The screw itself came loose. I&#x27;m sure is because I would leave the razor in the bathroom where the moist eventually got to the screw part, the chrome itself is impecable still, is just the screw..I tried to fix it with a vise, etc. and if works for a few weeks and it came loose again. I was ready to buy another one when I tried emailing MERKUR asking for the replacement part. It was hard to find out who to email, no website for MERKUR, I ended with the parent company (DOVO) and I emailed pictures of my issue and they replied telling me the replacement part was on the mail already FREE of cost. This is after years of use! I was amazed! I&#x27;ve written facebook about it and I thought writing a review here would be a good idea. Their customer service went beyond anyone&#x27;s expectations with me. I&#x27;m getting ready to gift another one soon! Best present for a man that uses disposables. Go green with MERKUR!</li>
    <li> my partner loved it - perfect gift for him to go with all the accessories  . . . .  .</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! My husband is obsessed with this little things. He used to get a really bad rash after shaving, lots of angry red bumps and now nothing! Amazing value for money, great looking and good for the environment, every man needs this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that there is only one setting but it does the job for me as I am female so I don&#x27;t need to shave facial hair. It&#x27;s perfect for shaving legs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Merkur. If you&#x27;ve used them you know their reputation for quality; if you haven&#x27;t, do yourself a favor and start. this is my second Merkur - the other is the long-handled version - and both provide an excellent shave. I won&#x27;t go into a safety razor/wet-shaving discussion here except to say that if you haven&#x27;t gone that route yet you owe it to yourself - and your face - to try it. This is a nice piece of quality gear that will help make a believer out of you.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to switch to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without too much facial hair, I never gave shaving much thought. I needed something simple that just got the job done. I started with Mach 3, then went to the Fusion which are both pretty decent. The price of cartridges always seemed ridiculous though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had held back on Merkur&#x27;s because I had thought you needed the full setup — badger brush, shaving creams and soaps, razor stand, etc. etc. I thought I had to take more time in the morning so that I wouldn&#x27;t cut myself in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. You can keep it simple still. Just shower, shaving cream, and water is all that&#x27;s needed. Fast as any other method for me.</li>
    <li> What a difference!  I sincerely didn&#x27;t expect shaving to feel like a whole new experience.  All I can say is FINALLY a close shave without irritation!  No nicks and no dreaded razor burn. This might be the finest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  On the down side, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have let my girlfriend know how amazing this razor is... long story short, I&#x27;m going to have to order a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more thing... At nearly 3 inches, the &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; handle feels really short in my hand but the weight of the razor adds a very nice balance. I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion for quite a few years now (that handle is about 4 inches) so it&#x27;s just going to take a bit of getting used to. I really don&#x27;t mind though, I&#x27;ll never go back to multi-blade razors.</li>
    <li> I finally ditched the expensive five-blade razors that are so popular in favor of this classic safety razor. It has a really nice weight to it, allowing for great control, and replacement blades are much, much cheaper than buying cartridges for a popular razor.</li>
    <li> It seems very solidly constructed and it&#x27;s working very well. I do kind of wish I got the longer-handled version that is almost the same price but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. It&#x27;s elegant, economical, and provides a great, pleasurable shave. You are not a real man if you don&#x27;t have this razor. Multiblade disposables are cheap crap.</li>
    <li> Holds a razor and shaves. What else do I need. Good price, sturdy, and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Forget 3-, 4-, or 5-blade razors. The refills get clogged and cost a small fortune over time. Get back to basics: a shave brush and a classic safety razor. I&#x27;m glad I did. I love my Merkur!</li>
    <li> this safety razor is really durable, well made.  offers a clean close shave that gets my face oohh so smooth.  handle a bit small,but you are informed about it&#x27;s dimensions prior to buying.  i plan to use it for years to come.  thank you</li>
    <li> seems better for my face, especially my neck. the multi-blade monsters were causing breakouts and irritation. This razor seems to help now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. Use a variety of blades to determine which one works best for you, with some quality shave cream or soap and a brush. makes me feel much better for the day.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest way to shave. I was tired of paying $32.00 for cartridges. This is awesome! So much nicer than the expensive razors.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, and I must say I am very impressed!  At first I was surprised how small it was (for comparison it&#x27;s about 3 inches shorter than a 4 blade Gillette Fusion) and wished I had gotten the longer handle version instead.  But, I soon realized it&#x27;s easier for me to shave under my chin with a shorter handle so I&#x27;m happy with my choice.  I get a notably closer shave with this razor than I ever have with any 3 or 4 blade &#x27;vibrating&#x27; disposable razor.  It does take me longer to shave in the morning, but it&#x27;s much more enjoyable with a safety razor and I actually look forward to it.  I still keep an electric razor on stand by for a quick sloppy shave just in case I&#x27;m running late. For the price, this is an excellent razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to traditional wet shaving and was looking for a good safety razor to start with.  The Merkur Classic Straight Razor (33c) came highly recommended on numerous shaving forums and websites.... boy, am I glad I chose it!  It&#x27;s beautiful to look at and performs its function perfectly.  I love the way it feels in my hand, small yet sturdy.  Even though it&#x27;s a 3 - piece razor it&#x27;s a cinch to put a new blade in.... When I used Mach 3 razors I could never get a smooth shave without the accompanying irritation, every time.  I even switched to the Dollar Shave Club to save money and had the same problems with their razors.  Not so with the Merkur Classic; switching to a safety razor was one of the wiser decisions I&#x27;ve made in life.  It only took me 3 shaves to get a baby smooth shave without a single nick.  I now look forward to the zen-like experience of shaving, rather than simply viewing it as a chore to get through as fast as possible.  In short, I&#x27;d recommend this razor to anyone, especially someone like me who may be new to the world of safety razors.  Take the plunge, get this razor, and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I like old fashion products that are still more convient that new age plastics, this is a perfect example and it gives him a much better cleaner cut. He says the learning curve was easy, it&#x27;s not even been three months and the product has almost paid for its self. He doesn&#x27;t get ingrown hairs any more, and only a few cuts that heal quicker because when he is cut it is a cleaner sharper cut (not one of those three blade hacks). He highly recommends!</li>
    <li> This thing is great if you are looking to make the switch from disposable razors. Personally if i had to do it again i would go with the longer version because holding the razor might be easier. This version is rather short and if you have larger hands it could be difficult to hold on to. It’s super easy to change out the blades too.</li>
    <li> This is a 3 piece razor which makes it a pain in the ass to change blades. Well...not that bad, but not nearly as easy as a 2 piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the razor is nice though and it feels good. I get good shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would get the Merkur 34c 2 piece. Same handle and easier to change blades.</li>
    <li> I shaved w/ plastic disposables all my life until recently looking into safety razors as an option. Previously I would feel stubble from shaving w/ plastic disposables appear by noon time, but my shave would look ok in the morning. When I switched to this I instantly felt the difference after the first shave and didn&#x27;t feel any stubble until at least 6 pm. Its a world of difference. I can use one side of a blade about 4-6 times before switching to the other side which calculates to almost 1 blade every 2 weeks. I purchased this razor w/ the Merkur OEM pack of 30 blades so by that calculation I should be set for a year or close to it. I will probably get a sample pack of other blades to try when I get close to using these up and may possibly switch, but so far the OEM blades are working great. The razor itself is solid and looks like it will last forever. You can see and feel the quality in it as soon as it is in your hand. They are usually sold at The Art of Shaving retail store for in excess of 50.00. Its the same razor here for almost half the price. Well worth the investment. It will probably be the last razor you will buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my wife, and she loves it.  I have the Merkur 180 Long Handle, which I feel fits larger hands a little better.  Solid construction, if you are thinking about getting into DE shaving, or need a replacement, you cannot go wrong with a Merkur razor.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so short but don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think its still a great razor. I get much better shaves than with my old pro glide.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing how we literally go from something so amazing as this to literally a 25 blade &amp;#34;high-tech&amp;#34; thing-a-ma-bob that just leaves you with rough skin, ingrown hairs, and is such a pain to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People look no further, here is the true 21st century swiss army knife Classic Safety Razor. Cost efficient and is something that just adds to the manly male testosterone ego that we have. A definite plus to have for every man.</li>
    <li> Love this razor!!!&lt;br /&gt;Had a old safety razor it would cut your face all up!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not this one, has a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Made very well,this razor will last along time!!!</li>
    <li> The product review website called The Wirecutter recommended this as the best single-blade razor holder.  Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s actually true, but I&#x27;m completely satisfied with its performance and it looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> This is what a razor is supposed to look like.  And this is how a shave is supposed to be.  It&#x27;s not as hard or dangerous as you might think.  And you will get a nice, comfortable shave with a minimum of fuss.  All the attempts to get gunk out from between your multi-blade razor?  No more.  The expense of those space-aged blades?  Reduced by over half.  And when you shave, you will feel you have a substantial thing in your hands, one meant to last, with a simplicity and elegance that is hard to beat.  That makes it a great way to start your day.  So when you are ready to go back to the safety razor (or to try it, if you never have), this is the razor you want.</li>
    <li> Like any male with a beard of wrought iron who shaves on a regular basis, I&#x27;ve come to realize the amount of money I spend on razors approaches a dollar figure that resembles the auto industry bailout loan. To trim down on the cost, I decided to try a new approach, and invest in a different razor. This purchase was the result of a desire to cut down on cost, and it&#x27;s been a tremendously effective move. Sure, the initial investment seems costly, but consider this: If you buy the Mach turbo&#x27;s in bulk at Costco/Sams/BJ&#x27;s Wholesale, you&#x27;re spending as much as this razor, and a pack of 100 razors from any number of reputable companies. The difference? You spend less in the long run (and, if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve spent a fortune shaving a face that could be used to smooth out Lincoln&#x27;s features on Mr. Rushmore) It&#x27;s also been a welcomed move; a smoother shave, and an end to the cash hemorrhaging from my wallet was so cheering, that I rubbed my face all over the celebratory steak I bought with the savings. If you&#x27;re wondering, there was nary a complaint from the steak after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has been great. It feels great in the hand, offers tremendous control, and is easy to use. I have no complaints at all with this product, and would strongly recommend it to anyone who has no previous experience with a safety razor. If your primary concern is fear of cutting yourself, let me assuage your sense of hesitation: I have no prior experience with a safety razor, and have never cut myself with this product. Just remember that you don&#x27;t need to apply pressure. It&#x27;s a simple contact-and-glide. In fact, this changed my shaving experience from one of purely mechanical perfunctory actions, to one where I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy the shave. Give yourself a little luxury with the savings, and buy some pre-shave oil, a decent badger-hair brush, a worthwhile shaving cream/soap, and see how big a difference this makes for you. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used. Great price. I use this razor with Feather blades. Great combo!</li>
    <li> Great razor. Made very well looks great and also gives nice shave. One word of advice GET THE LONG HANDLE. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. Gets a real close shave and the quality is top notch. Very heavy and durable. I will use this for years to come</li>
    <li> I find that it&#x27;s not aggressive enough for how close I like to shave so it requires me to make a three pass shave to get that smooth feeling required.  I&#x27;ll never throw this razor out, even with 5 others in the drawer, as I think it may out live me.</li>
    <li> This is a well crafted precision shaving instrument-great for all around use. Feels just right in your hand. Easy to clean and change blades.</li>
    <li> Great product, but too small. Very sharp and nicely wrapped in the package. The item arrived very quickly and exactly as it was described.</li>
    <li> better shave, better experience, better value, with the right blades got my price per shave down to 8cents per. never going back to disposable razors again... except for my balls, not much can be done to get around that one.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this as a gift for my best friend, as I had totally missed his recent birthday. I got him an entire setup, actually. And while I have an Edwin Jagger DE89 personally, and LOVE it, I decided he might like this German made beast. Looking at reviews, it seemed 50/50. People either love it, or they find it cheap feeling. And The listing picture kinda made it look a little less than superb, but I took a leap and got it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let me say...nothing I have seen or read prepared me for how nice it is. Sure, the nickel plating is not as super smooth as the chrome on my DE89, but that is really only the case on the handle and the underside of the head. The top of the head, where it touches your face, looks IDENTICAL to the quality of the EJ. I really can tell no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;The weight is actually about the same as well, maybe a touch more. Yet, it has a slightly shorter handle, and about 2/3 the thickness.&lt;br /&gt;As for loading the blade...it is effortless. I almost feel like it would be easier than my Edwin, due to the way it is made. Yes, it is the same design, but it just feels like it is a bit more of a workhorse than something I would feel terrible about scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very fine piece of functional art. I was skeptical of Merkurs before, but now I am 110% sold on them. I almost want to keep it...but it would be a shame not to share it. And the price is such that getting another for myself would be totally justifiable. I highly recommend this for a first razor, or a good daily. You just cant beat it.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and this has been a great product.  Slowly converting the entire family to DEs with these bad boys.</li>
    <li> As my first safety razor, I&#x27;m very pleased. My only complaint is that the handle seems a little short, but then again there is an extended handle version.</li>
    <li> I will only simply say that this razor is indeed a classic and works wonderfully.  I love it.  There are so many reviews on here that will tell you what you need to know.  I just recently transitioned to this style of shaving and have been very pleased with the results.  I&#x27;ve never used any other safety razors, so I can&#x27;t compare, but people seem to recommend this one as a classic choice to get started and I can say that it works and is made well.  Do your own research into the art of shaving and enjoy.  It&#x27;s a whole new world.</li>
    <li> What have I been doing wrong all these years? I&#x27;m almost 20 years past my university graduation and I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette line of razors since then. Boy do I feel RIPPED OFF. I purchased this Merkur safety razor along with the &amp;#34;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count&amp;#34; for a whopping $38.09. That&#x27;s $6.32 more than an 8-count of the Gillette Fusion Proglide replacement blades. Shaves just as close--if not closer--and the ROI is ON POINT. Would definitely recommend this combination to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I wanted a closer shave. The quality of the razor is good. My only complaint is I don&#x27;t get the clean shave as I get with the double and triple edged blades that I own. Buy the afternoon I feel stubble on my face, or is it possible my beard grows that fast?</li>
    <li> This product is great. Its a bit different than my old Gillete Pro Glide but a good different. Gets a closer shave at a much lower over cost. At first its a hefty sum but over time I&#x27;m going to save a ton of money on blades.</li>
    <li> Great for thick beards. Rinses and cleans easily. The short handle allows for versatile angles for shaving in small and large hands. The construction is durable and solid. Once hold this product, you know it will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I like being clean shaven each day, but the experience of using the multi-blade disposable razors is painful, and I started skipping days to let my face recover. That would make things worse as the multi-blade disposable razors are poorly designed and clog with hair, further aggravating my face. This razor is great. I shave every day and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve been rubbing my face down with sand paper.</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking and effective razor. It also saves you a bunch of money over time. The only down side is it&#x27;s hard to shave in some of the smaller/intimate areas using this razor. I still like it though and am going to continue using it for everyday shaving.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> I inherited this razor from my brother. It&#x27;s roughly 3 years old. I polished her up, brand new, no nicks, screw mechanism works perfectly, no \\&quot;play\\&quot; in the threading. no chrome deterioration. Excellent build. Been shaving with it now for a few months and having tried other razors, I gotta say it&#x27;s a great product. It&#x27;s a great razor for a newbie. three piece design, perfect length for me. I dislike really long handles. shorter handles seem to give me better control. However I do wish that this razor was a bit heavier so the weight will help the blade more. I find myself using a slight pressure when my blades get a few days old. overall very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve been shaving worth a cheaper safety razor and i had to be extra careful not to nick myself to get an ultra close shave and even then i would nick my neck.  This razor however is so much better.  It must hold the blade differently as to make an ultra close shave. I diameter nock myself and found that i don&#x27;t have to be so precise in my shaving angles.  This is as easy to use as a 5 blade yet gives a closer shave.</li>
    <li> The mercur straight razor is very well constructed and easy to use. It cleans up quickly as well. It&#x27;s balanced nicely and I have not gotten nicked or cut yet.</li>
    <li> Very good quality but is more difficult to replace the blade than the Schick I used earlier in life. You have to remove the entire head of the razor to replace the blade instead of twisting it to open and close the head. I am still satisfied with this product mainly due to the quality and balance of the razor.</li>
    <li> Just started using the Merkur about 3 weeks ago.  So far I like it.</li>
    <li> The design is over a hundred years old.  Newer razors do a better job but at a much higher cost per blade.  Still, you can buy a lot of blades for the price of this one.  If you&#x27;re going to buy it, get the longer handle version</li>
    <li> This razor brings back memories of borrowing my Dad&#x27;s razor forty five years ago. It delivers a nice smooth shave without the gimmick of multiple blades. I purchased a pack of ten blades from the local grocery store for $2.99 as compared to 14 multi edge cartridges for $45.99 at BJs. If I had it to do over again I would choose the longer handle for a better fit in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would prefer the shaving head to open like a clam shell to facilitate easier blade changes.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Classic is the word. A beautiful piece of your manly arsenal that has stood the test of time. It is perfectly balanced to let the razor do the work for you, so just guide it over your face without pressure. I love the merkur razors with feather brand blades. You&#x27;ll have a shave like no other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a great entry razor for the newbie and a great option for the expert safety razor shaver. Gift or personal purchase, you&#x27;ll be happy!</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I chose it after looking at the reviews.  That and I tend to lean towards German made products for certain things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a nice weight to it is seems well made.  It is easy to swap blades on the head.  Simply use the appropriate care when handling razor blades.  I have had the device for two months and it still retains its shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives are that the head slowly seems to come unscrewed over several uses, but a quick twist puts it back in place.  It is minor, really.  Also, there is a longer handled version that is available that I might have preferred.  While I have gotten used to using the short one, I wish that the handle was just a little longer.  I&#x27;m sure this is by design, but for some angles of shaving, an extra few millimeters would be welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quality razor.  I recommend it to anyone looking for their first safety razor...maybe the longer one though.</li>
    <li> Before getting into wet shaving with a safety razor I did a lot of research on what kind of razor to get and I eventually settled on this one and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I like the control and versatility that the short handle gives me and the razor has a good weight and doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable to hold.  The only thing that I would do over again is actually going for the heavier HD version of this razor as I think having the feeling of something a bit weightier would help.</li>
    <li> Sixty years ago I was taught to shave using a double edged razor-this was just after WWII so German made products were not widely available. All through college my Gillete and a pack of razors, the sort where one could store a used blade in the back, were my mode of shaving. And then the whirl wind of Norelco was upon us and for whatever reason I followed the throng to the electric razor. Oddly, I never felt it did as well, was a mess to take with me particularly as I worked overseas where the current was different, and apart from a certain design aesthetic, wasn&#x27;t as good as what I&#x27;d abandoned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I shaved my head, just got out the clippers and peeled it off but...it wasn&#x27;t smooth, the electric left a 400 grit feel so, looking through things abandoned, I found my double edge. Then read an article comparing various brands, discovered Merkur, and their excellent blades, ordered it and haven&#x27;t looked back sense. Standing in my bathroom wratpped in a towel, one foot on the toilet, a steaming basin of water, a badger brush whipping up foam, the firsst shave, the second shave, the peering deeping into the mirror to see if I \\&quot;got &#x27;em all\\&quot;. The pleasant smell of the foam, the water, it&#x27;s part of being a man. And Merkur is the best safety razor I&#x27;ve ever tried. Okay, I admit it, I strayed and tried some others but their razor and their blades are tops. You can spend more but you won&#x27;t bet any better. It&#x27;s Merkur or I&#x27;ll grow a beard.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to since it&#x27;s the first safety razor I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I can however compare it to a dozen other shaving methods I&#x27;ve tried.  I have extremely sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to ingrown hairs.  Waxing, depilatory creams, and every other type of razor have either caused razor burn or not been close enough to make my legs feel smooth.  This safety razor is great though.  I used it with several different brands of blade and the Feather hi-stainless blades seem to work the best. Very easy to clean, and as simple as the design is, I&#x27;ve used this thing for pretty much every nook and cranny -- better, closer shave than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  There are some places you just REALLY don&#x27;t want razor burn.</li>
    <li> My Dad owned one of these years ago and I lost it during one of life&#x27;s many &#x27;moves&#x27; and as I started rebuilding my vintage safety razor collection (for both collectors reasons and my ones for my own use) I was a little hesitant to buy this based on some of the reviews both here and on other &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; sites.  Here&#x27;s my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly well made, balanced and hefty little razor that gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve every had.  It is a mild razor; non-aggressive and almost identical to the Gillette Tech of old.  I find it to be a bit smoother pull and more forgiving.  I&#x27;d have to try to nick myself if I did it is so gentle.  I have a full face and neck beard, medium-heavy and do a two-or-three way shave to get a perfect shave and that&#x27;s what this razor does with out any irritation or burn at all.  Remember that the blade is as important to this as the razor; but a good shave starts with a good razor and this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and am pleasantly surprised at the price.  Weather your first safety razor or your 100th: Buy this razor, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Perfect finish, fitting, balance and weight.  Add a feather razor blade and you&#x27;ll never look back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving since 1969 and stared with the two razors my Dad gave me; a Gillette Super-speed and a Gillette Tech.  Both were great razors and lasted years, gave me great shaves.  In the mid 80&#x27;s I tried the new cartridge razors and honestly never liked them; neither the quality of the shave or the item.  I switched back in the early 90&#x27;s and have never looked back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the disposables, a few electrics, and a straight razor. While I have large hands and was concerned the short handle may be an issue it has not been. I found I prefer it over the others I have used.</li>
    <li> I wear extra large gloves and this razor is small in my hands, the handle is comparable in size to  an average tube of chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;i was going to return it becuase of this and order the long handle version, but after a test shave  i found it just to good to send back,  it glides acroos my face easily  and  removed my thick stubble. the included merkur  blade did an acceptable job as well.</li>
    <li> After about 7 months I feel the need to update my review. I should start off by saying it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the baby smooth shave of a straight razor. However I do like it much better than any electric or Mach 3 shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use merkur DE whenever I am short on time or traveling. It does a decent job after 4 passes. It will not give a perfect baby smooth shave despite the skill of it&#x27;s user. For a better DE shave, the blades would have to be angled better, such as with Merkur&#x27;s higher end models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about this one, is its simple solid construction and connivance. It is unbelievably cheap to buy replacement blades compared to the Mach 3 series. A years worth of blades should cost under $10. I&#x27;m sure if I bought higher quality blades (not from Walmart) it might shave a bit better...but I only use mine as a backup 2-4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that newbies should be very careful with this one. Use extremely light pressure by hold the end of the handle. I&#x27;ve bled myself far worst with this \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot; than with my straights. Also remember short strokes going once or twice over the same area and use 4-5 separate complete passes (lathering in between) stroking up/down/left/right (order in important, although I usually leave the upward pass till last)</li>
    <li> Super nice and back to basics....!!! Plus a hell lot cheaper than the gillete mac products ;-) !!!</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these for a couple of years and got this one for my son.  They are very forgiving for the new shaver and very comfortable for anyone.</li>
    <li> Having only shaved with cartridge razors or electric, this was my 1st safety razor and it&#x27;s incredible.  I was mortified that my first shave would result in blood everywhere, but I didn&#x27;t even get nicked once!  I used the included Merkur blade, which was really easy to plop in.  The weight and angle of the razor is perfect, leaving me no second-guessing if I have the right angle or pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is shorter than I was expecting, but I don&#x27;t have enormous hands so it&#x27;s not really an issue at all.</li>
    <li> Alright, so many have said the handle is too short, true (there is a longer handle model available), but nevertheless, this is an amazing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first foray into safety razors, and I am incredibly impressed, I can never go back to regular razors (whether they have 4, 5, or even 6 blades!). My skin is quite sensitive, and this Merkur Safety Razor (using Merkur blades) leaves me with no irritation! I never thought this could be possible. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Really fantastic shave! Better then 3, 4 or 5 blade razors by a long shot. I would recommend the barber pole model over the short handle. If you are new to safety razors, read up on proper skin prep as it makes a big differnce in the quality of shaving.</li>
    <li> The only shave that&#x27;s closer than a safety razor shave is from an old-school straight-edge &amp;#34;cutthroat&amp;#34; razor. And I can speak from experience that those things are best left in the hands of professionals. Beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a classic design, made of very high quality stainless steel, and is heftier than it looks. It&#x27;s not a cheap knockoff - not in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this along with a 100-count box of Personna double-edged blades (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0077LAJT2/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11) and combined, it&#x27;s a superb shave. Please note, gentlemen, that it&#x27;s a lot harder to nick yourself with a razor like this. But your grandfather used one like this, and if it didn&#x27;t make him look good, you wouldn&#x27;t be here. Follow the logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, something that&#x27;s not a complaint, just an observation. The handle on this razor is significantly shorter than the zillion-blade cartridge razor you&#x27;re probably used to. See attached photo for comparison. That, combined with the weight of the steel, means you&#x27;ll have a (short) period of adjustment. But you&#x27;ll quickly learn that the short handle is intentional - you&#x27;ll get better balance and control of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a classic shave, this is the way to go. I&#x27;m not saying this as post-icon retro hipsterism, but simply as a dude who enjoys a good, close shave.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a better shave, give this a shot!  It&#x27;s a little different than using the others, but you&#x27;re face doesn&#x27;t feel as irritated (at least mine didn&#x27;t)</li>
    <li> In my line of work I have to be clean shaven all the time, every day. The 5 blade wonders gave me terrible burns and rashes around my neck and felt horrible, especially after the morning PT when the sweat would get inside the open pores and cuts. So I began using a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Gillette safety razor for the past month to great results. It was a 1970 was product which I used with Rite Aid blades. It was my starter. It worked great. But finally I decided to upgrade, and the Merkur blew it out of the water by ten fold. Although I think that it may be the Merkur blade that came with the razor that is doing the job rather than the safety razor, it remains to be seen next week when I go back to my Rite Aid blades. (after I exhaust that supply, I am definitely buying Merkur razors!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love this product. It has a solid feel to it and carries weight in the handle. But, I must say that it looks a little rough; as if it was mass produced on the assembly line without being &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; by a person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend it to anyone considering wet shaving. Awesome product, awesome shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I decided to cut shaving costs at the beginning of this year. I heard Merkur was a reliable brand, so I eventually bought this one on sale. I will never go back. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing like using one of these razors. After a small learning curve, (and honestly I have still never cut myself after 2 months, going through several blades) this razor will really improve your look. Nothing beats this classic feel, and it shaves so well, you will never settle for anything less again.</li>
    <li> Perfect weight, nice solid construction. It is a comfort to use and will last a long time. So long cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a few months now and I absolutely love it. I honestly can&#x27;t wait to wake up and shave in the morning. When I was using cartridge razors, it was a chore and I couldn&#x27;t stand the process/feeling. Wet shaving completely changed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using the Feather &#x27;Popular&#x27; de razor and I had no problems whatsoever. If you&#x27;re looking for a great razor, whether you are new to wet shaving or not, I highly recommend it. Despite it&#x27;s light weight, it gave an excellent shave. I will definitely continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I decided to get the Merkur Classic (33c) is because I wanted something a little more solid and durable. The Merkur is an excellent razor that is extremely well crafted. It gives a slightly more &#x27;aggressive&#x27; shave than my previous Feather &#x27;Popular&#x27; razor, but not much. I was considering buying the Merkur 34c HD, which is a very popular razor, however I didn&#x27;t feel like spending the extra money for a slightly heavier handle. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t want anything heavier than the 33c. The weight and handle length are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an excellent all-round razor, I highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this razor daily and I continue to get excellent shaves. In all honesty, it doesn&#x27;t shave that much better than my Feather &#x27;Popular&#x27; razor. I am still relatively new to wet shaving (started in May of this year), however I quickly realized that there&#x27;s no such thing as an &#x27;entry-level&#x27; or &#x27;beginner&#x27; safety razor. This razor shaves just as well as a so-called &#x27;aggressive&#x27; slant or open-comb razor. Take your time, use a blade that works for you (Astra is my favorite) and use minimal pressure and you&#x27;ll get a great shave.</li>
    <li> A bit of a learning curve</li>
    <li> I bought the Merkur razor to save some money, which I have. But I did not expect the razor to make my face feel so much better than using a more contemporary razor. I have been able to find products that have are great for the face and have saved me money. I would highly suggest the Merkur for anyone looking for a superior product than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; everyday razor.</li>
    <li> Works great looks even better. Beats all those expensive cartridge shavers I&#x27;ve been buying for years .</li>
    <li> Once it came to the point that I had to take out a second mortgage to pay for five shaving cartridges for my modern, state-of-the-art shaving system, I decided it was time to make a change. My late father used nothing but a safety razor all of his life and if it was good enough for him, it would be good enough for me. However, I had no idea about brands or selection, etc. So, I did some online research and selected the Merkur. It has a good heft to it and I learned that for a good shave, you let the razor&#x27;s weight glide on your beard. It cleans easily, but almost too easily. The reason for only four stars is that the twist handle to open the top comes loose a little too easily; like as your shaving in the shower. Perhaps, it is just the one I have and I&#x27;m sure the company makes a fine product.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember - if you haven&#x27;t shaved with a safety razor before, depending on how often you shave, it can take 2-3 weeks for your face to become accustomed to a safety razor. Forget the styptic pencil. See if your local pharmacy carries Dermatol powder (or a similar product). For the little cuts that you&#x27;ll get (and you WILL get them!) a dab of the powder on your cut will congeal the blood. I also highly recommend shaving in the shower and use a boar&#x27;s hair brush and shaving soap. Smooth shaving!</li>
    <li> Just got this bad boy and man it is awesome. A real close shave, nice feel (kind of short handle but that&#x27;s fine). Been using this with the shaving kit and aftershave I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)&lt;br /&gt;Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And works like a charm. No more spending tons of money on Gillette again.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. The skin on my face is extremely sensative and doesn&#x27;t care to have the triple blade action of some disposable razors dragged accross it. So, I gave the Merkur Classic Safety razor a chance and was amazed at how close of a shave I got without the skin irritation. Keep in mind that investing in a good pre shave oil, shaving brush, lather, and alcohol free after shave is a plus for sensative skin. Take your time with this razor as it is easier to cut yourself with a single blade than multi blade razors. I&#x27;d say it added about 2-3 extra minutes to shave time. To sum up, great product, close shave, and saving $$ in the long run on blades. Cheers!</li>
    <li> Overall worth the money. However the handle is a little short for me. also its somewhat difficult to shave up close to your nose area. But woth the money.</li>
    <li> Great razor - easy to use, clean, and replace the blade. My only desire would be an easier way to take it a part (and its actually not hard to take apart as is), screwing and unscrewing can be a bit annoying and tedious if you want to take it apart mid-shave to clean it out. I much prefer this razor to the Gillette razors - saves me a ton of money and I actually think it gives a nicer shave.</li>
    <li> The Merkur Classic Safety Razor is the worst razor I have ever used the past 50 years.  Nothing compares to this piece of crap!!!  Don&#x27;t buy it you&#x27;ll be sorry!!!  The top of this finely German engineered product will not stay connected to the handle.  Amazon should be ashamed for selling this defective product.  I threw mine in the trash after the top fell-off and injured my foot.  I can honestly say that this product is the worst example of German engineering.  The connection between the head and the stem is almost a criminal act; in addition, I wasted money on purchasing others products (100 razors, 10 shaving soaps, top quality brush and shaving mug), for my worst clean shaving experience.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT IT&#x27;S A SCAM!  I gave it a one star rating because that was the lowest rating available to use.  This razor deserves a minus five stars!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent, well crafted safety razor. It is solid and a little on the heavy side—perfect for shaving. It comes apart easily for cleaning and blade replacement. I am very pleased with this Merkur.</li>
    <li> Good razor but I would opt for the long handled one instead</li>
    <li> Very high quality and a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take more care and practice to get right though.  Not nearly as forgiving as a modern razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for all of the smooth areas and then pull out the Gillette Fusion for my adams apple and other harder-to-shave areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not great for precise shaving around facial hair.  I use the Fusion&#x27;s back edge for that.</li>
    <li> After almost a year and 10ish other razors, the 33c is a great versatile razor</li>
    <li> From what I can tell, this is a good safety razor.  It feels solid and heavy in my hand but not unmanageable.  The cap unscrews somewhat awkwardly and your natural &amp;#34;unscrew&amp;#34; grip will slice your fingers up on the blades, so be careful.</li>
    <li> The Merkur 33c Rocks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is absolutely the best razor available on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what makes the 33 C the best razor it&#x27;s mild disposition, which means the razor is more forgiving, which is great for beginners, as well as advanced safety razor users, who don&#x27;t like butchering their face., unlike other razors this razor won&#x27;t tear apart sensitive areas of your skin and even after multiple passes leaves no razor burn. Furthermore the construction and design is phenomenal. The knurling on the handle makes it so easy to grip. This allows you to have a confident grasp and not to worry about water or shaving cream causing your hand to slip. I&#x27;ve heard people complain about merkur&#x27;s finish and quality but the 33 C is outstanding in this regard. The plating is flawless, and the 3 piece razor fits together seamlessly. another advantage is that the razor is smaller and fits well in your hand, the heft is solid and grants a confident feel in your hand, neither too heavy or too light.if you are looking for a beginning razor, choose this 1. It&#x27;s more gentle then the HD model, and the Edwin Jagger 89.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this razor daily, and absolutely recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor.  The parts are heavy and seem to have a great finish that I can see lasting for many years (fingers crossed).  It is made with three pieces and the threading seems very good.  My only complaint is that the handle is a little on the short side for my taste.  Quality product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband whom has a persistent issue with razor bumps and ingrown hairs on his face.  The concept of using a straight razor type contraption was a little scary to me but after reading the reviews and trying everything under the sun to cure his issue, he was persistent on this purchase.  He has used the razor twice and has had no major issue with razor bumps or ingrown hairs,  Previously, when he shaved his face it would feel irritated and burn afterwards.  That has not been the case with this razor.  He has mentioned several times how much he likes the razor and how easily it glides over his skin and has recommended I purchase one for myself.  I would like to mention that he purchased this with a shaving brush and paste/cream (Proraso Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol) and I think his good outcome in a mixture of the 3.  The razor itself if very sturdy/durable and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for months now and it&#x27;s fantastic! No more stupid, plastic disposable ones that make me feel like a sucker for spending money on something that is mostly trash..why? WHY? In this world we need less trash not more.&lt;br /&gt;Annnnyways, just so you know I am female and find this razor fantastic for legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses the same razor for his face and both of us think it&#x27;s a big improvement over the old disposables we used to get.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the blades you use are a big part of it. We use the Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge with this razor.(also available on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;But since this is a razor review I won&#x27;t go in to that. The handle is a wee bit short but it&#x27;s fine, I like that it&#x27;s pretty compact actually. Fits my hand well.&lt;br /&gt;It easily unscrews to put new blades in, for cleaning etc.&lt;br /&gt;So far it is living up to it&#x27;s stainless steel reputation and is staying lovely and shiny and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that if you&#x27;re not used to using a razor like this just go slow at first, use caution, the blades can be shockingly sharp compared to the standard disposables.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve nicked my ankle a few times when I wasn&#x27;t careful making sure the handle was screwed on tight enough to ensure a proper lock down on the blade. If you don&#x27;t have it screwed snugly the blade has a larger gap between itself and the outer metal covering and that can be a hazard. It only took a nick or two for me to be extra careful. :D&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the same as a standard multi blade disposable thingy razor but I love it. Using this type is not only going to save us a few dollars but it eases environmental guilt of tossing an entire disposable away or even just the plastic encased disposable blades...the metal blade needs tossed after a week or so of use (it&#x27;ll vary for people and their needs obviously) but I feel better about tossing a wee small bit of metal than some plastic into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh another note, it&#x27;s important to use plenty of soap and heat the blade in hot water to get a smoother shave for the face etc.br /&gt;Oh another note, it&#x27;s important to use plenty of soap and heat the blade in hot water to get a smoother shave for the face etc.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with this brand two years ago, and never will I put the plastic thing to my face again. I sometime don&#x27;t shave for a week and the safety razor does not pull it cuts the facial hairs and most of the time I shave with three passes sometimes two. This model the handle is thin and on the small size. Great for traveling</li>
    <li> amazing for first time safety razor user!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and much appreciated by the recipient</li>
    <li> This is my first razor that I have bought for D/E (double edge) shaving. It is a decent razor for the money. I found tha handle ot be a little small for my taste. I would recommend the long handle model myself, but this got the job done. I would recommend watching some Youtube videos before you use it. I recommend &amp;#34;Method shaving&amp;#34; with it and keeping the  strokes light and the skin tight. all in all a decent razor for the money. I think I may buy a more expensive one later but this one is good.</li>
    <li> This is well built, simple and clean. It has some weight, but not annoyingly so. It isn&#x27;t super fancy, but very functional. It does look and work well, however. Very german.</li>
    <li> Sturdy construction. Beautiful design. I use astra platinum razor blades and I have never had a closer shave. I highly recommend it over the regular disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Got this razor as a gift and they&#x27;re very happy with it. Less razor bumps. Very sharp blade, works very well, but they also did cut their finger open pretty badly.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, but after reading a ton I decided to go with this one. It&#x27;s a really good razor if you don&#x27;t have hands like Shaq, or like to hold the razor close to the comb. After a couple of months, I have Feather blades in this baby, haven&#x27;t cut myself once and I am getting the best shaves of my life. It really didn&#x27;t have the learning curve I was expecting. I may get another razor later down the road, but right now, I am very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor.&lt;br /&gt;My son and I both have Merkur Safety Razors. This is Great brand which is easy to use and change the blades. It also comes with Mekur blade which is also very good . I was a little concerned when I saw some of the reviews for some of the cheaper brands. Glad to say, my face is happy I chose a Mekur and it gives a really close shave as well.&lt;br /&gt;Buy online and save money.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  Saves a ton on shaving costs.  I love how it&#x27;s so simple yet so awesome and functional so many years after its initial design.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that he razor would be adjustable, but it is not.  It provides a good shave if you are a match for the single setting.  In the razor&#x27;s defense, the description does not indicate that it is adjustable.  I would recommend spending the extra money and getting an adjustable one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s day. He really likes the razor and can&#x27;t wait to use it. It&lt;br /&gt;was perfectly represented and was exactly as I thought it would be. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Well built and good weight. The size of this model is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Works and looks great.  Well balanced and just the right sixe for my hand.  travels well too.</li>
    <li> This razor, my fountain pen, the cast iron skillet I bought to replace my 3rd Teflon coated skillet; I&#x27;m starting to see a pattern, some of the older tools that have survived the test of time are far superior to their modern counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never owned another safety razor so I can only really compare this to my father&#x27;s cheaper razor that&#x27;s made of cast zinc and my Mach3 cheese grater.  There&#x27;s not going to be much variation in safety razors, some tighten from a knob on the bottom and some can be adjusted.  This one is a simple no bells and whistles design where pretty much nothing can go wrong, you unscrew it at the neck and it comes apart in 3 pieces.  I&#x27;ve tested the metal of all 3 parts, it is indeed stainless steel and is manufactured with the precision and quality of craftsmanship and metallurgy I&#x27;ve come to expect of German made tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t lose it somehow, this is no doubt going to be one of the tools I&#x27;ll use and own my whole life and will be passed down to the grand kids among other tools when I&#x27;m in the ground.</li>
    <li> I switched from spending a fortune on blades using a Gillete Fusion. Don&#x27;t waste your money anymore! Switch to this and get some blades at roughly 40 cents per blade!</li>
    <li> Everyone who posted long comments on DE shaving, THANK YOU!  For the first time since my teens I can shave comfortably without all of the post irritation.  After you buy your razor from this point on it is cheaper too.  You can get a years worth of supply of stainless blades for 1/3 the cost of a weeks worth of gilletes best.  My skin looks much better, I shave more and I  do look forward to shaving now.  The only question is, why did I wait so long to try this method?  Why is the newer shaving products, that are so popular, rougher on your skin?  Don&#x27;t fix it if it is not broke!  Old school is the way to go when shaving your face.  You do not have to spend an arm and leg on a good razor but keep in mind some of the cheep ones are cheep.  My roomate has $75 one that weighs the same as mine and is made out of the same material.  Some are even more expensive.  Do not let the pretentious DE shavers convince you that you need to purchase all the pricey stuff but do your research because there really is cheep stuff that doesnt last.  For example an alum block is an &amp;#34;alum block&amp;#34; no matter who makes it.  You can spend over 10 dollars on one and feel special like some of these wackos on these DE blogs or you can find one for a dollar somewhere and have the &amp;#34;exact&amp;#34; same thing.  Pay more attention to what people are putting in the shaving soup than who makes it.  You can spend $6 dollars on soup or over $50 because you want to pretend you are royalty but you are going to get the same shave as long as you pay attention to the content.  I did a lot of research and payed attention to what everyone had to say.  Merkur is pure quality and this specific one was the lowest price.  If you take care of this product you can plan on having it for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t offer me the extra close shave I heard others talk about, but it works well and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. The razor is easily disassembled for cleaning and blade replacement, and it&#x27;s very sturdy and solid. I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far, and don&#x27;t expect any in the future, either.</li>
    <li> Dad loved it, he has always liked old fashioned razors like this.</li>
    <li> A bit short but really great quality.</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor. More balanced and a better grip compared to my previous Edwin Jagger razor.</li>
    <li> Great safety razor. The gap is very small so its not as aggressive as some safety razors. I prefer this as I like to move fast when I shave.</li>
    <li> Very good razor for beginners.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaver. I&#x27;ve used disposable and electrics shavers over the years, but I found this to be a better alternative. Unlike the previous products, this one gives me very close shavings. Of course, this is coupled with the razor blade, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the results and am sticking to it.</li>
    <li> Great starter handle.  This was my first safety razor and I have nothing but great results.</li>
    <li> Love the weight and feel of the razor in my hand.  The non slip handle helps prevent accidents.  Easy to change out blades.  The simplicity and quality make it a great razor.</li>
    <li> Great double edge safety razor.  Next purchase I&#x27;m going to try their 34c heavy weight model but I love this one too!  A note on wet shaving with double edge safety razors: Whether you just started shaving or you&#x27;ve been shaving for years, I suggest you use safety razors instead of any type of cartridge razor.  Never, ever, ever again will a cartridge razor touch my face.  Even if a cartridge/disposable has only two parallel blades it&#x27;s hard on your face.  And then these cartridge razors with three, four, and even five blades are worse.  The way cartridge razors work is the first blade cuts your beard hair and pulls the folicle up in the process.  That&#x27;s not a problem per se but then along comes the second blade (and perhaps the third and fourth) a milimeter after the first blade and cuts your hair that is still pulled up.  The hair then retracts back deep down in your folicle.  When it grows (because it&#x27;s been unnaturally cut) it grows into your skin instead of out of the folicle and becomes an ingrown hair.  The ONLY reason we have cartridge razors is because of mass marketing/advertising so companies can sell &#x27;cheap to manufacture&#x27; cartridges but charge whatever they want, and make it necessary for you purchase them over and over and over again.  But the blades for safety razors are just pennies per shave.  PLUS you get an &#x27;off the charts&#x27; better shave.  You&#x27;ll get a much closer shave with a safety razor as long as you use it the proper way.</li>
    <li> It shaves me, but it keeps cutting my face.</li>
    <li> Very nice, works much better than the last safety razor I had. This is the kind where the head screws completely off in 2 pieces and a razor is placed between them and screwed back together. Very pleased so far!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Merkur safety razor as my first entry into the world of double edge shaving. I have been using it for a few weeks and I am pretty happy with it. I chose this model because I wanted something basic, with a classic design and from a reputable manufacturer. This razor seemed to be a good first razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I would like to note is that it comes in a cardboard box... not something that is useful for daily storage. You do get on Merkur blade along with the razor... A nice surprise. Also the part number for the razor is not 33C (90-33-001). I am assuming that it used to be that and it is an equivalent to the 33C, but the latest Merkur razors have different part/model numbers. Everyone still calls this razor the 33C though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this razor a good once over when it arrived. Overall it looked very well manufactured. I noticed a couple of very minor irregularities in the chrome plating, but not on easily visible surfaces and nothing unexpected for a $35 razor. There was also a slight inconsistency in the textured portion of the handle. About 1/4&amp;#34; of the texturing closest to the head was not exactly the same as the rest of the handle. Nothing glaring, but just a slight inconsistency. Just as an FYI, when you look at the Merkur product lineup many of the razor heads look to be the same design. So you are more or less just paying for handle shape, weight and design. This is not the case with their Futur and Vision razors or the slant blade models. Those are different animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as use goes it has seemed to work well. I won&#x27;t comment on shaving quality since I am new to this form of shaving and I think there are a lot of other factors such as soap/cream use and blade selection that play into the whole equation as well. It does feel good in your hand. The handle is short if you are used to modern razors. Also, with this being a three piece design you have to be careful when changing blades since you have to hold onto the head to unscrew it. Another thing is that the blades are not only exposed at the cutting edge. They also extend beyond the sides of the razor. So you really have to excercise caution when grabbing the razor head from any of the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with the purchase. Just a basic, well-made razor in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Gives a very enjoyable shaving experience. I&#x27;m glad I switched from disposables.</li>
    <li> Excellent German quality razor. I don&#x27;t think you can find anything better. After a year of use I would probably buy the version with the slightly longer handle because it helps with the razor-to-skin angle. Don&#x27;t buy any of those junk Chinese razors.</li>
