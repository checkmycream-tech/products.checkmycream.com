<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not as powerful as other similar tools. it was not that great a product honestly, the trimming mechanism has a lazy speed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really glide over skin and hair very well.  It tends to grab a lot, making it very difficult to achieve a smooth shave,</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave close enough</li>
    <li> Just got it and works great and fast.</li>
    <li> It does not work. It makes noise, but it doesn&#x27;t remove hair. What a joke. What&#x27;s the trick?</li>
    <li> I suppose it does ok if you are in a pinch. It certainly removes hair and painlessly, but I still feel a little stubble afterwards... certainly not silky smooth like I expected.</li>
    <li> Like the light. Non irritating</li>
    <li> Poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;Does a very poor job of removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;Battery needs to be replaced after an hour of use.</li>
    <li> I received this item and was so excited because I&#x27;ve had two of these before and loved them. That was not the case with this item. It does not work AT ALL! Do not buy!</li>
    <li> works great in a pinch</li>
    <li> Darn it! You still get stubble that&#x27;s irritating :(&lt;br /&gt;Shaves like a charm, no hesitation.</li>
    <li> Its a knock off nono yall just change the name to yes find your own idea</li>
    <li> I was not the least bit impressed with this hair remover.  It is quite flimsy and does not make the job easy.</li>
    <li> It doesnt do much it irratates my skin  not a good product i t doesnt do much  I was not happy wth it and I still have</li>
    <li> This worked on thinner hair but not well on thicker hair. The blades wore fast.</li>
    <li> A girlfriend recommended the Finishing Touch Lumina Lighted Hair Remover.    1. The light never worked.  2. It &#x27;buzzed&#x27; for a few seconds, then went dead.  Waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of buying a \\&quot;similar\\&quot; tool from CVS that literally fell to pieces.  This is the best of it&#x27;s kind and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else except online.</li>
    <li> I actually saw this product 1st on one of the home shopping channels as I was flipping through.  It was selling for $15 + $6 S&amp;H.  I was excited when I found it on Amazon for under $10 with free shipping, so I decided to give it a try.  The product needed assembly, and there were no instructions as to how to put the blade on.  There were instructions for installing the battery and for the adaptors, but not the main blade.  It was well sealed in clamshell packaging, otherwise I might have thought I had received a previously opened product.  After snapping it together, it was so flimsy that I used tape to hold it together.  The light did not work, and it pulled the hairs instead of cutting them which was painful.  Kudos to Amazon for the way they painlessly handled the return of this worthless product, especially since it is a personal care item.</li>
    <li> Does the job and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> The light doesn&#x27;t work that well to show what you are actually doing.  The shave is not close, but does get rid of bigger hairs.</li>
    <li> No issues, worked well</li>
    <li> finishing touch is a great product for removing small amounts of unwanted hair. It is a great compact size easy to store and clean and the light comes in handy. Just be very gentle with it and it should last long. :)</li>
    <li> This product works great! I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews at all! I&#x27;ve had one of these before and it lasted forever so this is a replacement one from three years of using the other one. Love it! Just follow directions, make sure you clean it out and enjoy!</li>
    <li> If you have previously  used a hair remover of this type and were disappointed with how poorly it worked you shouls be pleased by this one.</li>
    <li> This is a so so product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Panasonic ES2113PC Trimmer. I purchased a Finishing Touch Trimmer at a local drug store and used it for a year before I misplaced it and replaced it with the Panasonic via Amazon.  I am so glad I did.  I didn&#x27;t think I could expect much from a product like this and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  The Panasonic includes an alternate razor blade, two guards of different lengths and a cleaning brush. The most important thing, though, is that it does a better job with less work and well worth the extra few bucks. It shaves closer and quicker with better blades and a faster motor.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected - loved it.</li>
    <li> it is very easy to use and removes hair quickly. it serves its purpose well. it is also easy to care for and clean.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these about 2 years ago, and needed to replace it.  The new one worked for about 30 seconds, and after replacing 4 batteries, still no go.  Look at some of the other reviews on this product, and you will get the drift. Go to Walmart or Rite Aide and bypass this lemon!</li>
    <li> The product was new in the package.  The light on the product works, but the product will not switch on.  The batteries clearly are not the problem because the light works, but the razor does not.  I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a dollar store quality shaver.  The light never worked and the attachments don&#x27;t either.  Not a good system for facial hair removal since there is little control and it is a SHAVER.  You don&#x27;t want to remove facial hair this way.  Stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> I received the hair remover and am glad to have it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product it did not perform as it stated it would it left scratches on my sons neck, it doesn&#x27;t cut well at all!</li>
    <li> Loved this as long as it lasted but it broke quite easily.  Bought a second one and that one broke too.  Purchase a different brand for my hubby that doesn&#x27;t have the light.  Works well but not real high quality.</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say that the product is not working right from day 1</li>
    <li> 83 ONE stars from 304 reviews....that is a lot of \\&quot;I HATE IT\\&quot; ratings!&lt;br /&gt;What a piece of junk,every time they change it is for the worse...a horrible tool,not doing the job and  a worthless  purple light.&lt;br /&gt;Have no more words to say....a other ONE star added today!</li>
    <li> My first one broke when trying to replace the blade.  So I bought two new ones, one for home use and 1 for  my purse/travel bag.  Great price in my opinion for a  quick removal of hair on the face.</li>
    <li> Perfect removal tool for hairs you don&#x27;t want everyone to see. Easy on skin.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product, i tried to use it and it barely worked. I used it a second and third time and hair was still left behind even with redoing different spots. Hopefully it will get better with use.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer is awesome.  I love mine and have never had any problems with it.  For quick, detailed work in a small area, you can&#x27;t beat it.  The pivoting head is great for awkward angles, and you can use it with or without the light.  It comes with a removable clear plastic cap, which protects it while you&#x27;re traveling.  The kit also includes:&lt;br /&gt;- A \\&quot;length guard\\&quot; trimmer attachment that slips right over the clipper head and is great for eyebrows and other areas where you just want to trim (but not obliterate) the hair.&lt;br /&gt;- A small brush you can use to clean out the clipper head and the length guard, which you&#x27;ll need to do after each use.&lt;br /&gt;- One AAA battery, which will likely last you several weeks or months (YMMV, of course, but my first battery hasn&#x27;t died yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this trimmer on my face (lip and eyebrows), arms, and other areas, both with and without the length guard, and had no problems or irritation whatsoever.  It really does trim all the hair, not just one hair in 20; you can put it right up against your skin (but not press it in) to get a really close cut.  It&#x27;s SO much better than shaving and doesn&#x27;t give me razorburn or painful bumps.  I can see how other reviewers might say that it pulls, but that only happens if you&#x27;re moving the trimmer really quickly over your skin and it \\&quot;grabs\\&quot; a hair for a nanosecond before cutting it.  You don&#x27;t have to go at a snail&#x27;s pace, but if you&#x27;re just careful and relaxed with it, you won&#x27;t have any pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the trimmer for 10-15 minutes straight each time with no problems.  It has never clogged, and neither the motor nor the clipper head has ever stopped working.  The key is to use the little brush it comes with to clean off the device after each use.  You should also open the clipper head and remove any hairs that may be stuck inside (the directions tell you how to do this), as clogging is likely why many people&#x27;s units become \\&quot;defective.\\&quot;  The light on mine works great and has never gone out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few minor downsides to the device.  First, it gets absolutely covered in hair while you&#x27;re trimming, so occasionally you need to shut it off for a few seconds and brush off the clipper head.  Second, the trimmer does leave the tiniest bit of stubble; unlike shaving, which can cut the hair just below the tip of the follicle (sometimes creating bumps and razorburn), this trimmer can only cut the hair already *outside* the follicle.  So you&#x27;ll never get that perfectly smooth-shaven feel.  Third, it doesn&#x27;t trim a lot of hair at once; the actual clippers are only about an inch long, so it&#x27;s best suited for small areas of detail.  Fourth, the motor makes a loud buzzing noise, similar to a cheap vibrator.  All those downsides are minor; but combined, they take one star off the overall rating, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is small, lightweight, and easy to travel with.  I got mine at a local drugstore and am very pleased with it.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive yet effective shaving alternative for sensitive areas.t.

    <li> Good product, but a bit hard to use &amp; time consuming. It does keep the hair away for awhile though once removed.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Finishing Touch about a month ago &amp; was very pleased with my purchase. The price was perfect &amp; it was shipped quickly just as I was told.</li>
    <li> Simple product that does the job efficiently. It will last a year or two with regular maintenance and then it will be time to buy another one. Does the job effectively.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this in the past, and I loved it. Obviously, this is no longer manufactured the way it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get my rogue nose hairs, nor does it do a good job on my upper lip. I have to go over and over the same spot, and it does not give a close cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use road often, but I do use it. It&#x27;s nice, just go slow our it pulls a bit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for one pretty much just like it that I have had for years but the battery was going down.  I think I could have replaced the battery but since a new one wasn&#x27;t expensive, opted for that.  Love the light and the tilt.  Plus it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer does a decent job of removing hair, but it&#x27;s not fantastic. The only reason I purchased this product is because I will be having surgery soon with an external leg fixator, and will be unable to shave with a normal razer. This will cut leg hair decent enough to where other people can&#x27;t see it, but don&#x27;t expect it to be silky smooth after shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job on trimming brow hairs.  It&#x27;s best on the really fine hair that you frankly, don&#x27;t really see anyway...it&#x27;s only there on a magnifying mirror in some lighting.  So, for the hair that it does get, yay :/</li>
    <li> for what little the wife has used the product, she loves it and it does all that they say it does.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I feel like the light hurts more than it helps.  I can barely with it.  Maybe if I tried shaving in the dark?</li>
    <li> This is by far the best personal groomer I have ever used! It is perfect for sensitive areas that you don&#x27;t want to use a razor on. The eyebrow attachments are great and the pivoting head really helps. I love this groomer and I recommend it to everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;2012 Update- I&#x27;ve had this now for just over a year and it still works wonderfully! It&#x27;s running off of the original battery included which is amazing since it&#x27;s used every week by both my husband and myself. My husband really likes this groomer because it makes quick work of shaping up his facial hair without any knicks to his skin. If this ever does burn out I will gladly replace it with the exact same model because you cannot beat the quality and performance for such a small price!</li>
    <li> I am so please I bought this item its the best little Lighted Hair remover i have ever bought , its great , I have been pleased with every thing I&#x27;ve bought from Amazom .</li>
    <li> I have used these hair removers for a long while to &#x27;neat up&#x27; my husband&#x27;s beard. They remove excess hair in even small areas of the face very efficiently. I wouldn&#x27;t be without them!</li>
    <li> It works well on the face and the hair does not grow back thicker. I use it on my upper lip. The down side is that it doesn&#x27;t get a close enough shave, so you feel the stubble right after using it.</li>
    <li> Wish the tip was just a little smaller so that I could access my eye brows without worrying I was going to shave my whole eye brow off.</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s the item I ordered. Replacing my old one.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for years and it was dropped and broke.  So I ordered this one from Amazon.  It arrived quickly in good condition and works great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> Literally fell to PIECES in my hand. The pivoting was the worst after a few pivots it fell into about 5 pieces.Buy the Conair they last &amp; actually work!</li>
    <li> It works, but not as well as an old-fashioned Bic razor</li>
    <li> Loved it no more lip waxing with pain easy to use just the right size. Recommend to anyone who finds lip waxing painful</li>
    <li> Great for removing blond peach fuzz.  I have always been fuzzy and this little tools does wonders for taming my \\&quot;little blond beard\\&quot;!  For people who want to feel a smooth trim I recommend buying some of those hair removers that look like sandpaper and go over where you trim the fuzz.  Takes about 30 seconds and eliminates the prickly feel.</li>
    <li> I have one and needed another.  The item is well worth it.  I already have one but needed another.  They shape your eyebrows nicely and take away unwanted hair on toes and top of feet.</li>
    <li> This is a lifesaver gadget you must have! Does Great job on facial hair that crops up. Once over and it&#x27;s gone. Easy to carry with you (size of a pen) So much easier than trying to pluck with tweezers!</li>
    <li> I previously had an old one but it broke. Happy to have a nee one.</li>
    <li> It seem to pick up the fine hairs around my lip.  I advise to take your time in using this product and use a facial cream after using it.</li>
    <li> This utensil comes in very handy.The light on it will probably show you more than you really wanted to know,but that is why it is so effective.Quick trimming and easy clean.</li>
    <li> Mine, too, either has no light or the light doesn&#x27;t work.  Looked all over the product and do not see anything that could be a light.  Disappointed but not worth the trouble to send it back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different electric shavers from various brands that they sell at drugstores and places like that (ranging from $20-$50+) and they all seemed to break really fast or not work right, so when I saw this, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, ut fully expected it to suck. When I tried it, it ended up working much better than expected! It it more of a trimmer than a shaver and you may have to go over an area a few times to get all of the hair, but it&#x27;s not bad. The attachments didn&#x27;t work worth a crap though. I found the shaver worked ok on the small patches of fine hair I have on my face (though wax works better) and it was great for my bikini line! I think the best thing about this is that so far it hasn&#x27;t pinched or cut my skin at all when using it, so I feel comfortable using it in sensitive areas...nicks and pinches were my biggest issue with other shavers. FOr the price, you can&#x27;t expect amazing quality or a super long life, but it does work!</li>
    <li> The Lumina Hair Remover gives a smooth shave.  I use it on the face for hair removal and it&#x27;s an excellent nose hair shaver also.  It doesn&#x27;t catch the skin as you glide it over the face like another brand I had.  The main problem is the noise.  My other small shaver was silent.  The Lumina rattles and clicks and it&#x27;s very annoying.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to sound like that or if it&#x27;s a defect.  How would I know?</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
    <li> Not all that good will not buy again shipping was fast but not what I was looking for does not trim all that well so will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Am disappointed because I wanted a lighted hair remover.  It&#x27;s not worth the trouble sending it back just because of the light not working, though.  The remover works adequately.  I had another hair remover similar to this that I purchased from QVC that I liked much better.  Unfortunately they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing tiny shaver for small places.  I am a repeat buyer; the last one lasted for three years. I bought one  for my entire family as it removes nose hairs, chin hairs, lip hairs, ear hairs and can be used daily or weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Te  price is less  the cost of a razor which is not as convenient and safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy several as they are just bigger than a pen and can go in your carry on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product. I would recomend it to everyone It would be a great Christmas gift for men and women</li>
    <li> I used to use the smooth away thingy for the face( I only remove the sides of my lips) and it worked fine but the friction dried and irritated my skin. And plucking was too painful and I did NOT want to end up with the nasty side effects of shaving it. (Super black coarse hair blah blah) so I bougt&#x3D;ht this at walgreens hoping it would remove the entire hair. It didn&#x27;t its like a razor! I still saw tiny stubble and I had to remove it with my smooth away thing   -____-&#x27; WASTE OF MONEY! I may use it on the bikini only. AND the heads were worth crap. With them on it didn&#x27;t remove any hairs!</li>
    <li> The Lumina Lighted hair Remover is a terrible product. The Battery (for operation) never made contact...so it didn&#x27;t work.  A piece of the plastic broke off, It was a waste of money. Don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> Only worked for a few months.</li>
    <li> I like this because it is quick and easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not super fond of it. It works moderately well on finer hairs but anything coarse it doesn&#x27;t really do much on and leaves stubble, so you have to shave over it anyway which kind of defeats the purpose I feel. It&#x27;s also very loud for being so small.</li>
    <li> Well, it has a light and it pivots, but not much else. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> this will not cut hair as smoothly as a straight razor, but does exactly what I expected.  size is perfect</li>
    <li> Does not shave hair very well</li>
    <li> Light didn&#x27;t work from Day One; battery power offered little to no juice to the unit, making a continuous job nearly impossible.  Once it began shaving the eyebrows, it \\&quot;stalled\\&quot; so I had an uneven line.  Made of plastic and very cheaply assembled, truly a waste of $10.00.  I packed it up and will return tomorrow!!</li>
    <li> At first this little Lumina was okay.  But the little motor in it doesn&#x27;t have that much power to it.  It didn&#x27;t take long for the head to get dull either and there is no way of knowing or finding out where to get replacement heads for it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product before and since I liked it I bought another.   The problem is the edges on the latest one I bought are sharp and you really have to use it carefully.</li>
    <li> I used this both on my face and all over my bikini area (and I do mean ALL over, including the inner folds, if you catch my drift) and it did a fantastic job getting rid of the hair, left me feeling near-silky smooth, and no rash of bumps, which I always get with depilatories or a traditional razor.  Plus, you can&#x27;t use those last two methods around your \\&quot;inner folds.\\&quot;  Like a previous reviewer, I&#x27;ll be buying another to keep in my bag.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d use it around my eyebrows, though.  I think I prefer the control that plucking gives in that area.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this I love it and so do my mom and daughter!!</li>
    <li> not as good as the originals</li>
    <li> Horrible product. I bought this product because it was supposed to be effective in removing hair, and safe on sensitive areas. Needless to say, it did none of that. Let me review what I did:  1) Try product with attachment head: \\&quot;wow, this is painless. I love this product. Oh wait...it hasn&#x27;t removed a single hair.\\&quot;  2) Try product without attachment head: \\&quot;Ouch! This thing really hurts! Oh wait...it&#x27;s only removing 1 in 20 hairs\\&quot;  3) Fling product at wall and watch it shatter and smile, because you&#x27;ve realized that you got what you paid for when you bought a product &#x27;as seen on TV&#x27; for $10.  Avoid this product at all costs!</li>
    <li> The tip/razor broke while I was trying to take the cap off (within the first minute of being opened).  And I was&#x27;t able to fix it.  Shoddy.</li>
    <li> I have been buying products from Amazon for years but this is the only one that was really a waste of money. Description indicates that it \\&quot;removes hair\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;but it is actually a razor or it would be if it shaved any hair.  It does not \\&quot;remove\\&quot; or shave hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Buy a disposible razor, it is cheaper and it actually works.</li>
    <li> worthless - save your money</li>
    <li> Worked well.  But died within 2 uses.  Try something else.</li>
    <li> Came slightly dismanteled in the packaging but it&#x27;s not worth it to fight for it at the price, I just won&#x27;t be buying anything else from this maker!</li>
    <li> I was given one of these for Christmas and I&#x27;m not impressed. It&#x27;s a cheaply made product that falls apart easily. I&#x27;m not sure what the appeal of this item is, ok it may be helpful to quickly shave strays in between your eyebrows, but that&#x27;s about it. If you use this to shave your facial fuz like they show on tv, you will get stubble as you would with any other shaver. It sits in a drawer and I&#x27;m sure it will fall apart soon just by doing that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pink. Not that I&#x27;m ashamed by that or anything, it&#x27;s just hard to explain myself when I use it. It&#x27;s not as powerful as I thought it would be either.</li>
    <li> Only does a fair job of shaving off the fine hair. Seems like the cutting surface does not stick out far enough so that you have to really press hard against the skin.</li>
    <li> it works fine but the light did not work and I did not want to take the time to send it back. But it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> It is ok, but not the best !!</li>
    <li> The product broke as i was opening the package, do not waste your money! Its made of some cheep plastic that cannot be repaired what a waste of time</li>
    <li> Save your money.  Not only is this useless as a razor, but why pay for batteries, when you get better results with a bladed razor.  The great thing about the light, it really shows just what the razor failed to do.  Even if I was only trying to cut one particular hair, the light showed me it was clearly still there.</li>
    <li> I use this for my eyebrows, the weird hair on my toes, and my bikini area. It is completely painless and it takes the hair off beautifully. I wouldn&#x27;t go a summer without it. I have extremely sensitive skin, and if I use a razor on my bikini area, I always end up with painfully itchy red bumps. Using this product virtually eliminates that. I might still get a few bumps, but nothing like I get from shaving. My fiancé uses one too, for trimming his facial hair. Trimming, not shaving. It doesn&#x27;t really work on large areas like arms or legs, but it&#x27;s great for smaller, more sensitive areas. It is completely painless; never once was it painful, and I have been using it for 6+ years.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well as I hoped.</li>
    <li> This product did not do a thing for me.  I had to keep running it back and forth over my skin and finally it took off a few hairs.  I was not impressed</li>
    <li> This little trimmer is excellent for those problem areas where you don&#x27;t want to use a razor.  It is efficient and does the job.  I can&#x27;t say that the light adds much value, but as a trimmer, this one works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care what the infomercial claims, this thing is NOT an \\&quot;hair remover!!!!!\\&quot; I can&#x27;t believe  the positive reviews on here! It is a razor and I do not think it&#x27;s a good idea for women to shave their fine facial hairs as it will make them thicker. It is better to pull them with some wax or tweezers. Also, the light does not even work. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth what I paid, but no more. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the flashy extra features, they just distract you.   To be fair, it does what it says. But if you&#x27;re looking for a close, smooth shave, don&#x27;t get it. I know that it&#x27;s for trimming, but it&#x27;s not for anything heavy duty. It was best used on my eyebrows, and guys might find it useful for sideburns, etc.  Bottom line: if you want a smooth shave, put down more money to get something better.</li>
    <li> The product Finishing Touch Lumina Lighted Hair Remover arrived in a short period, well packaged and with additional parts.  I was pleased with the result.  H. Bloch</li>
    <li> Good...functions well...I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is OK but blade does not stay sharp enough and you have to buy the whole thing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; No where to buy and replace blades unless I just don&#x27;t know how</li>
    <li> I bought the original version (without the light) about a decade ago and it worked very well, but finally fell apart when my daughter started using it. We bought 2 of this new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; version and it doesn&#x27;t clear a single hair away. At first I thought the batteries were just dying. But I&#x27;ve put in 2 new rounds of brand new batteries and the thing barely functions. Useless. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I use this in my bikini area and it&#x27;s great.  Gives a really smooth shave without nicks or burn.  I would highly recommend.  It&#x27;s better than waxing.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money Does not cut thick hairs I am dissapointed better off with a&lt;br /&gt;razor I am going to try a ladies shaver havent done that yet</li>
    <li> I love this product I have used this for a number of years this really works well for removing facial hair. The finishing touch arrived way ahead of schedule. I highly recommended this. I would and will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have received the order today I am happy because it was  excellent and  I have used it in front of my mail box and i reaily love it&lt;br /&gt; thank you so much</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Just make sure you open it at the top and clean it out every once in a while. I owned one before and the little light went out early on but it went on working for a good while.  I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to make it easier since my eyes aren&#x27;t what they  used to be. It works great.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of this type of product and nothing compares.  It is the best hair removal for women out there.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Piece of junk only lasted a few months- the Conair I had before it lasted a lot longer. I threw it out and bought a Remington personal trimmer.</li>
    <li> recieved this and starting using it but the light didnt work, i re read the instructions and it still didnt work.  i guess the light was only a added feature.</li>
    <li> This product worked great at first but after a few weeks it just died.  The batteries were good and I even tried replacing them.  Use the $10 towards something that will last.</li>
    <li> OK but not great.  This one is bulkier than the one it replaced and therefore is harder to use. Also the on switch is very touchy.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a few months now and I still love it.  The hair does seem to grow back softer and it really does grow back slower.  So much better than tweezers and a lot less discomfort.  No red areas such as I got from the waxing, even cold waxing.  It is much more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t worked as well as I had hoped, but it is fair quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase</li>
    <li> left my facial hair still, and I did it a few times,  Paid for junk !!!</li>
    <li> Thank you and arrived safe,, on time and it works fine. Used once so fare and pleased as it works as it was stated.. ease of ordering</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Finishing Touch for years with no problems.  When it broke I bought this newer model and it&#x27;s just terrible. I contacted customer service and she told me sorry for the inconvenience.  She didn&#x27;t even try to claim that it might be defective, so therefore no offer to replace it, no solution whatsoever. In other words, the product is junk so it&#x27;s performing exactly as expected.  What a ripoff.</li>
    <li> I had this product about 5 years ago.  It performed great but&lt;br /&gt;broke after 2-3 years and I did not see it offered anywhere&lt;br /&gt;until recently.  Now it works great again and I guess the wait&lt;br /&gt;is to see how long it lasts.  At least now I can find a place&lt;br /&gt;to replace it.</li>
    <li> It works really good. I like it!!!!! Does what it saids it does!!!  More more words!!!!!!! DUH DUH that&#x27;s ll</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on this product before I bought it. It&#x27;s great for the price and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s great for traveling. I have had no problems and love the lighted pivoting head. For the price, it&#x27;s a very good deal.</li>
    <li> it is good for fast jobs.</li>
    <li> Waste of one&#x27;s time and money and batteries. Shaving accomplishes the work, this product sucks.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, not as strong as I thought but it helps on those &amp;#34;hurry moments&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Not a smooth finish as advertised.</li>
    <li> Item is a waste of money hate it</li>
    <li> I want to buy a couple more of these - while it goes through the triple AAA batteries it still works better than any other I have bought.  I am a facial hair removal freak! and this really works - it isn&#x27;t like waxing and I have gotten rashes from facial wax that doesn&#x27;t work.  Those wirey black ones - you&#x27;ll still have to use the tweezers - but I have not found a product - even wax that gets that!  I get more hair with this than wax!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Came with a battery. Easy to use and to store away.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> i have purchased many of these little shavers.  works perfectly for facial hair and little touch ups to any part of the body that you want a clean, smooth look.  a small investment with a big pay-off.  these make great stocking-stuffers!</li>
    <li> Tried using this and after the first time I tossed it out! I used it specifically for all over my bikini area and it pulled and yanked my hair out...Ouch! Definitely would NOT recommend this item:(</li>
    <li> this thing is cheap so if you have a huge problem with facial hair or whatever, you should probably invest in something more professional but if you just have some stray hairs or peach fuzz you&#x27;d like to trim, this is perfect. i have even used the smaller tip to trim some nose hair and it worked well. it is quick, easy, and painless. don&#x27;t count on it to take care of anything dark and thick though. it will cut it, but leave a huge stem and then you will just have a huge amount of stubble.</li>
    <li> I had the [[ASIN:B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer, Pink]]Finishing Touch trimmer and I loved it until the blades got dull, so I thought I would try this one since I was at the store and it was so inexpensive.  Well, it&#x27;s cheap.  Cheaply made, it fell apart out of the package, I rigged it back together and it didn&#x27;t do a good job, not like the Panasonic.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin nearly as smooth, it does trim the hair, but tugs it sometimes as well.  Not a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before and use it on both myself and mom to get random hairs.</li>
    <li> What a dud. I bought this at a store. Worked twice, then died. The light comes on, but no motor. I previously had a Noxema trimmer that lasted YEARS but that isn&#x27;t available any more.</li>
    <li> This product works quite well if you use it right. Many people are having a problem getting replacement blades. They only have to call toll free 1-888-769-7676, and order 3 replacement blades for $2.99. I was told there are no shipping charges.</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these and neither one of them worked.  I originally bought one about 2  years ago and it worked great but the new one didn&#x27;t do anything.  would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t trim hair as much as I would have liked. I have yet to figure out how the trimmer piece can fit and work. The head doesn&#x27;t pivot as much as I thought it would. Overall, I like it. I wouldn&#x27;t plan on using it to trim eyebrows since the trimmer head didn&#x27;t work for me. Still have to shave, but it&#x27;s a good alternative when you don&#x27;t have time to shave.</li>
    <li> it works and it&#x27;s painless. it arrived promptly</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife and she is pleased with it.  Newer than older model and works better.  She had Parkinson&#x27;s so this makes her trimming job easier to use and do.  Pleased with unit and shipper.</li>
    <li> My husband and I had the original finishing touch shaver and always said it would be great if it included a light for doing the inside of ears and noses... and voila! here it is.  It works great and is very useful.</li>
    <li> The battery ran out of juice the third time I used it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if this item was good or not, it was broken when I opened it.???? I didn&#x27;t report this so it is a gone deal.  t</li>
    <li> I bought this since I&#x27;m pregnant and I wanted something so I could go over my female parts easily to tidy up since shaving is more risky due to me not being able to see. Mine kept losing power. I threw it in the trash. I&#x27;m just going to pay to get waxed instead at this rate. At least then I don&#x27;t have to do anything except go lay on a table!</li>
    <li> I like this product from seeing it on TV. I have used this before and I wanted another one for backup.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this since it was so reasonably priced.  It does what I want it to do.  I haven&#x27;t used it a lot yet, so I don&#x27;t know how well it holds up.  But, right now, thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I bought that as recommended by a friend.  It works very good and I will recommend it to another friend.</li>
    <li> The way it is made with the light actually gets in the way if the razor. Hate it!!!!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT. IT REMOVES ALL HAIR W/NO PAIN. I ENJOY USING IT. IT WORKS GREAT IN VERY SMALL-TIGHT SPACES THAT YOU HAVE EXCESS HAIR THAT YOU WANT TO REMOVE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> its garbage...does not trim!!</li>
    <li> I had hoped it would be the trick for a quick little touch up on my chin and upper lip.  The upper lip result is better than the chin.  The razor is still the best tool.</li>
    <li> I have bought several of these as gifts  they last longer  and are very easy to use</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see I bought this a few months ago&lt;br /&gt;and honestly it works but only temporary!! Welli used it on face and I am Hispanic so I do have facial hair and when I did try it on face my hairs grew back like when shaving ! My hairs came back shorter bur thicker!! I found it nice at first but unless u wax use lazer or pull the hairs follicles out they grow back!! I have used bleach and that seems to work better!</li>
    <li> My wife uses it. She is well satisfied</li>
    <li> This is my second Finishing Touch and I am most pleased with it.  They have updated them since my first purchase, approx. 9 years ago!  Thank you so much.  The shipping was quite quick.</li>
    <li> It works well. It does what It&#x27;s supposed to just wish it&#x27;ll get a closer cute. Sometimes the light doesn&#x27;t work as well, which is weird cause it&#x27;s only been used maybe 5 times.</li>
    <li> It works as I thought.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had one for many years and loved it, unfortunately I misplaced it and really wanted another one.  Well they changed the design and this one just doesn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed, sometimes improvements just aren&#x27;t better</li>
    <li> I purchased the Finishing Touch lumina lighted hair remover with pivoting head to replace an older one that didn&#x27;t have those features. Tried it and like it. I don&#x27;t have to use tweezers for hair growth under my eyebrows or on a facial mole. The light is a good plus.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  Not powerful at all.  Very disappointed.  Light quit working second time it was used.</li>
    <li> While my hair above my lip does grow in darker now after the first time using this finishing touch razor, I only have to use it twice a week to keep my upper lip hair free. It is super easy to use and pivots and lights up for even easier use. Plus it&#x27;s completely pain free and runs smoothly over my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve also used it to trim nose hairs and remove those pesky two stubs on my chinny chinny chin. It&#x27;s made me feel more confident and I&#x27;m overall very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself &amp; 12 yr old daughter for facial hairs.  We did use depilatory cream first but chin hair did grow back w/n two days.  Same for upper lip resulting in a very, very stubble of growth.  The Lumina worked just as advertised.  It did not hurt at all and the skin was extremely smooth, no stubble.  You&#x27;ll probably have to do it fairly often but this is simple and fast.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Does not work very well. I have to shake it for it to turn on.</li>
    <li> Works Great. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Broke after a few days.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be hit-n-miss.  Sometimes I buy it works perfectly; other times they go from the package to recycle.  I think it is the nature of the beast, especially at the price.</li>
    <li> great!, i used to have one and it broke, so i am glad to finally get another one, this one is even nicer</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Gets those small corners.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a couple days and then suddenly broke.</li>
    <li> Razor did not move unless you pressed very hard. Threw it away</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut very close to the skin and it sometimes pulls on hairs.  I have had better, similarly priced trimmers.</li>
    <li> Works as it says! Quiet, easy to use, small and discreet.</li>
    <li> Good quality with excellent price&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone is looking for this product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;this will not be my first time :)</li>
    <li> it might work on uncut hair such as forearm, but hair that has been shaved on the upper lip was not removed and that&#x27;s why your product was purhased.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as my old one. Love the light..now I can see what I miss.</li>
    <li> Product works okay. I had another brand before this which I remember worked a little better. I use it only for upper lips. The product didnt come with a battery... usually they include batteries. That is a little annoying because you have to go out for batteries as soon as you receive it.</li>
    <li> Junk, doesn&#x27;t work even a little bit. The light is nice, but the blade does not work.</li>
    <li> It does pull when you using it so it is a little uncomfortable but for the price I needed something quick.</li>
    <li> I had an older one and the blades needed replacing.  So, decided on this one since it pivots and has a light.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This worked fairly well for a short time, working best on fine hairs, but mine failed after a  very short rime, and I thought it rather cheaply made. I think you would get the same results using a regular razor.</li>
    <li> This a first of this type product  for me so far so good ! It does a nice job.</li>
    <li> This little gadget should be in every womens makeup bag. It safely and easily removes unwanted hair. The batteries hold up very well.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very easy to use and very effective result. would recommend this product to all my girl friends</li>
    <li> These are hard to find anymore. As far as I know Amazon is the only place that carries them that I could find. I love mine but it&#x27;s about shot so I needed another. I was so happy when I found this one...it&#x27;s the 4th I&#x27;ve owned an was afraid they had stopped making them. Mine is perfect, don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> This a very nice hair remover, I have bought others but didn&#x27;t have light, and it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> It works, but doesn&#x27;t quite give me a close enough shave.  It does work on my arms okay.  Don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
    <li> I like that there is a light, helps me see the hair on my face better.  Know exactly where to shave.</li>
    <li> These was a gift and it arrived before expected and it works very well and My lady hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it as of yet</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do. I really like the light.This will be an excellent gift to give someone.</li>
    <li> I love it so much, painless, does not pull skin and works on any part of my body. The hair doesn&#x27;t grow fast compared to shaving. I used it for my legs, bikini line and stomach.</li>
    <li> I never got the chance to use it.  It broke as soon as I took it out of the package.  It&#x27;s a very flimsy device.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It went immediately in the trash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so irritated I bought this. It just couldn&#x27;t cut anything I gave it. I had to go and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for one similar to this.  I loved that one and I love this one.  It helps to remove that unwanted facial hair without looking like you shaved and have a shadow following it.  This worked perfectly and I am extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> This little product was a little disappointing and we could not get it to work as good as the tv demonstrations we&#x27;ve seen.  The price was too good to be true and not worth returning.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 of these before and use them until they die. I usually love them. This one had a defective blade and hurt my skin. Not worth the hassle to send it back. Would be thrilled to have the company send me another and would change my review yet I doubt  that would happen since they are such a big company. Win some, loose some.</li>
    <li> total waste of money. Does not remove even the fine hair that is on my upper lip. Does not work at all</li>
    <li> Doing exactly what it is suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;Had one some years ago until it got broken.&lt;br /&gt;So very happy that i got back the exact model.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I use Finishing Touch. It removes peach fuzz easily and what grows back is not coarse or dark.</li>
    <li> This is the only product on the market that can get the areas that need triming. I thought I was buying the one markeded for men , though I would not expect the product to be any different.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item. I like that it has the small light that shines bright. I use this about every two weeks for some small hairs on my chin. This does not irritate my skin at all the light makes them easy to see. Would order this again and/ or recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This product works well.  It is easy to use and takes away unwanted hair.  I would recommend that someone purchase this.</li>
    <li> It did work well on soft, light, baby fine hair but overall I don&#x27;t feel this purchase was worth it for me. Ended up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> Bad bad bad bad qauility , i didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning this item.  It isn&#x27;t working well.  I have to push it together to work, and if I do that, the &#x27;blades&#x27; are uncomfortable.  I&#x27;ve used another brand that works well, and this one just doesn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fell apart, in fact pieces never fit. Trash</li>
    <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve purchased.  Easier than trying to find batteries for them.  Also the blade starts to lose its sharpness after a while which is to be expected.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a great tool for quick touch ups for those pesky beard and mustache hairs that haunt us as we get older. Super travel companion.</li>
    <li> It was delivered loooong after I ordered and I&#x27;m disappointed.  it is easy to operate but not enough steam to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these and they do not work. The blades do not even move. Will not ever buy again.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cut my hair, but it&#x27;s great at scratching my skin</li>
    <li> Im sorry to say that, but its really bad Im not using it.Doesn&#x27;t work like it say it should.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is the best ever! I have tried threading and waxing my eyebrows and it is painful! I don&#x27;t understand people who think of it less than great. As soon as I turned it on, it took off the hair!I LOVE IT! Buy it now!!! :)</li>
    <li> This gently takes care of the fine hair on my face!  I bought an extra for a friend of mine.</li>
    <li> Love it, light is great and does a good job.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in February and know does not work at all. you can bye this product at Walmart for $5.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, also it is very nice on skin. I liked it so much. In addition, the delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> When I  received  this product and took  it out of the pkg parts were already falling off . I had a product like this before and it worked great this one however is not good. The switch that turns it off and on was not on it and when I did get it to turn on by manually switching it without the part. It pinches your skin I am not sure the blades are on it right. Because it is more trouble then it is worth to return it I will just throw it away. Don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
    <li> mi esposa lo usa para sus ejas y le gusta por que no le hirrita la piel....</li>
    <li> this finishing touch is NOT what its cracked up  to be. has hardly any power at all.   maybe ok for traveling. but does not really  do a very good job in removing hair, have to  go the same spot a million times. :((</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong I really like this product, however, it arrived and the light did not work.  I ordered it through gohastings.  It arrived very timely and they were willing to give me a refund if I wanted to ship it back.  I really did not want to wait for another one,  approx. 6-8 weeks, so I asked if they could send me one and I would return the one that I have in the envelope that they provide to me.  They were not willing to take a chance over an $8.99 product.  It seems that when I ordered it that I put my faith in them that they would deliver so I think that they should have put their faith in me that I would send the defective one back when the new one arrived.</li>
    <li> Broke at the top where the hair cutting piece is after one week. Tried to tape it but it&#x27;s not holding it together tight enough.</li>
    <li> Bought this a replacement for the one I had that quit working.  Had it for years.  It is great for small jobs or when you want a quick touch up.  Finishing Touch is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about buying this product but after I received it, I was more than satisfied! It removes hair so effortlessly and the pivoting head definitely is a big help! With the help of the little LED light, I was able to remove the hair on my sideburns, chin, and upper lip with no problems! I decided to test it out on my arm just for the heck of it and found out that you have to be careful with longer hairs or it&#x27;ll snag. I couldn&#x27;t be anymore pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Friend &amp; she was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove Hair efficiently. Leaves behind hair &amp; has to be done over &amp; over to get one spot clear of hair. Ones purchased years ago took hair of arms, chin &amp; cheek easily. This one isn&#x27;t able to change blades as last one purchased. I don&#x27;t know but maybe this is a different manufacturer. Not at all satisfied with product &amp; will look somewhere else for a different model.</li>
    <li> I used to love this hair trimmer until it stopped working after a few months. Changed the batteries, no difference. So, I decided to purchase another one. About a month later, guess what? That one stops working too. Completely shuts down. Don&#x27;t buy it - it&#x27;ll last for a few weeks, maybe two or three months max. You might as well invest in a more expensive option.</li>
    <li> Worked once and then quit.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best of this kind of product!</li>
    <li> This was working fine and then all of a sudden it died. When I opened the battery part to see if the battery was the problem I saw that it made a brand new battery explode inside of it.</li>
    <li> It shaves upper lip to a certain extent; it does NOT remove facial hair (those awful whiskers as women get older) at the root on the chin.</li>
    <li> I love it works grate. I belived it would&#x27;nt work well i belived Wrong!!! I will buy again.</li>
    <li> We all know we as women hate any type of facial hair. This product does not remove facial hair as easy as it advertises. I only used it a few times before I threw it out.</li>
    <li> This product is a real joke.  After several attempts to assemble failed, there was no way to keep it together to function.  A waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Great for hair removal and the light helps you see the ones that you miss</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  IT IS MY SECOND ONE!  MY FIRST ONE WAS PURCHASED SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT JUST STARTED GETTING DULL AND NOT DOING ITS JOB SO I ORDERED THIS ONE!  IT IS A ESSENTIAL IN MY MAKEUP BAG!!!</li>
    <li> I think this is a waste of money, did not work well. But not worth it to send back.</li>
    <li> This works great:) Been using it for a few months and the battery it came with still works. Was a little worried when it started sounding slower but just carefully unlatch the blade cover and blow on it a few times to remove hair that gets caught inside that compartment. My sister tried it but said it pulled her hair. I guess she has thicker hair. I even used this to shave my guy friend&#x27;s toe hair! It was hilarious. He said it tickled but that was his only complaint. My older brother even uses this on his face. I use it mostly on my legs and it still works great:)I&#x27;m very white and most of my fair is blondish and fine.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (if you have fine hair)</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a while ago. I have two daughters who also use it in addition to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it comes with the brush and it&#x27;s easy to take apart to clean the hair that gets inside.  It worked great the first few months we had it. Then slowly it started slowing down so we replaced the battery. We got a few weeks of good use out of it and then it started slowing down again.  Now no matter what its not fast anymore, we spend more time working on our eyebrows and somethings it gets stuck cutting a hair and pinches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I guess I can&#x27;t complain to much, I got my moneys worth. Next time I&#x27;m going to purchase one that I can replace the blades on and such.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does exactly as it describes. Discreetly fits anywhere you need to put it and isn&#x27;t so loud when it&#x27;s on. Worth getting if you need a trimmer</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Love the small size. Easy to store, set up and use. Gave as a gift and it was very well received.</li>
    <li> Its easy to use the hair remover ,i use this to remove just some hair on my face and my upper lip as i dont like waxing much and i like this product ,it wont be painful and it runs on battery.</li>
    <li> This product DOES NOT cut my facial hair!  I had better results with the cheaper one I had previously and will go buy that again.  I don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t work because the blade feels sharp, but when I run it over my cheeks, etc., nothing happens!  I am disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> Got this as an extra for a finishing touch we have for more than 7 years. it fell apart and we have thrown it away. Still using the old one though.</li>
    <li> I like Conair hair removal better.  I don&#x27;t like the LED light on Lumina.  Can&#x27;t find out if I can turn it off.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work so I sent it back!</li>
    <li> Before I bought this I read the reviews that said it only works if you use it right. I read the instructions and practiced a few times, and it still didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  Maybe I could have done more research, like watched videos on You Tube, but I really just want something that works without having to complete the equivalent of driver&#x27;s ed before getting results.</li>
    <li> This is a new design and it does not seem to be quite as effective as the old version.  The white one broke fairly easily, but this one does not seem to do the job as well as the original finishing touch.</li>
    <li> love it and use it at every other month</li>
    <li> works as stated easy to use</li>
    <li> The seller post Finishing Touch Lumina by Finishing Touch for sale, but when I received,  it was Finishing Touch Elite by Idea Village. The Elite is a bad device, it cut only 5 pieces of my bikini hair and that was it, it doesn&#x27;t cut anymore. I contact Amazon for the return and the seller offer me a full refund without returning this junk device. Note that the Finishing Touch Lumina by Finishing Touch is an excellent device for bikini hair remover. I use it for 4 years already and it still cut well without cutting my skin.</li>
    <li> a wonderful little gadgetry pleased wirh it.</li>
    <li> Cannot open the battery pack and looks used as the blade looks dirty.</li>
    <li> Lovev this Hair Remover. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> You cant really see a difference and it doesn&#x27;t vibrate and the blades dont move or anything. It just nakes a large buzzing sound and lights up. You can run your fingers up and down yhe bladeand you won&#x27;t feel a thing! Doesn&#x27;t work for the amount of money.</li>
    <li> I use this in areas when I need to do a quick trim of finer hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well for courser hairs, but that isn&#x27;t why I got it.  I still use it on my eyebrows, though it doesn&#x27;t leave it as smooth as a wax or plucking.  Still, I love this item, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Finishing Tough hair remover that I&#x27;ve had over the past several years.  It works great, is easy to handle and the light is an extra plus.  The price is also right!</li>
    <li> I bought this Oct 2009 and it&#x27;s still doing a great job on my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve roughly packed this several times for travels and it still works! Light still lights, head still pivots and still cuts my hair, not my skin. The short and long hair attachment is perfect for whatever length you like on your eyebrows. I tell all my friends to get this and they&#x27;ve loved it too!</li>
    <li> This product really saves a lot of pain. It works to shave off the light hairs from your lip and other areas you wish to be rid of unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> The concept for this product is excellent. I bought mine at a beauty supply store and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The one I bought turned out to be a cheap piece of flumsy junk. It does not do so well on the courser hair on chin/upper lip, but it does well on the finer hair on the sides of my face. I have to jiggle this thing a few times to get it to even start. When I turn it on, the light comes on but the \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; does not, unless I keep jiggling it for a few seconds. I think they should do some more research and make it a high quality device, but I would not recommend it at this time.</li>
    <li> This works fine,for use on face-between brow line, and  sure is more cost effective then-oh-No-No won&#x27;t go there.&lt;br /&gt;How many people can afford $200 some for the alternative.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used another battery-operated facial hair remover that a friend owned and found it much better than this one, which often requires more than one pass over an area.</li>
    <li> I am surprised by the bad reviews.  I bought this 4 years ago at Bed, Bath and beyond and I have bought replacements at amazon.com as needed.  This little gadget has changed my life.  It is an easy and painless manner of removing hair.  I cannot imagine ever plucking or waxing again.  I have given it as a gift to many friends - they are now hooked.  It is great and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> The light is not very good and the blade does not trim as close as i would like.</li>
    <li> It is not worth the money it cost&lt;br /&gt;No good</li>
    <li> I give this three stars because it was defective. It would work for the first few minute and then it would stop. The only thing that would work is the light. I would have to hit it or time it on and off in order for it to work. However the product does shave painlessly. And I did receive a replacement for the defective one which works just fine.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I never go anywhere without it.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast . The product isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> it is a 5-star for my purpose.  i just wanted it to shave the stray hair that grows too long.  i don&#x27;t use it for shaving per se.  it is not meant for that.  i am not sure about the bikini area.  it might work, i just don&#x27;t know.  i haven&#x27;t tried on my eyebrows either.  i would think it might work there.  i just have the occasional hair on my face that needs to be gotten rid of.</li>
    <li> I love the light, it helps you to see better; that&#x27;s a nice added feature.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Finishing Touch for a couple of years and love the results. Every now and then I think it is giving out but I find that the locking tab below the blade has slid out of the locked position. When this happens the blade hums but won&#x27;t shave. I have attached a photo of the tab in the locked position.  If you have replaced the battery and are still having a problem, check this tab.</li>
    <li> great for removing facial hair</li>
    <li> My father liked it. Kind of tough to clean though.</li>
    <li> i love it so much thank god that i dnt have alot of hair on me u cnt even feel it but u kno that it work i brought mine frm korger had it fo a whit it broke so i wnt an will get the real one with the light so yeah it wrk fo me</li>
    <li> While I like the product, it broke after only a few uses. The light would turn on but that was it... so, I purchased another one.</li>
    <li> It does a good job but it looks cheap. I&#x27;m wondering how long it is going to last but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> It was my mistake to buy this product!!! It claims to remove the hair, but it does not. It is simply just a very cheap type of razor which DOES NOT WORK that well at all!!! Stay away from this product, and any other products of this type. I bought this product in despair to somehow tame my facial hair (I had some very fine hair on my chin and upper lip), but just after the very first use the hair started to appear only much darker and thicker. Before I was plucking only a few thick black hairs on my chin, but after this product I had to start shaving, because the hair on my chin started growing like crazy and very aggressively. Now I am regretting about trying this product, because now I have to literally shave off the hair on my chin and upper lip triggered by this product. And a simple razor&#x27;s blade like Venus works much-much-much better!!!</li>
    <li> This product did not work/turn on.  I tried to return it but there was no sales slip or shipping information available to return it so I am out the money for it.</li>
    <li> Ok, but not spectacular.</li>
    <li> I bought a lumina before. It lasted at least a year. When it got old, I bought a generic one. It fell apart in less than a month. This original product is gentle and well made. When it gets rough to your skin buy a new one, so it won&#x27;t irritate your skin, as any old product might. Buy this product. Don&#x27;t share it, it won&#x27;t last as long. The reason not to share from a practical standpoint is: how coarse or fine another family members facial hair is not the same as yours.  2nd review-I bought a new old lately. I like it better, here&#x27;s why. The original white one can give you the nubs like a a man so it is better for your nose hairs. The newer one is more gentle to the face and I do not get the nubs with it. Still a five star product!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Trims without pulling hairs. Has a light that makes it easy to see areas being trimmed.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
    <li> Love this. Works great! Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> i bought this item and exchanged twice due to the light never working. Gave up and kept the last one, which broke fairly quickly. Wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for my best friend who would normally spend hours in the mirror plucking hairs.  she now is saved a ton of time.</li>
    <li> The light on this remover is great, its almost like a bright violet color. Plus the top is bendable making it easier to get into small or tight spots.&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to use it for my peachfuzz on my face.</li>
    <li> too small of a blade - the last one I had was larger and easier to use.  This one works but you have to go over the area several times to get all the hair.  Otherwise fine. If I had my choice, I&#x27;d have one with a thicker blade.</li>
    <li> I sent it to my daughter and she said it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m going to visit in May and can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> Just received today, only used product once &amp; thus far I was satisfied with results.  Light is really bright and helpful.  Did not have to repeatedly go over area to remove hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter received this as a Christmas gift and it worked for her for a week and then quit. I normally have good reviews about the products that I purchase on amazon and the people that I purchase them from, but this time is not one of them! This item was requested for expidited shipping and was not recieved within the alloted time.  I did request that the expidited fee be reimbursed, but the company just reimbursed half of the fee. Please be aware that if you get the expidited shipping then the company needs to do just that. Thank you for your time.</li>
    <li> It was hard to eliminate my facial hair with this thing, and it irritated my skin.  It is easier to use small scissors to cut my hair off.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t work please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> The older I get the more sceptical I am of products touted to do it all, so I am delighted to report that FINISHING TOUCH actually does do it all!!  Easy to use; great price; it&#x27;s the last product you&#x27;ll need!</li>
    <li> This product really sucks. First of all, it does not do what it claims to do. Second of all, it broke after several uses. I learned my lesson. One should never stray from trusted brands when it comes to these made-in-China stuff.</li>
    <li> Does not trim very well feels dull. It takes a while to try to get the facial hair trimmed off and still doesn&#x27;t get it all.</li>
    <li> My mom had the exact product and when I tried it I loved it. I bought it and received it however it doesn&#x27;t work very well. Returning would be too much of a hassle for the price I paid. Tried to use it on face but wouldn&#x27;t pick up anything and when it did it would hurt which is not what I remembered from using my mom&#x27;s. Now I just use it for eyebrows which is the only thing it will really work for.</li>
    <li> Good excellent nice because Is most effective than cream of avon. This product is cery very good. For me. Ok</li>
    <li> This is a very handy gadget to have. Great for touch ups and facial areas. Very portable and battery lasts a long time in it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works very well! However, the pivoting head doesn&#x27;t actually allow you to move it yourself, it just sort of shakes.</li>
    <li> as described! fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is a great idea and it saves on shaving your legs but works better on your face!</li>
    <li> I lost mine and will get another one.  Snips those lip whiskers right off.</li>
    <li> Finishes up nicely :)</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!!  It does require 1-AAA battery, which is not included!!  You do have to go over the hairs a couple of times, but it does do the trick!!  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this from Walgreens for about $10 and I used it to shave my arms and legs&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for it at all. Then I started to use it to shave the hair from my nose it works well for that</li>
    <li> The light isn&#x27;t as bright as I thought it would be, but it works better than the one I had for about 10 years from AVON.</li>
    <li> A great product.  Very easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
    <li> Basically a razor with a light - not sure what the hype was for this product.</li>
    <li> It takes some maneuvering to get a close cut but it&#x27;s still useful for its purpose.</li>
    <li> What I got was only slightly different but it does the same thing and works well. Came fast and well protected.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, very nice</li>
    <li> I love mine.  I have had it over a year and used to trim upper lip.  Hairs grow back slowly and soft so no stubble shows.  Want to get refills now for it.  Haven&#x27;t changed the battery since first getting it either...guess it would depend on how often or how much you use it.</li>
    <li> I honestly was so surprised to see so many one stars on this product. I purchased this item long time ago.. Maybe like four years ago from a store (not online) I think it was Ross.. and been happy with it ever since I got it! Great for any area you want to shave! HIGHLY recommend it. The light is a nice touch although I don&#x27;t really use it. When you push the button up once it turns on and if you push it up one more time the light turns on.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Finishing Touch Lumina Lighted Hair Remover with Pivoting Head and I was very satisfied with this product.  I don&#x27;t like to take the time to go to a salon for waxing my little hairs that crop up on my upper lip and chin.  This product does what it the advertisement says it does and it is quick and easy when you are trying to get out the door in the morning.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Rough and scratchy blade; light is not helpful!  Buy the Panasonic one instead; it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
    <li> Great instrument. does exactly as you would expect. My problem with these products are their lifeline. time will tell</li>
    <li> I liked this razor until I attempted to use it on my eyebrows... I used the 4mm guard and it didn&#x27;t do anything so I used the 2mm guard and it practically shaved off one of my eyebrows completely! Im very upset! 😩</li>
    <li> works great and i love how it has a light.</li>
    <li> Hmmm, I&#x27;ve bought these before and this one seems particularly dull, doesn&#x27;t work very well. Also batteries provided were dead, had to use new ones.</li>
    <li> If you are in your 20&#x27;s with facial hair like lambswool, then go for it otherwise don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I only bought this item last week but I&#x27;m concerned about regrowth. It would be primarily used for upper lip so am wondering if, like shaving, does the hair grow back fast and ten times thicker?!</li>
    <li> It was a gift ....great purchase price ..quick delivery,  no negative feedback on it so it must  have been a great gift choice.</li>
    <li> This is just an average hair remover...nothing special, but it will do what I need it to do efficiently enough.</li>
    <li> Arrive nearly a week late. I was recommended this product by my friend who bought it at bed bath and beyonde. Her&#x27;s works great, mine does not. There&#x27;s not a good connection with the battery so it loses power when at certain angles and gets jammed frequently. Maybe mine is defective, but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> out of the box it did not work. i emailed you quite a while back with this info. and asking for return instructions.....&lt;br /&gt;this is the only thing i received back!!</li>
    <li> It does not remove hair like a previous one.  Its very dim when it comes to removal of hair.  Will not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought, binned it.</li>
    <li> this product stinks big time.  it is made of plastic and my old one metal.  it broke after a week.</li>
    <li> It was gift for my mom and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I have an older one of these that is the white light.  It worked great for a long time.  The new one with the purple light was a waste of money.  It does not cut well.  The purple light makes it impossible to see what you are doing.  I still use my old one and not this new one.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t even cut as close as a razor.</li>
    <li> This is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve been sans nose hair, and I&#x27;m pushing 70!  I used to just cut it short or pull them out.  What a thrill to be so much more feminine with no pain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned that has a light. It definitely makes a difference. I like using this when I&#x27;ve negelcted my brows and I need them in shape ASAP. I wish this was able to get closer to the skin, but it does an okay job.</li>
    <li> I opened up the box and its was good. I used it and shaved my eyebrows with it. So far it hasn&#x27;t grown back. it makes it all stubby its horrible. DO NOT BUY. WHEN YOU SHAVE , THIS MAKES IT ALL STUBBY AND DOESNT REALLY REMOVE HAIR.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought was pretty good, lasted about a year. Replaced it with their newest version, lasted about 5 minutes. Have tried everything, new batteries, cleaned connection points, but nothing has worked. Very disappointed with the new version, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It fits right in my makeup bag and does a great job! I will never use wax or Nair again on my face!</li>
    <li> I had one before that came up missing before deployment. I Iike the size of it, but Im not quite sure of the light yet, the one I had before did not have a light, so it is kinda strange to me. Works great and doesnt eat batteries like most that I have had in the past.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  You are better off just using a regular razor, which has the advantage of exfoliating as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair remover as recommended from a friend. I wanted to use it as eyebrow remover, however, it does not work...</li>
    <li> I bought one, it worked for a few weeks, but since the parts are all plastic it broke.  I thought, it was nice so I purchased another one...guess what, it worked for a couple weeks and broke too.  Dont do what I did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I been using this for over a year and can tell you I really enjoy mine. I was a bit worried when it slowed down and started to hurt, however a quick battery replacement fixed that. While I haven&#x27;t needed to replace the blade or light, it still holding up pretty well for the price in my purse. There is some minor damage on the ends where it has fallen out however its still holding up :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Not going to lie, I used this on my legs a few times, when I found spots I surprisingly missed and didn&#x27;t have a drying problem like normal razors without water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;-Its pencil like design has made it easy to hold while using and finding a spot in my purse each time I switch bags.&lt;br /&gt;-Very discreetly shaped.&lt;br /&gt;-Durable&lt;br /&gt;-Light&lt;br /&gt;-Pivoting head&lt;br /&gt;-2 comb attachments for eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;-When the battery is dying, the blade slows down.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace my old model ... This has No Power,&lt;br /&gt;went back to using my original Finishing Touch, glad I kept it.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what they changed but I&#x27;m not Happy.</li>
    <li> Got it on time but it never worked. Had to send it back. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I just purchased mine but I really like it.  I am postmenopausal and have to pluck upper lip and around my chin and neck.  This worked beautifully on my upper lip and the other areas.  I am going to tell my sister and my friends about it.  I can&#x27;t imagine what the one reviewer was doing to break hers twice.  With care I hope to keep mine working great.  I also appreciate seeing the phone # for getting replacement blades.</li>
    <li> The on/off switch broke completely off the first time I switched it on!  This ended up being a $10 lesson in what brand NOT to buy.</li>
    <li> This hair remover has become an integral part of my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use it on my face but is pretty good for underarms.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the positive reviews on here! It is a razor and I do not think it&#x27;s a good idea for women to shave their fine facial hairs as it will make them thicker. It is better to pull them with some wax or tweezers.</li>
    <li> This thing is made different now, it has a plastic piece over the top and it does not allow the blade to touch the skin!!  I tried to take the plastic piece off and it wouldn&#x27;t stay together!  Needless to say, back it went....</li>
    <li> As soon as I removed the protective cover, the thing literally fell apart, and it was impossible to put it back together so it would stay. This must be the cheapest piece of junk I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> Works great! I love these. Have owned one for years.  Dropped my other one, one too many times. Finally need a new one. Went to what I know. Love.</li>
    <li> Great product - we love it.  Especially with the light on it.  Works great  and has battery that can be replaced.  Excellent price with no shipping.  Thanks :)</li>
    <li> not so good.  has a sharp edge, so it scratches when using.</li>
    <li> Did not work. Unfortunately , I didn&#x27;t open to use until after eligible return date. Otherwise would have returned immediately.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped. I bought another brand a couple of years ago and it will remain my go to product.</li>
    <li> I have a trimmer similar to this product and it works very well but doesn&#x27;t have the light. That&#x27;s why I purchased this item. The light is a nice addition but once I got A AAA battery in it did not fit well and was actually kind of loose. It does work but it does not trim very well and the battery moves a little inside it. I have resorted to using my old trimmer with all the light and just using the light on this new trimmer. I should&#x27;ve just bought a light!! Wow</li>
    <li> I just received this product today and I have to say I am delighted. It works exactly as advertised. Make sure you have the correct angle for most efficient hair removal. It feels a little cheap but it was! I got what I expected and would recommend this product at $10.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in a different brand before, I only bought a new one because I was too lazy to find replacement blades for my old one.  I should have, because this new one, even with all the bells and whistles, doesn&#x27;t work.  Even when placed directly along my skin at different angles, it has a hard time cutting through even the thinnest, softest hair.  Plus, the vibrating motion it uses to cut hairs actually hurts my skin.  My old one was much gentler and much more effective.  And this one is very loud!</li>
    <li> I like it&lt;br /&gt;Finishing Touch Lumina Lighted Hair Remover with Pivoting Head ..&lt;br /&gt;This product meets my expectation&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to have this item&lt;br /&gt;I found at Amazon web</li>
    <li> I tried another brand and I was very disappointed in it.  This brand works so much better.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is for a quick shave.  I would say this is a good  product.  Try this and it is easy to clean</li>
    <li> This product was a huge disappointment for me.  I bought it for the soul purpose of hair shaping in my bikini area, I used it about 3 times before it just kind of fell apart.  It&#x27;s no worth it to buy this if you&#x27;re only gonna be able to use it a couple of times before it breaks apart in while your using it.  I recommend the Remington Pg165 Battery Operated Adjustable Detail Trimmer, this thing works like a dream and it&#x27;s no expensive either.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my friend told me, which ofcourse was one to the hopeless advice which i heard . It&#x27;s good for nothing and i would suggest not to waste your money on that</li>
    <li> Just purchased my second one.  I used the first one for years. It is great for facial hair and eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I lost my last Finishing Touch Hair remover so I quickly ordered this one and it came to me just as fast as I ordered it.  It&#x27;s amazing and Amazon got this very needed item to me super quick.  I love this product and I love Amazon too!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Este trimer es una PORQUER&amp;Iacute;A, lo compre dos veces y las dos veces se rompi&amp;oacute; al primer uso. El material del que esta construido es muy d&amp;eacute;bil.</li>
    <li> This product works well for the price. I used it all the time for my upper lip before I started to wax. Now I use it to trim my eyebrows and it works well. Sometimes the pieces come apart(for you to clean not broken) if your not careful but they go back together easily. There might be better ones out there but it did the job for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Please use care if you attempt to use this product on any sensitive area of your body (face, neck, ect.) It dosen&#x27;t work and can cause seveer pain and injury.  This item is very unsafe. It pulls your skin and hair. PURE JUNK.......BUYER BEWARE.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this.  It is our 2nd one, and is very useful.  I would recommend it to anyone who has the least bit of hair that needs to be removed.</li>
    <li> Does not work. I have fine and light facial hair. I went over the same area repeatedly and it did not work. The description said the battery is included but it was not.</li>
    <li> Broke after using it only twice. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I put the batteries in an cannot slip the battery cover over it and if it gets too tight it will not work.&lt;br /&gt;does not have the little cutter.  Overall very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Ive been looking for this product that was stolen from me year&#x27;s ago,its the only shaver that never cuts,or pinches and removes hair smoothly especially in the bikini area and the light really helps you see what is being removed.</li>
    <li> Have had great results with no problems whatsoever.  Would strongly recommend!  I plan to buy another to keep in my travel case</li>
    <li> I love this thing, I really do, it&#x27;s perfect for all small areas, my problem is that I can&#x27;t for the life of my get the head open to clean it out! I keep reading about pushing some button down to release it but there is no button on mine! I can&#x27;t keep using it because I can&#x27;t clean it, I even tried just forcefully taking it apart</li>
    <li> Works great for getting rid of unwanted hair for us ladies. I had one before and I wore it out, so this was a replacement. Good product.</li>
    <li> not as happy as I was with their last product (I believe diamond touch).  Takes longer to remove hair from face.</li>
    <li> Works like advertised.</li>
    <li> Why spend lots more for something that won&#x27;t get those hard to reach places.  This is a very good item, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Cap/lid was broken. All other parts were fine.</li>
    <li> What an amazing little wand, I tried the $280.00 no no joke! LOLI was in a craft store and bought this as an impulse buy, thought what the hec for 10 bucks I will try it. If its facial fuzz you want gone, this is an amazing little tool for the money, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> You see the light go on so you know there is power--the blade part doesn&#x27;t move.  Once you hit it 20 times it starts, it should not be that hard.  I returned an item once and it cost me 50% of item.  So I will keep it, but never purchase an item like this on line again.</li>
    <li> It was a generic trimmer and I wish I would have researched the product more.  I found the same thing for five dollars less at the Family Dollar Store.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the first one I bought over a year ago. Does nto seem to to get the fine hair and eyebrow comb does not work at all.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for some hair under my chin that popped up out of nowhere. I was really self conscious about it and felt like everyone could see it (they couldn&#x27;t, it was just me obsessing). Still, I wanted the hair gone and plucking was too painful (plus there were just too many hairs). Waxing seemed painful and messy, and shaving would leave darker stubble that would be even more noticeable. So I spent the ten bucks on this and it did the job. The unsightly hairs are gone, but it did leave some stubble that&#x27;s noticeably rough, at least to me. I will have to do this every day or I will soon have man stubble. Hmmmm. I&#x27;m hesitant to use this on my upper lip hair. I don&#x27;t want my husband feeling rough stubble when we kiss. Still, it did remove the hairs easily, quickly, and pain free. PS, don&#x27;t use this &amp;#34;down under&amp;#34; because that kind of hair is just too thick for this little thing. I tried and didn&#x27;t get far at all. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> bought for wife who loves it and pivot head is great for handling this trimmer esp in angles of the body</li>
    <li> The Finishing Touch Hair Remover is a good product for \\&quot;light\\&quot; usage such as; fine hairs on face, eye brows, etc. I was surprised I have to use it as much as a razor. Perhaps frequency will go down as I use it, it&#x27;s only been a week.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about six months ago and I&#x27;ve used it about once or twice for my sideburns. My hair would come back in two days and it would come back rough and noticable, it embrassed me more knowing my sideburns were more noticable. I would only recommend using it on your eyebrows after you tweeze them because it does get the little hairs you could not get other then that it&#x27;s a waste.</li>
    <li> Better than the first version of the finishing touch. Works extremely well, you just have to make sure to clean the little blades.</li>
    <li> This item works to get rid of the excess hair on my face however, its not like a man shaving. It is not a very close removal, i could feel short hairs remain on my face. I would like to not feel the hairs at all but it is better than nothing.</li>
    <li> this product was super disappointing and painful. It cut my skin and when it did remove hair it ripped the hairs out and was incredibly painful. I don&#x27;t recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> This one has lasted me a long time. Still love it and am still using it.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk.  Barely cuts hair.</li>
    <li> It does not cut well, hurts on skin, is a cheap piece of junk! Had to use electric razor after the best effort with this. I do not approve this item at all. I just applied for refund and was pleased to see that UPS will pick it up with prepaid label. Also, I got a return label online, printed it to enclose with pkg. Easy return!! LIKE that!</li>
    <li> As described, thank you!</li>
    <li> Needing this for upper lip hair and this works! RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Perfect. No problems. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is the biggest waste of money I have ever spent.  The light is in the way of the blade so it does not shave most of the hair.  I can tweeze more hair than this trimmer removes!!!</li>
    <li> Does not work at all for me.  Not one hair was gone. I was using a Remington which worked good but wore out , so I tried this&lt;br /&gt;one. I would tell everyone not to buy this.</li>
    <li> Horrible, waste of money! Cheap chinese rubbish!!!!!! I would definitely NOT recommend it to anyone........</li>
    <li> This product works great with light colored fine hair but really does not do anything for short and/or dark colored hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hair remover!  I am 47 and started to get extra face hair around my side burn area.  This thing works perfectly and gets rid of the most fine hairs.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use - all menopausal women should have one!  hahaha  Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> HAVE HAD THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE AND TRIED TO USE MANY TIMES, BUT IT JUST DOES NOT DO THE JOB AT ALL.</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed in the product especially after reading good reviews on it.  You have to make many passes on your face to remove the hair and even then it does not take the hair off even remotely close.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was a necessary item. Works well, highly impressive!</li>
    <li> I have crazy eyebrows that seem to have a life of their own, and grow over night.  If I am going out,  I cannot groom them by plucking with tweezers because then I look as if I had been stung by bees with red blotchy skin that even make-up doesn&#x27;t really cover.  The Lumina Hair Remover is perfect at anytime, but especially good for these last minute touch-ups.  It&#x27;s the best grooming aid ever!!!</li>
    <li> Works really well and fast!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very scratchy and doesn&#x27;t cut easily.</li>
    <li> Had another that &amp;#34;went missing&amp;#34; (can you say sticky fingered maids??); this is perhaps not as good, but it works ok.</li>
    <li> The first use is pretty good but seems to diminish substantially beyond that. Still gets the job done with minimal abrasiveness.</li>
    <li> I must say, this arrived really quickly. I was quite surprised. I like this product; however I don&#x27;t think it is worth $10. It is good for trimming my unwanted hair before I shave, and it gets rid of my sideburns but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of this one because of the light!! There is no way to turn off the light, and when you go to trim your eyebrows, the light blinds you!! I ended up cutting more of my eyebrow off than I wanted. It is also very bulky which I don&#x27;t like. I usually love these hair removers but NOT THIS ONE!!  Update: This just sits in my bathroom drawer taking up space because I still cannot use it with the blinding light. I wish there was a way for me to shut it off!   I buy a lot of products on Amazon, and I rely on people&#x27;s review before purchasing. If my review has been helpful, please click the Yes button below. Thanks and I hope my review has helped you.</li>
    <li> this is very gentle to use dosnt leave any rough spots;Very comfortable to use. Its looks are very nice. Anyone would feel comfortable using it.</li>
    <li> Wife says its the best one shes had</li>
    <li> Broke after one use within a week. The price went down from $13.95 to $9.45. No wonder.. I wish I got a refund.. too much hassle for an inexpensive item..</li>
    <li> This is my second Finishing Touch purchased.  The first one lasted for several years and I loved it so much had to have another!  Speedy delivery and they have only improved the design!</li>
    <li> I loved this for a while. It started out great. I bought new blades for it. Now the light works great but that is all that works Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Great tool for quick touch ups in the morning! Doesn&#x27;t get all the way down the the skin necessarily, but certainly helps!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as promised and works as advertised. I have had one in the past but was lost during moving. It works great as long as you make sure you use it on a clean face.</li>
    <li> The worst ever had to get refunded the blade won&#x27;t even spin further more it won&#x27;t even come on.</li>
    <li> This is the fifth one I&#x27;ve gotten. It totally busts after two months. I want to be clear, this has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SELLER, as I have gone out of my way to purchase these from various stores and online sellers. This product is just cheap. I will say, it does it&#x27;s job, while it works. It does not completely remove the hair, so there is some stubble, but it&#x27;s perfect for touch ups. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t last longer than 8 weeks. And no, it isn&#x27;t the battery. The light comes on but the little razors or whatever you want to call them simply stop working.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion and works very well.</li>
    <li> got for my husband as birthday gift, he used one time and the motor quit working.  I unfortunately had gotten rid of packaging and packing slip so no return/refund.  Really disappointing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, was expecting something different</li>
    <li> love it and have to get used to it a bit.  seems to cut back on time and don&#x27;t have to use as often</li>
    <li> This product arrived in the promised time and was well packed and arrived with no damage.  It works as advertised and thus far, I am very happy with it; I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend this item. Light is not bright enough and it does not remove hair close enough to the skin. I consider it a waste of money.</li>
    <li> So far I love this thing!  works great for mustache/ eyebrow easy clean up.  I cant wait to see what else it can do!</li>
    <li> I use this for my face and like it.it works good and removes the hair quick and easy. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wanna do full-scale trim jobs with it but it&#x27;s a good thing to have around when on the go or lighter jobs are necessary to complete thee.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair and so the hairs that grow on my face are also mostly light colored.  It&#x27;s great for trimming areas like sideburns, chin, etc that need to be touched up in between waxes.  I would not recommend using it if you have very dark hairs because it is just cutting the hairs off the surface and you will still be able to see them.  The only drawback is that the blades go dull after a while and you have to replace it.  I had my last one about 8 months before I had to get another one.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I can say I was interested in this product because of what I saw on TV and I thought it would be a great tool to help maintain my sons hair in between cuts. Needless to say this thing barely removes any hair and its not a painless hair removal method. My son cried because he said it was pulling his hair on his neck, and when I tried it on my arm I felt the same thing. The hair it did remove seems to be pulled out rather then shaved off. I am not returning it or asking for a refund because I figure that&#x27;s what happens when you buy cheap stuff, but I hope no one else puts out any money for this useless gadget.</li>
    <li> my sister recomended this to me, can&#x27;t believe how well it works with this price - perfect for my needs - actually use it now for one of my boys who has a unibrow but finds waxing unpleasant</li>
    <li> I am a hairy latina woman and i have a lot of hair all over. this worked great on the chin hairs i had and the hair on my fingers as well as the hair on my upper lip and toes. it takes it right off with no pain and no you will not cut yourself if u get too close...at most you will be left with a few scratches that don&#x27;t even penetrate the skin. very fun, easy and efficient to use. for the people that say that this thing isn&#x27;t worth a crap and breaks easily you just have to be gentle with it.</li>
</ol>
