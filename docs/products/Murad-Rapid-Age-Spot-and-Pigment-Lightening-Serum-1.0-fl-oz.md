<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product after 7years with dark spot in my face in two weeks my spot were completely gone I will continue using it❤</li>
    <li> Love this product .Helped me a lot!</li>
    <li> I have medium skin and it is really helping to lighten my dark spots! Didn&#x27;t think it was going to work at all! I&#x27;m telling everyone about it!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well on dark spots,but use sparingly due to dangers of hydroquinone.</li>
    <li> I still have about half the jar left just sitting on my counter.  I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin while using it.  Plus, it has an odor that is off-putting to me so that definitely doesn&#x27;t help me want to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;This seems to work on hyperpigmentation and scarring from older acne issues. It seems to work towards precenting outbreaks too. Don&#x27;t use it very often due to HQ content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLDER REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them. After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone. All these issues have been satisfactorily addressed. Here is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Wash with DM essential cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;DM oil control lotion&lt;br /&gt;Murad rapid age spot serum AND DM c12 bright serum&lt;br /&gt;Either DM dynamic skin recovery moisteurizer or DM active moist (the former if i feel a bit dry)&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;Makeup as usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening&lt;br /&gt;DM wash&lt;br /&gt;DM daily microfoliant&lt;br /&gt;Murad and c12 serums&lt;br /&gt;DM pure night lightening cream&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week I use a DM sebum clearing mask&lt;br /&gt;Every two weeks or as needed I use a chemical peel, followed by DM power recovery masque to restore moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Map15 generator dust mixed with moisteurizer as needed but rarely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are massive. Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
    <li> In fairest to this product, I haven&#x27;t be as consistent in the application as I should be. Still, I would expect some results at the very least. Maybe in a month I might feel different.</li>
    <li> Works very nice. Not too oily..but after a week it started to smell a bit funny. Not sure if thats how its suppose to smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I order this product. It has made me a BIG magical look, this has really worked on my face, NO breakouts at all, I had very dark age spots on my face for years Now UNBEIVEABLE my fase looks great. Lighter, Younger, and healthier. I really recommend this product. It make Miracles, I get very good comments .... If you have face issues DON&#x27;T think it twice order this product. You will be glad you did, Look younger with a Clean, healthier face look. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Worthless:( would have put no star but it wasn&#x27;t allowed</li>
    <li> This is a fake do no buy..!</li>
    <li> So far so good on this product. I decided to try it after reading reveiws on it, and after about a week and a half I can tell a difference in the appearance of some of my sun spots on my face. I am going to keep using it as it has not irritated my skin, which is great for me as most products do.</li>
    <li> It is too early to rate this item.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three weeks and have not seen any change in the dark spots on my face!</li>
    <li> I been using this product for a few weeks now on my bikini area (did not intend to use it for the face). It seems to be clearing not only my skin tone but also a bit of my ingrown scar/marks. Although they are still there, they have improved greatly. I will continue to use it until the bottle has finished because so far, I am satisfied with the product and I recommend.</li>
    <li> The best for the black spot </li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks, I have not seen any improvement thus far, although the reviews were good I had high hopes that this product would work.  I will continue to use it until the bottle is empty. If by that time I still don&#x27;t see any change, I will not repurchase or give a good review.</li>
    <li> I have fairly light brown spots on my face. Not that visible, but I wanted to start treating them before they got really bad. I was going to purchase the Clinique or Dr. Brandt serum when I saw this instead. Full disclosure that I bought this in the summer and wasn&#x27;t great at using SPF on my face. That could be a reason why I am not seeing the results like others have. However, now it&#x27;s winter and my spots really aren&#x27;t going away. I recently got a light chemical peel and will start using this again. I am committed to finishing the bottle however I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I only received a sample from Sephora but after using it for only a couple of days I noticed a huge difference in my dark spots. I highly recommend this product, if you&#x27;re skeptical I suggest getting a free sample as well from your local Sephora. This is the first spot treatment I&#x27;ve used, the manager at Sephora recommended this product. I&#x27;m going to be 30 soon and was starting to see some age spots and my acne scars were getting darker. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy this product has made me. I have very light skin so absolutely everything is noticeable. Please take it from my experience, this is a definite keeper. I don&#x27;t recommend products often, but go to your local Sephora and try it out yourself. I can&#x27;t wait to buy the entire line of Murad products.</li>
    <li> After three uses I have had to give up on this product. Each time I use it it causes a severe reaction, leaving my skin red and inflamed for several days, which is worse than the original scar I was trying to fade!</li>
    <li> iS QUITE STRONG AND BURNS SOMETIMES.</li>
    <li> The product does remove the spots and it really works the product took about 3weeks to see a difference I&#x27;m  truly surprised .</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this, having read the reviews both here and elsewhere before purchasing. But it&#x27;s been about 5 weeks, and I don&#x27;t see much change. I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it&#x27;s finished, but I doubt anything will change significantly.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample size of this from Sephora for free, and I loved it so much that I&#x27;d only used a couple drops of my little bottle before I ordered the actual one for about half the cost it normally is. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> really works on dark spots if you have time to use it several times a day</li>
    <li> Dark spots on face are fading although not completely gone.  I&#x27;ve used it for a month and will continue to use it to see if they completely fade.</li>
    <li> While I like the product, I am very unhappy with the pump cap on the bottle.  First of all, I only use this product sparingly once a day &amp; only on specific areas on my face.  After just a week, I realized that almost a third of the bottle was gone because when you hit the pump for a little squirt the liquid starts running down the sides of the pump &amp; on the top of the glass bottle as well.  At this point, it is too late to return.  I am going to have to find a small bottle that I can transfer the Murad into because if I don&#x27;t  there will be nothling left to use in a week.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for over two months, applying it regularly everynight and to date have not noticed any improvement.  We&#x27;ve taken photos from day 1 and comparing to today&#x27;s photo, we were unable to discern any lightening of our brown spots.  We also apply the product to only one side of our face and that also revealed no real benefits.  We will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Almost done with my first bottle.  While it appears the spots are fading to my naked eye, comparing a before picture with a now picture not so sure the improvement is as good as I thought.  Going to buy a second bottle and will review again because the spots are definitely lighter.  Debbie</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.  Won &#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago, but it had a different label.  I can&#x27;t recall what it was called then but it was to be used day and night with a sunscreen during the day.  Maybe that is why it&#x27;s not working for some users.  Try using it morning and evening and don&#x27;t forget the sunscreen and see if that works.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This did NOT do anything for me, after 2 weeks I saw no difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this along with the vitamin c peel mask, the face wash and the moisturizer with spf 30. My hyperpigmentation has lightened but it&#x27;s still there. I guess a bit longer</li>
    <li> It did softened my skin a little but did nothing for spots of my face. Not the results I expected,</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased Murad with amazon&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it at a fantastic price, but the last&lt;br /&gt;order I placed for the same product the price was considerably&lt;br /&gt;higher. I love the product ,but will not order again&lt;br /&gt;if the price continues to increase.</li>
    <li> Unlike other Murad products, which I have really liked, I&#x27;m not convinced that this one actually works.</li>
    <li> This product did not work one bit on my dark spots! I&#x27;m very disappointed and will never use this product again, it was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> It really works on my brown spots. My skin is looking better every time I use it. My brown spots are fading which makes your whole face look improved.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for weeks and have not seen any improvement.  I will continue to use it until its gone because it was pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> Worked like a dream! Removed all of my age spots on my hands that flared up when I moved to a sunnier climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy again!</li>
    <li> Loved this for year&#x27;s... brightens the skin to a natural glow.</li>
    <li> This serum was not effective at all.</li>
    <li> In a nutshell, it does what it claims to do: fades dark spots.  After 2 months of usage, I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable lightening of my hyperpigmentation, which I assume is from sun damage.  Although it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated the spots, I&#x27;m pretty happy with them being lighter.  With that said, I should mention that I use this product twice a day after washing my face.  I follow this with a glycolic acid toner and moisturizer containing retinol.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the average person use this many harsh chemicals on their face but it&#x27;s working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in purchasing this to try, I&#x27;d buy it from Amazon.  It runs for $60 at Sephora and Ulta.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the results or lack of..I&#x27;ll have to try another product</li>
    <li> Product did not work on age spots.  For the money that was paid, I was hoping for better results.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this religiously for the past two months and it does nothing.  Not worth the money.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> The bottom line is that it does work to some degree.  The light spot that I wanted to lighten actually looked worse for about a week and a half.  After it sloughed and healed, it looked lighter--almost gone, but this was about a month of treating it according to the instructions.  The darker spot has been treated for about a month now, and it doesn&#x27;t appear lighter at all.  The name &amp;#34;Rapid Age Spot Lightening&amp;#34; is not too accurate, but for lighter spots on patient people, it does have some degree of effectiveness.</li>
    <li> The reason I purchased this serum was to help fade the pinkish brown spots I had leftover from acne breakouts. I was looking for a product that would give my skin an allover even tone. I always have doubts when trying a new product but this has really evened out my complexion and faded those ugly little discolorations. I&#x27;ve been applying it every night for about 3 weeks now and my skin looks good enough to where I feel comfortable with just a quick dusting of mineral makeup. I was considering buying the obagi system which is super expensive and has a million steps, but I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase and recommend it to anyone suffering the same issue.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I see a difference after 4 days. My skin looks clear and the spots are lightening. This product is only used at night. If u use it in the morning sun exposure will burn ur face. So those of u that used the product in the morning its a big no no.</li>
    <li> This was a bit expensive and I used every last drop of it and never saw any results.  I was trying to lighten post-acne dark spots but I did not see any improvement.</li>
    <li> Spots still there...not sure anything will work. Frustrating...they are not age spots.  I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s pregnancy mask; I have had these spots for many years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightened the spot over about an 8 month period...</li>
    <li> Worked almost overnight.  Smells awful though. I am using twice daily followed by Ponds wrinkle cream.  Very happy with results.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Has worked better and faster than anything else I have tried.  Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something that works.</li>
    <li> Did not seem to do anything.  Didn&#x27;t notice any changes  :(  Went through the whole bottle.  Says you should see improvements within one week.&lt;br /&gt;Did not happen for me!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all. I have been using it morning and night for almost a year now and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> My skin is usually not sensitive but it became dry and had a rash when I used this serum.  I think it brightened my skin tone a little after using it once a day for about 3 weeks, even though I was outdoor almost daily (wearing a hat 99% of the time when outdoor though AND wearing sun block when running), but the cons outweigh the pros so I&#x27;m going to stop using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that my skin has returned to its normal condition (not dry and no rash) after I stopped using this serum for about a few days.  Now it&#x27;s been 2+ weeks and it&#x27;s still ok.  If I&#x27;m ready to try another brand of skin tone lightening product, I&#x27;ll try the one from Clinique.  I used a sample of it for a few days and that product felt great on my skin.  I could tell it was very moisturizing and it didn&#x27;t give me a rash.  How well will it do its actual job?  That I&#x27;ll have to wait to find out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SERUM!  This is my second time purchasing the Murad Rapid Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum, and it will NOT be my last.  This product is definitely part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Does what it says to my skin!</li>
    <li> I used this for dark spots on my hand.  I found it worked well.  However, have read warnings about Hydroquinone being a carcinogenic.  Refuse to use any longer.  I&#x27;d rather have dark spots than cancer.</li>
    <li> My bad for not testing this on a piece of arm skin before applying it to my face. Woke up the next morning covered in pink welts and my eyes swollen almost shut. It itched like crazy. I took Benadryl for three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They tell you to apply it all over your face, but that will lighten EVERYTHING and you will still have age spots. Should be applied to age spots ONLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never going near this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Did not work as stated. I used the entire bottle and applied as directed and did not see any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I use it once a day with 30 sunscreen over it.  It does fade as suggested.  A little pricy.</li>
    <li> Love the product, works wonders on age spots. Does have a bit of a sticky feel, but washes off easily. Great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping it would work on my sun spots, but have been disappointed........  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Used religiously and noticed no difference in my dark spots:(</li>
    <li> I have been using this Rapid Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum for about a month now and thus far have not noticed any results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as soon as I received it and in the beginning, thought my brown spots were starng to fade. I&#x27;ve been using it daily since but my spots are still here and doesn&#x27;t appear to be getting any lighter so am disappointed, especially since it is called &amp;#34;RAPID age spot and pigment lightening serum&amp;#34;. Maybe someone else will have better results. I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone but unless I see increased results, would not purchase this again!</li>
    <li> After three weeks of religious use, this seems to be making a difference in my most noticeable age spots.  And my overall face seems brighter.</li>
    <li> only have used 1/2 the bottle and already see a big difference!!!! easy to use . A great product!! satisfied</li>
    <li> I have had the pregnancy mask for 10 years now and even with treatment from dermatologists, and countless other serums, this is the first one I&#x27;ve seen actual results. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and my spots are almost completely gone. I get compliments on how nice my skin looks and I don&#x27;t have to use a full coverage foundation any longer. I will continue to use it and the products that go with it.</li>
    <li> Noticed a increasing number of age spots on my face, hands/arms and legs.  This product worked wonderfully and I noticed a lightening of all the age spots after on 1 week of use.  Great product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Using this to prep for my wedding. My skin looks great. I swear by all of Murads products. All the ones I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve loved.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t notice any lightening of brown spots.</li>
    <li> After a lot of research on lightening products i finally discovered that serums are much more potent and effective than the lightening creams that i have been using for over a year with no improvements. Now, I didn&#x27;t use this product in the typical way on acne scars. I am an african american woman and have a few hyper pigmentation scars from shaving my bikini line. I know this is getting a little personal but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being African American, I have very coarse hair and when we shave we are inviting ingrown hairs, but i didn&#x27;t know that they would leave behind unsightly dark marks even after being removed. i have tried many bleaching creams including palmers and ambi to spot treat to no avail, until i found that a serum would be more effective. this product has tremendously helped me. i apply just a dab only on the dark spots, i do not want to lighten any other skin. i&#x27;ve used it twice a day for about a week and a half now and i can truly say that it has worked wonders and i already see improvement. given that the area that i apply it on doesn&#x27;t see much sunlight, this might have sped up the process. never the less, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference when I used it.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical in the beginning, but once I started to see immediate results, I knew I had the right product. I use it at night, and only put it on areas where the malasma is located on my face. It feels sticky at first, but once it dries, you no longer feel like you are wearing anything.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, and I&#x27;ve tried enough of these products to know!</li>
    <li> I did my research and found this product as a treatment for the sun spots on my forehead and cheeks.  I have been using the product for about 3 weeks daily at night and have noticed the spots begin to fade.  This product is not a quick fix but must be applied consistently for 30 days + to make real progress on dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue I did experience with the serum is I have super sensitive skin (prone to breakouts), and I did struggle with increased breakouts while using this product.  They were not severe... typically one would pop up on my forehead or cheek each week.  The benefits I saw were good enough that I did not stop using the product.</li>
    <li> The wife is happy with this item and that makes for a great day for me!!!! Will order more when needed. The supplier should be noted for there excellent performance and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I started using this product on June 23, 2014.  It has been a little over a month and I have seen a huge change in my blemishes.  I am a deep brown and suffer from hyper pigmentation.  I use this product only once a day in the evenings before bed after washing my face with a mild cleanser and rubbing an astringent for a deeper clean.  Once my face is dry, I apply this serum and let it settle before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that someone told me about this product.  My blemishes have lightened up so much and I still have a half a bottle left over.  Now, I only do spot treatments because I don&#x27;t want the product lighting my entire face. Oh, and as far as I can tell, this product does not break me out. If you decide to use this during the day (which I don&#x27;t recommend) be sure to use a good SPF over it.  Use SPF in general if you have blemishes so they don&#x27;t get darker.</li>
    <li> Great product,  started seeing results immediately.</li>
    <li> I am using this in conjunction with a kojic peel I bought on amazon and in the first week dark spots are about 75 percent less. so happy right now!</li>
    <li> Made my face puffy....</li>
    <li> I used this for the entire summer. I figured my skin was breaking out so much due the humidity. I had finally gotten rid of my acne before I started using this and ordered it because I had a few dark spots left. When I started used this my skin got so bad. This caused my entire face to break out and now all of my ance scarring is back. I recently stopped using this, and my face stopped breaking out. :( really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this to even out my skin tone after many days in the hot So Cal sun.  The product did just that.  Lighted some sun spots and freckles and even out the color of my skin.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It produced a very bad red rash on my cheek. I couldn&#x27;t believe it irritated my skin that bad considering I had user Aveno before with no issues.  For the price it was a huge disappointment. I suggest you take your money and buy another high end product.</li>
    <li> Murad - Rapid Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum 1.0 fl ozT  his works very well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken nearly 50 years to get all these age spots so it&#x27;s foolish they&#x27;ll be gone in months but of all the products, peels, laser treatments I&#x27;ve had,  this seems to be working as well as any so far.  No miracles, but slow and steady after two bottles, the spots are lightening.</li>
    <li> I  haven&#x27;t noticed significant results by using this product.  Still hopeful.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Saw a decrease in hyper pigmentation in just 4 days. Highly recommend. This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really write reviews but this product is beyond amazing! I had this acne scar on my nose and it was really embarrassing so i searched the internet for solution to get rid of that dark spot and came across this. It only took about two weeks to go away!</li>
    <li> do not really know yet</li>
    <li> It has lightened my age spots but not all the way.  I am still using it and it has worked better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of improvement. I&#x27;ll give it another month to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The pump did not work and it is not returnable...</li>
    <li> I bought this product and July of this year, And now I have finished the bottle.  Without a doubt this is the best acne mark product I have come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last 2 1/2 to three months, I have seen an 80% clearing of the acne marks on my face.  Not only will I buy more of this product but I would most definitely recommend it to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you should take some preventative measures from starting a break out, ie. not touching your face, and ensuring that if certain foods cause breakout you avoid those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth every penny and i recommend this to anyone who is spent years trying to clear up acne marks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for just 2 months now and I am pretty satisfied with it.  I use morning and most nights after washing my face before applying moisterizer.  I began suffering from hyperpigmentation about 4 years ago from years of sunning without sunscreen on my face - BAD IDEA!!  I have tried MANY different products and this is by far the best for the money.  My face is brighter.  The brown spots are mostly gone or so fair that they aren&#x27;t too easy see and I have also had less acne than ever.  There isn&#x27;t a strong smell and once it dries on your skin you can&#x27;t even tell you are wearing it, it&#x27;s so light.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 3 weeks now and have not seen any results yet. I will finish the bottle, but am not sure I will reorder.  RL</li>
    <li> Definitely noticed lightening of spots from this product. For larger spots, seeing a dermatologist is definitely still a must. Good product, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this. I don&#x27;t have dark spots but I do have a lot of redness and I put this on and about ten minutes later my redness is almost gone. Serums are also a lot better for oily skin than creams and after getting this at sephora (I will be buying from Amazon from now on because it&#x27;s 20$ cheaper) I threw out my old brightener. I love this. It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out at all.</li>
    <li> The initial results were fast but then  results slow to a crawl.</li>
    <li> Dark spots still visible, but have lightened in the last few weeks. Not sure if I would purchase again, but I&#x27;ve only used 1/3 of bottle.will see at the end of bottle.</li>
    <li> Dr Murad is the leader in skin care , love this product !! Works</li>
    <li> This is a definite five star product for lightening age spots.  I&#x27;ve used Murad products for years&lt;br /&gt;and this is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 63 years old and have decided to try this product on my very age spotted hands hoping&lt;br /&gt;for the same results I&#x27;ve gotten on my face:)</li>
    <li> My esthtetician suggested I order Murad to rid myself of the &amp;#34;brown mustache &amp;#34; under my lip caused by pigmentation.  She said it would take about a month to work.  It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks and I can see a considerable difference.  Quite pleased with product!!!</li>
    <li> You can start see results in less than 7 days! Only one problem: you feel a little burn sensation! My skin reacted not too well but then worked they way were suppost be! Great product! Go ahead and buy, you wont regreat!</li>
    <li> This product unlike one that I purchased at a later date appeared authentic and did not cause me to break out in a rash.  I love this product.  It really works.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to help with some acne scarring. Its been 2 ish months and I can totally see a difference. I am so happy with the results so far and plan to keep using this product!!</li>
    <li> I was out in the middle of the day at an outdoor concert and failed to reapply sunscreen for most of the afternoon. This resulted in brown spots/sun damage on the lower half of my face (the parts of my face that didn&#x27;t get sufficient coverage from the brim of my hat). I ordered this serum to treat those spots and noticed a significant difference within two weeks. After about six weeks, the lightest spots are completely faded. I also use Aczone and Retin-A to treat adult acne, and adding the Murad resulted in my skin peeling for a few days. Beware if you use other products, like this. You may want to start by only applying the Murad once a day.  But the serum itself is pleasant, with very little scent and no burning or stinging at application, unlike another product I&#x27;ve used for lightening skin. Good stuff, I am pleased with the results so far.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Works just as it says. Little expensive for elderly on social security as their only income. But still wonderful</li>
    <li> I received a sample size from Sephora, and have only gone through half the bottle and have noticed dark spots/acne spots fading. I&#x27;ve used prescription lighteners from dermatologist and never saw results after months - I noticed a difference after a week with this stuff! Going to buy a full size bottle once I finish the sample.</li>
    <li> I was optimistic after reading so many positive reviews. However, after using this product consistently for 5 weeks I see absolutely no difference in my brown spots.  I don&#x27;t understand how it can work so well for some yet have no results for me.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks use, have not really seen in dramatic results.</li>
    <li> only thing ive used to wipe away sunspots....this clear liquid is amazing.................it takes about 3 weeks to notice a big difference..i am on my third bottle</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have used it in the past but paid 3 times more at the makeup store.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of age and sun spots, and my skin is dry and sensitive.  I do see a difference in my skin.  Especially when I put on my tinting moisturizer.  I&#x27;m really glad with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Did it work? Nope. I used it for a very long time. Nada.....Learn from me, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. My age spots have not lightened at all. Don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
    <li> It has been a month I am using it daily, I have very bad hyperpigmentation on forehead, cheeks and have old acne scars. The product is ok the dark spots are still there but they are a little lighter. My face does look brighter so I guess it&#x27;s doing something. Will continue to use until I find something better.</li>
    <li> This product really works,  You do have to be patient for darker spots to fade, but after a few months they have blended into my skintone and I no longer have &amp;#34;age freckles&amp;#34;!  A1</li>
    <li> It works exactly as promised. Better price on Amazon than in salon, for sure. I will buy more when if I need to when this is finished.</li>
    <li> I saw about 50% improvement in dark spots.  In addition to this product I have been moisturizing more, and using the Neutrogena refinisher.  It&#x27;s pricey, and I haven&#x27;t used any other product.</li>
    <li> Works on my brown spots but like all the others it does take awhile just to show them fading.  Guess I was expecting it to act quicker.</li>
    <li> Simply does everything it states.</li>
    <li> The spots did not fade after all product been applied over about 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I wish it was more potent, but legally, it can&#x27;t I suppose. This product definitely works, but it takes at least 2 weeks and exfoliation to help speed things up. I usually put two pumps of the serum in my hands and apply all over my face and neck. I then do about 1/2 a pump of the serum in my hands and ONLY apply to dark spots. I think that&#x27;s the trick--concentrate on those dark spots!! I exfoliate using St.ives apricot scrub once a week.My face has improved all over AND my dark spots are getting lighter. I am AA with dark oily skin. I apply the product at night and 70 spf sunscreen during the day to avoid further darkening of my spots.</li>
    <li> Love it and the seller/sender got it to me very fast!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for one month, and I can see a difference. My face is more evenly toned - though I still have brown spots, but they are a little lighter.  I am hoping that with continued use this serum will keep working.  So far so good, I&#x27;ll keep you posted.  FYI - I have olive skin tone and with lots of sun damage due to the Florida sun.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product as I&#x27;ve noticed some dark patches developing on my face, mainly my cheeks, over the years from sun exposure. This hyper pigmentation would lighten up some on its own when summer was over but never really went away. So it&#x27;s been a few weeks and I have noticed definite lightening and being summer now, have not noticed any more darkening with sun exposure. I also feel it has a toning quality as well for the skin. All in all I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try and, as someone who&#x27;s tried other products and seen no results, would recommend this for anyone with hyperpigmentation.</li>
    <li> I have been using for several weeks now, and can see the difference in my skin.  I put it on before my night creams in the evening and in the morning before my cream and base.  Living in Florida, my skin damage is from sun exposure, so does lessen the effect of the damage</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does what it says it will.  The spots on my face have begone to fade and are hardly noticeable.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a Sunday night and was surprised to see it in my mailbox by Tuesday afternoon. I have been faithfully applying this serum on every night with no results. I will continue using this product until empty just to see if any changes happen, but more so I just don&#x27;t want to feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I love the age spot and pigment gel whaich I feel tightens my face.  Mdy husband usdes the serum and his dark age spots seem to miraculously disappear.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any change in my skin since using this product. It may help others but it didn&#x27;t me.</li>
    <li> This really works and I love how it makes my skin feel.  I have reordered several times. Great product thank you</li>
    <li> Used the entire bottle and saw no benefit, at one point even had a new age spot appear. Will never buy again</li>
    <li> product did nothing ...  it&#x27;s supposed leave a little residue and it get a little flaky-. or a slight tingling sensation ..nothing..did nothing for dark spots.I used it as directed-I&#x27;d like a refund please.. Thank you</li>
    <li> Very little result after using it for over a month</li>
    <li> I like it. Takes some time to see results but overall pleased.</li>
    <li> I tried this for 2 weeks straight, day and night but didn&#x27;t work to lighten or fade my sunspots from and old sunburn....:-(</li>
    <li> I had bought a sample size of this serum, and noticed the dark spots had begun to reappear after I had stopped using it.  That is why I bought his bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple products to lighten dark spots on my hands, and none work as well as Murad.  A bit pricey, and it must be used daily, over a few months there is a visible difference.</li>
    <li> Unlike most spot removers, this product actually works. I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to so many products, but this didn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin. I noticed a difference in 4 days. And, most importantly, if you quit using it, the spots don&#x27;t begin to reappear. I highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this serum after reading about it in my SHAPE magazine and I am super happy with the results.  I have a skin condition called melasma which causes over-pigmentation of my skin from any sun exposure.  This serum works!  In just a week I noticed an improvement.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> AMAZING.. Second day applied I started noticing my age &amp; sun spots were fading..</li>
    <li> This has a nice pump dispenser. It&#x27;s goes on easily and stays put so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it running into your eyes. All you need is a tiny little dab so I expect this will last a very long time. It contains the highest percentage of hydroquinone that you can get over the counter and it does lighten dark spots if used consistently for several weeks. I have learned that spots typically return when people stop using hydroquinone so I will be looking into trying an at-home chemical peel at some point as well.</li>
    <li> I have seen no diference so far</li>
    <li> took a while but now it is really working!</li>
    <li> I have used dozens of products to lighten age spots on face with no changes at all. I have been using Murad for about a month now and  have noticed spots and discolorations have significantly lightened but are still visible. I will continue to use and hope that the product will continue to work. I felt the price was affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 weeks and I feel it has lightened dark spots on my face. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It is a nice product. I have seen my skin improvement slightly. Too short time to say, but It is working! I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I tried it and after a few days I was itching, I have very sensitive skin since chemo 8 years ago so when I started itching I had to stop using it, might work well for others.</li>
    <li> I have been faithfully applying the product to my hands and some spots on my arms and have not seen any promising results. I realize that each person may have different experiences, some may take longer to see a change. It does have a chemical odor and sometimes a stinging sensation.</li>
    <li> This product lightend dark spots and leaves skin feeling brighter and clean.  Also used it on a few spots on my arm and it lightented some spots as well.</li>
    <li> Expensive however, It works excellently lighten my age spots! And has coincidently, it real has stopped nearly all my blackheads from cropping up on my nose.</li>
    <li> I just start using this about 2 weeks ago..I have 5 dark brown marks on my face. The one on my cheek is just about gone, NO LIE...2 are fading, and the other 2 are still on the dark side. I dab this on the marks before bed. The smell is strong.But I can say for certain, I have seen results in just 2 weeks.I am totaly shock about the biggest, darkest one on my cheek. About 5 more nights and it should be gone. Wish I would have bought this long ago. IT DOES WORK.May differ for others. But I like it. Will give 5 stars when the other marks are gone....I wish i had before and after pic, to prove it to you...</li>
    <li> I use it in the morning and evening, give it a bit of time and it does fade the brown spots.  have tried many different products and this is the best.</li>
    <li> I saw absolutely no improvement in my small or large brown spots. I used this for 6 full months, nightly.</li>
    <li> happy with the product and the cost</li>
    <li> Like it a lot, but a little too expensive.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this as directed for almost one month now, i have only seen a slight difference. the directions said stop using after 3 months. hopefully by then it will work on me</li>
    <li> The pump does not work.  I used it for the first time this morning, switched the pump to the open, because there is a locked state, and nothing comes out.  I pumped it for more than 3 minutes and nothing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very competitive price</li>
    <li> disappointed in results</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly and in perfect condition. Product works if used religiously as directed . It lightens somewhat but does not erase. Fading is the most it will achieve.</li>
    <li> It has slightly lightened some of my dark spots. I was expecting a more visable difference.</li>
    <li> Really did lighten my dark spots.  I knocked one star off because the product is kind of thick and sticky.</li>
    <li> There is no place to click on contacting the seller. The pump applicator does not work. Yes, I turned it to open. I pumped 100 times and no serum was drawn up nor dispensed. What can be done?</li>
    <li> This product has worked better than others I&#x27;ve tried &amp; it&#x27;s less expensive.I am very happy ! I reccomend it !</li>
    <li> I have used other products such as Obagi Clear which is more expensive than  Murad, and Obagi doesn&#x27;t work for as well as Murad even though Obagi contains Rx strength hydroquinone.  I have a darker complexion being Latin  I have a friend who has fair skin and Obagi worked better for her skin type.  Definitely need to use UVA/UVB protection on face and neck if using either product.  I hope this helps</li>
    <li> Have tried lots of products and this works the fastest and best.  Don&#x27;t get  it if you are looking for something gentle because it contains hydroquinone.  But if you want the age spots to disappear, this is the stuff!</li>
    <li> Great.  Been using it for years.  The product diminishes age spots very well, however, you must use it consistently (a.m. &amp; p.m.) and use UV protection.</li>
    <li> I have used murad products for a while and have bought from this company many times!  Keep up the great service!</li>
    <li> It did not work at all.</li>
    <li> Been using this product about 2 months now and have almost used the entire bottle. I have a few &#x27;age spots&#x27; on my face; one of them is a little larger than the size of an eraser. After reading positive reviews about this I decided to try it. Although I can see some lightening, it&#x27;s not nearly as much as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> It definitely cleared up a dark spot from a cold sore, and lightened under my eyes. But another spot on my face showed no change.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my wife as one day she noticed a very rapid increase in age spots. After a quick checkup with the dr. to make sure nothing was amiss I ordered this. Although a little pricey, works very fast and she is thrilled with the results. You just have to use it consistently and a little drop on the fingertips does the job. This bottle will last some time.</li>
    <li> I decided to try it after reading the good reveiws on it, and after about 6 weeks I can tell a small difference in the appearance of some of my sun spots on my face but not on all. I does not irritate my skin so I will continue to use up the bottle, but will not buy again.</li>
    <li> So I waited till I&#x27;d finished the bottle to give a review....I have fair skin that was random dark spots that began during pregnancy. My dd is now 17mo. I started using this about 5 months ago with no results to date.</li>
    <li> I have seen SOME improvement after 6 weeks, but it smells so bad I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. It smells like putting glue on your face. And my dogs keep trying to lick it off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks now,not much difference</li>
    <li> Smells terrible and made my skin become very raised and bumpy all over. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> I had seen this product on &amp;#34;The Doctors&amp;#34; and decided to give it a try. After only 1 week I noticed my dark sun spots fading.  Now, after about 5 weeks they have almost completely disappeared!</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days and I can already tell a difference in the texture and tone of my skin.  My daughter has been using this Murad product for months and I see a definite improvement in her skin.  I am very happy so far and plan to continue use of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month &amp; haven&#x27;t really gotten the results I wanted.  The main reason being that when I use it on consecutive days, the areas I put it on turn red.  It&#x27;s like I got sun burned in those spots.  So I have to stop using it until the redness goes away.  Now, I have to use it sporadically, like every other day or on the weekends.  Did anyone else have their skin react this way or is it just my skin being too sensitive?</li>
    <li> I have gotten two compliments on my skin recently, and I swear it&#x27;s because of this stuff.  Just bought my second bottle. It&#x27;s my new MUST have product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to lighten some brown spots on my cheek caused by the sun and birth control pills. I&#x27;m on week 4 and I&#x27;ve only noticed a slight difference. I&#x27;m going to use it until the bottle is empty and then update my review. I&#x27;m hoping for at least a 50% reduction by then. If not, im moving onto something else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product doesn&#x27;t get a full 5-star review.  It works for my skin, and I have very troublesome olive Mediterranean skin that is prone to hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other products that simply did NOT work (that had the same promises).  This one DOES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must be good for Mediterranean skin types.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest if you have medium-dark skin, try this.  It will clear up your condition.  If you have lighter Scandinavian skin, this product might not work for you.</li>
    <li> so so. its seems that after 3 months of every night useage, it did lighten the spot just a little. i have one brown age/sun spot of my left cheek ..prolly from the sun shinning into my car window. its gentle. no burning. i plan on going to get further gtreatment at dr. office.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product faithfully twice a day for 2.5 months. I do not see much of a difference, if anything.  I am torn, because there are so many reviews.  This product did not come in a box when I received it, so did I get a fake? Or is the product simply not effective?</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works great, very affective on my age spots, acne scars n acne. I  put it on at night before going to bed. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> no noticeable reduction of dark spots after 1 month of use. will continue to use until gone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using as directed, the bottle is half empty and there is no visible reduction in the color of the age spots on my hands and face.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 2 weeks and, so far, have not noticed any difference whatsoever--will continue with you for several more weeks and see what happens.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Very disappointed.</li>
