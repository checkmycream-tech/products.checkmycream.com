      <li>I&#x27;ve used the pore balm before, and I loved it.</li>

      <li>I love all of these must have pore care products!</li>
      <li>my skin has become flawless and i have no blackheads or large pores.</li>
      <li>Amazing skincare I like it 😁</li>
      <li>However I am most impressed with  golden egg, after washing my face and applying it</li>
      <li>If you just like cute stuff and have a great skin and want just kid around and use it just to make you feel better &amp;</li>
      <li>The steam pack has exfoliating bits in it, but doesn&#x27;t do much to warm my skin.</li>
      <li>It is very soft and smoothes my pores out perfectly.</li>
      <li>you are doing smth great for yourself&amp;#34; go right ahead.</li>
      <li>So that was pretty great.</li>
      <li>The heat is very light but soothing</li>
      <li>My nose is very smooth that foundation just kinda slides off of it without it, and it helps make the makeup cling a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love using this to take off my makeup.</li>
      <li>my skin is more oily than normal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to apply powder, and I get a really nice dewy look with light coverage.</li>
      <li>so i am sure i will not run out.</li>
      <li>i have already re ordered more</li>
      <li>Ok, here is my two cents into Korean cosmetics.</li>
      <li>However I feel once I apply makeup over the top it looses some of the effect</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really in love with the silky pore balm.</li>
      <li>Love all three of the products.</li>
      <li>I love product</li>
      <li>had a good chance to consistently use the steam balm or cooling pack</li>
      <li>has that mild herbally kind of smell</li>
      <li>The smooth balm exceeded my expectations :)&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Ideally after you open your pores with this you would use the tightening pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This set is very fun and cute.</li>
      <li>Basically if you want to use it as cosmetic line that is fine</li>
      <li>and retailer were fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and seems to have a cooling effect when I put it on.</li>
      <li>It calms my irritated skin and makes it baby smooth when I take it off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>my face feels SO SMOOTH.</li>
      <li>These work very well and are a bit on the costly side but good skin care products tend to run higher.</li>
      <li>It can be used to clean (if you&#x27;re not wearing makeup, maybe like in the morning)</li>
      <li>and you buy something that says &amp;#34;it will clean your pores in one use and your clean will be clean and spotless&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Tonymoly is more like throwing bandage on to bleeding wound, if you really want buy stuff that works for you skin.</li>
      <li>I love these products so much.</li>
      <li>very good product, first of all, it smells so good, the lemon fresh, I really like the Blackhead Steam Balm, I feel very smooth after using only a few times, the Cooling Pore Tightening is also works very well for me, I have used this set everyday for a week now, very smooth and silky feel, the pores does tighten a bit but the result is not as good as the steam balm</li>
      <li>white egg is a steam balm which I absolutely LOVE!</li>
      <li>They also have free sample, I got Pure Bbee propolis for baby, Mizon skin recovery, and Mizon aqua bank.</li>
      <li>very silky smooth to apply it</li>
      <li>definitely worth buying</li>
      <li>It is not going to do anything for your skin as far as making it better (as a treatment).</li>
      <li>It turns white the more you scrub</li>
      <li>With this set you will see the results after first use.</li>
      <li>If you have really oily skin this would be a lifesaver to use before makeup in the morning!</li>
      <li>First, I just wanted to share that I just received the item.</li>
      <li>ok if you plan on using it as a cosmetics not skin care (by no accounts its a skin care) if you want to refresh the skin and maybe diminish big pores before maybe night out or smth.</li>
      <li>first time I used it I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but after using it once or twice a week for a bit I noticed I really like the way it makes my pores look.</li>
      <li>It is an absolute garage.</li>
      <li>It really makes the bb cream stick.</li>
      <li>: I really like this.</li>
      <li>The silky smooth balm as a primer is definitely divine!</li>
      <li>and I feel it really helps to loosen up your pores so it can clean deep</li>
      <li>This particular kit is (I guess)</li>
      <li>The white egg really cleans up my blackheads and the brown egg makes them nice and tight.</li>
      <li>The silky smooth balm looks like its old because the cream is dry and it doesnt fill the spaces around it</li>
      <li>They work wonders on my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a gooey consistency, but you only need a small amount.</li>
      <li>My only issue is they take up some much needed counter space but</li>
      <li>The tight masque has a fluffy mousse texture unlike any other clay masque I&#x27;ve used, and it made my skin feel pretty nice afterwards.</li>
      <li>But not after I used tolymoly new egg pore set, just after one use, my skin became so much cleaner, nose doesn&#x27;t have any black heads.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just like any other clay mask it sucks up excess oil and kind of tries up.</li>

<li> Trust me, I have had a life long skin issues and have tried everything from prescription to different brands of skin care.</li>
<li> but it will do squat for your skin in short or long term.</li>
<li> These were a lot bigger than I expected.</li>
<li> I have learn over several tries that Korean cosmetics are based on &amp;#34;faking&amp;#34;</li>
<li> When you open it,  the beads or the scrubs is falling down and for me its look like dry</li>
<li> the cooling mask definitely helps cool off and tightens pores after washing my face with lukewarm water to get remove the product I finish washing my face off with cold water to close my pores.  </li>
<li> For me I rub it on the middle of my chin, my nose area and a little bit of my forehead.</li>
<li> It not a real result</li>
<li> My package came sooner then expected.</li>
<li> It melts any makeup, dirt or oil on your face and turns white as it heats up very slightly.</li>
<li> amount of these products doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot, but a little goes a very long way.</li>
<li> Works well, looks just as pictured, delivered in timely manner (early actually) but the shipping made the product expensive.</li>
<li> It makes a lovely base for my makeup.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m about half way through each one.</li>
<li> You know this feeling when you have black dots on your nose</li>
<li> I have noticed less blackheads though.</li>
<li> Well it never worked for me, all the time I would rinse the product of my face, black heads would still be there.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now</li>
<li> Exceedingly small amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
<li> but I am not sure if it suppose to look like this.</li>
<li> It slowly gets rid of the oil and gunk that&#x27;s caught up in there.</li>
<li> If you really serious about your skin invest in BHA and AHA products</li>

    <li> Works well, looks just as pictured, delivered in timely manner (early actually) but the shipping made the product expensive.</li>
    <li> These work very well and are a bit on the costly side but good skin care products tend to run higher.</li>
    <li> This set is very fun and cute. The only reason I took off one star is because they don&#x27;t seem to have lasting long term effects.&lt;br /&gt;The gold egg is a primer/pore smoother. It is very soft and smoothes my pores out perfectly. However I feel once I apply makeup over the top it looses some of the effect and I notice later on in the afternoon my skin is more oily than normal.&lt;br /&gt;The white egg is a steam balm which I absolutely LOVE! It&#x27;s kind of a gooey consistency, but you only need a small amount. I love using this to take off my makeup. It melts any makeup, dirt or oil on your face and turns white as it heats up very slightly. The heat is very light but soothing and I feel it really helps to loosen up your pores so it can clean deep down.&lt;br /&gt;The tan egg is the face mask. It&#x27;s light and seems to have a cooling effect when I put it on. It calms my irritated skin and makes it baby smooth when I take it off.&lt;br /&gt;The amount of these products doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot, but a little goes a very long way. I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now and I&#x27;m about half way through each one.</li>

    <li> great product for pores.</li>
    <li> Amazing skincare I like it 😁</li>
    <li> very good product, first of all, it smells so good, the lemon fresh, I really like the Blackhead Steam Balm, I feel very smooth after using only a few times, the Cooling Pore Tightening is also works very well for me, I have used this set everyday for a week now, very smooth and silky feel, the pores does tighten a bit but the result is not as good as the steam balm</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I will come back 2 weeks from now with before and after pic. First, I just wanted to share that I just received the item. 12 days before I actually received the egg pore. When I opened it the package, the boxes are already opened and the lid seems someone have already opened too. The silky smooth balm looks like its old because the cream is dry and it doesnt fill the spaces around it (hope you could see it in the pic). Then the blackhead steam balm, when you open the egg container, the oil is already oozing out of the lid (you could see it shine and I haven&#x27;t open the lid) They also have free sample, I got Pure Bbee propolis for baby, Mizon skin recovery, and Mizon aqua bank.Lastly, the tightening cooling pack. When you open it,  the beads or the scrubs is falling down and for me its look like dry but I am not sure if it suppose to look like this.</li>
    <li> Love all three of the products. They work wonders on my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Ok, here is my two cents into Korean cosmetics. It is an absolute garage. This particular kit is (I guess) ok if you plan on using it as a cosmetics not skin care (by no accounts its a skin care) if you want to refresh the skin and maybe diminish big pores before maybe night out or smth. It is not going to do anything for your skin as far as making it better (as a treatment). I have learn over several tries that Korean cosmetics are based on &amp;#34;faking&amp;#34; the results, such as using whitening agents that used in sun care (not hydroquinone) to make your face &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; and etc. It not a real result, my point is. If you really serious about your skin invest in BHA and AHA products (Paula&#x27;s Choice are very strong and effective), invest in very good Israel line Holy Land Cosmetics. Basically if you want to use it as cosmetic line that is fine but it will do squat for your skin in short or long term. Trust me, I have had a life long skin issues and have tried everything from prescription to different brands of skin care. Tonymoly is more like throwing bandage on to bleeding wound, if you really want buy stuff that works for you skin. Do not waist your money on this one. If you just like cute stuff and have a great skin and want just kid around and use it just to make you feel better &amp;#34;that you are doing smth great for yourself&amp;#34; go right ahead. Its all depends on your goals, age and skin condition.</li>
    <li> the blackhead pore one might take awhile to work and remove blackheads but it works it helped eradicate some of my stubborn blackheads after 3 uses.  the cooling mask definitely helps cool off and tightens pores after washing my face with lukewarm water to get remove the product I finish washing my face off with cold water to close my pores.  The silky smooth balm as a primer is definitely divine! very silky smooth to apply it has that mild herbally kind of smell it&#x27;s all good keeps my face matte for 12 hours and makes my tony moly bcdation adhere to my face with no transfer whatsoever.I love these products so much.</li>
    <li> My package came sooner then expected. So that was pretty great. I love product definitely worth buying</li>
    <li> I love all of these must have pore care products! My only issue is they take up some much needed counter space but even then I will repurchase these again.</li>
    <li> So-so. Somewhat covers pores. It helps.</li>
    <li> This is the best pore set I&#x27;ve ever tried! You know this feeling when you have black dots on your nose and you buy something that says &amp;#34;it will clean your pores in one use and your clean will be clean and spotless&amp;#34;. Well it never worked for me, all the time I would rinse the product of my face, black heads would still be there. But not after I used tolymoly new egg pore set, just after one use, my skin became so much cleaner, nose doesn&#x27;t have any black heads. With this set you will see the results after first use. Definitely will repurchase!</li>
    <li> this is the holy grail of skincare. since using it  (i am about two weeks in) my skin has become flawless and i have no blackheads or large pores. i have already re ordered more so i am sure i will not run out.</li>
    <li> These eggs are amazing! The white egg really cleans up my blackheads and the brown egg makes them nice and tight. However I am most impressed with  golden egg, after washing my face and applying it my face feels SO SMOOTH. It&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the pore balm before, and I loved it. It makes a lovely base for my makeup. My nose is very smooth that foundation just kinda slides off of it without it, and it helps make the makeup cling a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the steam balm and the clay pore tightener, I decided I&#x27;d use them several times before I make a judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Steam oil: I really like this. It&#x27;s not oily at all! It can be used to clean (if you&#x27;re not wearing makeup, maybe like in the morning) but I like to use it after I wash my face. What you do is you get a bit on your fingers and you rub it on the spots where you have issues with blackheads. For me I rub it on the middle of my chin, my nose area and a little bit of my forehead. It gets rid of the oils and it loosens up your pores because it has a bit of a warming effect. It turns white the more you scrub and it says to do it for a good 3-5 minutes. I dont have the patience for that so I just do it for 2-3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but after using it once or twice a week for a bit I noticed I really like the way it makes my pores look. It slowly gets rid of the oil and gunk that&#x27;s caught up in there. Ideally after you open your pores with this you would use the tightening pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tightening pack: It&#x27;s a clay mask that you put on your open pores. It&#x27;s just like any other clay mask it sucks up excess oil and kind of tries up. It&#x27;s convenient to use after the blackhead out oil because it closes everything up. If you have really oily skin this would be a lifesaver to use before makeup in the morning!</li>
    <li> These were a lot bigger than I expected. I&#x27;m really in love with the silky pore balm. I use it as a primer,  after toning and moisturizing, before applying my bb cream. It really makes the bb cream stick. I don&#x27;t need to apply powder, and I get a really nice dewy look with light coverage. It helps to control oil and definitely minimizes pores. The tight masque has a fluffy mousse texture unlike any other clay masque I&#x27;ve used, and it made my skin feel pretty nice afterwards. The steam pack has exfoliating bits in it, but doesn&#x27;t do much to warm my skin. I have noticed less blackheads though. All in all, great buy if not just for the silky balm.</li>
