<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A wonderful product!  I love this stuff!  I just ordered some more because my husband keeps using mine. It is truly wonderful. Aloe - nourishing, healthy, gentle, fabulous! That&#x27;s it... the plain and simple truth!</li>
    <li> Product is exactly what I ordered rich and creamy great for moisturizing</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for many years...it is an excellent face cream. There are two brands of this cream, vitamin E and the aloe vera. The aloe vera it is especially good if you are allergic to vitamin e. I highly recommend this face cream for anyone!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this since I couldn&#x27;t get my usual brand. It works good and is a good value as well.</li>
    <li> This skin cream did not disappoint.  It has a thick consistency, and has renewed the look of my hands.  I did some mechanic work, and my hands got lines in them and various cuts and burns, working on a hot motor.  I wear gloves now when I work on the car, and this cream is helping to heal the skin damage I already have. It lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I got it on Amazon.com it arrived timely.</li>
    <li> First, I want to say this cream does make skin feel very soft, supple and emollient... BUT after reading the ingredients, towards the end of the list, it contains parabens :(&lt;br /&gt;I am pregnant and it is something that should be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t return it, for $7 it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a list of the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera extract&lt;br /&gt;Aqua(water)&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl Stearate&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Stearic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol&lt;br /&gt;Stearyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Collagen&lt;br /&gt;Elastin&lt;br /&gt;Tocopherol Acetate (Vitamin E)&lt;br /&gt;Squalane&lt;br /&gt;Triticum Vulgare (Wheat)Germ Oil&lt;br /&gt;Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower)Seed oil&lt;br /&gt;Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed oil&lt;br /&gt;Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A)&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) oil&lt;br /&gt;Carbomer&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol &amp; Diazolidinyl Urea &amp; Methylparaben &amp; Propylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Parfum (Fragrance)</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin.  I am on a constant search for the perfect skincream.  Wintertime is the worst with overheated homes, stores, cars, etc. I came across this cream in an old-fashioned drugstore - and have blessed the day ever since.  This successfully moisturizes my skin, makes my skin feel a whole lot better without making me feel like I&#x27;ve been greased.  My skin loves it.  It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
    <li> I this product on my feet in the winter time. Aloe Vera products (lotions, creams . . .ect), works wonder.</li>
    <li> As always the product is exactly what my mother need and works works wonders. I will be ordering more soon</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 30 years.  I use it in place of shaving cream and of course it does not dry out your skin like shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Superior texture and smell, pump free container, easily absorbed and affordably priced. Simply blows away the competition. If you are already into aloe, this source is the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son who has a skin condition. This product helps his skin stay smooth. He loves it!</li>
    <li> This cream is incredible, my skin feels infinitely more soft and supple after every use and the feeling lasts all day!  It absorbs quickly, smells great and it&#x27;s like getting two for the price of one with the dual packaging.  I keep one by my bed and one in my bathroom, it is my new &#x27;go to&#x27; cream.</li>
    <li> I Love, Love, it.  I&#x27; recomended several of my friend and have given them as gift.  Keep them coming.  As the comedian said,&lt;br /&gt;I put it ALL OVER MY BODY111111111111111.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream daily for a week and I already see a smooth difference on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t smell funky nor is it thick and hard to rub on. On the contrary, it had no scent and easy to apply all over the body. Definitely going to restock - thank you for the prompt delivery too!</li>
    <li> I love this cream as an addition to the ingredients to the lotion I make.  Perfect for winter months when extra moisture is needed.</li>
    <li> It heals as it softens. My friend&#x27;s hands get very dry and crack. This product has relieved those problems. The price is right and does the job, as stated.</li>
    <li> main ingredient is aloe vera renews your skin and leaves it feeling moist recommend for dry skin and skin that has been exposed to the sun</li>
    <li> I did not notice any positive results by using  this cream.&lt;br /&gt;It did not have any bad side effects either. So you may not need it.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating without being slippery!  Soaks into the skin well!  Great value!!!  Will definately buy again!&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl B. - Bradenton, FL</li>
    <li> This cream is EVERYTHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to lotions/creams/moisturizers, but Fruit of the Earth exceeded my expectations - to say the least.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream on my face and hands over the past few days, and it&#x27;s really helped stop the dryness and cracking that would typically occur in this horrifically bipolar NYC cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too thick, but not so thin that you feel like it&#x27;s going to wear off in 10 minutes, so that&#x27;s good.  In addition, it lasts like forever.  I typically don&#x27;t have to reapply - even after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a cheap alternative to crappy creams on the market, so you might as well give it a try.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I really do love this.. I use it from my face to my toes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Nonna</li>
    <li> It does create silky skin, not exceptionally great though. I read no where that it had fragrance. It&#x27;s good for feet, knees and elbows.</li>
    <li> I really like it very much ! it&#x27;s very good and useful! But it is not alcohol free. So I can&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
    <li> It smells unnatural.  I still use it but I would rather have purchased something that I could have smelled first.  I would not have chosen this product.  It&#x27;s certainly wise to consider that before any online purchase.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR AFTER SUN EXPOSURE OR TO MOISTURIZE DRY HANDS AND SKIN.</li>
    <li> My husband asked me to get him some Aloe Vera Cream to use on his dry arms.  After using it for a couple of weeks, he reports that he is very happy with this product.  He likes the consistency and the healing properties.  He likes it so much, he said he will try it for redness (allergies) on his face.</li>
    <li> These are awesome&lt;br /&gt;I am buying a second set</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I have used and reviewed this product in the past. It has not changed. It is still good for the things aloe is good for.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream. It&#x27;s a little heavier than what I would prefer but soaks in nicely. Great deal for the money</li>
    <li> Amazing Product and Spectacular Results! I&#x27;ve been searching and trying many different over the counter solutions  to dry skin and Fruit of the Earth Bogo Cream Aloe Vera has by far exceeded my expectations! After applying a small portion to my hands and face I saw immediate results along with a pleasant aroma that made me feel fresh and clean. The effects of the aloe vera lasted throughout the day so I didn&#x27;t have to constantly apply it. And it didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy looking. The ingredients contained in this purse size container has made me feel like I found a fountain youth, I will be purchasing more for myself and daughters in the near future!</li>
    <li> My skin is soft now.  The peeling after my cast was removed has stopped &amp; my scars are healing up nicely</li>
    <li> I use this cream mainly on my face.  The results are excellent!  I have oily skin and this cream makes my face shine with radiance and not oiliness.  My skin stays moisturised all day long.  I have acne issues and some of the products I put on my face are very drying, this cream really works to moisturise the sensitive area around my mouth.  Further, it does not cause any breakouts!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Cream gets the job done beautifully. It works, as advertised, and the price for 2 jars is cheaper than I can find for 1 in any store. The aloe vera arrived in small packaging that fit inside my mailbox and was packaged inside a plastic, bubble wrap-like bag, protecting the jars from cracking in transit. And arrived ahead of schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other aloe vera creams are normally so thick that it takes forever to absorb, greatly slowing down my morning routine, but not Fruit of the Earth. While this cream is has a slightly thick texture, it still absorbed quickly and did not slow down my routine any. I will not go back to my old aloe vera cream. Ever. It is especially great for using on your hands, elbows, &amp; knees and works much better than any regular lotion you might pick up for these areas. The cream is white and the smell is pleasant and definitely not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the jar, 4 oz., also make it easy to carry with you anywhere you go. Just toss it in your gym bag, keep it at your desk at work, keep in your diaper bag, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> One problem with most skin creams is the scent, but this Aloe Vera cream has a very refreshing, floral scent to it that I wasn&#x27;t ashamed to walk around with. It&#x27;s not an instant relief for dry skin, but after a few nights of use, I could feel the moisture return to my hands. It has healed a good portion of my calluses and loosened my skin a little bit so it&#x27;s not so taught and painful when it gets dry. I just started using it on my face, and I have noticed an improvement in my morning dryness. I don&#x27;t seem to be as flaky. I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s ability to cure signs of aging. It&#x27;s been a few days since I started it on my crows feet, and they&#x27;re still noticeable.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this cream, but then when I used it it  broke out my skin :(&lt;br /&gt;Not right for me.</li>
    <li> Fruit of The Earth aloe vera hand lotion is, in my opnion, the best!  I have tried lots of them over the years and this one is just the perfect consistancy.  It is not greasy.  It just seems to soften rough dry skin, leaving it feeling so enriched.  Since I always use the lotion I decided to try the cream, is a bit more thick and in the dead of winter when skin really becomes dry it is wonderful.  The consistancy works well to soften my feet as well.  Can&#x27;t live without it- and that&#x27;s not an overstatement!</li>
    <li> This lotion absorbs quick yet you can tell the moisture is lasting.  The smell is strong but fresh smelling.  Ill be buying again soon!</li>
    <li> This product was amazing. With most cheap creams you get pasty gunk that oils more than it smooths, while this cream actually works wonders. It has an amazingly smooth texture, a beautiful smell, and is affordable.</li>
    <li> I bought this crem to help heal an extremely dry patch on my neck and around my hairline on my forehead.  I do water aerobics 2x a week for 2 hrs at a time and the chlorine was making this spot unbearable.  I apply this cream through out the day and at night before I go to bed and so far so good.  The spot healed within a couple days.  I started using it on my 6 yr olds legs and arms because he has eczema really bad in the winter.  We have a hard time using any lotion because he screams that it burns.  I convinced him to let me try this and no screams.  His skin is returning to smooth.  I gave the extra tub to my niece who swims on the swim team because she has bad eczema as well and she is loving this cream too.  My sis in law uses it on her hands that are extremely dry and chapped from frequent washing (she works for a dentist) and she says her hands are healing up nicely.  We all like that it absords quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.  We will all be definately buying more of this!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face for my spots and it has helped me a lot. I am happy to have two. It came in a timely manner and I appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Super moisturizing and I really like it for my body.  I wish the fragrance wasn&#x27;t so strong as it made my eyes water when I applied it to my face.  I will use the Vitamin E cream by Fruit of the Earth on my face (love the creaminess and the scent is not as strong as this one!)  I wish they would come out with one that is fragrance free!</li>
    <li> I WAS IN RED RIVER VALLEY NEW MEXICO OVER CHRISTMAS, IN A SNOW STORM NO LESS, SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW DRY ONES SKIN CAN BECOME. I WAS DESPERATE SO I PURCHASED THIS CREAM AT THE LOCAL MARKET AND WOW I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. MY SKIN HAS NEVER FELT SO GOOD. I USE IT DAILY ON MY WHOLE BODY, AFTER SHOWERING AND IT KEEPS MY SKIN SOFT AND MOIST ALL DAY. WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and like it. The price is still good and the cream moisturizes my skin and it has aloe vera.</li>
    <li> This product is greasy, and it has a powdery smell - like cheap creams.  Well, what can you expect since it is a cheaper product....I won&#x27;t buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> This is a great little lotion. It leaves your skin feeling very soft. It has a light powdery smell to it (not that heavy powder smell) and soaks in pretty quick. Little bit goes a long way with this lotion so it&#x27;s definitely great on the pocket too.</li>
    <li> This product is great, clean smelling, fast absorbing, leaves skin moisturized and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This product is in a buy one get one deal,  and has a very very economical price. I have bought it&lt;br /&gt;2 times.  (4 containers) and just love it !!)  I would highly recommend this Aloe Vera crème to&lt;br /&gt;anyone, men or women and it is gentle enough for children.  Stock-Up !</li>
    <li> Very smooth with a delicate scent &amp; not at all greasy or sticky even in this humid weather. Have shared this with a neighbor!</li>
    <li> This products first ingedient is aloe vera extract. Most aloe vera products contain very little of the good stuff. This product is terrific and the price is great. Its a very most and soothing cream without ant greasy feel.Love IT!</li>
    <li> I worked for Walgreens. I use to get big jars of it really cheap. It works real good. They quit selling it. I was very happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> Great price. It soothes my dry skin very well. Although it can be greasy sometimes, I cannot complain with this cheap price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m doing radiation treatments and skin care is essential. This cream is  an excellent moisturizer. I use it after treatment and at night.</li>
    <li> Looking for a really good cream?  This is it! The texture and feel are wonderful. It is not sticky or greasy.  I use it on my face, hands, feet.  After spending 4 times more for other creams, a friend gave me a jar of Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera - I was amazed - good results - no breakouts! Even better - I got it on Amazon and never had to leave home. Try it - you will love it.</li>
    <li> Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Cream is a wonderful product. It is great for rough dry skin. Doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into your skin and smells wonderful. The price was great. This is a great product for the winter months.</li>
    <li> I realy like this product. It makes your face feel very soft with the added benift of having Aloe Vera in it</li>
    <li> This product has kept me looking young for over 20 years.  Would look really old without it.  When I have yielded to the temptation to try other products, I have always regretted it, because this is the only product that keeps deep wrinkles at bay. The other aloe vera  cream with vitamin E does not achieve the same results for me, so I would be devastated if this formula were to be discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love this product. First my Mom, now me, and now my girls. I have even given away to friends.</li>
    <li> Although I have been using this cream on my face, I wish it had a delightful fragrance. It actually has no smell which may be good for some people but I like fragrance. It is thicker than a lotion but does absorb well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years and would not do without it.  Glad to see it still on the internet as I cannot find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cream. Been using it for a few years now. The only NON greasy cream. Use it for extreme dry skin on my hands and feet. can see a remarkable difference after just one use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard aloe vera is great for sunburns; however, this product only temporarily calms the wrath.  I also purchased to use as a moisturizer which it does very well.</li>
    <li> Has really helped reduce the cracking and peeling of my feet.  Not oily and absorbs into the skin readily.  Little to no scent.  Also use on hands and elbows during winter.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Always used it...for years...</li>
    <li> This cream feels good and not overwhelming by way of scent or heaviness of a face cream. Hasnt made me break out eitheir. Feels so good youll want it all over your body!</li>
    <li> I have used this produce 2x a day - every day - on my face and neck for the past 15 years.  I have dry, sensitive skin and Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Cream is the best product I have found that keeps my skin smooth and supple.  I found it originally at Wal Mart, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere after the first couple years so I started buying from the company direct.  Then, I found it on Amazon a couple years ago and have ordered from them since.  It is affordable and works for me.  I would suggest you try it if you have dry, sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would have more natural ingredients so it wasn&#x27;t a good buy for me. I wanted to use it on my face for more moisture but I feel all of the additives would probably clog or aggrevate my skin. I gave it to my son to use as a lotion.</li>
