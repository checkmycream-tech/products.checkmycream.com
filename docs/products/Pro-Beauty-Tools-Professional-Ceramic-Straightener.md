      <li>:) I love how it leaves my hair when I straighten it or when I do curls.</li>
      <li>And it is such a great deal on Amazon!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
      <li>I could not find it in stores when I dropped it one to many times and it no longer worked.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many straighteners that just don&#x27;t straighten my hair without making it feel toasted and burnt.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done my research on hair care over the years and know how to take better care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite straightener since I discovered it about 3 years ago.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>Quick heat up, high heat, great product!</li>
      <li>Love this flat iron thee best!</li>
      <li>I loved the first one I had</li>
      <li>Could not be any more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Glides smoothly over your hair without tugging or ripping.</li>
      <li>heats up very quickly.</li>
      <li>No other straightener can get my hair to look this great.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like it, it must be for baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>Trust me, it makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>6 months later it is still working great.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!!!</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully depending on the grade of the hair, if your hair is thin it will pass once, if it&#x27;s thicker it will require more than one pass (I&#x27;m not going to lie) but overall good product.</li>
      <li>of all the products I use to get ready in the mornings, this is definitely my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have coarse curly hair and it takes a great straightener to get curly hair to look perfectly straight without frizz.</li>
      <li>LOVVVE THESE THEY GET VERY HOT</li>
      <li>I use this thing along with argan oil from HSI which can also be found on Amazon and my hair feels strong while straight and stays that way all day..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many a flat iron in my day and none are this reliable and easy on the hair.</li>
      <li>Light weighted and heats fast.</li>
      <li>It straightens nicely, the curls last</li>
      <li>like the nice long cord.</li>
      <li>Works great...heats up quickly and it works faster than any flat iron I&#x27;ve used, and the cord is longer than most.  </li>
      <li>High quality flat iron for a much better price!</li>
      <li>And many times, it would just curl back and poof up.</li>
      <li>But when it was shipped to me, the part that connects the tool together felt looser than my first one.</li>
      <li>Not as hot or damaging to my hair either</li>
      <li>and I was amazed at how well it straightened my hair while making it feel smooth and natural.</li>
      <li>Hot enough to quickly straighten and smooth my curly hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really nice straightener, better than my more expensive ones!</li>
      <li>I just wish the description had been a little more accurate.</li>
      <li>Love this flat iron.second pair .first</li>
      <li>I love how my hair feels after straightening, but I dislike how long it takes.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron and the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>I have really curly hair</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t bring myself to spend the money on a real Chi, so I bought this...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Would HIGHLY recommend!</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair shiny and straight.  </li>
      <li>you straighten your hair everyday,I really recommend getting this one.</li>
      <li>and my hair feels very damaged after two uses in a row.</li>
      <li>My hair looks straight and shiny.</li>
      <li>Long extension cord for easy use.</li>
      <li>other than that, I love the product</li>
      <li>I have frizzy, curly hair, and I bought this straightener because many of the other reviewers have hair like mine.</li>
      <li>I have to squeeze pretty hard to get the plates to straighten my very fine hair.</li>
      <li>Decent price - works</li>
      <li>This is my second one and I will buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>That extra dough is worth it.</li>
      <li>And it leaves my hair shiny, not dull.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this because it said new, yet it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Had this exact one for years before I lost it and bought the same one again!</li>
      <li>This is the exact same model she has always used.</li>
      <li>I thought this would not straighten my hair but was pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>first one faied and replaced it with a second one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This was my second Pro straightener purchase, but the first one I did online.</li>
      <li>Most other straighteners will have your hair starting to frizz within an hour, not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
      <li>The same as the CHI, but much cheaper.</li>
      <li>It also leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>No problems so far.</li>
      <li>It has taken much abuse with traveling and falling numerous times onto the tile floor.  </li>
      <li>I needed  this my old one broke</li>
      <li>It seemed more difficult to keep the tool clamped together and were not flush on top of each other.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, thin hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVVVE THESE THEY GET VERY HOT</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.second pair .first pair lasted 4years before giving out and it worked over drive on all this hair</li>
    <li> High quality flat iron for a much better price!</li>
    <li> Second one of these I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;While I like the performance, and price.&lt;br /&gt;My first one faied and replaced it with a second one.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this one lasts longer, the weak link seems to be in the circuit board that controls the unit.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it can not be beat</li>
    <li> No problems so far. Light weighted and heats fast.</li>
    <li> Ive had a Chi and a Hai and this one works JUST as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better. This one didn&#x27;t  straighten my hair well. Plus it had a smell to it. Didn&#x27;t heat well, so that caused my hair to not get straighten well.</li>
    <li> I recently bought four different flat irons and had to return all of them because of poor performance.  I decided to go with the same name, Pro Beauty Tools, as the one I was looking to replace.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers off while I&#x27;m trying to straighten my hair and it also doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair causing breakage... which all of the other flat irons did.  It leaves my hair shiny and straight.  I love this flat iron and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is unbelievably curly and this straighter tames it with ease. I have tried a lot of other straighteners and none of them compare to this one. It makes my hair shine beautifully and keeps my hair straight ALL day!! Most other straighteners will have your hair starting to frizz within an hour, not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the products I use to get ready in the mornings, this is definitely my favorite. I have reccomended this to many friends that have commented on how good my hair looks.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels after straightening, but I dislike how long it takes. I have to squeeze pretty hard to get the plates to straighten my very fine hair. I also dislike how there is only one heat option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this straightener because I like my hair at the end, but I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Well priced, item came earlier than expected. 6 months later it is still working great. My more expensive Chi broke in less than a year.</li>
    <li> I needed  this my old one broke and this is the one I prefer, I like how my hair looks and feels after using it.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully depending on the grade of the hair, if your hair is thin it will pass once, if it&#x27;s thicker it will require more than one pass (I&#x27;m not going to lie) but overall good product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener! It works WONDERFULLY on my thick, curly, frizzy hair. My hair looks straight and shiny. It heats up immediately and has lasted a long time. And it is such a great deal on Amazon! SO much cheaper than other straighteners. The same as the CHI, but much cheaper. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay all that money for Chi&#x27;s or for other name brand straighteners. This was a wonderful no-regrets purchase, for sure.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, curly hair, and I bought this straightener because many of the other reviewers have hair like mine. It works just like a Chi, and takes me about 30 min. to straighten my hair. I keep it for two days, and it&#x27;s always perfect. For the price, it totally beats my last Chi.</li>
    <li> Showed up quickly &amp; I love this iron, wrks better than a Chi! Not as hot or damaging to my hair either</li>
    <li> I have extremely long, thick, curly hair and this cut my time down by half and looked great with no remaining waves. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Works great...heats up quickly and it works faster than any flat iron I&#x27;ve used, and the cord is longer than most.  I happen to like that the on-off switch is inside the unit....just unplug it and it&#x27;s off.  Plus, with the right heat pouch it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!!! Works perfectly!! Couldn&#x27;t be more happy. I will use this seller again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife to replace the Pro Beauty straightener she dearly loved. This is the exact same model she has always used. Wonderful straightener. The problem is, when delivered, the box looked well worn and scuffed. When my wife opened the box, the straightener had definitely been used. It had a small chip at the end and had makeup on it. I purchased this because it said new, yet it wasn&#x27;t. My wife has tried it, said it works great, and we are going to keep it. I just wish the description had been a little more accurate. Four stars because you can&#x27;t beat the quality!</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron thee best!</li>
    <li> I love my pro iron! It straightens nicely, the curls last and my hair straightens softly instead of feeling dry</li>
    <li> I have coarse curly hair and it takes a great straightener to get curly hair to look perfectly straight without frizz. This has been my favorite straightener since I discovered it about 3 years ago. No other straightener can get my hair to look this great. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many a flat iron in my day and none are this reliable and easy on the hair. No pulling or issues clamping. Quick heat up, high heat, great product!</li>
    <li> This is my second one and I will buy more in the future. Great product and comparable to the CHI, which I&#x27;ve also had. It will last for several years.</li>
    <li> Iron works great,  just wish you could lower the heat setting</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;Straightens curly hair&lt;br /&gt;KEEPS hair straight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Dosent create &amp;#34;flips&amp;#34; in your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really nice straightener, better than my more expensive ones! Would HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it and the price is great, I used to buy it at Bed Bath and Beyond but my store no longer has it and found it here and it is $10 cheaper :) I love how it leaves my hair when I straighten it or when I do curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow out my thick wavy hair (I&#x27;m a guy). I&#x27;ve tried many straighteners that just don&#x27;t straighten my hair without making it feel toasted and burnt. And many times, it would just curl back and poof up. I would just end up frying my hair and end up cutting it because the split ends were so bad. My friend let me borrow this straightener one day and I was amazed at how well it straightened my hair while making it feel smooth and natural. He eventually gave it to me because he stopped using it. I use this thing along with argan oil from HSI which can also be found on Amazon and my hair feels strong while straight and stays that way all day.. I&#x27;ve done my research on hair care over the years and know how to take better care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you straighten your hair everyday,I really recommend getting this one. It has ceramic plates which is way easier on your hair than metal. That extra dough is worth it. Trust me, it makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Great tool! Had this exact one for years before I lost it and bought the same one again! Could not be any more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Glides smoothly over your hair without tugging or ripping. heats up very quickly. Long extension cord for easy use. Hot enough to quickly straighten and smooth my curly hair.</li>
    <li> The iron is the perfect heat. I have curly, frizzy, thick and coarse hair and it straightens it well. I has only one heat setting @ 110 F. I thought this would not straighten my hair but was pleasantly surprised! I would definitely buy this again. It also leaves my hair soft and shiny. My last iron dried my hair so this is a winner. I had tried this before at my daughter in laws and liked it so well, I decided to order it on Amazon. I feel it is as good as a Chi.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t bring myself to spend the money on a real Chi, so I bought this... and I love it!</li>
    <li> Seemed to work well, until I noticed that my hair ends were disappearing.  I do not recommend this dangerous product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, it must be for baby fine hair. Wished I kept the packaging so I  could get my money back</li>
    <li> I had one previously and it lasted for about 6years.  It has taken much abuse with traveling and falling numerous times onto the tile floor.  I could not find it in stores when I dropped it one to many times and it no longer worked.  I bought 2 other flat irons to replace it and they just could not compare.  So I found it on Amazon and ordered it and it was cheaper than I paid in the store with the 1st one i bought.  I love it. It withstands abuse.  I have very fine, thin hair.  My hair does not curl or volume well; but with this product, it holds all day.  The other replacements I tried left my hair flat to my head after about 5hrs.  This one does not.  And it leaves my hair shiny, not dull.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like some of the other ones do.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> This was my second Pro straightener purchase, but the first one I did online. I loved the first one I had and when my roommate broke it I wanted to get another one to replace it. But when it was shipped to me, the part that connects the tool together felt looser than my first one. It seemed more difficult to keep the tool clamped together and were not flush on top of each other. It could have been damaged during shipping, but it was hard to tell. other than that, I love the product</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as I have expected. Seems to not straighten my hair that well and my hair feels very damaged after two uses in a row.</li>
    <li> Decent price - works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the nice long cord.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my granddaughter and based on the fact that she uses it almost daily I have to assume that it is a good unit.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair straightener! Don&#x27;t know how it is so cheap because it&#x27;s the best quality I have ever gotten. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned Owned it 3 years still works great</li>
    <li> This is my every day flat iron! I have really curly hair and it works so well!! Cuts time down too</li>
