<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not like how this worked. :/ I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This did not expand like a normal sponge blender when wet. Instead it pushed my makeup around my face and didn&#x27;t not help stipple in my makeup at all!</li>
    <li> good prduct amazing delivery satisfied</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Not the worst quality but it definitely doesn&#x27;t compare to the real beauty blenders.</li>
    <li> I like the shape of the blender because it can get right into the lines on my face but it has been peeling and breaking apart since I took it out of the package even though I use little pressure.</li>
    <li> These are very rough even once you wet them</li>
    <li> It is great for blending concealer or for highlight!!! It can be use dry or wet!!! Love the beauty blender!</li>
    <li> my dog chewed it up before my second use, but i wasn&#x27;t that big of a fan of it in the first place</li>
    <li> Worth giving this a try.  Gives a nice even and flawless finish with cream foundation says you can use it with powders in youtube reviews but I&#x27;ve never used it for that.</li>
    <li> This sponge comes very cheaply made and the quality is horrible. For the same price I paid with shipping I got a better one at my local retail store. NOT pro.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this makeup blending sponge. It allows me to apply and blend my foundation perfectly.</li>
    <li> I like this alot,It blends in very well with my makeup i use it everyday for schoool and work.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Wow! As comparable to the Beauty Blender only $25.00 cheaper!</li>
    <li> I being using it for a long time still the same, as the day i bought it, and it does not have any cracks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay sponge not very impress and it&#x27;s not like the original blending sponge :(</li>
    <li> love love love it.  took forever to come but when i got it.  it was like, where you been all my life ? lol.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the beauty blender. It repels makeup and doesn&#x27;t blend at all. I gave them to my daughter to sponge paint with</li>
    <li> I really loved this product its especially great for the smokey eye look! I even use it for everyday makeup to make it look smoother</li>
    <li> I bought this as a cheaper alternative to my beauty blender. It looks the same right? Well, it&#x27;s not! This sponge is really dense and hard...doesn&#x27;t apply foundation well at all. Didn&#x27;t feel bad spending the money since it was so cheap, but if you are looking for a dupe for the beauty blender keep looking</li>
    <li> Great while it lasted. The material a little different and after a while it wasn&#x27;t soft and it started to break apart. It did last a good time though.</li>
    <li> WORST SPONGE EVER!! Complete waste of time and such a hoax! So annoyed that I bought 5 of them!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to compare it to the Beauty Blender and to find a better and cheaper alternative. This beauty applicator did not hold up. It actually tore the second time i used it and i have not repurchased it. I recommend the origional Beauty Blender over this knock off.</li>
    <li> it is a month late!! it wad suppose to be here between august 21 and september 9 sooooo it is all most been a month when it was suppose to get here. i have waited two months from when i actually ordered it!!! where is it?!</li>
    <li> For $0.25 and a two week wait, plus about $1.00 shipping, I have what impatience will cost about $10.00. It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re even made in the USA- I skip the middle man.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s obviously not even close to the beauty blender but it&#x27;s a good sponge. Makes make up look very nice and glide on, it does blend nicely. It does have a weird smell when you first get it so I recommend washing it before use, it takes a while to come I&#x27;m but with cheap products like this it usually does. Picture looks better than the sponge though, in reality color is really hot pink and it isn&#x27;t as smooth looking as the sponge in the pictute, it&#x27;s also a lot smaller than you would expect (to me that&#x27;s actually a though). Not only is it good for blending foundation but I like blending my under eye consealer with it too. It gives a nice natural finish.</li>
    <li> Smelled funny but did the trick.</li>
    <li> works just as well the original beauty blender! i totally recommend it especially for this price!! i will be buying more! even tho shipping took a while!</li>
    <li> nice and cute sponge and i would like some more yuppiiii&lt;br /&gt;n  thanks you so much yeahhhhhhhhhh&lt;br /&gt;  kkkkkkk&lt;br /&gt;  llll&lt;br /&gt;  lllll&lt;br /&gt;  kk</li>
    <li> Works really well :) I love how I can blend my foundation really well it gives it a flawless look excellent :D</li>
    <li> It took quite awhile to receive, by the time I had received the product I had actually long forgot that I ordered it. Although, at that point, it was a nice surprise to receive in the mail! As far as a beauty tool goes, it works well; I use it to blend my foundation and/or concealer. Good product, very cheap/affordable but for the wait, I would have rather just gone to my local beauty store and bought one!</li>
    <li> beauty blender, I used it for the first time this past weekend and I love it! Definitely buying another one just incase!</li>
    <li> Just a flat out horrible sponge I&#x27;d rather use the drugstore brand than these, they never absorb water?????!!!! Again a waste of my time waiting for these to come.......</li>
    <li> I think that beauty brushes are slightly overrated, but they are a staple item that every girl needs in her makeup bag.</li>
    <li> This product sucks. It feels like you&#x27;re punching your face and it doesn&#x27;t blend or make your face flawless whatsoever. It just kinda puts your foundation on your face like you had your little brother put it on.</li>
    <li> Sponge smelled funny. Washed it but smell remained.</li>
    <li> it is nothing compared to the original beauty blender, its so hard i couldn&#x27;t even use it on my face i just tried it on my palm and it felt like i was punching myself.. u get what u paid for lol</li>
    <li> Not sure how I missed giving my review of these cause they have been great. I guess it was because I wanted to use them to make sure they were worth reviewing. Well, as it stands I have been using them for quite a while and don&#x27;t have any complaints. They were better than using a regular flat makeup sponge. Although, stiffer to the touch than my original beauty blender with a little water these blenders did a fine job. For the price and quantity it is definitely worth giving a try.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading reviews on how Everyone compared this to the real beauty blender. How it wasn&#x27;t exact but very close to the real deal. I had purchased the item alone with 2 phone cases by the same seller. I thought wow such a cheap price why not! Believe me save the $3. Your supposed to dampen the sponge before makeup application. The sponge or I like to call \\&quot;rubber ball\\&quot; hardly moisten and never expanded. While applying my makeup I noticed it made little round spots all over my face. Even after I tried blending it out it never worked :(. Was very disappointed but hey that&#x27;s what you get for buying something so cheap!</li>
    <li> I love it it blends well and is super soft. It is very squishy and it feels great on your face.</li>
    <li> Just to clarify for anyone who has never used a beauty blender or any beauty sponge for that matter, these things are supposed to be very SOFT, \\&quot;squisy\\&quot;, and they are supposed to expand once wet. I was very dissatisfied to find that 2 out of the 4 sponges were hard and uncomfortably firm. Very firm beauty sponges are useless because they don&#x27;t blend your makeup well, thus you are better off using your own fingers. The other two sponges were slightly softer but still required a firm grip to grip the whole thing in your hand. I tried wetting one of the softer ones to see if it would expand and get softer, but it pretty much remained in the same state. I used it with foundation the same way I would with any beauty sponge and had to apply some good pressure just to dab the foundation on. I ended up using my fingertips as I expected. The only good thing about this purchase is that I spent less than $2, so I had nothing to lose. I read the reviews before I purchased but for some reason the \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews still convinced to get it. This is my honest opinion on the purchase. Purchase with caution.</li>
    <li> I loved it. I will buy more as soon as I can. ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> This is an amazing blender, definitely recommend it ,I only purchased one only cause i wasn&#x60;t sure about the teadrop, however now i wish i would have purchased more, i will be ordering more. The only problem is that my order took so long to arrive.</li>
    <li> It was pretty good but I would like it to be a little bit more better lol but it&#x27;s a good deal for only 1.19$</li>
    <li> came as a totally different shape, n use to me,  my cats enjoyed it</li>
    <li> It is too stiff and hard to blend nicely, spend the bucks and get the real thing if you want good makeup application</li>
    <li> Horrible quality and doesn&#x27;t blend well at all. Even for the price it is, I expected it to be a little better. All it did was absorb the makeup. Try another alternative if you want a cheaper version of the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> Bought these sponges and they were horrible. I used then a few times but couldn&#x27;t take the rock hard texture not to mention that they didn&#x27;t work. Ended up throwing them away after a few uses. These are far from smooth and I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest. Doesn&#x27;t obsorbe water like it should. Really nothing else to say about it. :/ falls apart easy too.</li>
    <li> It has a funky smell even after washing it several times and it sucks lol&lt;br /&gt;Flat out. Nothing else to say</li>
    <li> FIRST OFF IT BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE I PLACED MY ORDER!&lt;br /&gt;THE SELLER HAS NOT ANSWER MY EMAILS!&lt;br /&gt;FROM OTHER REVIEWS I SEE I AM NOT THE FIRST WITH COMPLAINS!&lt;br /&gt;ALSO FROM WHAT I GATHER FROM OTHER BUYERS THIS IS NOT EVEN THE SHAPE IT COMES IN!&lt;br /&gt;WASTE OF MONEY REALLY A PRODUCT NOT WORTH BUYING!&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS JUST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!&lt;br /&gt;MY RECOMENDATION IS FOR YOU TO BUY A REAL TECHNIQUES MAKEUP SPONGE ITS ONLY 5 DOLLARS AND IT IS SERIOUSLY JUST LIKE A BEUTY BLENDER! I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FRIENDS BIRTHDAY LAST MONTH SERIOUSLY SO DISAPOINTED AT THIS! I JUST BOUGHT HER A REAL TECHNIQUES AND HAD TO BUY ONE FOR MYSELF BECAUSE IT WORKS JUST LIKE THE BEUTY BLENDER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN I GET THIS PRODUCT IM SURE IT WILL BE TRASH JUST LIKE THE SELLER AND JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS REVIEWING! UGH SO ANGRY RIGHT NOW! I CANT BELIEVE ITS BEEN TWO MONTHS!</li>
    <li> I thought this was gonna be a real beauty blender, but when I got it it was this very dense sponge. With the beauty blender it starts out small and you can get it wet for a more sheer finish. When you wet the REAL beauty blender it gets bigger. This one just fell apart. The only good thing is it was only $2, so at least I didn&#x27;t lose much money.</li>
    <li> this sponge is so hard, its like you can bounce it off the ground.  I put it under water and it does not expand at all.  The only way to describe it is its like a hard bouncy ball.  not worth spending even a penny on this.</li>
    <li> its okay, the reason I don&#x27;t give it 4 stars is because the sponge is somewhat hard also you cant apply foundation with this because it really hurts. but I like using this to highlight my cheeks and under eye using my concealer BUT not for foundation. Also it took a month for me to get it in the mail ! SOO its only $1.00, its very hard but not super hard, it took a month for me to get it, Worth the wait ?? well its only a dollar... no big waist their.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this in early October and I am just now receiving it. It does not expand much. I tried using it to put on my foundation and i looked as if i did nothing. I do not know if i am using it incorrectly or what is going on, but for now i feel like i wasted my money. If anyone has any tips to help me with this so called &amp;#34;miracle blender&amp;#34; please feel free to comment</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected, but for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  It&#x27;s difficult to clean compared to my other sponges.</li>
    <li> Its good. Not a bad product. Kind of solid.</li>
    <li> Keep in mind these are NOT beautyblender sponges.  They are a good substitute though, considering the price of these &amp; price of beautyblender.</li>
    <li> cute, pink, and cheap first time using a Pro makeup blender sponge it smooth your foundation and blends very nicely</li>
    <li> As a professional makeup artist, I love trying new things. These are NOT comparable to the beauty blender; they are extremely firm and hold a lot of excess makeup. However, once I lowered my expectation, they weren&#x27;t bad. Useable, yes. But not the beauty blenders.</li>
    <li> I bought this beauty blender on December 26, and it&#x27;s now January 13, and I still haven&#x27;t gotten it... I wouldn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be that hard to ship. But overall, I LOVE beauty blenders. I hope this one is as good as the original!:-)</li>
    <li> hate this product... DO NOT BUT IT! it is not soft and it just plainly sucks do not buy this</li>
    <li> The quality is good. The texture is just right. The size is almost laughable. I had seen these sponges at the store before, but never got around to buying one. When I spotted one on Amazon, I thought it was time, so I ordered it. When it finally arrived, I thought a mistake had been made. This product is half the size of the sponges you will find at your local Walmart or Target. But it does the job, and I already purchased it, so might as well use it.</li>
    <li> its ok for the price. its not super soft like the beauty blender but for the price it does a fair job</li>
    <li> I use my Teardrop to blend my makeup around my entire face.  Blends perfectly and erases the makeup lines.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It took this little guy FOREVER to get to me. First I received a bunch of nail files that must have been shipped to my by accident and then later received this makeup blender. Even so, the price was right for me to try this product for the first time (much cheaper than the beauty blenders). With that being said, I can&#x27;t say that I would get this product again; it didn&#x27;t really work for me. I feel like it just stole my product instead of applying it to my face.</li>
    <li> It is too stiff to use. Didn&#x27;t make the makeup application go easy. Definitely not comparable to the real beauty blender</li>
    <li> this is definitely a fake beauty blender, i have the real one and they are like day and night! This one smells horrible, its very dense and just yucky! never even tried to use it because i didn&#x27;t want to break out or something!</li>
    <li> Very hard even when wet. I kept getting a lot of pink dye coming out of it when I washed it the first million times to use it too. It doesn&#x27;t expand when wet as advertised and I bought 2 of these and they both are like this. When you put them on your face in a bouncing motion as you would, they are actually really firm and hard. NOTHING AT ALL LIKE THE BEATY BLENDER, at all! Would not recommend and they just came in an envelope mailer with no box or packaging just shoved inside. Steer clear and purchase a Real Techniques sponge!</li>
    <li> Works really well for mousse foundation. Love it! Takes a bit of time to get used to but it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, it irritated my face. It smelt like latex, and it didn&#x27;t expand like the real beauty blender. Would NOT buy again.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than i thought it would be. Also its not too soft even after soaking it in water. However it works okay when apply my highlight. Overall for the price it an okay product. Just keep in mind you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I guess I give it a 2, I review so many products for my channel and this just was all that great I wished it was my started falling apart because I got to the video but I guess it was ok.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE PRICE AND EVERYTHG ELSE ABOUT THIS!! I USE IT EVERYDAY TO APPLY MY FOUNDATION. I ONLY WISH I WOULD HAVE FOUND IT SOONER!! IT GETS TO EVERY AREA OF THE FACE WITH NO PROBLEM. THANKS!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. It blends so perfectly. I am about to order like 5 more! I don&#x27;t personally wear a lot of make-up, but before using this blender, I would always leave a line. I never have a ugly make-up line when using this, Plus its so soft!!!</li>
    <li> I received this item on October 29/ 2013 and tried it for the first time on November 2nd, and fell in love with it. It made my foundation go on so smoothly with no streaks or discoloration on my face that I just had to put on my translucent powder and blush and was finished. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> horrible. shipping took weeks then when I finally got it, it was tiny. I assumed it would expand in water but lo and behold, it wouldn&#x27;t even absorb the water.&lt;br /&gt;It ate my foundation, flaked on my face and I refuse to waste soap to clean it. Right in the trash</li>
    <li> Never had one and I guess it awesome can&#x27;t beat the price .overall it does the work blend good ,foundation go on good easy to work with I tiny bit on the hard sides but good</li>
    <li> I received it way sooner then it said! I end up buying one from the dollar store n it smelled weird, like turkey lol but this one was perfect n didn&#x27;t smell ;-) worth the money</li>
    <li> I do not own the real beauty blender, but for less than $2 why not get this? I feel like it blends my foundation perfectly. I use the CoverGirl outlast stay fabulous foundation and it does so so well at blending this in it does not look like I have anything on! I am buying another one just in case!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but it feels like something they&#x27;d use in a MAC store, It&#x27;s thick and hard to &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; and works magically. I feel like a queen.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully,But it had a strong smell so you might want to wash it before using it. It was great either way</li>
    <li> I was trying to be on the cheaper end so I purchased this. Ended up not liking it. The product doesn&#x27;t squish very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good makeup sponge just wish it got a bit bigger when dampening it. But it is really soft and blends foundation wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I like my sponge, i thought it was a little bigger but other than that I like it. i give 4 stars</li>
    <li> In love with this product&lt;br /&gt;And it is easy to clean</li>
    <li> In all honesty at the beginning, I hated this thing. Thought it was too hard, but with time and wetting it I use it to set and buff my make up with finishing powder and/or spray. Gives a very natural finish and has gotten softer.</li>
    <li> Works well with liquid makeup after I figured out how to use it. I want to try it with mineral makeup, but I&#x27;m nervous</li>
    <li> Very cool I enjoyed this product. It was cheap and something new for me to try. I&#x27;m not sure how to recommend this product but it was good.</li>
    <li> This took over a month to arrive, it is of poor quality, the material had snags and was coming apart when I took it out of the packaging, and smells of chemicals. Terrible.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the reviews were decent and I thought, hey for $1, I&#x27;ll try it. No, do not even waste the $1 to purchase this. It&#x27;s nothing like the real beauty blender which I just purchased and I love. It doesn&#x27;t double in size under water, its super dense, and smells really weird. It doesn&#x27;t lay down product nicely. I mean, you get what you pay for, but just buy the real beauty blender. It&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
    <li> In Love with this product, work soo perfect with my process pf getting ready and i just cant wait to get more  💙❤️👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here. I paid like a dollar for it and it shows! Save your buck! this beauty sponge is so hard and doesn&#x27;t blend at all it. It just absorbs all your foundation and makeup.</li>
    <li> This one small item took a long time to get...after one week it had a bad smell and I threw it away..will not use another one of these..just thought I would try it out.</li>
    <li> the product is fine, but it&#x27;s just a small sponge. nothing special really. it must be used properly or else the sponge will absorb all the product.</li>
    <li> too hard to use, glad it was cheap. it does a horrible job at bleanding unless its your cheeks and you have to dampen it but then its still hard</li>
    <li> Bought this and have no complaints. I also have a second one for backup. Thanks for selling this at such a great price!</li>
    <li> my first beauty blender and I like it. I have yet to use it wet but I do use it to blend in my concelar and it does smooth it out very nicely. Only downfall is I wish it would have been bigger.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and was highly disappointed after waiting over a month for it to arrive, it was not at all like the picture. The shape of the sponge is not teardrop shaped at all, it goes in at the middle. If you are planning to use this for makeup application do not buy it, you are wasting your time and money. There is no way you could apply makeup with this sponge because the pores (or holes) of the sponge are much to large and rubbery, I guess you get what you pay for but I would say skip it. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Well over a month I purchased this item and still no sign of it!&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your time and money on this. Much better off going to a cosmetic store and paying more money then to sit around and attempt to wait for this product. A shame.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this for applying and blending her makeup foundation. Very fast shipper, especially for coming all the way from China. Reasonable price...</li>
    <li> its alittle denser than i thought it would be but it is manageable. this is not a bad product for paying so little</li>
    <li> works alright wet, but if i were to buy this product i would spend the extra dollars to get the real one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hard sponge that can be used to apply makeup. Eh, I use it because I paid for it but I wouldn&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 4 months ago, and it still is not here. I paid for two day shipping. They cannot even give me tracking information or anything! Its not even in transit! Do not buy. Order from some where else or go to the store. I recommend Ulta or Sephora. This is a bust. Wasted money. Never again. I tried to contact seller, but it was not available. They took my money and wont give it back. Stupid.</li>
    <li> Does not get bigger when you run under water unlike the Beauty Blender. It also is very firm &amp; does help blend in your make-up.</li>
    <li> The title says it all! this is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!! The best product ever! totally worth price! o m g so awesome</li>
    <li> Sponge was a little more firm than I expected. It doesn&#x27;t bounce as well when applying foundation on my face. But overall it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> That being said, it is an alright sponge.. It soaks up a lot of product, does not expand, and does not feel that great on the face. It does okay distributing make up. It is nowhere near as high quality as a beauty blender. But a beauty blender is also 19 dollars more. You get what you pay for. And you don&#x27;t pay for much.</li>
    <li> Maybe it works well for others, but it&#x27;s just not useful to me. It actually just wipes away the makeup instead of blending. Again, it might just be me, though. A lot of people love these things.</li>
    <li> Works really well at a fraction on the price many of the other stores are selling it for. I&#x27;ve seen the price as high as $20 for one. Ouch! Thank you for a reasonable price for a sponge~</li>
    <li> This sponge was a real let down. Not only did it take over a month to receive them. But they don&#x27;t even blend the foundation properly at all. Waste of time on them.</li>
    <li> Works very well and easy to use. Product is exactly what I was expecting and the size is just perfect</li>
    <li> Its horribld,like a plasteline.&lt;br /&gt;When i washed ut first water was pink. Dont blending on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Very bad purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting on this. I ordered it quite some time ago. I have no idea if it even exists at this point... The money I paid for it however? Very real.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have the light feeling that I expected. When applying makeup, the makeup was very caked on the sponge, resulting in it caking and clumping on my face. I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to use it. But I am sure I will figure it soon and it will be great.</li>
    <li> Smaller than a regular beauty blender but, I like it. It blends out the concealer and foundation pretty good !</li>
    <li> I tired the official beauty blender before and the quality and application of this one was not similar at all. It did come in the mail quickly though!</li>
    <li> These are more like stress balls. Mostly made out of rubber and smell like it to. No complaints for the seller they did deliver the product as promised.</li>
    <li> The sponge was really rough on the face and it sucked in the foundation instead of evenly spreading it on the face.</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s not for me.. My wife loved it... I&#x27;m sure she would buy more (btw this is to get over Amazon words limitation).</li>
    <li> The sponge is soft and fine textured so it is gentle on facial skin. I am very pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;It took a long time to arrive, however the Customer Service was attentive and helpful when I asked why it hadn&#x27;t arrived. International mailings do not always comply with our postal regulations and automated mailings often end up in &amp;#34;dead letter&amp;#34; boxes. Be patient, but ask question the sponge is well worth it.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, it said it was a teardrop beauty blender. And what I got in the mail was not a tear drop one. It was one of the ones with the curves in it. Im not very happy about this.</li>
    <li> blends perfectly... except it doesnt exactly look like it... it has the pointy tip and an extra bulge at the end... Doesnt really make a difference... more bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> I would buy it again if it ever wears or tears. I got sent the right product; it is pink and tear-shaped. I got it right on time. I love how it&#x27;s less cakey than stippling and flat top brushes!</li>
    <li> Absolutly love this! I have boughten one similar and it does not work the same at all! Smooth flawless coverage!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well on blending my makeup, and I did run it under water and it still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this teardrop pro beauty blender! It blends out concealor perfectly, and does not take off product! Amazing, only fallback is that it takes forever to come in the mail, like nearly a month!</li>
    <li> Not pleased. Its was to hard.</li>
    <li> Works well. Really helps towards a flawless look. YouTube videos on how to properly use it helped a lot.</li>
    <li> Close to the Beauty Blender without the huge price. I would purchase again. I do use it daily and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Its true, you get what you pay for. This is not the original beaut blender. Its tough and hard, so you pound your foundation into your face...its less then pleasant, but it was cheap so it didn&#x27;t hurt to try and see :) At least I&#x27;m not out anything. :)</li>
    <li> The sponge is too hard for the face and it does not expand. Save your dollar;do NOT purchase. I am a real purchaser and believe me, it&#x27;s not worth it. Try another brand.</li>
    <li> I ordered it three weeks ago and it never came. I love this product by its taking it forever to get to my house.</li>
    <li> I am so satisfied! It blends my makeup flawlessly.. I have no complaints about this item, I actually am going to buy a few more! Thank you</li>
    <li> The teadrop shape makes this perfect for blending around the eye area --  It is a great texture and looks like it will hold up well.  Plus it is supercute!</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this item in the future because it is very very hard no matter how much water you soak it in.  It is just to hard to use on the face.</li>
    <li> This blender works great when wet. I makes makeup application very easy and gives you a natural look.  Why spend more on something else.</li>
    <li> I never thought that a Beauty Blender would ever do the trick for flawless skin. Until my friend told me to go and get one. Let me say its amazing! The only thing is suggest is it to be a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Works amazing!!! Blends out beautifully! !leaves my foundation looking flawless. Very soft but gets the job done. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package and I felt the it felt like a ball you would give your dog. When I tried to wet it the next morning, It would absorb the water and didn&#x27;t get big, not to mention that it ate all of my foundation. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buy these, it would be a waste of money. The Soho beauty sponge is sooooo much better.</li>
    <li> I love the size of it - It feels so soft and it fits just right in my hand. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Took forever to get to me but love it</li>
    <li> Nothing like my actual beauty blender. Very dense. Like SERIOUSLY. You can&#x27;t really dab it on your skin and expect it to blend your makeup very well. But for $1.12 on opposed to $30+ for an actual beauty blender you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Blends foundation evenly  doesn&#x27;t smell and is easy to use you would be crazy not to get this product it is amazing</li>
    <li> This seems to really blend in the makeup pretty well. Doesn&#x27;t leave a caked look on skin. Its  worth the money.</li>
    <li> I do not like this at all :(  it is really hard&lt;br /&gt;And it just absorbs al my makeup. Ever wet is really hard! You can not compare this with a Beauty blender al all !&lt;br /&gt;If you want good results get the real technics sponge !</li>
    <li> It works if you need to smooth out small areas like around your nose. As far as being relatable to the beauty blender, that&#x27;s a negative. Does not absorb water or expand(which is a property of normal sponges) so applying makeup with it is a nightmare. It&#x27;s also really rough on skin. I really wanted to like this inexpensive version of the beauty blender but should&#x27;ve saved my $1 something.</li>
    <li> It smells very rubbery, and the smell rubs off on your skin when you use it. The smell goes away slowly over time, but it&#x27;s still there. Plus it&#x27;s kind of...dirty? I don&#x27;t know if it just gets really dirty really easily or if it came that way, but either way it&#x27;s kind of gross. It&#x27;s cute and easy to use, though. So if you can keep it clean and get rid of the smell, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the teardrop shaped sponge like pictured but instead it&#x27;s an hour glass. i tried to use it several times but it&#x27;s so hard and rubbery.</li>
    <li> It is still working for me better than the blender sponge and I have had this a couple of months with very light use</li>
    <li> It was alot smaller than I expected when compared to my Sister&#x27;s real beauty blender. But wow! It is pure awesomeness!  So smooth and bland so flawless!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would measure up to the &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; which I&#x27;ve never used, but I really enjoyed this. It buffs my foundation onto my face like a dream. I would highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in the &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; at a way lower cost!</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way, gets the corners of your eyes, the corners of your mouth, why would you buy anything else?</li>
    <li> works very efficiently ! i love it!&lt;br /&gt;very inexpensive and can save you ALOTT OF MONEY.!!!!!!! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and use it every day for my foundation and highlighter.  Very soft and easy to use!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice ... Just one problem, it rips a little when you wash it with water and soap. This happens to me when I washed it for the 3-5 time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/14/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now thrown it away because the tear was too much and it rip in half, also when I use it on my face with foundation it leaves some pieces of the sponge.</li>
    <li> I knew it was to good to be true! This product sucked!!! It&#x27;s hard as a rock! And I did submerge into water for a while, not happened! It didn&#x27;t even observe water but it sure did observe my makeup!!! Don&#x27;t get it save your money for the REAL beauty blender!</li>
    <li> Working for the largest Salon in Washington, we have our own Makeup team! So when we changed cosmetic sponges I was on the band wagon to buy them! UNTIL I saw how much 1 (one)  Would cost! Who cares about packaging! Once it&#x27;s out if the container and off its pedestal, it goes in my make up bin! So I found these! I love them! My daughter loves them! I even had the makeup artist do my make up with mine, I told her so she didn&#x27;t have to wash it! She didn&#x27;t even notice! In fact she said it felt brand new! NOPE I only rinsed out my liquid foundation! I will buy! Again and Again!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed a blender for my foundation. This product worked surprisingly well for what it was worth. It does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. I did buy two and currently bought two more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item so I could compare it to the beauty blender and I have to say it is very comparable.</li>
    <li> Poor quality sponge. Price is equivalent to quality</li>
    <li> Definitely not the best but pretty nice for a dupe. I use it to blend rather than apply because it soaked up my foundation and hardly got any on. Works great as a blender</li>
    <li> Not even worth a dollar ! It ripped that same day you would have to be so sensitive with it !</li>
    <li> No clue what this is for, but my daughter loves it.  It&#x27;s fun just to keep in your hand and squeeze like a little stress ball.</li>
    <li> I think this makeup blender is good quality. I use it every day for my foundation. It&#x27;s wayy cheaper than the beauty blender and it does the job well so I am pleased with this product. oh and idk why some people are saying it&#x27;s worse than the real beauty blender because it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> This product defiantly is you pay for what you get, it&#x27;s VERY hard even after you wet it. Not workable at all!!</li>
    <li> Love this blending sponge!  Best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. Recently purchase another one. They last, and easy to wash with soap (I use baby shampoo) &amp; water</li>
    <li> This product took about 3 weeks to come in. This is my first blending sponge. The product is too hard to squeeze. I soaked it in warm water before using it. It is still hard to squeeze just a bit to put my foundation on. Although the product is a bit stiff it was ok to use my foundation went on smoothly. But with the price of $1.09 its just an ok product.</li>
    <li> My blender is ok for me at least . Wet it and then works better but nit the best and way to pricey . Advise don&#x27;t get it</li>
    <li> It doesnt blend as smoothly as i hoped it would, instead it just soaks up all the make up. None left on my face</li>
    <li> It was not like my last one it was a miniature., I was unaware it was. Nor did it state that in the description of the item.</li>
    <li> Love the firmness...spreads and blends make up real good.</li>
    <li> Best invention ever for blending in concealer!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re better of buying something else like a knock off one at cvs or Walgreens. The price of it makes sense</li>
    <li> Not fond of this product but not your fault.  I just didn&#x27;t like it.  But I do like the bigger ones!!!</li>
    <li> Sooo good I absolutely love this, it feels so good on your skin it&#x27;s blends the foundation so good, perfect finish flawless I love it.</li>
    <li> I love it !!!! Totes the best thing I&#x27;ve tried I totally recommend it , it&#x27;s something the blends amazing</li>
    <li> Love it... I can get into all the areas of my eye and around my lips perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t absorb like a cheep make up wedges do.</li>
    <li> this was perfect and blends makeup well ! I have used it for months and it gives me that air brushed look . Plus not expensive</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I never knew I could get my liquid foundation on so perfectly until I tried one of these. I ordered several because they were &amp;#34;dirt cheap&amp;#34;. The shipping did take almost a month, but this was expected as I read the shipping details. I highly suggest washing them in some mild soap first (I used my mild face wash) because they do have an odd odor to them. After I washed them, the odor was gone.&lt;br /&gt;How I use these: I saturate them in water and squeeze them dry. I then use the corner of them for my concealer. I use the big round head for applying my liquid foundation. They are a bit rougher than i thought they would be but it doesn&#x27;t effect their use. I recommend these to anyone wanted a flawless look with foundation.</li>
    <li> I placed my order 4 months ago and until this day i havent gotten this  product !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work. Sorry I tried.</li>
    <li> Not really that awesome. It&#x27;s super stiff and it may blend okay (everywhere BUT under eye area) but takes absolutely FOREVER because it keeps it&#x27;s shape when you pat it on your face. Nothing like a beauty blender at all.</li>
    <li> this is an ok product... it does its job but not as well as some of the other ones i have tried....i mean it is for sure worth the price but if you are looking for something that is practically flawless consider spending a little extra money.</li>
    <li> I love it so much it does great blending and it blends my foundation and concealer perfectly. Cheap and great quality!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this. Had to re purchase it cause my dog tested it up</li>
    <li> FIRST OFF I NEVER RECEIVED THIS AND HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR IT FOR SO LONG THIS MAKES ME NOT TRUST BUYING STUFF FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU GUYS NEVER SENT ME IT!!! AND I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOWARD TO USING THIS ITEM . I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND MAD ABOUT THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> Blends makeup wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Love what it does. The rubber-ish smell of the sponge took about 2 months to disappear so sometimes my face was left with this odd smell. Oh well, still a lovely product to distribute foundation.</li>
    <li> No good damp, developed a rubbery ball-like texture. And is falling apart quickly.</li>
    <li> I really love this product I will recommend puts the color evenly it&#x27;s very good works very good as we&#x27;ll</li>
    <li> Love love love it...I only purchased 1 because I wanted to test it, well looks like im gonna be buying at least 10 more today,  so soft and I love the size. Thank you for this wonderful sponge and cant forget the price. ...5 stars!!</li>
    <li> When it finally arrived I had forgotten that I had even purchased it lol so the surprise was nice. It&#x27;s cheap and that&#x27;s a plus. I recommend it and the seller as long as you don&#x27;t need it within a month. Overall it does what it&#x27;s meant to do. I have no complaints about the item itself. So for that reason I give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> A little to late but finally i.got it and its all.good..very good service and good stuff thank you..&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that maybe itll be better to not send some small things like this so far... Like this you have to pay more than you get? But thank you:)</li>
    <li> The sponge is great for applying makeup. I ordered two for myself and one for each daughter. I hope they like theirs. It took a very long time to get this order. Luckily, it was something I could wait for.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I prefer using my hands or a brush, but I occasionally use this. Not my favorite, but it may work better for someone else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why all the other reviews are so positive about this sponge. It&#x27;s tiny, even when wet it doesn&#x27;t swell up. It doesn&#x27;t bounce off the skin. THIS IS NOT A DOUPE FOR THE BEAUTY BLENDER! Not even worth the dollar.</li>
    <li> its not the beauty blender. I found that its not as soft as the beauty blender but still blends well. I bought it to see a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> Rubber.....not a sponge....and it stinks, ewww dont order</li>
    <li> This Is an amazing beauty blender ! I use it everyday when I&#x27;m doing my makeup and it blends great</li>
    <li> The sponge was hard and did not form to my face making it harder to put on my foundation. Sucks!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, it doesn&#x27;t really distribute the product as well as i thought it would, but for the price it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> Dont waist ur time its the shape of the teardrop and its a light pink color but it doesn&#x27;t work. It actually hurt since the sponge is kinda hard it takes for ever to ship out dont waist ur time and dollar</li>
    <li> Love it! Helps to have a smooth finish to my foundation. I wet the sponge to apply my makeup and followup with a finishing powder.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE! I guess you get what you pay for. And its so rubbery.... feels like a hair tie</li>
    <li> Good sponge compared to beauty blended I have been using this for a few months and it works great to apply all face makeup</li>
    <li> I expected a bigger one but still pleased!</li>
    <li> I placed my order on July 24, 2014. It came in the mail on August 12, 2014. All I can say is don&#x27;t waste your time. Its literally smaller than my pinky.  I have no use for this now. MAYBE I can use it to blend concealer, but then again I might get a cramp from holding it because it&#x27;s so tiny. I&#x27;m really disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Soaks up all the product but doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly on my face</li>
    <li> I like it but it took forever to come in</li>
    <li> I know is very cheap and definitely you get what you pay for. Cheap made, It is not bouncy at all, It hurt when I was applying my concealer. Not a all a dupe for the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the real thing...I&#x27;ve tried a few imitation beauty blending sponges and this was by far one of the worst unfortunately. The material is too firm and ruff and doesn&#x27;t get bigger when dampened like the original.</li>
    <li> This product is cheap but it works like any of the other beauty blenders without the high price. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to be a little bit bigger but I am happy with the product. Took a while to ship but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This is worth the price. Has a bit of a strange feel to it, and there is an initial odor but goes away quickly. Gets in all the nooks and crannies.</li>
    <li> NEVER GOT IT AND ITS BEEN ALMOST A YEAR</li>
    <li> A bit hard to clean, but this thing has lasted me a long time I love it.</li>
    <li> Smaller than what you think it is, didn&#x27;t really absorb water, it is nothing like the blendie sponge</li>
    <li> It is smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s okay, does its job well.</li>
    <li> I love it! Was smaller than expected, but works great for undereye:)</li>
    <li> WASTE OF MONEY, DO NOT PURSHASE!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t change size at all, so it&#x27;s still small and dense no matter how long you put it under water. it still applies makeup tho so for $1 you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> It does the job well but I didn&#x27;t think it would b so dense n so small but great product.</li>
    <li> a lot smaller than it looks in the picture, also a tighter foam so it takes long to spread out your foundation, a bigger and looser sponge is what i expected</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It blends eye makeup perfectly and is easy to find in the midst of all my makeup.</li>
    <li> its okay. it got here kinda slow I got the ugliest color ever, everyone said it looked like a breast.</li>
    <li> It smells a little weird and when I washed it the color started to rinse off, but for the most part it works great!</li>
    <li> This has made make up applications flawless!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I tried to put the sponge under water to see if it would expand and it didnt. If you are buying this in order to replace the cost of a beautyblender, do not waste your time.</li>
    <li> Product is nothing like the beauty blender. Not bouncy enough and absorbs lot of product even when I made the sponge damp. Rather invest in the beauty blender</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look even toned and natural when I put concealer or foundation. Works great if you don&#x27;t have a makeup airbrush but still gives you that look. I bought an air brush for my foundation a while back and I think this still looks better than airbrushing and its so simple. This was recommended but Kandee Johnson and she was right.. [...]</li>
    <li> It works just as the one that cost me $20. Works sooo good!  I will definitely be buying more. . Makes my makeup flawless. .</li>
    <li> ...and does it well!  I have never used the expensive beauty sponge, so I can&#x27;t compare.  However, I have used the white wedges and this make up blender sponge wins hands down!  I&#x27;m very happy with this blending sponge...especially the price!  It has lasted me about 6 weeks of daily use before small tears and holes started to appear.  Yes, it does soak in foundation that you can&#x27;t completely wash out (of course it does, it&#x27;s a SPONGE! But so does the expensive one) but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and blends make up flawlessly.  I definitely recommend this to everyone using liquid make up/foundation.  My only (small) complaint is the amount of time it takes to receive after ordering (about a month).</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I thought it would make putting on liquid makeup easier and do a better job.  I found it absorbed too much of h makeup and did not cover like I thought</li>
    <li> This is definitely NOT a Beauty Blender dupe, it&#x27;s a little harder and does not expand as much when wet. However, for me, it is acceptable as I don&#x27;t wear foundation anyway, so the only thing I use the sponge for is to blend out concealer and my cream bronzer; which it does an excellent job of doing.</li>
    <li> This item appears much bigger online than in real life. I got it and it is about the length of my thumb if not smaller. This item also appears to be a hot pink and when I received it in the mail, I could barely tell it was pink at all. It is a very pale pink. I am not happy with the way this product is deceived vs what it actually is, but I am glad I only wasted a couple dollars, as opposed to a lot of money. Also for something so small, it took about a month to show up at my door step. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this , it feel so good on your skin and makeup looks so natural and flawless !!!!</li>
    <li> I have never used a real Beauty Blender but this sponge is pretty awesome! I was using it a lot before a got my first Sigma F80 brush last week. The F80 is crazy amazing &amp; a fast way to apply your foundation! At the moment I prefer the brush over the sponge; however I think the sponge will be very useful in the colder winter months when my skin might become flaky. It is definitely worth the price &amp; I plan in ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product yet due to not getting it in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used and other product like this it would have been a first for me if I got it in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say if customers should consider getting it because I have yet to get mine so haven&#x27;t tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get this product so I don like or dislike anything about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Expectation for now is that it works better than my fingers but can&#x27;t say haven&#x27;t gotten product.&lt;br /&gt;Its been about a month and still waiting to get it in the mail.</li>
    <li> I just loved it i would.  Definately  recommend! !! Bettter than the $18-20 ones go buy this im super happy wit this product</li>
    <li> It suck but for the price am not complaining</li>
    <li> I like this just because I don&#x27;t want to dirty my fingers when putting on my concealer. Probably any applying brush/ dabber would work, so it&#x27;s not amazing, but it was super cheap so I like it.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when it had arrived but once I opened the package it was disappointing. It&#x27;s much smaller than the original beauty blender and it does not expand when you soak it so that was a downer plus it has a really strong rubber smell to it that sticks to your hands after using it... but besides that it does the job</li>
    <li> No difference noted between these and the expensive ones.  I can discard them after some use without feeling guilty.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This blender is rock hard. Even when I ran it under HOT water for a long time, it didn&#x27;t loosen up.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid I didn&#x27;t expect the quality of the original. I did purchase another knock off that was better than this one. This one does not expand or soften. I may need to soak it longer but I don&#x27;t think it will help.</li>
    <li> Worked good for a while, but then started to tear off on the tip (From every day use maybe?)</li>
    <li> I really dont understand, I read the reviews for this and thought id give it a try. Maybe I got a bad batch because the one I got was small and even when I wet it was hard. I have a real beauty blender and its nothing like the real one. On top of that shipping took a long time.</li>
    <li> it definitely is a good dupe for the beauty blender</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great only thing is after awhile it starts to tear! Took extra long to come in the mail. I even forgot I ordered it!</li>
    <li> packaging was great everything was great NO damage to it at alll ... i loved it !!! definetley worth buyingggg i reccomend this product ...:)</li>
    <li> They were amazing. They did a wonderful job, and are a quality product. Send me free samples to try. Would recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> i loved this sponge it worked great the only thing is that i expected it to be pink as shown and a bit larger.</li>
    <li> I like this particular blender sponge. It is softer than others I have tried in the past and it applies liquid foundations nicely. It worked well for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> My blender doesn&#x27;t expand or smooth my makeup....I ask the seller if I was using it wrong they said to look at the description...not helpful....waste of my $1...but I&#x27;m glad it was only a $1...what really bothers me is that I was super excited to get this and it didn&#x27;t work....</li>
    <li> THis blender is definitely a dud! It didn&#x27;t last a week and it didnt&#x27; come clean and it tore. Needless to say I trashed it and bought the real thing! Don&#x27;t waste your time! Get the real &amp;#34;beauty blender!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get the rave about these.  Makeup brush works wayyyyy better.  Used once.</li>
    <li> This sponge blends very well. Depending on the liquid foundation and/or other product I would suggest dipping it in water before stippling it onto your face :) Helps to lighten and blend.</li>
    <li> So far with this product I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t really blend the make up, more like removes it. And unfortunately for me I&#x27;m allergic to latex and this smells just like it. Won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> No the real make-up pro... It&#x27;s not even the tear-drop shape. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s took a month to come</li>
    <li> It blend on my face natural , I want it to full cover my skin but I like it when I blend it on my concealer.</li>
    <li> I was recently in a major make-up retail store and saw the name brand beauty blender there.  It was smaller and I could not believe how much they wanted for one.  $19.  That is just ridiculous.  This blender works great and is easier to work with because it is bigger.  The only negative I have to say is that it is very firm so you need to be a little gentle when blending.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the money bit don&#x27;t rub too hard cuz ot will leave pink streaks on your face</li>
    <li> I have never used the real beauty blender so I have nothing to compare it to but it does the job I need it to do and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love my product it&#x27;s so easy try o use I love how it smooths in my foundation with my Concealer</li>
    <li> It makes ur foundation go on smooth and even without having the mess on your fingers. Will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Its very hard and almost feels like you are punching yourself when blotting the makeup on</li>
    <li> Well., Its not the Beauty Blender. BUT IT IS PERFECT FOR ITS PRICE. Does what it says! Super cute, too c:</li>
    <li> It was extremely hard . and it doesn&#x27;t blend that well at all .</li>
    <li> awesome blending sponge! great price. My only complaint is that it took over 2 weeks to get this</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t bad for price to hard even when wet for my face or anyone else</li>
    <li> This item sucks  badly do not even dare buying</li>
    <li> smallest thing ever! doesn&#x27;t even work! I threw it away!</li>
    <li> Love it!! I bought this about 6 months ago and it lasted a long time lol. I used it everyday and worked great. Just ordered a new one, can&#x27;t wait!!😍😍</li>
    <li> Save your money. This &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; does not soak up any water. It does not blend well and it smells awful. Its clearly not something that I would use for foundation ever again. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> i really like this product, even though it took a really long time to ship. it was worth the wait! one thing i will add is that the color is a very hot pink, so don&#x27;t be expecting a light pink product. the pictures are not good quality. if you want a makeup blender, i highly suggest this product! also, it is well worth the price. i said to myself, why not, and so should you!</li>
    <li> Its way smaller than what i expected and when it arrived the color was pink then when i put it in water it turned tanned brown..and i didnt even use it yet i just washed it because it smelled like plastic from the wrapping...if you need a small version of a beauty blender this one does the job BUT it still works great (:</li>
    <li> Great for blending foundation and concealer can be used wet or dry and easy to clean, at a great price</li>
    <li> It is so cute. I love it. It does its job amazingly. the price is great. it is spectacular. it is super easy to clean and simple to use. doesnt break or fall apart.</li>
    <li> i love these! thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome blending sponge for the best price!</li>
    <li> Love this product so much! My make up goes on so much better and it&#x27;s so cheap compared to the real Beauty Blender! Will definitely purchase more of these in the future!!! :)</li>
    <li> Smallest beauty blender ever dnt buy it is small.</li>
    <li> I was pretty impressed, I will repurchase</li>
    <li> Perfect puff to get the make up everywhere I need it to go. Better than I expected because of the cost. Shopping just took awhile</li>
    <li> I could just be using it wrong... but it doesn&#x27;t get the job done! It doesn&#x27;t blend, I feel like it just takes the makeup with it..</li>
    <li> it took a while to get to me but its a beauty blander, does its job and works well!</li>
    <li> I was very excited for this product to arrive, but when it FINALLY showed up (shipping took 7 weeks) I was quickly disappointed. It works nothing like I hoped. It is a waste of time, foundation and money.</li>
    <li> super dense&lt;br /&gt;cannot do anything with them&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> These are no joke! The size I purchased is about an inch and a half tall (I believe it was the smallest). I think it would be worth having one this size as well as having a larger one if you plan on doing foundation with it. I use my small one for concealer and it does wonders!</li>
    <li> Love it and use it all the time ...works just as good as the expensive ones ....however I will admit it was a little more stiff at first but the more I use it the more it softens up and the more I like it</li>
    <li> Smaller then expected. But it still does the trick.</li>
    <li> For the cheap price and free shipping I thought I would get what I pay for but It works even better then I thought!  Its amazing! It took a while to get here but seeing how it came all the way from china I was expecting it would take a while but surprisingly it got here a week before it was suppose to arrive.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with it and I&#x27;m going to order more just to have as a spare..</li>
    <li> I just got this as a replacement for my Beauty Blender sinc the reviews on this thing were pretty good. But sadly, I didn&#x27;t love this blender one bit! It doesn&#x27;t soak up any water whatsoever and is so hard to blend! It also reaks of bad chemicals. But the again, what can you expect from a 2 dollar makeup sponge. Went right back to Beauty Blender and will never try another.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!! It makes my foundation look airbrushed and I am soon going to repurchase it. It&#x27;s also really good quality</li>
    <li> I never thought that these are so small.</li>
    <li> I have heard a lot of hype about beauty blenders and after watching beauty gurus everywhere using them, I decided to get one.  My first impression was great, I loved it.  It blended flawlessly and gave great coverage with my concealer.  The only thing I did not like about it was that it was very, very stiff.  I have to use three, almost four, fingers to squish it down and I&#x27;ve seen people do it using only two.  Overall, I really enjoy this sponge and think it is a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> It works great for blending in the make up I apply my make up with a brush and blend with this sponge. I get a perfect finish.</li>
    <li> I ordered these makeup blenders for my granddaughter and she and I were very disappointed at the quality.  They were rock hard and unuseable.</li>
    <li> I hated this, and you know why? Because it made me think that the Beauty Blender was crap. However, you get what you pay for, and I have to say that it is worth the splurge to buy the name brand Beauty Blender. I do not know what they do differently in manufacturing this sponge, but don&#x27;t waste your money. I threw this away after a couple uses and swore never to buy another pricey stupid sponge ever again. That was until my sister ordered the real one. Every person I&#x27;ve talked to that ordered the real one says that it basically changed their lives, and everyone I know that ordered a knock-off claims that it was the biggest waste of money ever. Do yourself a favor and either get the real thing, or stick to a different way to apply your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a like to all the Beauty Blender products that Amazon offers:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/s/ref&#x3D;sr_nr_p_89_0?fst&#x3D;as%3Aoff&amp;rh&#x3D;n%3A3760911%2Ck%3Abeauty+blender%2Cp_89%3ABeautyBlender&amp;keywords&#x3D;beauty+blender&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1425875105&amp;rnid&#x3D;2528832011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review was helpful!</li>
    <li> Save your money (even though its basically free) and do not buy this product. The sponge smelled really bad and I didn&#x27;t wash out so I never ended up using it because I did not want my face to smell like nasty rubber. Splurge and buy the real deal.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. I&#x27;d buy the original beauty blender. Makeup appears chalky and ashy with this when it&#x27;s wet, which is how you&#x27;re supposed to use it. Price was good, but cheaper isn&#x27;t always better</li>
    <li> This sucks. It doesn&#x27;t even expand and absorbs all your foundation. Waste of money</li>
    <li> ordered months ago and still using.. just as good as the beauty blender. I have both and i use this one the most.</li>
    <li> Was not too bad for the price a little smaller than what I expected but it works fine</li>
    <li> Was scared when I never received a tracking number but didn&#x27;t stress it much and I&#x27;m happy I did cause not only did it come packaged well but early too.. looks just as it does n the picture very happy with tge seller product will order from them again ^-^</li>
    <li> Generic,  not what I expected</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this Beauty Blender! It is the best shape for applying everything from concealer, to foundation, to powder, and blending...it&#x27;s perfect! I have been looking for one that would fit comfortably in your hand while working, and this little Guy is it! I am going to order more so I can give them as gifts to my Make Up students...that&#x27;s how much I love this Blender!!! It is Pro Make Up Artist approved!!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy these they do not expand at all! Not even worth the dollar!</li>
    <li> works amazing! Great blending tool!</li>
    <li> Such a nice product to have when you&#x27;re in a rush in the morning!</li>
    <li> a litte stiff/rough but gets the job done thats needed.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted!! Great!!</li>
    <li> this is not a good option for value . it is hard and doesn&#x27;t become &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; when wet/damp.i have tried to use it on a few occasions and i threw them away. don&#x27;t waste your money just buy the real deal this &amp;#34;hunting&amp;#34; we do looking for dupes is more expensive then just getting what we KNOW WORKS</li>
    <li> This works just nearly as well as the $20 beautyblender! My makeup goes on so smoothly with this! My only suggestion to using this is to use a primer to help get smooth flawless skin. I&#x27;ve noticed that if I don&#x27;t use my primer with this I have to apply a lot more foundation than with a brush to achieve an all-over flawless coverage look.</li>
    <li> I love this beauty blender. It&#x27;s exactly like the original one but a bit cheaper, and worth the wait and money. Now I just need to figure out how to clean it.. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I would actually give 0 stars. The sponge is hard and horrible. Not for make up, going in the garbage. Shopping for forever too.</li>
    <li> its only 99c but dont even bother its hard as a rock its not like the real beauty blender thats soft and you can wet it and blend your makeup with  well not this</li>
    <li> too stiff even after soaked with water and damp. does not apply make- up well either.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Complete scam</li>
    <li> Very stiff and did not blend the products as it should.</li>
    <li> not exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not really worth having since i&#x27;ve probably only used it a handful of times but the price isnt bad. Its just the sponge is stiff even when wet</li>
    <li> O thought three was more than one, not sure how to use, no instructions😖</li>
    <li> Really stiff, even when you soak it in water.</li>
    <li> I bought this because brand name beauty blenders are expensive for a sponge and I was amazed at how cheap this one was it worked exactly the way I wanted it too.</li>
    <li> Poor packaging, but good product.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the original blender. Hard as a rock I threw it away immediately.. Save your money and buy the real thing.I also didn&#x27;t even get the one that was pictured.</li>
    <li> I really love this sponge! it works just as well as the beauty blender at almost a quarter of the price.  It is soft yet dense enough to do what it has to do.  Reaches all those crevices that are hard to cover, easy to clean and can be used either wet or dry.  I am a brush type of girl but I would rather use this for the concealer/highlighter in the countouring areas ( forehead, eye, bridge of nose, top of chin) as well as I use it for my Tarte Cream blush ( the large bulbous part) for a soft cheeky airbrushed blushing look.  Great product at an even better price, if they keep it at the current price will keep purchasing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, but its not for long term use. After a few weeks the sponge was getting harder and harder to wash. Other than that, it was good while it lasted :)</li>
    <li> I love Beauty Blenders and this is a great alternative. Slightly smaller in size, which I actually prefer to the large mac beauty blenders on the market. One thing I suggest is to RINSE  the sponge with hot water thoroughly before using it because they did not have safety seal packaging and the pink dye in the sponge bleeds out a little. I still love the sponge and its great price for the extra caution before using.</li>
    <li> This product is convenient for those who have issues with caking, it gives me a smooth natrual look. I have oily skin and at the end of the work day my make up is shot, so this helped a lot! I will say that the delivery took a while and I forgot about it. But if you&#x27;re patient then you have nothing to worry about. Give it a try, it&#x27;s a dollar well spent!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I hate this product, but I don&#x27;t like it and I never used it for that reason. This beauty blender I received instantly got a stain after I used it just once. I washed it off with dish soap (which is what you&#x27;re supposed to do) and the stain wouldn&#x27;t come out. Also, the photo is deceiving as I received a light peach colored knock off. I honestly ended up throwing it away as it didn&#x27;t make my foundation application &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;, just patchy and discolored. To add to the disappointment of the product, my beauty blender arrived way past the expected shipping date. Will not be buying from this seller again. I recently bought the original beauty blender from Makeup Geek and I LOVE it. I trust her way more than I trust this seller and I&#x27;ll be buying from her in the future because of it.</li>
    <li> Was expecting a sponge it&#x27;s too hard to use so I just ended up giving it away waste of money</li>
    <li> BEST COSMETIC PRODUCT EVER!! LADIES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BEAUTY BLENDER, IT WORKS MIRACLES!! GET RID OF THOSE BRUSHES AND USE THE BEAUTY BLENDER!</li>
    <li> So the headline of the prodruct is teardrop makeup blender.. and its pink. I got a blue hourglass shaped one. I ordered this as a beautyblender dupe.. not to be surprised. Oh well.</li>
    <li> i expected to get the teadropped shaped sponge in stead received more of a pestal/ teadrop shaped one. but i stills work amazingly. blends all of my concealer and foundation in perfectly.</li>
    <li> It blends very well with your foundation and it is very good to use up under the eye area that really need it the most.</li>
    <li> This is not the product you think you&#x27;re buying! You buy cheap you get cheap! This thing is hard as a rock. Even after I ran it under water to soften it up still doesn&#x27;t work! Better to spend the money at sephora. I was trying to save myself money but I just seemed to throw it away with this garbage!</li>
    <li> It is okay, i think a foundation brush is a lot better, because this sponge sucks in all my foundation and its not the greatest</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with these blending sponges. Ever since I have started using them my makeup has been smoother than ever and definitely more blemish free! This sponge makes it easy to get all the hard to reach areas, like the creases of your nose, where as the rest of the sponge rolls nicely between your fingers to create a flawless look! Not to mention, these sponges are insanely soft! I prefer this teardrop shape over the more abstract shape that they are also offered in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on these is definitely phenomenal. The only real downside is that they ship from China so they take about 2 weeks to arrive, which is fine I just order in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend! I guarantee that these will change your beauty routine for the better!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on positive customer reviews and the product description. The real beauty blender was pretty expensive ($15 for one!) so for a little more than a dollar I thought this would be a good substitute. Turns out, I was VERY wrong! Not only is this not even close to what the picture looks like (much smaller and a different color), it&#x27;s hard, a different material (not porous at all) and does nothing when wet, just stays a dense rubber-like material. I just went ahead and bought the real thing, I guess there is no substitute for the real deal.</li>
    <li> This little thing is great. I had heard that they were good and contemplated buying one for a while. I&#x27;m glad I finally did and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too dense, hard as a rock, and didn&#x27;t perform worth anything.</li>
    <li> It arrived earlier than expected but it was very hard, usually with beauty sponges you must wet them then they puff up and are very soft and well spongy this was hard i wet it and it stayed the same so i had to cut it to use on my nails instead.</li>
    <li> Hard as a rock and doesn&#x27;t even soften when dampened.</li>
    <li> Way too small and too firm to blend</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work so well its hard to clean and doesn&#x27;t really blend well it left blotches on my face.</li>
    <li> The material is a little too stiff. It wouldn&#x27;t absorb water, none the less my makeup. You get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the sponge that was pictured.I got a didn&#x27;t shaped one.So can&#x27;t review the inner pictured. Wasn&#x27;t happy I didn&#x27;t the spongeI Ordered.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It really met my expectations and beyond. Being that this product was so affordable and low in price I didn&#x27;t think it would be anywhere near the original beauty blender, but I was wrong and it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I&#x27;m sooo buying this in bulk in my next purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bit smaller than I thought but it works really well for me as a cosmetologist .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better to buy an original beauty blender. It&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great all though it took so long to come in.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied being that I had my own Salon for years I would use this professionally.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the worst one I have ever used. First of all, it took forever to arrive. When i tried to dampen the sponge, it never expanded. It&#x27;s as hard as a rock, you get what you pay for..</li>
    <li> The is a really nice blender I just have very dry skin so when I use it my skin flakes off, which is gross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I find the shape a little inconvenient.</li>
    <li> The picture shows the complete opposite of what you actually recieve and having never used a real beauty blender before i thought this thing was amazing UNTIL i received my real beauty blender yesterday and this is NOTHING like it. This is a rubbery texture doesn&#x27;t swell up like the real blender the few times i used this it left my foundation blotchy and i had to go in with foundation brush and fix it. After purchasing the real thing i would not recommend this fake blender it is a waste of money and you might as well just buy the real thing.</li>
    <li> I have used other sponges before from other companies.  However, this product does not deserve any stars.  The product is something that I can&#x27;t use on my face.  The material is not a good material and is not supple.</li>
    <li> First off I would like to say, my order came way before the estimated arrival date (good thing). The item came within about 3 weeks.  My order was held up in Cali for a whole week for whatever the reason may be (bs). When I opened the package, my fingers were covered in some disgusting black oily slime. Was f**ing disgusting! let alone the smell of car oil &amp; the sponge applicator was soaked in it! There was no way in hell I could salvage let alone use tht on my face. I&#x27;m quite disappointed in the product &amp; will never be ordering from here again. Luckily, I only wasted $1+.</li>
    <li> Omg I love this thing I would order again came on time packed nd arrived good... Use this to blend in my concealer haven&#x27;t used it on foundation... Works good even when wet think ill buy the other shapes but yes this very good well b buying again</li>
    <li> bought this because i also thought the $20 beauty blender was too much. it works just fine, although it is not very soft or flexible. hoping to maybe find another one on here that&#x27;s better... if anyone knows, leave a comment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: after purchasing a higher quality beauty blender (the orange Real Techniques one) I decided this one is horrible. Soaks up too much foundation and very stiff, you&#x27;re basically beating your face up. No thanks. I&#x27;ll stick to paying $10 on Real Techniques and not splurging completely at Sephora on the Beauty Blender. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money - since it does take FOREVER to arrive.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s an average blender that is hard to clean but does a decent job. The shape is good, and is easy to hold, but care for it is difficult. For the price, I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY. Its super hard and does not apply makeup. It is nothing like the beauty blender, which is soft and squishy and deposits makeup. Regular latex makeup sponges are better</li>
    <li> Bought three of these for my daughter, niece and myself. We don&#x27;t use liquid foundation, but we do use a lot of mineral and cream makeup. Works well around eyes and for buffing away along the jawline. We use it for blending cream blushes and bronzes and couldn&#x27;t be happier. We have found that the blenders work well with layering small amounts. If you put too much on the blenders it makes a mess so take it easy. Shipping does take a while but the seller is in China so you should expect that. This is not a $20 blender but definitely worth the dollar I spent.</li>
    <li> I received the sponge as per shipping instructions but it leaves a weird smell on your face after you use it to apply product.</li>
    <li> This is a great little make up blender! makes my foundation look flawless!</li>
    <li> It looks like but it is not the real thing. After I bought the real stuff, I throw away it immediately.</li>
    <li> Worthless product. Feels and smells rubbery. Please do not waste your money on this. Wish I could give it no stars!</li>
    <li> I am in love!! It blends like a charm.. I&#x27;ll use my large flat top brush to apply the foundation then this to blend it out. Now they say that if the foundation is runny not to use it. Well I did. It soaked up enough to where it make my face look flawless. It also holds enough water for it to work. Now it is a little hard.. But it&#x27;s great for my face. I don&#x27;t want it to soft. I&#x27;m known to stick my fingers right through the soft ones.</li>
    <li> It arrived loose and damaged in the package, without any sanitary protection. Save your pennies for the real Beauty Blender instead.</li>
    <li> This is great i love it. I don&#x27;t use it for makeup I use it to do my nails, But it works great I did try it out with makeup and it works just fine with that to I recommend buying this but remember it is cheaper to go to an actual store cause you don&#x27;t have to pay shipping or wait for it to come if you just want to order it online then buy this its great</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t accept this to be big it is very TINY ! and just to say that it took almost a year for me to receive this I had to contact them to let them know!</li>
    <li> It works great.  Blends my make-up and takes the shine off my face.  For a 1.95.  Cheap. Work s for me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s obviously not like the original but it&#x27;s way better than applying make up with your hands, I love the finish look and it&#x27;s very helpful will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this product, it feels very rubbery, i have a lot of beauty blenders and it is nothing like this, this is horrible i will not be purchasing this again, don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money on buying this..</li>
    <li> I know apparently it is not the real thing BUT BUT BUT it sure does the job. It is different. The finish on your face whether blending a concealer or foundation is great.</li>
    <li> When i saw the prize of this item i thought that i was going to get some okay not something bad or some great. But this came out to be something that i actually hated myself for buying.&lt;br /&gt;- It wouldnt soak of the water!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It was so strange the first time that i used it all dry and hard and it made my makeup application look very bad. So the second time that i used it i put the sponge inside a cup of water for five minutes and it still didnt work.&lt;br /&gt;- So save yourself from this bad product and invent in a good one, the one that i would recommend that isnt expensive as the real one would be the Soho but yet that one will tear and you are kind of rough with it.</li>
    <li> Oh no. I had to throw this away. I tried cleaning it the way one would clean a beauty blender and the foundation would not come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, when I ran it under hot water it DID NOT expand at all. It&#x27;s a piece of nothing. Save your $$</li>
    <li> This works great, it came faster then I thought, brand new in the package. Buy more then one because they are so cheap. for sure worth it! They blend your makeup great, wouldn&#x27;t want to do without now.</li>
    <li> This was not a good product at all. It was very hard, even we wet. Not the real deal😒 it didn&#x27;t even blend my makeup very well. I think maybe you could use it if your just getting started maybe.. But definitely not a good purchase. I now let my younger sister(age 5) play with it when she does my makeup. And she loves it</li>
    <li> this blends my make up so well i am so glad i tried this and so easy to wash had it for months and still works like i just got it out of the box.</li>
    <li> i dont think that i will  try it on my face..you can even feel the smell of the plastic.....dont like it</li>
    <li> This is no beauty blender, but very comparable to every other BB dupe I&#x27;ve tried, the reason this and many others don&#x27;t compare is because of how firm the sponge is. So, for 1 dollar its just like the 5 dollar dupes I&#x27;ve tried. So that&#x27;s good, but too firm for me</li>
    <li> i didnt even get the &amp;#34;tear drop&amp;#34; one which is the one i ordered, and it is too hard, the water has no effect on it</li>
    <li> It blends well, is easy to use and gives a airbrushed look if you use it properly. It does take time to get used to but when you get it down, its so so worth it!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.  Normally once you put them under water they expand and get soft.  These didn&#x27;t even move.  I don&#x27;t recommend them if you are looking for a beauty blender alternative.</li>
    <li> it absorbs the product too much..its not as soft as a sponge when u wet it..hard to clean..good for price</li>
    <li> This product works great for the price we pay for.it it worth i just received mine and could wait to use it, it doesn&#x27;t grow much when you wet it but i blends great i love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice size..its like the size of an egg...would&#x27;ve rated it a 4 but it took a long time to come...very soft,pretty pink color..will order again..</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter she uses this a lot.</li>
    <li> This is a great beauty blender! Love it. It did take a little while to get here, but, it was coming from across the pond, I think...so that is understandable.</li>
    <li> This makeup sponge is amazing. Works just as good as the higher priced ones. Does the job just the same, without spending $20+. I ordered just two to try. I should of ordered a bunch. I will be purchasing again. I ordered on 5-10-15 and received them on 5-29-15.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a beauty blender, this my first time and I lovvvvve it, I give it 5stars....I&#x27;m ordering more</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would work just as well as the Swissco ones, but the sponge just does not hold nor distributes the product evenly or nicely.  Well you get your money&#x27;s worth, I guess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used makeup sponges before and they hold water in it and become larger in size but this one really did the opposite. It didn&#x27;t soak up the water I had it sitting in and when I went to use it, it was very hard to the touch and putting foundation on like that does not work too well.</li>
    <li> This sponge is not soft at all, even when you put in under running water still hard. I bought the beauty blender and unfortunately their is no comparison. The beauty blender is 10 times better. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This  beauty blender is horrible. It is very small and does not absorb water when put under the faucet.. It does not grow or become soft, instead it stays small and hard.</li>
    <li> Price is very reasonable! It&#x27;s more porous I&#x27;m person then the photo shows, looks very smooth in the pictures. Came in on time very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Absorbs and smooths just like a beauty blender. I wash mines right after using them so no staining so far and they are still holding up very well. I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied with this product. Extra plus is that they are soft. I would def. recommend and buy again for my clients.</li>
    <li> I liked the shape but these weren&#x27;t soft enough, even when wet, to spread my makeup easily. That caused streaking and spots with too much or too little coverage. Shipping was extremely slow.</li>
    <li> This thing sucks!  Avoid it at all costs.....it&#x27;s extremely hard and makes BAD streaks.</li>
    <li> I think for being that this item is so cheap it is a good quality. I was about to waste so much money on a beauty blender when i came across this. I was what i expected</li>
    <li> FIRST let me say yes it is clearly a knock off the expensive beauty blender so i knew it wouldn&#x27;t be as great as the original, but even for a knock off this is terrible! It does NOT blend at all and just makes the foundation look horrible. Its hard dry or wet. It doesn&#x27;t blend or make it easy to apply foundation at all, id rather use an old school white triangle sponge than use this again! Luckly it was cheap so no harm really. I even went as far as to try avons 8.00 one and it was already 10 times better..would never recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> this is amazing! shipping took about 2 weeks , really actually soft and picks up my fondation great (: i dont know why some people complain ,i recommand this ! So much alike , to the sephora beauty blender</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is not a dupe for the Beauty Blender it is way too hard and doesnt give when you press it. it also soaks up way too much product and I find it impossible to properly apply makeup with it especially foundation and concealer.the foam that they used to manufacture this product is not like most cosmetic sponges it is a hard foam that feels more like rubber than actual soft foam make up wedges or sponges. I would just save up money for the Beauty Blender and just by that instead of trying to save money with this lower quality knock off.</li>
    <li> Love my tear drop can not so my makeup without it</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again its not close to a beauty blender and its really hard even when wet might be ok if you wanna pack or cake on product but stay away if you want a flawless finish. It takes forever to grow and when it does it till very hallow and stiff I will continue to invest in Real Techniques Complexion Sponge and the BB. I bought three of them thinking maybe they were improved very  disappointed at least I have new room decor</li>
    <li> The Teardrop Pro Beauty sponge works pretty good for the price. I usually wet it and squeeze the water out , this helps to soften it and to leave a pretty flawless appearance. The teardrop shape makes it very easy to get your foundation around your eyes and nose area. Overall it does the job.</li>
    <li> Terrible product to purchase ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> its not a real beauty blender. iteam is cheap and does not work!!! I am extremely dissapointed with the iteam.</li>
    <li> I rarely use this item because a beauty triangle does better. Kinda awkward to use at first. Takes some getting use to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this same item before from this same seller and was extremely pleased with what i had received but this time it wasnt even the same material it did not expand like a sponge at all it was super hard and silicon like, I might as well use a piece of rubber on my face to apply foundation.</li>
    <li> Got this blending tool after seeing similar ones for sale at Sephora for 3 times the price. Got this one instead and it is definitely effective. Do not pay those high prices when this tool is just as effective.</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if I&#x27;d like it better than or at least as much as the one I got from TJMAXX. I used it twice and tossed it out simply because wetting it does not make it softer, or bigger. I feel like I could do a better job applying foundation with my hands. There are some dupes to the beauty blender out there; this is just not one of them.</li>
    <li> It got to me fast, and was exactly what i wanted it to be Thank you so very much :)  it actually came with more then one i was only expecting one so thank you</li>
    <li> Regret this order, I cannot believe it takes over a month for a makeup sponge! Ridiculous will never buy again</li>
    <li> i have the beauty blender but i decided to get this just for back up since it was so inexpensive but it is way to hard, it doesn&#x27;t get bigger with water either… nothing like the beauty blender, do not recommend</li>
    <li> Got 2 of them for just under $2.00, and they shipped pretty fast to me. I have no complaints about the this beauty blender and would def order them again. Great product for the price!!!</li>
    <li> this is an awesome dupe for the beauty blende and it works great. I can&#x27;t give it five stars because it breaks down easily, but its awesome for a dollar. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product does not increase in size when wet. It also does not absorb and extra make up, it just smears it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source - Make up artist.....</li>
    <li> I follow many beauty bloggers and vloggers and this shape for a blending brush did not work well for me. Also after a few applications the Sponge began to break apart and leave remits in my foundation. It was super cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> not as big as I pictured it to be fits in the palm of my hand with space left over. good buy over all keeps me from getting fingers messy and hold together well</li>
    <li> While I do love this product for blending my liquid foundation and such, what&#x27;s shown in the picture isn&#x27;t what I got in the mail. What I received was blue, and was sort of gourd shaped. While this doesn&#x27;t at all change how it works (as far as I know) it would be a good idea if you&#x27;re going to sell different styles (I noticed some reviewers DID get the pink one) to show them, and maybe allow selection. I didn&#x27;t know until a bit after I bought it that you need to use this WET. But don&#x27;t worry, the dampness doesn&#x27;t remove your makeup, it just allows for smoother blending.</li>
    <li> The makeup beauty blender was exactly what I was expecting and is great for applying concealer to face.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Easy to use and blends perfectly. Others cost 8 dollars and more. This one is cheaper and does the same function.</li>
    <li> Great product love the way it applies my makeup</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t own a beauty blender but from what I&#x27;ve seen this sponge is nothing like it. it almost has a styrofoam texture and it is very rough and hurts to use it. I am not totally disappointed because I spent $1 and nothing on shipping; not worth buying</li>
    <li> Ok, being a beauty gru, please save your money and your looks by NOT purcjing this product</li>
    <li> This is a great dupe for the original beauty blender , how ever its way way way waaaay smaller than expected &amp; the one I received had a tear/hole in it .</li>
    <li> It was exactly what i was expecting. It&#x27;s a little small when it first arrives, but when you start using it with water it starts growing. I recommend it, plus it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
    <li> It got here relatively quick but its super small, probably only plus side is that its easy to get close up into the under eye area and the area around the nose. Ill still give it a try though.</li>
    <li> Love it although&lt;br /&gt; it&#x27;s tiny!</li>
    <li> I never recieved my product . And i actually waited 1 more month and still nothing . Aint that much money to even worry about but atleast have the supply!!</li>
    <li> The beauty blend was a bit hard and on top of that it had a toxic smell to it. After a few washes both were taken care of. Damp it with some water water and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Does not blend. Too stiff even after soaked</li>
    <li> Make sure you wet with warm water then squeeze out excess then use. Great beauty sponge!</li>
    <li> So great, I use this thing everyday. I have probably 15 of these things so I will always have one</li>
    <li> Love how my foundation look after using this. Makes it look like its a natural look. Cant stop using it..</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing!!!! Was just a little smaller than expected but so cheap and so worth it!! Get it wet and squeeze out the water before you put the product on and wipe over face in circular motions. My makeup has never looked better and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> every time i washed it the color was coming off of it</li>
    <li> Very firm, almost painful to use over eye area. Blends foundation/concealer very well</li>
    <li> These are about half the size as the normal ones you see in stores</li>
    <li> I bought this before and I liked the first one better because it was more swishy and applied makeup much better and my new one is harder and not good.</li>
    <li> Loveeeeee this baby use it damn near everyday !</li>
    <li> Never used a beauty blender before but it was pricey for me atm so i looked for a dupe. This sponge is very good! It is hard when not wet, but once wet, it works like magic and does NOT soak alot of foundation. For me at least. Glad i went with my instincts on this one! I&#x27;d recommend and buy again. Try and see! It was priced cheap and if you dont like it, what do you got to lose right? :D</li>
    <li> I really love this product! Since it was so cheap wasn&#x27;t expecting it to last as long as it is lasting and leaves such a nice smooth finish. I usually wet it first before use. If not you don&#x27;t get the same result</li>
    <li> this thing sucks and will rip in half if you breathe on it wrong. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s so cheap or if I just hate beauty blenders but this thing is the worst of the bunch.</li>
    <li> apart from waiting and waiting for them  to get here, it was very dissapointing. i ordered two and they were far too small and also were very hard and although im sure they were made of sponge like material, they were hard and looked cheaply made, they absorbed most of my makeup.and they did not even blend anything out but merely cleaned it off my face...  also they have a fowl smell.. so please ear yourselves and dont buy this.</li>
    <li> When this product arrived i was very pleased. It was soft and smooth and a good size. It was bouncy and the color was nice. I used this product a few times and found that the sponge does not absorb too much product. There is however a slight odor but that was fixed after i washed it. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Do not order this. Got a balloon in the mail instead of a beauty blender</li>
    <li> Do not buy! If you are looking for something like to Beauty Blender, this is not it! It is all latex and not spongy at all. It doesn&#x27;t soak up any water. You are better off buying sponges from the drugstore. You can also go to Ulta.com and buy the Real Techniques sponge. It&#x27;s only $6.00 and it is just like the Beauty Blender...just a different shape. :)</li>
    <li> Is not the good i don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> First of all I didn&#x27;t get the teardrop sponge. I got some hourglass sponge which smelled like rubber. However, it does get the job well and fast.</li>
    <li> Super small. Doesn&#x27;t absorb water but does absorb all your foundation</li>
    <li> i love this sponge smaller than expected but its great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really tiny and not like a real beauty blender, I like it but I&#x27;m not in love with it</li>
    <li> Really great blender, you have to make it moist otherwise will not work as good. Really good quality.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t wash the foundation out of the is produc</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I wet it, squeeze the water out then use my palette. Its a Flawless application. Great buy!</li>
    <li> When it first came i wasn&#x60;t impressed, just because it looked nothing like the picture for one, but also it is a little harder than a real beauty blender. Works great when it is wet though!</li>
    <li> It is cheap and do the same job than the high price...</li>
    <li> im not a big fan of sponges but i decided to try this one, it wasnt very smooth and i didnt like it but my sister loved it</li>
    <li> Teardrop Pro Beauty Makeup Blender is very easy to use &amp; blends my face make up perfectly.  Easily cleaned, I actually put it in the dishwasher with my other makeup sponges and brushes.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> This item is much more affordable than the popular brands. I like the size, shape and ease of application. It works perfectly well. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> SOOOO GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously identical to the $20beautyblender and applies foundation, concealer, and bb cream flawlessly! Definitely will be a repurchase!</li>
    <li> It was a little hard when I got it. I didn&#x27;t understand the purpose of these when I first bought it so I used it for painting. I have one now years later and I love it!</li>
    <li> Works very well worth money</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong... but I get more of an &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; result using a foundation brush.  Still glad I have it in my collection...</li>
    <li> Very nice really good buy I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but the only problem it sheds a lot</li>
    <li> came just as expected thank you so much</li>
    <li> Its great for blending out my makeup except for when it came, it had a weirdly strong smell. I had to wash it a few times</li>
    <li> Used to use max factor many years ago. Well satisfied with the pan stick. Has good coverage.</li>
    <li> The two I received were very soft and they blend my bronzer very well. I know they are meant for foundation but I bought them to contour. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll work just as well with foundation.</li>
    <li> I have been using this blender for 2 weeks now and I love it!It blends my makeup perfectly and it&#x27;s easy to clean. I would be buying a new one in the future.</li>
