      <li>A little dry for the winter weather here in New England but does a very nice job clearing the skin.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this bar soap as a body soap and a face soap.</li>
      <li>just high quality charcoal soap the will store well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving 3 stars based solely off the comparison of my normal charcoal soap made by Say</li>

<li> ;) If you are prone to dry skin, I would recommend keeping a little fractionated coconut oil on hand after washing up with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It does burn on raw skin, and take care to avoid the eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;But, wow!  </li>
<li> It does dry out your skin a bit-</li>
<li> /&gt;It doesnt irritate my skin at all - and I havr very sensitive skin with complex allergies and mast-cell conditions.  </li>
<li> Was as expected......</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t buy any other brand.</li>
<li> I wish some of their other stuff came in value packs like this!</li>

    <li> A little dry for the winter weather here in New England but does a very nice job clearing the skin.</li>
    <li> Was as expected......</li>
    <li> Great soap and cleans well!</li>
    <li> works well would buy agian</li>
    <li> Does anyone zoom in on the ingredients? They have &amp;#34;LARD&amp;#34; in one of the ingredients, which is &amp;#34;pig fat&amp;#34;....</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent, my skin felt super clean after using it! I have used commercial brand charcoal soap, but none of them have cleaned my skin without drying it out. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> great stuff. replacing my organic coconut oil soap (which I love) for this.</li>
    <li> Best value for a quality product!</li>
    <li> Great soap for sensitive areas &amp; skin! Does what it says. I won&#x27;t buy any other brand.</li>
    <li> Bar doesn&#x27;t dissolve away before your eyes, comes with many bars, and it priced less than others that give you one</li>
    <li> I have been using activated charcoal soap, as well as researching unscented, truly hypoallergenic soap and detergent options for a year or so now.  And, I must say that I am very pleased with the quality and pricing of this product :)&lt;br /&gt;It lathers beautifully!  And it eliminates ordors and residues (and oils - hence &amp;#34;squeaky clean!&amp;#34;) If you are prone to dry skin, I would recommend keeping a little fractionated coconut oil on hand after washing up with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;I also find it works excellently as a shampoo and even as a dish soap (leaves plates, pots and pans squeaky clean too :) yay!)&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt irritate my skin at all - and I havr very sensitive skin with complex allergies and mast-cell conditions.  It does burn on raw skin, and take care to avoid the eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;But, wow!  I love it</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to be a little granier for exfoliation, but overall a great soap.</li>
    <li> I am a medical physician as well as a naturalpathic physician and I try to make all of my own soaps etc.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have bought &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34; soap of any kind that I have been so completely impressed with.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this bar soap as a body soap and a face soap. I recommend this as a consumer, a medical doctor and also a naturalpathic doctor.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase. The soap has been helping keep away the poison ivy rashes when I work in the yard. I come in and shower with it right away. So far so good. It does dry out your skin a bit- but that is what I wanted it for !</li>
    <li> I use on my face, and so does my teenage son. It really helps with acne!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 3 stars based solely off the comparison of my normal charcoal soap made by Say Yes To Tomatos. While this soap is way more economical, I don&#x27;t like it as well as SYTT. I can&#x27;t put my finger on why, and after 6 bars I may no longer care, because it&#x27;s cheaper. I guess time will tell.</li>
    <li> Love the soap leaves skin nice and squeaky clean, non fragrant, which I love since I wear cologne when I want to without have two different scents on my skin.</li>
    <li> Got this for a couple of oily, somewhat stinky, teenagers, and they love it. Will certainly continue to get this for them as long as they are oily and smelly. :)</li>
    <li> Love it  so much  i ordered another bag after using the first bar like 3 times .  stuff is that good</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this soap! I gave bars to family/friends to try and now have to order another bag. It is truly scent free and leaves your skin feeling so clean! Fast shipping, too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great value. For the money, there isn&#x27;t a better product I&#x27;ve ever come across. The soap smells great, feels nice on the skin and in the hands, no feeling of residue, just clean–overall just high quality charcoal soap the will store well. I love Lush&#x27;s products and have tried a number of other higher priced, similar products and believe this stuff is as good as nearly any of them. Would certainly recommend/buy again. I wish some of their other stuff came in value packs like this!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. A friend makes soap and got me hooked on charcoal soap, but she stopped making it for others.  This product is fantastic and dare I say even better than my friend&#x27;s?  Shipped quick, which is always good.  I will be buying from this company again ... and again ... and again. :-)</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried Charcoal soap, and it seems to be a really good soap.  Lathers well and leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
    <li> What an amazing product!  I gave a bar to my mother and she said that it made her skin feel so soft!  I agree, and it has also cleared up my skin from the adult acne I suffer from.  Such a great price too!  The soap lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no breakouts on my face since I&#x27;ve started using this.</li>
