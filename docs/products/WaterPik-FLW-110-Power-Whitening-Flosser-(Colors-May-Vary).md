<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tingling sensation in a few spots meant I could not get to them with my hummingbird. Not as easy to use as the hummingbird but maybe better for your teeth.</li>
    <li> Not so sure this is better than flossing</li>
    <li> The Whitening Flosser does&#x27;t replace flossing. The dental floss can clean under the gums (if you know how to do it) while the flosser clean only between teeth.</li>
    <li> i got it i used it a few times it&#x27;s not worth it i can understand if it used water but all it dose is vibrate i might get more out of it if i attach a tooth brush to the end of it. for all who want a water pik, this one dose not use water.....</li>
    <li> I really like this because its handy and I am able to take it with me. It  cleans between my braces very well.</li>
    <li> Braces make flossing a royal pain.  This makes flossing reasonable again.  Only drawback is that this is battery operated, not plug-in</li>
    <li> This works well and seems to help my gums, it&#x27;s quick, and easy to access most of the interstitial spaces between teeth.  It does not go \\&quot;all the way up\\&quot; between closely spaced teeth, so I still supplement with traditional string floss.   Drawbacks include having to hold the button instead of being able to turn it \\&quot;on\\&quot;, and it&#x27;s difficult to get between my last set of molars because my cheeks obstruct the instrument a little bit, but OVERALL I&#x27;m glad I bought.  Nice supplement to conventional method and great for on-the-go flossing.</li>
    <li> This item made my gums bleed terribly and hurt to use. I also felt like it was not cleaning inbetween my teeth at all.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the actual water flosser I had of there&#x27;s. That worked great but product stopped working after about six or seven months. Wish I knew the warranty information. But power flosser unfortunately wasn&#x27;t  what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent dental care product that cleans your teeth and gums really well *near* the gum line areas.  However, it is hardly a \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; for floss, since -- unless you have very large gaps between your teeth -- it cannot possibly clean between the upper inter-dental portions of your teeth as floss can.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I recieved this item on yesterday and used it last night I don&#x27;t know wht took me so long to look for one and order it but it is easy to use and I hve recommended it to my coworkers</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product...works well and a great price</li>
    <li> Perfect for those who can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t floss.  Maybe not as good as regular dental floss but much better than none at all.</li>
    <li> I like this product and use it regularly--but some things are annoying.  It is hard to get to my back teeth because the flossing tips are too short and so is the place where they attach to the flosser.  The flossing tips have a little bulb at the end that is sometimes hard to get in between tight teeth.  There is no charging or charged indicator on the device.  The flossing tips are provided in a loose case that doesn&#x27;t attach to the base in any way.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That said, I do use this every day and that&#x27;s better than I&#x27;ve done with regular floss or other products--so it&#x27;s an improvement for me.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t  find for a long time.  Simple but effective.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this at Amazon.com, but either way, this thing is junk. I was excited that this may make my flossing routine faster and easier with no more blue fingertips (from cut off circulation), however, after using it, I went and flossed with regular floss and it was like I was flossing for the first time. All it did was vibrate my gums. It certainly didn&#x27;t clean any plaque from anywhere and I couldn&#x27;t get to my molars.    I have normal, straight teeth, with normal gums, no braces, so I asked my husband who has a little bit of teeth crowding to try it and it was even harder for him to floss with this thing.     Returning it ASAP and going back to the ol string of floss.</li>
    <li> The words &amp;#34;Vibrating tip&amp;#34; ANYWHERE in the product description might help someone to know that this WATERPIC product HAS NO WATER.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this item.  The threads were too thick to fit between my teeth. I tried using it for a few weeks, but gave up.  Resorted back to shread-resistant floss.</li>
    <li> I have used this product instead of dental floss for well over a year.  Recently I went to the dentist and had 3 cavities between my teeth.  My dentist said that this product works well enough at the gumline but does nothing to prevent decay between the teeth. How could it, when it doesn&#x27;t go there?  Maybe if you have enough space between your teeth, this could slide up and down between them, but if not, you are out of luck.  Notice that this is a pick-style device, not a true flosser like the Reach Access Power Flosser, which I will try next.  Also, the button is in an awkward place and requires constant firm pressure to stay on.</li>
    <li> Love/Hate relationship. I have braces and this item is perfect for me! It&#x27;s phenomenally easy and pleasant to use rather than using a threader and floss. I keep it in my purse. It&#x27;s great for massaging gums, too. While at home, I use it between water flossing with a Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator EW-EJ10-a.  I have tried three different Waterpik water units and they all performed abysmally. I tried two of the portable WPs and 1 countertop unit. Never again. The Panasonic is so good that I bought another one to keep in my suitcase. I travel twice monthly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to this fabulous flosser - it&#x27;s inexpensive for what it is, so having to replace it after a year and a half wasn&#x27;t as aggravating as trying to change the battery. Grr. The first one I had, the head thing broke off of the battery part (never did find the battery in the compartment - it was so stuck in there) so I threw the whole thing away and ordered another. I rec&#x27;d my new one with amazingly fast Amazon.com standard shipping free and it only took 3 days- got it 30 minutes ago and I opened it to see if this one opened easier. Slightly. Although I got the head AND battery unit removed successfully on this one, when I went to put it back and use it,  the business end of it (cap thing and flosser) won&#x27;t attach back onto the body. Arrrrggghhhhhhh!  I just got off with customer support and she told me to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I LOVE the Waterpik cordless flosser FLA-110.</li>
    <li> I realy liked the product. It is easy to use because it&#x27;s cordless and stimulates gums.</li>
    <li> Even after flossing the old-fashioned way, the WaterPik flosser was able to get out some additional particles that I had missed. It gets into close spaces with little effort and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my kids-in-braces, to make flossing easier for them. It has done that.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shock came when I went shopping for the replacement filaments (they come loaded in a heavy plastic rack, reminiscent of a magazine for a gun). For a pack of 30, the price (retail, not on Amazon) was $5.99! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for almost one year. It continues to work flawlessly. One of the main reasons I bought it was to do a better job of flossing under my bridges. It may not be perfect, but it does a great job. It is so much easier. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This item does not work as you may think.  All it does is vibrate a large piece of nylon.  So if you are thinking of replacing flossing with this, that will not be the case, unless you have large gaps between your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I have had periodontal sugery twice (as well as lots of other dental treatment). The flosser is the key to why at age 67 my teeth are in excellent shape.</li>
    <li> I am unhappy that I did not order a regular water pik.  the little pics do not do a good job clearing particles between the teeth.  they bend out of shape very quickly...before the &amp;#34;job&amp;#34; is accomplished.  I ended up using dental floss and electric toothbrush to take care of what I expected the pik to do.  and the shipping cost was outrageous!</li>
    <li> works great, and it arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I really like this thing! It cleans between your teeth at the gum line. It doesn&#x27;t slide between your teeth like floss; it pokes in through the side and wiggles around like a drain snake. &lt;br /&gt;It is a gentle but invigorating experience. Change tip every time. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This flosser works fine. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to figure out. I don&#x27;t recall seeing instructions on how to remove each flosser, but it was pretty easy to figure out once I picked up the sleeve of new ones and saw this opening on the side and knew I had to put the needle in there and then &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; it over. That popped out the old needle to make room for the new one. The real test of how well it works will come at my next dental appointment!</li>
    <li> I think if you have braces this is great.  If your teeth don&#x27;t touch this would be fine.  If you want something that will go up and down between the teeth, and they touch, this is not for you.  I would rather use floss.  The only thing I can get this to do is go along the gum line at the very bottom of the teeth.  That&#x27;s not going to keep plaque away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The little tips are just too big.</li>
    <li> I really like using this product rather than floss because it cuts the hassle!  It&#x27;s also much more hygenic in my opinion, if you are not near a sink.  I like to use it in the car on the way to work!  It takes a minute to get used to your teeth vibrating though!</li>
    <li> This device is absolutely indespensible for anyone with braces or dental appliances of any kind.  The water jet really gets the hard to reach areas clean.  Durable design and convenient storage make this a bathroom must!</li>
    <li> I like this flosser.  The replacements are not cheap but I found them at Pharmapacks.com for $3.84 for 30 .. everywhere else  is like $6-8 dollars.</li>
    <li> Our children needed to be more faithful with flossing. One had braces and the other has a permanent retainer bonded behind her front teeth. Faithful flossing was a regular topic at the dentist and she recommended that we purchase this unit. We are glad we did. It is easy to use and our children floss much more faithfully.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many many years and always get great dental checkups... Use everyday and your gums will be healthy not bleed</li>
    <li> When I dropped my old flosser, I had a panic attack. I use my flosser  every day. Everyone needs one</li>
    <li> I use this flosser and my dental hygenist says I&#x27;m doing a great job with the flossing.  My problem with it is when the battery (always a cheap brand you never heard of) dies and I replace it, the flosser won&#x27;t function.  I am on my 4th flosser in two years as a result.  I put up with this because it does a good job while it is up and running.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to string flossing! I wanted to try the water or air flossers, but they were too expensive. I have more control of the flossing experience (compared to string), which makes the process easier and less painful</li>
    <li> Being an adult with braces is worse than when I was a kid! Having to threat little pieces of floss between every tooth &amp; bracket is a pain and time consuming...this flosser totally cuts the time in more than half and gets to the gum-line...NOT between teeth, for the thin plastic floss is too thick for between teeth spaced close together, so you still have to use regular floss for 100% flossing...but it just makes it easier to use this for the top &amp; gumline, where the real hygene problems occcur. I will be going back to regular floss when I get these braces off...in the meanwhile, I totally recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have use it for 2 weeks and find it no where as good as floss. The only place it works is between the teeth at the gum line and that is not very well. The tip that you us is some what flimsy and tends to bend. All it dose is vibrate and dose not rotate. If you have no spacing you can forget it, forcing the tip in causes it to bend.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Within a week of use it has eliminated  puffiness and redness of gumline between the teeth. Teeth are very noticeably whiter. it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this battery operated flosser.  Though it works just fine, unless you&#x27;re a real gadget geek, regular dental floss is just as effective, and less fidgety (you have to store the floss tips and change them out every use), and a better value.  The floss tips themselves aren&#x27;t well packaged....I spilled several of them trying to get them out of the little plastic bag they are packaged in.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as the little Butler go betweens throwaway brushes.  When I saw the cost of refills I knew I would toss this after my initial supply was exhausted.</li>
    <li> This is a great glosser especially at this price.  It is very easy to use and your mouth feels so clean after each use.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I have been search for one of these for sometime now as a replacment of one purchased many years ago.Can&#x27;t find them in any of the stores,</li>
    <li> No info available how to use equipment.  Came late.</li>
    <li> I just got the flosser (see below) It was recommended to me by my dentist b/c I have  permanent retainer glued behind my lower teeth.  It is so easy to use, rather than trying to use a threader to weave through my retainer, only to have the floss shred there and bug me all day.  Unfortunately, rather than deal with these problems, I often opted not to floss as often as I should.&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to use -- the &amp;quot;floss&amp;quot; is stiff enough to easily fit between the teeth, but doesn&#x27;t poke or hurt at all.  This is a great product!! Thumb&#x27;s up</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an automatic flosser. It definitely makes my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> Works well. It does not do 100% of \\&quot;yer flossin\\&quot; but it is another tool against plaque and decay.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flosser because I have braces and the threaders are awkward to use. This works very well to get between the teeth but doesn&#x27;t go below the gum line, which is necessary for good oral hygiene.   It&#x27;s still not a complete replacement for flossing but does a pretty good job at cleaning between the teeth.   I find that I still need to floss my teeth but alternate it with using this flosser.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite fit between all my teeth and sometime I still clean a little better with regular floss.  Nothing wrong with how it works and it does help me to floss more because this makes it alot easier.</li>
    <li> I have braces and thought this product might be easier than using a \\&quot;threader\\&quot; to floss.  I think the whitening thing is a bit of a gimmick, but it does a reasonable job of flossing. However, when I tried to open the unit to change the batteries, the head broke off and I can&#x27;t get it to snap back on--nor can I find the battery compartment. I looked online, and I simply couldn&#x27;t make any sense of the instructions.  Seems like a pretty big design flaw to me.</li>
    <li> poor product - hard to use  would not reccmend it to anybody</li>
    <li> fell of sink and tip broke. There is no water nvolved</li>
    <li> An expensive toothpick. Not what I expected. I still have to floss every day and it does not whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best thing anyone&#x27;s come up with in a long time.  Due to shoulder problems I have trouble keeping my arms &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; long enough to floss the old fashioned way.  If you&#x27;ve read other reviews which say it won&#x27;t work if your teeth are really close together - that&#x27;s wrong.  It just takes a little longer.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My gums were bleeding. Not for me.</li>
    <li> Item was not what I thought it was..thought it was an automatic flosser (battery operated), have not used it...any way I can return it??, don&#x27;t have original packaging.</li>
    <li> It works as it says. The only thing I wish it had was a little water to help out the process.  Follow the instructions and it should work for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter after she got her new braces. It works really well and she loves it</li>
    <li> Really helps my teeth and gums, and so easy to use. Thank you</li>
    <li> SO much better than floss, and easier to use!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. However, I got the following for my cousin and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It costs a little more though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H28S5GE?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393185&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00H28S5GE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;justckem-20</li>
    <li> The plastic &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; bend too easily for between some of my teeth. And I don&#x27;t see how it adds any whitening.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  The water flosser is  much better for me.</li>
    <li> Whitening tips more than doubled the price of the pick, but had no whitening effect.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I got the following for my cousin and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It costs a little more though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H28S5GE?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393185&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00H28S5GE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;swiclu-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;MGFHRLHHG7W2HNIN&amp;sc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times but haven&#x27;t had the chance to use the water part of it.  I am sure it will work just fine.</li>
    <li> this product are good!</li>
    <li> This is really convenient. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to floss my teeth with the dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;This works quite well.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love,love this it is so easy to use and works well</li>
    <li> I think it works great, still doesn&#x27;t get me to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; or use it.  Oh, well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I will definitely be recommending this to my friends!.  I would recommend this to anyone who wears braces!</li>
    <li> a bit weird but feels like is working</li>
    <li> Great for our daughter that just got new braces!  She uses this daily and so much better than having to thread the floss through the wires!  She said, &amp;#34;Mom, you&#x27;ve saved my life!&amp;#34;  Haha!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice device.  I have never been one to floss everyday even though my dentist has encouraged me to do so for years.  Since purchasing this product I have flossed every day because it makes it convenient and less messy.  My dentist will be surprised the next time I go in for a check up.  I am now purchasing it for some other members in my family.  This product is well worth it and the price couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> These work very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated string floss, and the picks are sometimes a hassle to keep in a clean secure place, but this works great for home use. Now I just need to keep a few picks at work and in the car for occasional use. I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
    <li> I got this item because I felt I would floss even more often if I had such an easy tool. I was right. This is so easy and comfortable to use and it leaves a nice clean feel. I find it far less tedious than flossing with regular floss. Also, if you have a bridge or dental work this would certainly make it a lot easier to care for that area. I have no complaints, though I think I will still floss the regular way at least a few times a week because while the Power Flosser easily fits into the area at the gum line, it is too thick to slide all the way up and down between some of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Good product!  This flosser does the job, and the replacement tips make it very hygienic to use.  Great way to keep those pearlies whate and bright!</li>
    <li> Its good if you have space between all your teeth. I have braces and thought it would help me out. My floss picks are still the favorite. This is collecting dust. Will try after my braces come off.</li>
    <li> This is the worst flossing product ever. Doesn&#x27;t use water, and doesn&#x27;t properly floss your teeth. Power cuts in and out. Crappy product...</li>
    <li> found fairly useless. Hurts gums and has no water mechanism so is misleading item.</li>
    <li> I used this to replace the now discontinued Humingbirds I have used in the past. This one is sturdier (and bigger) than the Humingbird but so far, has worked well.</li>
    <li> I just love this gadget.  I have difficulty using string type floss, but this is so easy.  It makes my mouth feel so much cleaner after using this product.  Not hard to use for arthritic hands in my experience.</li>
    <li> Does not clean side of tooth like dental floss plus con artists are selling refills picks for more than the water pik cost me they buy off you and mark it up its a good machine I just use it now and then it cost so little to buy .</li>
    <li> The waterpik flosser is great for cleaning between teeth but doesn&#x27;t take the place of floss for reaching under the gumline. If you have spaces between your teeth naturally or because you&#x27;ve worn braces, this product will work well for you. If you can barely fit dental floss between your teeth, don&#x27;t buy this. The vibrating makes the spaces between my teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been brushed with a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This flosser is great for those of us who have a hard time putting our hands in our mouths.  However don&#x27;t throw it about. I dropped mine and it died immediately. I liked it enough to buy another. Recommended.</li>
    <li> AWESOME FOR A QUICK FLOSS</li>
    <li> Too flimsy.  The floss bends and is not sturdy enough to move between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I wish it was rechargeable or corded. Batteries don&#x27;t last very long. It seems to work better if the battery is installed backwards.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting, probably will not use it, I saw Waterpix so that is what I thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> At fourty one years old I now have a full mouth of braces. Floss works with brushing, however, this thing is great for sticking in your purse to help on the nights out where  I have to slip into the ladies room for a quick freshen up.</li>
    <li> Its ok. Simple pik. It doesnt use water though.</li>
    <li> Love these flossers - way easier than string floss.</li>
    <li> I got this because it was inexpensive to use as an adjunct to regular flossing to really get into the large gaps down at the gum line between some of my teeth and hopefully whiten them.  It seem to be working in the short time of used it and the effect is very refreshing.  I am sort of an oral cleanliness nut and floss and use an oral irrigator as well.</li>
    <li> item as described and shipped promptly</li>
    <li> This product will destroy your teeth. It is absolutely useless for flossing. This products, cheaply made In China will damage your gum.</li>
    <li> If you have trouble flossing, often &amp;#34;forgetting&amp;#34; to do it, this flosser should help.  It is easy to use and effective.</li>
    <li> Great for kids (or adults) with braces. This is so much easier than ising a floss threader.</li>
    <li> I do not see any improvement as a whitening flosser. I am dissapointed. You need wide space between teeth to use it, and still do not see any whitening progress. Better than not flossing at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product for cleaning the hard to reach spots in between my teeth. The WaterPik is easy to use and the replacement flossers are easy to replace. The flosser is also very gentle on my gums and cleans thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I got the following for my cousin and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It costs a little more though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H28S5GE?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393185&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00H28S5GE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;snealo10a-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;MGFHRLHHG7W2HNIN&amp;sc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> As advertised good deal.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine,by any stretch, how this gadget could possibly replace string floss I can&#x27;t describe how very disappointed I am. Sadly, I ordered one as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law as well,which is really embarrassing, I&#x27;d like to at least return that one, but I opened and tried mine out, so,of course, it is not in the original wrapping.I&#x27;m waiting to hear back from the seller about my recourse, if any.</li>
    <li> My mistake the name waterpik threw me off, I thought this used water but this is just a vibrating piece of plastic.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it actually works.  And the stains between my teeth are actually diminishing!!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected.  I do not feel that it works and I have gone back to plain old dental floss.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I floss my teeth and watch Big Wars.  This flosser works best after watching Big Wars.  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I have a permanent retainer on my lower front teeth, and have had trouble flossin between it and my gums.  This \\&quot;tool\\&quot; is ideal for these teeth, and is very easy to use on my whole mouth.  I really like it!</li>
    <li> The good: it&#x27;s extremely easy to use even if you have a permanent retainer or braces installed, has an impressive battery life, and is far faster than flossing.  At under $10 for 30 disposable tips, the tips may seem expensive at first.  But it&#x27;s far cheaper than going to a dentist or orthodontist later when you&#x27;re having problems because you were too lazy to use regular floss. &lt;br /&gt;The bad: the size &amp; angle of the device may make it difficult or impossible for you to reach the rear teeth.  Depending on whether you&#x27;ve had your wisdom teeth removed or not, expect for 1 or 2 teeth to be unreachable &amp; require regular floss.</li>
    <li> The flosser itself is great and reasonably priced, but beware you must use a new tip each time. At $5.50 for 30 floss is much cheaper. This tool however is much easier and convenient.</li>
    <li> I use this to floss around crowns, it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s easy and convenient to carry.</li>
    <li> Have had one for years. Bought several as stocking stuffers this year.</li>
    <li> The WaterPik FLW  was a great let down. The picks are far to soft and the motor is not strong enought once it&#x27;s between your teeth. It is going in the garbage can.</li>
    <li> Really see a difference.  Teeth look whiter and feel cleaner.  Easy to use.  Bought one for my granddaughter.  She loves it, too.</li>
    <li> You might think this is a great gadget, but use it once or twice and it will sit in your drawer - unused.  Nothing better than hand flossing.</li>
    <li> The heads are too big to fit between my teeth - so giving the entire thing (unused heads of course) to someone else, they found the heads too big to get between back teeth.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money. Got rid of it. I won&#x27;t buy this. Get a real waterpik. Or do the manual floss - it works better.</li>
    <li> i purchased this item as stocking stuffers and now i am embarrassed, as i can&#x27;t get them back.  thought that it would be a good motivator for teens to floss more often.  it is really a waste of time.  the floss does not get into tight spaces and after a few tries, the floss bends so that it does nothing.  changing the floss only helps for the first few tries, but still does not go where real floss would work.  don&#x27;t waste money on this premium product........maybe the cheaper one would work better.</li>
    <li> I thought reading positive reviews can help me like the product but it&#x27;s not the case with this one. To this day I am not sure why I bought it and what&#x27;s the purpose. The battery power hand held flosser does not do much for me. It&#x27;s pretty much a waste. :(</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have tried.  I dislike manual flossing, so I find this easy to use product right up my ally.</li>
    <li> very happy with this device, my teeth are super close together, I can barely get floss&lt;br /&gt;in there, and this works wonders.</li>
    <li> This is not a Waterpik. It is only a flosser, and does not fit between teeth. It is useless. However I will say that I was given a refund without having to send back the item. I guess they realize anyone who knows what it is will not want it.</li>
    <li> a great idea at a good price</li>
    <li> For a product called &amp;#34;Water pik&amp;#34;, this thing is dry as hell. Made my gums bleed a lot. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll give it a second chance....</li>
    <li> Love this, my dentist recommended it because of flossing too much I have damaged some of my gum between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;With this thing it is great. Brush, then it is sonic so the constant movement of the stick at the end cleanses between your&lt;br /&gt;teeth without damaging your gums. It has different caps for multiple users. I never knew flossing would get this far.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be better than regular flossing, NOT.  It does not get to areas in the back of the mouth and it can be a little awkward. The inserts you need to clean the teeth is very flimsy and bends too easily. This item is ok but you will still need to floss the old fashioned way</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this but the tips bend rather than get in between my teeth.  The tiny little tips are also a nuisance as they go all over the place.</li>
    <li> SMILE...I really do feel the differences and its great.</li>
    <li> Okay I still have to manually floss every night and then afterwards I would use this waterpik floss. Overall you get what you paid for. I am not too thrilled about this waterpik power flosser.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was unable to Floss while my arm was in a sling from a recent operation on my shoulder. The flosser cannot get in between tight areas of the teeth. Basically just between them at the base … so only about 10% of the flossing job actually gets done. Definitely can&#x27;t compete with the normal way of flossing. I rated it a one because i stopped using it altogether after the fourth time I tried it.</li>
    <li> Perfect. When I went back to the dentist after using the water pick, the dentist was impressed and didn&#x27;t have to do much cleaning. Everyone needs this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband because he is not one that like to use dental floss. He has used this only a handful of times but wasn&#x27;t impressed. The pik works great and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like the ease of flossing with this product and the mint on the tips is nice feature. glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Better that those plastic piks. And does a good job.</li>
    <li> It works great!!!! I have braces now and this thing works wonders! It&#x27;s quicker than using the actual needle and floss method provided by your orthodontist and it does a better job!! Totally recommend it if you have braces. There are others but if your on a budget this is best.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected - thought it was a waterpik, but that&#x27;s just the brand. This is a little stick that vibrates in your mouth - very silly.</li>
    <li> WaterPik Power Whitening Flosser is a great addition to your oral hygiene.  It helps remove food from between teeth and massages your gums.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this to use as Flosser since my teeth are pretty close together. I&#x27;m not a huge fan as the flossers bend after using in the first few teeth. I was hoping to love this but I must say the hummingbird was much better. I wish there were different attachments. I will continue to try but I&#x27;m not sold.</li>
