    <li> I own two of these Benjabelle Daisy Brush Tree. I use it to dry my brushes after washing them. The brush tree is pretty stable and the flexible silicone holes make it easy to insert and remove brushes, they also do a great job at holding the brushes in place. The brush tree stand is easy to assemble and disassemble allowing you to easily take it with you when traveling. This is a must have if you own makeup brushes!</li>
    <li> Love it. Better than drying on a towel.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for drying your makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this sturdy, brush tree to dry my Sigma brushes and I am very happy with it.  There are enough holes of different sizes to dry most of my brushes at one time.</li>
    <li> I really like this item. It arrived quickly. Easy assembly and storage. It looks good too on my bathroom counter top when it&#x27;s being used.</li>
    <li> Makes drying brushes easier! I don&#x27;t have to worry about the water flowing into the brush handle, Perfection! Extends the life of brushes, I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves it. Nice quality too!</li>
    <li> I really like this. It works well at keeping brushes separated and upside down while drying. It&#x27;s taller than another brand I bought, which I like. Not a fan of the price tag on the larger one or having to pay for shipping though.</li>
    <li> Folds up flat for easy storage. Good value. Does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do. Good investment when you consider how much good brushes can cost. I would buy it again. It would make a good gift for anybody working with makeup or paint brushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definetly flimsy and you need to be careful handling it. That said, I use it all the time and it dries my makeup brushes perfectly.</li>
    <li> Easy way to dry my brushes at first I can&#x27;t put together the 3 pieces after I figured how its easy, and I can storage easy too. My brushes dry faster without worried about if it will loses shape.. a little price but worth the budget if you already spend in a nice brush set</li>
    <li> I learned of this item early in 2014 through a YouTube video and my immediate reaction was: how practical! So, I bought one. Since then, I have been in love this brush tree so much that I also bought one as a present for my sister-in-law who is more into makeup. We both love it. As someone who doesn&#x27;t always use full makeup everyday, I still find the brush tree practical when I want to wash and dry the brushes that I do use almost daily (stippling/foundation, concealer brushes, etc.). I also found this model to be the best and most practical one that suits my need versus the other models that they offer: It is small and compact and has the various brush size holders. The biggest holder even fits my kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also happy to learn that this product (as of Feb 2014) is still made in the USA, in the garage of the company&#x27;s owner! I think the price is pretty decent, if not a good deal, especially considering that it&#x27;s supporting small businesses in America. I hope the company doesn&#x27;t eventually outsource the item elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> great product works well, but the price is too high</li>
    <li> I disliked that the stand rattled and was not very sturdy. The stand needed to be more cohesive, connected, and stable.</li>
    <li> I love the Benjabelle Brush Tree. I got a small one because I don&#x27;t have all that many brushes with wide handles. It also functions beautifully to dry my watercolor brushes which are very expensive. Like other reviewers, I also noticed the stand wasn&#x27;t a perfect \\&quot;lock in place\\&quot;, but I did experiment a little by handling it a little rougher to see if it would fall over. It didn&#x27;t. For extra support, place it on a kitchen towel while drying your brushes. It will catch dripping water, but if you&#x27;re that worried about it falling over, it will prevent it from slipping on smooth surfaces. I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and I wold get another if the need arises. I also recommended it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Greatest invention since sliced bread, wished I had thought of it!  I used it the moment it arrived and enjoyed putting it together, dried my washed brushes within a few hours and then I disassembled it, put it back in it&#x27;s white fold in box and stored it away for next time.  Needed this years ago!  So glad the company thought of different sizes, I could only afford this one and it&#x27;s enough for my collection of makeup brushes.  Bless Benjabelle!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift . Good product not expensive and it keeps makeup brushes off the counter.</li>
    <li> So happy someone finally came up with this. It works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that I wish it was sturdier for the price..The bottom wobbles when I move it from my bathroom to bedroom after washing my brushes and I&#x27;m afraid of it falling apart..I wish it looked into place and stayed in that place!</li>
    <li> Lovvvee my benjabelle!  Could not do my brush cleaning without it</li>
    <li> Perfect for drying brushes while allowing them to keep their shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d seen various YouTube guru&#x27;s rave about this product.  I finally bit the bullet and ordered one, and boy am I glad I did.  I can clean my brushes, put them in this to dry, and they&#x27;re completely dry the very next day....sometimes the next morning.  Before it would take at least 2 days for my brushes to completely dry.  If you&#x27;re like me and have a ton of brushes, I would suggest getting multiples of either this one or different models as you&#x27;ll want to clean your brushes all the time just to use this.</li>
    <li> easy to store, and perfect for drying brushes. Almost wish it had more brush holders.</li>
    <li> Great brush holder for drying my makeup brushes!  The quality is superb and it is made in USA!  I foresee it would last very long time.</li>
    <li> Great product, very easy to assemble, but arrived with scratches on the main surface of the item- however, the scratches were not too visible unless you closely examined it but it was still disconcerting to see the scratches there when it&#x27;s a brand new item. I read other reviews that had mentioned the same thing. Still a great product for the price but should probably be packaged better to prevent the surface from being damaged/ scratched.</li>
    <li> In love with this brush tree! So happy I decided to get it at the last moment. Only regrets I have is not knowing they had it available in pink and ordering black instead! This bTree can hold a lot more brushes than it shows in the thumbnails and that&#x27;s also a huge plus! If ever again I can get another one I&#x27;m ordering. Pink and hopefully in a even larger one!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do and my brushes dry twice as fast as just laying them out, plus with them hanging from the handles there is no need to worry about moisture getting into the ferrule and ruining your brushes!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Daisy model and I love it. I have a moderate amount of brushes and this was perfect. For those that are inept at putting this together like I was, you really have to jam the stand piece into the crevice of the flat top. It looked to me like it wouldn&#x27;t fit, but it was just because my touch was too gentle. You won&#x27;t break it. Also it&#x27;s actually pretty sturdy, I&#x27;m not quite sure why people are calling it flimsy, mine isn&#x27;t anyway.</li>
    <li> This keeps my brushes free from getting brush cleanser deep in while drying! Love this item!! The material is sturdy but needs a better way to attach to the base, one bump and the whole thing collapses.</li>
    <li> It is a little flimsy, but it is nice. My brushes dry much faster. I like it. Would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that it feels a little flimsy, but it doesn&#x27;t fall or disassemble easily... So it works just fine.</li>
    <li> So, this product has received many glowing reviews from several youtube makeup artists, and truth be told I was really expecting better. The brush tree feels rather flimsy, and it takes a considerable amount of force to get it to snap together, so much in fact that I worry it may break over time. Also the plastic portion of the tree holds onto fingerprints quite badly, it doesn&#x27;t effect the functionality, but it does look cheap. I don&#x27;t feel like the silicone holds the brushes very securely, and the whole thing has a tendency of falling over. Lastly in the review I saw the brush tree came with a convenient storage box, mine did not, which was also a bit of a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, it shipped in a timely manner but I feel like the quality of this product does not justify the cost. It does the job but it looks and feels rather cheap. I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I am an artist and I have to say that this is fabulous!!!  As we all know we must keep out brushes with the tip down and this works well, especially since one Kolinsky hair brush will cost you about $300!!!!! I have the mini tree for my regular size rushes up to 12 and this one has larger circles for my brushes with thick handles, for instance my Da Vinci Mix B in size 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is I wish it was twice as tall, but then again it was made for cosmetic not art brushes and the handles on cosmetic brushes are only about 5&amp;#34; tall, where as mine  an be as tall as 12&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To whoever sells this, you should list it in the art section under paint brushes, you will sell a tone of them I am sure.</li>
    <li> This is an incredibly smart invention and it was just what I needed. I received this as a gift about a year ago, and I love the way it allows my brushes to dry! I was always worried about ruining the brushes before due to water seeping into the handles. Now I can dry my brushes perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little hard to snap together and it always takes me a few tries. I do like that it comes apart for storage though! I just wish it had a box to store it in, even a cardboard shoe-box style with a lid would be perfect. The folded paper/labeling it came with was nice for looks but is not great for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to have the bigger Sunflower Tree for more brushes but I am limited on counter space for now so this really is the perfect size for me.</li>
    <li> I have many brushes and this tree has reduced my drying time and sit perfect on my bathroom sink. For my smaller brushes I put three in one hole and the hairs don&#x27;t touch. You won&#x27;t regret buying this if you are all about preserving your makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Emilynoel83 of Beauty Broadcast put me up to this, and it has definitely been a game changer when it comes to keeping my brushes clean. It makes the process of washing and cleaning them much easier, faster, and less tedious. I do not have a lot of counter space in the bathroom, and laying the wet brushes down on a washcloth took up a lot of room, didn&#x27;t seem to dry them in the most efficient and even way, and I&#x27;m sure extended the drying time. This simple and ingenious product stores flat when not in use, is a snap to put together, and my brushes dry quickly and upside down so water can run out of them like it&#x27;s supposed to. It also holds a lot of little brushes if you double up; the rubber in each hole holds everything in place. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> What a great idea!  I love this!</li>
    <li> Gets the job very well done, so easy to use,so easy to clean, so convenient to store. I just love it!</li>
    <li> I wash my makeup brushes regularly, and this is a great and convenient way to dry them. I think they dry faster when placed upside down.</li>
    <li> this brush holder is absolutely amazing!  not only does it fit many brushes, i can even put smaller brushes together in the larger slots.  i think this will help my brushes last longer as any excess water just drips down off them. thanks</li>
    <li> Gamechanger, keeps your brushes on point</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> This works great.  It is easy to assemble and take down although I rarely take it down as it takes up very little space when assembled.  Soon after I bought it I dropped it and stepped on it and one of the bases cracked in half.  I was devastated.  I use some superglue on it and it works like new.  No wobbling or anything.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great invention!  I received a beautiful, shiny black brush tree that was packed perfectly with lots of reusable thin foam padding that protected it.  I agree with everyone who loves this, and it was easy to assemble, take apart, stands without wobbling, and holds more than enough brushes of varying sizes.  Makeup brushes are an investment, and this is a perfect companion to keep my new set of Lamora brushes in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Someone mentioned that this would also work with artist paint brushes, which I thought was an excellent idea for an alternative use.  However, if I purchase one for that purpose, it will most likely be the taller version of this one to accommodate my longer handle oil brushes.  At present, that one is only offered in the white color, and I would prefer it in black. It does appear well made, and I will adjust/update this review as needed.</li>
    <li> must have love this!!!!</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life?</li>
    <li> Decent but not big enough for my brushes. And don&#x27;t want to pay more for a bigger one.</li>
    <li> its ok should be more stable. but so far it works just fine.i also wish it was a little taller</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service!! So sweet:) The product is very easy to use! Thumbs up! I got a black and a pink one. I love pink!</li>
    <li> Perfect for drying the brushes and it has very good quality. Recommended seller.</li>
    <li> Love this thing.. I put my most used brushes in this item on my counter top.. it is best to use both hands to pull your items out to reduce the likelihood of &amp;#34;tippage&amp;#34;.. but other than that it is great for its practical use. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Serves it purpose, great!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a tad bit bigger, its kind of small but i still really like it &amp; it does the job. Really happy with it</li>
    <li> I liked the product you are looking for a very long time Thank you for providing this beautiful and useful product</li>
    <li> Not practical at all .. it keeps falling</li>
    <li> I really love this little tree! This is my second one and my husband stepped on my first one and broke one of the support legs in half - so be careful! This holds all my brushes and is so handy to have around!</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and since it stores flat, it will not take up much space.  Made of acrylic and silicone plastics, so it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.  The largest opening doesn&#x27;t hold my extra large powder brush. - So maybe it was meant for a kabuki brush.  Otherwise, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. Good Price. Easy assembly. Tall enough to hold my brushes. Exactly what I was looking for. Mahalo!</li>
    <li> These are fantastic brush holders.  Everything I read says to store make-up brushes bristles down, especially when drying.  So now when I shampoo my brushes (which is almost everytime I use them), I just place them bristle side down in these handy dandy brush holders - Yes, I got two!!</li>
    <li> now it is so easy to dry all my brushes. I really recommend it to all make up gigs with &amp;#34;dozens&amp;#34; of brushes !</li>
    <li> I like the idea and love this product because it can prolong our brush when i rinse them. Easy to use and keep. Protect brush shape.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for drying brushes. It is not built so well. Mine came broken so i had to return it.</li>
    <li> really awesome! perfect for brushes! no issues</li>
    <li> Easy to put together I love it for my makeup brushes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda flimsy. When set up, it doesn&#x27;t really seem like it&#x27;ll stand straight and it wiggles. This makes it hard to put brushes in one handed (the other hand is holding several wet brushes..). There&#x27;s always that feeling like it&#x27;s going to tip over and all the brushes that you&#x27;ve just cleaned are going to fall on the bathroom floor and you have to wash them all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But despite months of use, it hasn&#x27;t actually fallen over for me yet. It just really really feels like it&#x27;s going to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this flimsiness, drying brushes on the stand beats tying brushes with hairties on towel racks one by one (thereby loosening all my hair ties), or finding other creative ways to dry brushes.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive my Daisy Brush Tree order after seeing Goldie Starling&#x27;s review on it, thought it was a genius idea.  However, as soon as I opened my package to start putting it together, I accidentally dropped one of the legs and it broke in half when it fell on my bathroom tile floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can imagine how bummed I was to have a broken Brush Tree before I had the chance to use it.  For the price of this item, I expected it to be of better quality.  However, Ben sent me leg replacements which was wonderful.  Hopefully, they will find a sturdier material for this item.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Just what I expected and wanted.  Now, I will be able to quickly dry my freshly washed makeup brushes with the care needed to keep them in good shape and prolong their useful life.  Easy to use.  Easy to store.  Arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Benjabelle Daisy Brush Tree to anyone wanting to properly dry their makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Wish I would have bought it sooner. Have been thinking about purchasing it for a year. Silly me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to assemble and even easier to use. I will clean my brushes absolutely regularly with this tool. It&#x27;s ingenious! I cleaned all my brushes last night and all were soft, dry and pretty as new in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to the person who invented this! I will be purchasing these for gifts in the future. Get one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is very innovative. Brushes fit amazing. Prevents damage to them and has a very sleek look to it. Fits into small areas and takes up no space in your home. Very interested in trying the brush cleanser next.</li>
    <li> I was happy that this arrived three days before promised, I was eager to use it right away.  It was simple to put together.  It&#x27;s sturdy enough for the job it was designed to do however, it will not stand up to misuse.  I am happy with it and will report back with further updates as I use it more.  I do not expect any problems.  Would recommend and buy again from this company!</li>
    <li> This product is reasonable in price. It works really well to dry off any size brush. I would definitely recommend it to someone who washes their makeup brushes often.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for! I am absolutely 100% pleased with this product. Firstly, it arrived quicker than expected (and I have prime shipping). Secondly, I am super pleased with the quality of the product. I have only used it once but it does NOT feel like cheap materials that will easily break. There are also more than enough holes for what I needed it for. I&#x27;m not sure if some people are going to use it for the storage of heir brushes, but I use it after cleaning my brushes and need to hang them upside down. Easy to put together (comes in a small flat box) and easy to take apart. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy for me. I wash my brushes every other day and this helps retain their shape. Very easy to store.</li>
    <li> This was a little tricky to put together, but once I figured it out it just seemed so simple after that.  Anyway, I love this device it is very compact but holds a lot of brushes.  For the smaller brushes I can put 2 in a slot.  I&#x27;m glad I invested in this!</li>
    <li> I received the brush tree in a week and it was well packaged. Setup is very simple and it does not take up a lot space on the bathroom sink. I washed my brushes the second day after receiving this and all my brushes fit in there perfectly. For the smaller brushes like the blending brush, concealer brush, etc i put (3) brushes through one hole and the hairs did not touch. Dry time was quicker than laying them flat and a downward slope. This is a must buy for make-up lovers.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product so much!!! It makes my brushes dry way faster than before and let&#x27;s not forget that avoiding the water to get into your brushes handles will make them last longer. It is also good to preserve the shape of the brushes.</li>
    <li> This is so needed for proper drying. Love it</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2EWG0QIAWBXY5]]It&#x27;s wonderful, it makeup holds the brushes very well. I would buy this as gifts for other makeup mavericks like my self.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ! No more hanging around brushes all over my bathroom hahahha&lt;br /&gt;Good quality and great size</li>
    <li> I read many negative reviews about this item, so I wasn&#x27;t completely sure about ordering it,  but, I  decided to purchase it anyway, and I&#x27;m glad I did! I found it very simple to construct, (just 3 easy pieces), and I haven&#x27;t had any of the issues other people complained about (with it falling over or being too &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34; to work). I use it very often, and I am very pleased with its performance. Granted, this is not what I&#x27;d call high end or MUA quality, but, for at-home, everyday use, I highly recommend. Would make a nice gift for a teen or makeup lover of any age.</li>
    <li> This was one of the most popular items 0n the channel and best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased the service was so friendly and fast. my best investment ever made thus far. I just wanted to say that the quality is just awesome.im in love with it I&#x27;m quite sure my spoiled daughter is going to want one so I be back...**************more stars for this on for sure.********************</li>
    <li> I adore the Daisy brush tree!  It&#x27;s so convenient, and makes it much easier to dry my brushes properly.  I don&#x27;t know how I got along without it.  It&#x27;s well-made, and is easy to store.  When I first heard about the brush tree, I thought &amp;#34;who needs that&amp;#34;?  The answer is &amp;#34;anyone who owns makeup brushes---or craft or art brushes&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a small investment to protect your big investment in your brushes.  A big &amp;#34;thumbs up&amp;#34; for Benjabelle&#x27;s brush tree!  (Also check out the solid brush cleansing balm---fantastic.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I won&#x27;t show up as a &amp;#34;verified purchaser&amp;#34;, because I bought directly from the Benjabelle.com web site.  But I truly own the Daisy, and the cleansing balm.</li>
    <li> Really convenient for drying brushes and it speeds up the drying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular tree has just the right amount of spaces for the average person and it&#x27;s small (like half a sheet of paper) so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space. It&#x27;s also great that it&#x27;s collapsible so you can just store it in your drawer when you&#x27;re not using it. It&#x27;s easy to put together (make sure you read the directions!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with it is that brushes that are a bit too small for the inserts (mostly my thinner eye brushes) hang at weird angles, but that&#x27;s not really too big of a deal.</li>
