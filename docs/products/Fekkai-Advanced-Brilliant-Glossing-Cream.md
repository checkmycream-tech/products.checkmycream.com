### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>You will still need hairspray, which will reduce the glossing effect of this product (i.e. use this cream during calmer weather when hairspray is not needed for best results).</li>
      <li>However, this Glossing Cream is perfect.</li>
      <li>Wonderful!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>The best smoothing cream I have ever tried.</li>

      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product, but don&#x27;t leave it in the sun or take it to the beach!</li>

      <li>this is absolutely perfect for smoothing and conditioning my hair (and protecting it from the blowdryer).</li>

      <li>, IT WAS GOOD TO MAKE YOUR HAIR HEALTHY</li>
      <li>This stuff does work nice, but try a sample</li>
      <li>It also works nicely after blow-drying, followed by a straighting iron.  </li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t even seem like my own since I&#x27;ve started using this.</li>
      <li>This product adds shine- but don&#x27;t use too much- which makes spending money on this an ok thing- this tube has lasted me a while!!!</li>
      <li>&amp; this one is BY FAR the best.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair which is probably why my hair reacted so well to the product.  </li>

      <li>I got a sample tube and it lasted me forever, and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  </li>
      <li>I swear I started getting more zits after I started using it</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Watch out and make sure to keep your hair off of your face when you use this stuff, though.  </li>
      <li>The texture of your hair immediately changes for the better.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I bought a travel size tube of this and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>so thiswas an added expense on top of the cost of the leave in conditioner.     </li>
      <li>In fact, it seems when most people like a product, it doesn&#x27;t work with my hair.</li>
      <li>Give it a try you will love it....</li>
      <li>I have found that using Fekkai products in conjunction with one another seems to help them all work better together.</li>
      <li>Leaving me with smooth, shiney and silky hair!</li>
      <li>My mom even told me my hair looks healthier.  :)</li>
      <li>It has rejuvenated my hair and leaves it looking glossy and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Ironically, this makes the testing to \\&quot;protect consumers\\&quot; more accurately an activity corporations use to protect their own behinds --and its nearby \\&quot;bottom\\&quot; line.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>And since going to college I have turned SO many of my friends (of varying hair lengths and types) onto it.</li>
      <li>This is definetly my favorite Fekkai product.  </li>
      <li>and it is working so much better than the Biosilk ever did.  </li>
      <li>any more will make your hair look greasy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s phenomenal.</li>
      <li>I noticed many of the reviews on here</li>

      <li>THIS STUFF IS PRETTY GOOD</li>
      <li>and I think it works best on dry hair after styling before hairspray.</li>
      <li>I think it works best when your hair is dry.  </li>
      <li>I had been using the Farouk Biosilk Silk Therapy for years and was fine with that, but I was never truly satisfied with my hair.  </li>
      <li>Got a free sample of this product and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
      <li>Instantly, my dry hair became smooth and wonderful and I knew that I just HAD to go out and buy it.  </li>
      <li>At first, I absolutely adored the product - used the pea sized amount they recommended, and it worked beautifully.</li>
      <li>I have fine to medium hair, and it&#x27;s about 6 inches below my collarbone.</li>
      <li>colored, fine hair and</li>
      <li>WORKED GREAT WHEN WET AND MADE MY HAIR FEEL HEALTHY, BUT WHEN I USED IT</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried EVERY product available (Chi, frizz-ease, Kiehl&#x27;s, etc.)</li>
      <li>I had a coupon that entitled me to get something free, and so I chose this.</li>
      <li>Pricey for sure, but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just fantastic.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been so smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>I got a free sample tube of this stuff</li>
      <li>Two extra bonuses are that it smells great - a light scent with a hint of fresh cut grass; and it does wonders for my super-dry skin too -</li>
      <li>(I guess for women, this product would significantly reduce the split-ends they&#x27;re always mentioning).</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the $s!</li>
      <li>worth every penny, girls!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great because you don&#x27;t need a whole bunch to make your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Also, my hair feels SO incredibly soft, I just love it!  </li>
      <li>It makes make long, wavy hair look shiny, smooth, and it smells sooo good.</li>

    <li> I tried this product on one side and the Sunsilk Hydra TLC on the other side and could not tell any difference during styling, or in appearance.  I looked carefully at my hair under bright light later in the day to see if there was more shine on one side or another and I could tell no difference. [[ASIN:B001D34JOQ Sunsilk Hydra TLC 24/7 Creme 7 oz. (Bonus 2 oz. Shampoo &amp; Conditioner)]]</li>
    <li> The best way to use this product is applying it to your dry hair, it will make it so soft and shiny.   Its very nice!</li>
    <li> This is definetly my favorite Fekkai product.  I have never tried anything on the market that comes close to this.  I have very fine hair which is probably why my hair reacted so well to the product.  First, I will warn, if you are looking for glossy, try hair serum, but this won&#x27;t be it.   This detangles hair, makes it so soft and silky and it gives volume.  I think this is what hair should feel like ALL the time.  Another thing, it&#x27;s not excellent at taming frizzes so again, I recomend a hair serum for those issues.  Still it&#x27;s worth trying.  Remember (a little of this product goes a long way) so don&#x27;t get carried away.</li>
    <li> I live in South Florida, the humidity does awful things to my dyed hair.  With so many new products boasting overnight success to dry, damaged frizzy hair... it&#x27;s easy to remain skeptical.  However, this product eliminates frizz without a greasy, heavy residue.  It has rejuvenated my hair and leaves it looking glossy and healthy.  It is amazing and I would recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, wavy, unruly, etc.  This is the ONLY cream I have ever found that can tame it.  I pray they never discontinue it.  I put it on after drying my hair.  It makes it so soft and non-frizzy.  BUY THIS PRODUCT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff that you can ever get.i got it as a gift for valantines day. i often use it when my hair is already washed and dried. it makes your hair so soft and shiny. i also have oily hair so i keep it away from my scalp. but otherwise, it&#x27;s the best stuff that i got for my hair and it last forever! my hair is very long, and with a fredrick fekkai brush, it evenly distributes the cream so you save alot more. i recommend this to anyone who styles thier hiar often or want it straight.</li>
    <li> My hair frizzes if I don&#x27;t use something in it. I was using Bed Head&#x27;s After Party, but it didn&#x27;t help much unless I used a lot.  But if I used just a little too much my hair would look greasy.  This stuff is great because you don&#x27;t need a whole bunch to make your hair soft and shiny.  I&#x27;ve used it everyday since the day I got it.  My mom even told me my hair looks healthier.  :)</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by many glossing cream/leave-in conditioners before, including Keihl&#x27;s and many other drugstore products.     But this one is voted as best of sephora, and I had luck with other best of sephora products before, so I decided to give it a try. And to my surprise, it is wonderful!    It makes my hair feels so soft and silk-like. And it does not weigh down my thin hair. It looks all natural, and feels soft too.     And you only need to use a small amount. I usually use about a pea-sized amount on my long hair (almost to the middle of my back), and it is enough.    I was so happy with this glossing cream so that I recommended my roommate to try it out, and she liked it too!    Give it a try and you will be surprised!</li>
    <li> Loveitloveitloveit!!!&lt;br /&gt;Humidity - no prob. Flyaways - no mo. Split ends - gone.&lt;br /&gt;Had every imaginable hair mishap, until this product. Try it! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I like this glossing cream. It makes make long, wavy hair look shiny, smooth, and it smells sooo good. I tried to use it on my toddler son&#x27;s hair to create a messy-look hair and it looked very nice. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> No matter how good a product is, I can&#x27;t justify buying it if I know animals have been used for testing that is not required by any agency -- just conducted in attempts to avoid liability should a consumer be injured in some way by the product. Ironically, this makes the testing to \\&quot;protect consumers\\&quot; more accurately an activity corporations use to protect their own behinds --and its nearby \\&quot;bottom\\&quot; line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The uselessness of the tests combined with the unspeakable cruelty makes it in my mind impossible to consider giving a dime to companies that refuse to take the small steps needed to stop testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forcing animals to eat a product until half of them die (LD-50 or \\&quot;lethal dose\\&quot; for 50% of the poor animals, often dogs) has no possible value to anybody.  It&#x27;s one of the most common tests, even though items like lipstick and face powder are so unlikely to be eaten by consumers until they get sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the bottom line with animal testing -- and what makes it so damn unnecessary a cruelty-- is that finding out how consumers will react to a product has very little or nothing to do with how a particular animal will.  So a consumer who wants to sue badly enough can do so on these grounds anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve come so far in evolving past this heartless and useless practice!  Up to the mid-80s, you could not find cosmetics and hair products not tested on animals. I had to buy them in health food stores, which had also not evolved too far back  then.  Good old \\&quot;Beauty without Cruelty\\&quot; came out with their products then to give consumers like me a choice - but bless their hearts, their colors were pretty awful.  Now that we&#x27;re almost there in getting animal tests on cosmetics stopped for good - I&#x27;m hoping more people will keep the lab animals in mind when making their buyhing choices.</li>
    <li> The old formula worked.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  This formula made my hair dry and puffy!!!  I am so upset b/c it is puffing out my hair and it costs soooo much... this \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; formula must be cheaper... it doesn&#x27;t work.... total disappointment!!!  Fredric, I want my Money back!!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that I color, highlite and blow dry all the time. It is very dry but not quite fried all the time. This stuff is awesome! It makes my hair soft, shiny, and feels moisturized! I just found out the shampoo and conditioner is out, and can&#x27;t wait to try it! Definitely worth the $s!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair product junkie- I have tried several \\&quot;glossing\\&quot; creams before, and usually they just make my hair oily.  Not this stuff.  I apply I pea-sized amount to my towel-dried hair and blow dry.  It works great- my hair is noticably shinier and softer when I use it.  It also works nicely after blow-drying, followed by a straighting iron.  All of the products I&#x27;ve tried from this line have worked beautifully- and the bottle has lasted me over 4 months.</li>
    <li> This product transforms my coarse and frizzy hair into the smooth, manageable, shiny hair I&#x27;ve always wanted. My hair doesn&#x27;t even seem like my own since I&#x27;ve started using this. It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every penny. It works much better for me personally than Phyto Defrisant, or any other anti-frizz product I&#x27;ve tried. My favorite thing about this product is the fact that you can use it on wet or dry hair, so you don&#x27;t need a separate   smoothing balm after you blow dry and style...this product does it all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair so soft and sleek. Just don&#x27;t use too much or your hair might look a little greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years and LOVE it! I have long, blonde, wavy, averagely thick hair, and every time I had tried moisturizers in the past my hair would be weighed down and incredibly oily. However, this Glossing Cream is perfect. It adds moisture and actually gives my hair more volume! It&#x27;s phenomenal. I also love it because, despite the length of my hair, I hardly need to use any, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the cause. And since going to college I have turned SO many of my friends (of varying hair lengths and types) onto it. I haven&#x27;t met anyone who didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s just fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff immediately after trying it at my friend&#x27;s house.  I had straightened my hair, was in her bathroom, and decided to try it (since she&#x27;s raved about it before).  Instantly, my dry hair became smooth and wonderful and I knew that I just HAD to go out and buy it.  Since then, I&#x27;ve persuaded my sister to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use it before and after styling my hair.  I use it only after my hair is dry, and sometimes later in the day if I feel I need softer hair again.  I think it works best when your hair is dry.  It pretty much eliminates the dry ends that I have, and makes my hair oh-so-smooth and touchable.  Now, I cannot imagine straightening my curly hair without it.  Wonderful!  Totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product seems to last forever.  I only use a very small portion (a dot the size of a dime), and I have lots of long hair.  It seems a little pricey at first, but it does last.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim at Bath and Body Works. I had a coupon that entitled me to get something free, and so I chose this. So happy that I did. This stuff is amazing! A little goes a loooong way! I think I use about the size of a half a pea each time, and my hair looks like Jennifer Anistons (or so I like to think!) After using my straight iron I just put some in the palm of my hand, run it from root to end and all the frizz, and flyaways are gone. Leaving me with smooth, shiney and silky hair! The best smoothing cream I have ever tried. Pricey for sure, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy hair that I wash and blow dry straight twice a week and touch up with the flat iron every day.  This is the only product that smooths and calms my frizz, and I can use every day even if I don&#x27;t wash it that day.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a nickel sized amount as another reviewer mentioned.  That&#x27;s way too much even in my thick hair!  You should only use a tiny pea size amount to start, then a little more if needed.    &lt;br /&gt;Also, I recommend using a stroner product on wet hair before blow drying, as I&#x27;ve found this product is best for touching up dry hair but doesn&#x27;t have alot of hold or straightening power.  I use Aveda straightening cream when wet, then use the Fekkai cream when dry and every day to touch up.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of controlling and adding shine without weighing my hair down too much. I agree that you don&#x27;t need much and I think it works best on dry hair after styling before hairspray. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> There are currently 24 reviews about Frederic Fekkai Glossing Cream  and I think I see that there is maybe one or two people who did not think that this product is great.     I&#x27;m one that loves tFrederic Fekkai Glossing Cream because I feel that it really saved my hair. For the longest time I had hair that was coarse and thick but worse it was damaged.  My thick, coarse hair was always frizzy because of over processing (dying my hair) and I wanted to chop it all off because I felt there really was no hope for it.     I posted my problem out on a makeup forum and a member suggested that I this. The very first day I tried this my hair felt soft and silky and after a month of continues use my hair now frizz free , soft, silky and shiny.     This is the hair I have always wanted in my life, I spent years with my hair up in a pony tail or slathered with gel and mouse in an attempt to control the frizz but these days I wash my hair, towel dry and add just a small amount of Frederic Fekkai Glossing Cream and that&#x27;s it.     Frederic Fekkai Glossing Cream is about 30 something dollars which may seem pricey to some but you don&#x27;t need much or if you do add too much your hair WILL look oily.  My hair is nearly waist length and I still only use a dime size and only apply it to hair past my scalp. I use just whatever left over residue is on my hands after running the product through my hair to give a bit of control to the hair on top of my scalp and I never work it into the hair on my scalp or again my scalp hair will look greasy.     I compare Frederic Fekkai Glossing Cream to when I use to use a leave in conditioner I use to purchase from my local grocery store which was about 5 to 6 dollars a bottle (not including tax) and would last a little more than a month.  Frederic Fekkai Glossing Cream will last me at least over 6 or 7 months so at 30 dollars it&#x27;s pretty comparable.   Also even when I used a leave in conditioner I needed something to keep control my frizzy hair so thiswas an added expense on top of the cost of the leave in conditioner.     Because my hair is thick and coarse I MUST use something to detangle it after I shower so Frederic Fekkai Glossing Cream has replaced my leave in conditioner and styling product.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily since.  I can flat iron or leave my thick curly hair natural. It adds so much shine and it tames my hair beautifully. I live in south Louisiana where we have 100% humidity constantly, so this works wonders on me. This is NOT for women with fine, thin hair. It will totally weigh it down and make it look greasy, but for those of us with thick hair, it works wonders :)</li>
    <li> worth every penny, girls! I&#x27;ve tried it all, believe me, ALL. I was sick of my boring, dull, and dry looking hair (even though it is healthy!) I tried haircuts, nothing gave it that &#x27;ad-apperiance&#x27; or movement, except for this thing. It smell great, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy, it&#x27;s just pure shine and silky, ultra-smooth hair, and i just realized that i had indeed a nice haircut, but i never noticed because i was forced to wear my hair up. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Fekkai.</li>
    <li> I have course, medium-thick hair, that is not straight, and not curly-- I&#x27;d call it slightly wavy.  It is colored to hide gray, but not super dry.  I&#x27;d describe it as a bit porous because it does frizz in humidity.  Well- this product made my hair take forever to blow dry, and it left it soft, but not \\&quot;good soft.\\&quot;  Rather, it left my hair, well, fluffy and full.  It did not leave my hair shiny, but, instead, left it looking a bit dull.  The one good point about it was that it does seem to moisturize your hair.  But, I&#x27;d rather leave that to my conditioner.  Won&#x27;t even finish the tube, I think.</li>
    <li> This product adds shine- but don&#x27;t use too much- which makes spending money on this an ok thing- this tube has lasted me a while!!!</li>
    <li> Was shopping downton Seattle my hair was starting to frizz ran into the local Sephora bought a small sample container of the glossing cream.  Put it on my hair to smooth it down and it actually smoothed down my hair and it looked great.  That is hard to do when you have naturally curly hair and you are walking in a misty Seattle day.  My only regret is not buying the larger size.  Give it a try you will love it....</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best! I got a sample tube and it lasted me forever, and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  I&#x27;ve used tons of different shine and anti-frizz creams and this is the only one that makes your hair perfect without leaving residue or weighing it down! All you need is a tiny bit and it goes a long way.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Got a free sample of this product and I&#x27;m in love.  I have straight, fine hair that is color treated (highlighted and colored blonde).  I had been using the Farouk Biosilk Silk Therapy for years and was fine with that, but I was never truly satisfied with my hair.  I thought it still looked damaged from the color treatments.  My stylist told me it was because I wasn&#x27;t blow drying it completely, but I wasn&#x27;t sure.  Anyway, I got this Glossing Cream as a free sample from a Bath &amp; Body Works internet order and I&#x27;m totally hooked.  I tried it as they suggested on dry hair and it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  However, when I applied it to my towel-dried hair, and then blow dried it, I have noticed my hair is much softer, shinier and healthier looking, and I have much less flyaway hair.  I noticed many of the reviews on here say to apply it on dry hair, but for my fine, straight hair, I prefer to put it on damp and then blow dry.  It is AMAZING and it is working so much better than the Biosilk ever did.  My hair has never been so smooth and silky.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample tube of this stuff and I love it. I use it on towel dried hair before I style my hair. I think one of the most important things to know about this product is to use the pea size amount recommended; using anymore can leave your hair looking oily, especially at the roots. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that such a small amount can do such an awesome job but it does. I have found that using Fekkai products in conjunction with one another seems to help them all work better together.</li>
    <li> I bought this glossing cream to settle down my flyaways. I have fine to medium hair, and it&#x27;s about 6 inches below my collarbone. At first, I absolutely adored the product - used the pea sized amount they recommended, and it worked beautifully. It continued to work beautifully until I left it in the sun for a day, near my bathroom window. The heat made the oil separate from the creamy parts of the product, and no matter how much I shake it or try to re-infuse them, it&#x27;s not happening. This is a wonderful product, but don&#x27;t leave it in the sun or take it to the beach!</li>
    <li> My hair is coarse and wavy, and recently I had to travel quite a bit and ended up using hot hotel hair dryers. You know, the dirty, low-flow kind and you&#x27;re always in a hurry. They fried my hair so badly that my stylist was horrified. And of course sold me $150 worth of stuff to try and fix it. I got a sample of this glossing cream and can&#x27;t believe what it&#x27;s done. My dry frizz head is no longer making me want to wear a burka, instead my you&#x27;d never know I tried to electrocute my hair. This product is really amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! You only have to use a tiny amount (I got the small travel size tube and it&#x27;s lasted me six months). I stroke it on my towel dried hair before blow drying. I don&#x27;t apply any when my hair is dry - since my hair can tend to get oily. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Watch out and make sure to keep your hair off of your face when you use this stuff, though.  I swear I started getting more zits after I started using it -- there&#x27;s avocado oil in it...</li>
    <li> A little bit of this creme smooths and tames my hair. I dont know what id do with out this stuff. Waaay better then all those drugstore products that promise to do the same thing. I have naturally curly and a bit frizzy hair so this product is great for courser hair. You can use it on flat ironed or curled hair. Try it!!!</li>
    <li> I have medium/coarse, wavy hair that I&#x27;ve spent years trying to manage &amp; tame the frizz. I&#x27;ve tried EVERY product available (Chi, frizz-ease, Kiehl&#x27;s, etc.) &amp; this one is BY FAR the best. Other products I&#x27;ve used would either not work at all or they&#x27;d make my hair look completely greasy &amp; grimy &amp; even so, it was STILL frizzy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, I just apply a small amount of this to my hair when it&#x27;s wet then, if I want to wear it wavy, I just let it air dry - no frizz! If I want to straighten it, I use a big round brush &amp; go back over it when the flat iron. Even in the worst humidity (I live in the South), it never gets big &amp; puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a VERY long way! My hair is pretty long (to about the middle of my back) &amp; very thick &amp; it still takes me close to a year to go thru a whole tube. Also has a very pleasant, clean scent.</li>
    <li> This really is better than any drugstore brand, and better than any of the more expensive leave-in conditioners I have ever tried. I use it on my hair when it&#x27;s damp. I have dry, highlighted hair and I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of product, so this is absolutely perfect for smoothing and conditioning my hair (and protecting it from the blowdryer).</li>
    <li> Ladies, this product is the best!  Does not weigh your hair down, or give you the \\&quot;greasies.\\&quot;  The texture of your hair immediately changes for the better. Smoother,  healthier.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Lots of people have written about the value of this stuff for straightening curly hair or taming frizzy hair.  Me, I have a thick head of long, straight, super-fine hair.  (Is it possible for hair to be both thick and fine at the same time?  Yes, it is.)  It flies away and tangles easily, while also becoming weighed down if I use too much product.  This glossing cream is the best, though!  I always put it on after blow-drying or air-drying, a pea-sized drop is enough, and I never apply it to the hair near my scalp (I put it on about the last 2/3 of my hair, actually).  Following these guidelines results in shiny, glossy, tangle-free hair all day long!</li>
    <li> I am African American with curly hair. This product did not do much for me when I wore my hair curly. I tried using it when I flat ironed and it still did not impress me. I think it is way too expensive to not do anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried DOZENS of leave-in creams for my frizzy, color treated hair, and this stuff really works. I&#x27;ve had other creams that \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; worked, but I had to almost slather my hair in them. You really do only need a \\&quot;pea\\&quot; sized amount of the Fekkai, and it makes such a difference. My hair usually feels like straw, and now it actually feels healthy. I&#x27;m using this cream with the Fekkai Technician conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have thick, damaged hair with tons of split ends.  I wash, blow dry, and flat iron every other day and I haven&#x27;t had a haircut in 10 months (besides a few months ago when I made my boyfriend trim an inch off the bottom).  I got this as a sample in the mail the other day, and the first time I used it I was blown away by how smooth and silky it made my hair.  I used a pea size on my damp hair, then blow dried it.  After it was 99% dry, I worked a little more through my hair, then flat ironed it.  The results really surprised me. I&#x27;m by no means a product girl, or hair savvy at all.  I used to use neutrogena triple moisture healing shine serum, which was nice, but not amazing.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately, so I tried a Redken product (which someone had used in my hair before with great results that I haven&#x27;t been able to duplicate), and some Studo Line I found for cheap at Big Lots (I know, I know), and some Fructis shine serum.  None of these work at all.  This glossing cream is truly awesome, and you don&#x27;t need very much at all.  The sample packet I had lasted me through 4 stylings.  Ok, I did split open the packet to get at it all.  I might have even wiped the empty packet shell on my head to get the last bits.  It is so worth it.  I&#x27;m currently looking around the internet for a deal, but I&#x27;ll gladly pay full price if I can&#x27;t find one.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different hair products for my curly hair.  The glossing cream is the best thing ever invented for curly hair!  It separates my curls and adds a shine that lasts all day.  I simply put some glossing cream in my wet hair in the morning, brush or comb it through to distribute it evenly, let it air dry, and I am good to go all day long!  The glossing shampoo, condition, and glaze make my hair look great on special days! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Every year when the heat kicks in, I try to find a de-frizzing cream that actually works.  Every year, I end up wasting money on one that doesn&#x27;t do much, if anything at all.  This April, I had a $10 certificate from Victoria&#x27;s Secret for my birthday.  There wasn&#x27;t really anything I needed, so I found myself looking at the hair products.  I was intrigued by this product, so I asked some of the employees their opinion.  The majority of them have tried it, and they just raved about it!  So, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Well, now I&#x27;m raving about it!  My hair does still have a few fly-aways, but it does eliminate much of the frizz.  Also, my hair feels SO incredibly soft, I just love it!  It is a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it; the bottle lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve had it for over two months and used it every day, and the bottle still looks new!  You only need a TINY amount; my hair is down to my shoulder blades and I use less than a pea-sized drop- any more will make your hair look greasy.  I loved this product so much that I went ahead and starting trying others from this line- I love them all too!!</li>
    <li> After reading all the rave reviews about this glossing cream from various sites, I decided to visit my local Sephora store and try it out yesterday. Unfortunately, this cream did not work with my relaxed shoulder length hair. It gave a brilliant shine, however, at the same time, any left over product on my hands was disgustingly oily! Also, my hair felt brittle after applying this product! Except for my hair ends, the rest of my hair was relatively soft and smooth, and this product made my hair feel brittle! Not impressed. In fact, it seems when most people like a product, it doesn&#x27;t work with my hair. In my opinion, this product is even worse than Biosilk Silk Therapy which I hate! (It&#x27;s also very greasy but at least my hair didn&#x27;t feel brittle).</li>
    <li> I bought a travel size tube of this and fell in love with it.  I have dry, fly-away, colored, fine hair and this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever tried that makes my hair shiny, manageable and thick.  I love it.  Two extra bonuses are that it smells great - a light scent with a hint of fresh cut grass; and it does wonders for my super-dry skin too - I use it not only on my hair but also on my arms and legs which gives me a healthy, smooth (and greaseless!) glow.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS PRETTY GOOD EXCEPT YOU HAD BETTER FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS WHEN IT SAYS SMALL AMOUNT.  I USED ABOUT THE SIZE OF A NICKEL AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT MY HAIR AS INSTRUCTED, ONCE WHILE WET AND THEN AGAIN WHEN DRY.  WORKED GREAT WHEN WET AND MADE MY HAIR FEEL HEALTHY, BUT WHEN I USED IT WHEN MY HAIR WAS DRY IT GOT INCREDIBLY OILY AND WHAT&#x27;S WORSE, IT STAYED LIKE THAT ALL DAY LONG!  I WORE A BEANIE TO TRY TO MAKE IT DRY QUICKER, STUCK MY HEAD OUT THE WINDOW WHILE DRIVING, ANYTHING I COULD DO TO GET MY HAIR TO LOOK DRY AND NATURAL.  SO I GAVE IT TO SOMEBODY, IT WAS GOOD TO MAKE YOUR HAIR HEALTHY BUT CERTAINLY NOT WORTH $25.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing.  I have thin, fine hair and was reluctant to try this cream because most products like this tend to leave my hair greasy since I have thin hair.  But this stuff left my hair shiny, soft and beautiful.  I will say that I truly only use a pea size amount...literally.  I imagine if you use too much on thin hair you might run the risk of it weighing your hair down and making it greasy.  I was actually in need of a trim (my hair wasn&#x27;t exactly looking it&#x27;s best)when I started using this stuff and my husband kept commenting on how beautiful my hair looked.  Highly recommend this glossing cream.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this hair product from Bath &amp; Body Works and I&#x27;ll immediately admit that it does make my hair look great. I&#x27;ve got thin and slightly longer hair (my \\&quot;Winter cut\\&quot;), so I used this after showering and blow drying my hair, just to see what it does.     Essentially, my blow-dried, frizzy hair really flattened out nicely (I guess for women, this product would significantly reduce the split-ends they&#x27;re always mentioning). Not only that, but this lime-green colored cream has some kind of super-fine metallic flakes in it which reflect light so well, it caused my dry hair to actually look wet! I mean that in a good way, as I only used the recommended pea-sized amount; this stuff does go a long way and the ingredients list includes olive oil, which might explain the extreme shine (oddly, the stuff isn&#x27;t greasy in your hands).     I think the only downside is the \\&quot;wet look,\\&quot; as it was really more wet than shiny, which may be due to the lighting in my bathroom or my lighter colored hair. Who knows... it goes away by the end of the day. This stuff does work nice, but try a sample **BEFORE** spending so much money. Maybe high-end department stores have some trial sizes, etc. Also, it will NOT keep your hair in place. You will still need hairspray, which will reduce the glossing effect of this product (i.e. use this cream during calmer weather when hairspray is not needed for best results).</li>
