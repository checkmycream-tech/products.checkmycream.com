<li> On top of all that, the needle tips are poor quality and are not uniform among all 25 needles, som are tight and some seem larger then others!</li>
<li> Come a day before it was expected 💯👌</li>
<li> I will defiantly be buying these in other sizes as well.</li>
<li> blister pack  had either dead bugs,</li>
<li> one of the blister packs had a large piece of some sort of dirty twine!</li>
<li> WTF!</li>

    <li> Perfect and exactly what I needed!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered two sizes of needles from the same company and it really makes no sense to me how one box can be perfect and the other, THAT SHOULD BE STERILE, comes to me at the same time, in the same shipping box, yet almost every single sealed, &amp;#34;sterile&amp;#34; blister pack  had either dead bugs, some kind of weird I don&#x27;t even know what and one of the blister packs had a large piece of some sort of dirty twine! It looks like they picked up the needles and disposable tubes off of the floor and stuck them in the package! WTF! I&#x27;m very not happy about this purchase as I need these needles and the companies pure negligence has cost me money on lost work! On top of all that, the needle tips are poor quality and are not uniform among all 25 needles, som are tight and some seem larger then others! I just don&#x27;t understand how this could even happen! ?</li>
    <li> Regular needles and good grips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used grip/needle combos. I like it but the only draw back is that you have to pull the needle out to bend it then re insert the needle again. Basically defeating the purpose of having a pre inserted needle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far no needles are bent or balled. I&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
    <li> Came fast.the needles didn&#x27;t fit my O Rings too small</li>
    <li> Come a day before it was expected 💯👌</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Just as described. Good item. Good Seller.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Perfect Product. I like the disposable aspect and the grips are great for my mits. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> WILL DO BUSINESS WITH AGAIN</li>

    <li> Good needles like the cleanliness of having everything disposable. I will defiantly be buying these in other sizes as well.</li>
