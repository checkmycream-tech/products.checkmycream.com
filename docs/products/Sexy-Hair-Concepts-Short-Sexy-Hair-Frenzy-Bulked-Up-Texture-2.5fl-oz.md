      <li>Love this stuff  </li>
      <li>AWESOME FOR SHORT HAIR.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be more of a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; pomade that was more workable in your hair.</li>
      <li>the drier you hair the better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on the lookout for something more like a hair lotion or conditioning product.</li>
      <li>The more I practice it, the better I get.</li>
      <li>The more you put in the more my hair did not hold, almost weighing it</li>
      <li>ok, two words...</li>

      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I found Sexy Hair Frenzy but &amp;#34;googling&amp;#34; best products for short hair and read several reviews on this product.  </li>
      <li>my husband notices a significant difference when I use this versus just mousse or hairspray.</li>
      <li>Only concern I have is the price, but I still keep buying it because its the best one I have tried so far.</li>
      <li>They last a good month to 2 months each.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. Still the best out there</li>
    <li> I first discovered this product after hearing a few YouTubers and other stylist talk and rave about this product, but after using this pomade it definitely does not live up to its name. The scent is not too flattering and the product makes your hair look more oily than it does shiny. However, this product isn&#x27;t terrible. The hold is quite strong, but from experience there are many products that can out do this product. If you are looking into similar products, consider trying L&#x27;Oreal Paris.</li>
    <li> It was worth a try, but I ended up not using it. For much less money, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s New Look Studio Overworked Hair Putty is as good a product, if not better (all depending on one&#x27;s personal preference, of course). I&#x27;m better off (fine hair, salt &amp; pepper grey) using Living Proof&#x27;s Prime and Wet Line Xtreme Reaction Ultimate Hold styling gel (available in some beauty supply stores).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying several hair products and so far this is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s a little on the thicker side and has a great scent to it. It definitely works better the drier your hair is. So I usually towel dry my hair, finish whatever else after showering, dress then apply this and it works great. Lasts for a very long time too. I think I&#x27;ll keep getting this until I find something better!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair wax I have ever been able to find. My hair is dark, straight, and very thick. This stuff only take a few fingertip&#x27;s worth to hold my hair up all day long. What I love about it is that you can&#x27;t even tell you have anything in your hair from the look. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look wet or greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t have one of those overly strong obnoxious scents like many of the other products I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.</li>
    <li> After a WEEK, this seller (Good Looking Discounts, Inc.)contacted me and said they couldn&#x27;t offer this size to me at this price, but would give me a smaller size for the same price.  That price is more than all the other sellers on Amazon. Poor business model!  What happened to standing by what you advertise?!?!</li>
    <li> Best hair product for men. Great hold without making your hair shine. It even smells great and drives the ladies wild.</li>
    <li> This gel or glue or goo whatever you want to call it works great.  It doesn&#x27;t put that super shimmer on your hair like a lot of gels do.  It keeps your hair looking great all day through your sleep and into the day if you don&#x27;t shower. It also smells amazing, I get compliments all the time on the smell of my hair if someone leans over next to me at the bar etc.</li>
    <li> Apprehensive at first, as the packaging was completely different.  Also, picture on Amazon says 2 Shine, 9 Hold.  The actual product is 8 Hold.  That aside, love the product!  Exactly what it says it is at an excellent price.  Arrived early, too.  I will continue to purchase for as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> Great product, feels and smells nice. I am not sure what kind the other reviewers got, but mine had no bad rancid smell. It smells fruity like grapes (in my opinion). It feels a little stiff at first, so I soften it with my fingertips first and then apply it to my hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for mussy look.  Keeps my hair in place without a greasy look or feel.  Lasts all day.  I used Sexy&#x27;s older product but this is much better.</li>
    <li> This product works but you need short hair and can&#x27;t use too much or it will weight down your hair and make it greasy.</li>
    <li> Good on short thin hair</li>
    <li> Love this stuff  really holds your hair...can&#x27;t  find it anywhere  but Amazon!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and washes out clean - no yucky residue like some other waxes. I have used it for years</li>
    <li> My SO have thick Asian hair, even Asian stylist comments on how stubborn his hair is.  So finding a product that work on his short hair is not an easy task.  We tried everything from salon to grocery stores, I even bought all the Gatsby series I can find when I was in Japan.  While some may work on people with regular hair texture, sadly none works on his hair. Thought we&#x27;d give it shot when we came across it at local beauty supply store, and he was so happy that he didn&#x27;t have to &#x27;touch up&#x27; at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a hair product fragrance, but nothing girly that could cause his peers to give him a second look.  Local store have it price at 18+tax each, but you can always find deals if look carefully.  I&#x27;m always stocking these when I see a good promo.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair off into a short pixie cut for the summer. I had been using another product that left my hair greasy and weighted down. This stuff is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t take much and I can style my hair however I want. Lots of options with this product without the grease! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love short and sexy frenzy ,the product I received was not what was pictured very disappointed</li>
    <li> ;( they don&#x27;t make this anymore but it is great. Not shiny, but gives you hold for days.</li>
    <li> I have short straight hair and this is the best product I have found to keep my hair looking great every day.  I like that it&#x27;s not greasy or wet like some pomades.  Leaves my hair looking natural but controlled without looking like there is product in my hair.  Best used on dry hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great for holding hair in place. And it takes only a little product to work also. Better than the off the shelf stuff too as it is not gooey and again, takes so little to use.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent price and I got it right away! I&#x27;ll never buy this anywhere else. Great product for short fine hair.</li>
    <li> Was missing half the product</li>
    <li> my husband keeps looking for other products but he keeps coming back to this one. must work for him (normal asian hair).&lt;br /&gt;good product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is not the formula I&#x27;ve been trying to find in stores.  Once I run it through my hair, it leaves little specs of product that looks like dandruff.</li>
    <li> If you want a matte product that can truly control your hair without looking super-producty, this is for you. Pleasant smell, but luckily it doesn&#x27;t linger (kind of feminine).</li>
    <li> AWESOME FOR SHORT HAIR. BEST SHORT HAIR POMADE THAT I HAVE HAVE EVER USED. I BLOW DRY MY HAIR AND FINGER STYLE THE POMADE THROUGH OUT MY HEAD, STARTING AT THE ROOTS AND IT GIVES NICE TEXTURE AND HOLD. ALSO SMOOTHS OUT COARSE HAIR AND MAKES IT SOFT AND HEALTHY LOOKING. START OUT PUTTING LITTLE PRODUCT ON YOUR FINGERS TIPS, YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD MORE.</li>
    <li> After trying 5 other different hair styling products on my new short hair style I finally found something that works and I love it!!!!! I found Sexy Hair Frenzy but &amp;#34;googling&amp;#34; best products for short hair and read several reviews on this product.  I am so glad that I gave it a try because this is all I use now.  Frenzy gives me fine hair just the right amount of lift that I want and does not make it greasy or shiny like some other products did.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dirty at the end of the day either.  If you want a product that will give your short hair lift, or you want to spike and piece your hair into  a defined style this is for you.  I WILL definitely buy this product again.  OH, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of Frenzy to get the desired style either.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this from other places, and they always send me the &amp;#34;dried up&amp;#34; ones. I have ALWAYS got the perfect one from here!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> One word...ok, two words...seconds and OLD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product had to be expired or sitting on a shelf for a long time because it smelled rancid and was not the same quality as from a salon.</li>
    <li> The photo shows the yellow cap 2 shine 9 hold. I got the black cap in the mail 2 shine 8 hold. I am so disappointed. Sad thing is, I need it for work so I opened it and used a pinch already. Didn&#x27;t have enough time to reorder.</li>
    <li> Works very well and holds hair for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> Well, best stuff next to Kiwi Shine Wax which they don&#x27;t make anymore.  I have had trouble finding Frenzy locally, and have heard that they are going to stop making it.  I got 4 containers of it in case they are going to stop making it.  This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or oily feeling/looking.  Has excellent hold.  I only have to use hair spray with this product when it&#x27;s almost time to get my hair cut.  My hair is cut in a spiky style, so I spike it up all over.  This has a good enough hold so that it stays spiked all day!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Even when your hair is like having the worst hair day and you REALLY need a trim it works wonders. Really does give short hair a really sexy feel!</li>
    <li> great price, works best of all hair gels I&#x27;ve tried.  I usually check amazon for it and I am still really happy with it when I find it...</li>
    <li> I love this pomade.  No shine and really good hold.  Only concern I have is the price, but I still keep buying it because its the best one I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> A little too loose for me, with short hair is does wonders.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be more of a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; pomade that was more workable in your hair. It is stiff and hard to get out of the jar. I used to use a blue colored one made by Bed Head that was awesome but unfortunately, the formula has changed and it is hard to find.</li>
    <li> Works great I personally think it works better and looks better without hairspray. It also lasts awhile for its price it&#x27;s a must get.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t style my hair as well as my stylist, but this pomade does help me to texturize it - somewhat. The more I practice it, the better I get.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help style my super-short pixie cut. I have very thick, wavy hair with plenty of natural volume, and a tendency to look a bit frizzy. All I want is a little hold and smoothing. This tends to make my hair look even thicker and really gives me that &amp;#34;soccer mom&amp;#34; look. It also feels a bit crispy no matter how much I brush it out and fiddle with it. I&#x27;m on the lookout for something more like a hair lotion or conditioning product.</li>
    <li> One of their best products!  Both my husband and I use it!</li>
    <li> all the Short Sexy Hair products are great for short, fine hair</li>
    <li> good stuff will buy again</li>
    <li> Awesome product, helps keep me in control of my short cut and smells great too! Just a little of this stuff and I&#x27;m ready to go... will last for a long time! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> i wanted to try the Pomade.  It&#x27;s pretty good and not too heavy on my hair. I&#x27;ve been using the Powder for a long time and love it so am using this for a change.  They both Poof me up pretty good!</li>
    <li> One of the only pomades I&#x27;ve found that rinses clean, holds well through the day and doesn&#x27;t look greasy or get stiff like a gel/mousse.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and it is okay but leaves hair feeling dirty and looks good at the same time.</li>
    <li> The product itself is OK - no better or worse than most on the market. HOWEVER - the packaging is made to look as if the whole container is full of the product and it isn&#x27;t.  I accidentally dropped mine and the inside packaging came apart - revealing an intricate molded inside container that clearly reveals that the jar only holds about half of what is shown!  The contents actually only go from to the top of  the  word &amp;#34;Short&amp;#34; to the top of the lid.  So the jar size makes it look as if you get the same as other similar products at similar prices - when in fact you get close to 50% less!  I am sure the manufacturer will point out that the jar contains the weight listed - but this is a clear attempt to visually fool the buyer into thinking that they are getting more or at least the same as other similar priced offerings. Shame on them!</li>
    <li> This pomade is not for me.  It is greasey and did not give me the lift I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel really strange. Also, it held it in place but not where I wanted it - one tuft of my hair would stick out even more stubbornly than before.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and a pixie cut.  This is great for styling my hair without making it look greasy.  It provides good hold as well and you don&#x27;t need to use much.  I will be using it from now on.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect texture pomade for short, fine hair. The hold is mega-mega...it won&#x27;t let you down! The scent is perfect. I LOVE this product and will be using it for a long time to come! I have used all sorts of hair pastes, balms, and fiber products. This is BY FAR the best for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> I love, love this product!!!  I purchased this product based on reveiws and I used another product in the past.  I will never go back to other product!!!  I have short hair and love it to look a little funky this product works great!!!  A tiny dap will do you.</li>
    <li> This product gives lift &amp; volume, while keeping hair soft and touchable. My hair is fine and thin - this product works well.</li>
    <li> works well on my hair to give volume and texture plus its matte. plus it was cheaper than in stores</li>
    <li> This really does make my hair sexy....my husband notices a significant difference when I use this versus just mousse or hairspray. I love it.</li>
    <li> SO STRONG AND STICKY.  I had to send it back.  Maybe good for short male hair, but no good for hair that is any longer than a few inches.</li>
    <li> The Joico Design Collecton Dry Spray Wax works much better than this.  I thought I would try it to see but like the other much better.</li>
    <li> I guess I am still out on this product. I have short fine hair. It pretty much dulls down your hair and it does build up. I didn&#x27;t feel it really had the holding power I was looking for. One thing about it is that it will make your hair thicker looking. The more you put in the more my hair did not hold, almost weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> Product was very dry and hardened.....difficult to apply to hair and left hair sticky.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product.  The hold is very strong with very little shine so no wet look.  I find it works as well in dry hair as wet, but it is water soluable, so if you like the mussy choppy carefree look the drier you hair the better.  Oh it kind of smells like sweet tarts too.  How cool is that?  One last thought, the product does not harden, get crunchy or flake or  come off.  This is not dippity doo after all.  I fine hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what its worth I have very thick, fine, but poker straight hair.  YMMV</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to replace a product that has been discontinued.  Decided to try this and was pleasantly surprise because everything else I&#x27;ve tried was a waste of money.  I will be ordering more soon.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It smells great and is the best I have found for texturizing short hair styles. Adds volume to hair also.</li>
    <li> Buen servicio, entrega a tiempo, producto de buena calidad y excelente precio. Me gusto mucho.&lt;br /&gt;Recomiendo la marca Frenzy. No dude en comprarlo.</li>
    <li> The product is like  putting melted hair remover wax in my hair.  Also it is very hard to get off my hands.  Even worse they sent me an expired product.</li>
    <li> If you have short hair and like a sassy style, this is for you. It doesn&#x27;t take much to whip your locks into shape, and you can restyle later in the day. The pomade smells great and makes my hair shiny!</li>
    <li> I like this product and seems to work well in my hair...not too greasy.  Seems sticky at first but once you work it in, its good.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use, nice scent, let&#x27;s you create texture and definition. Washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: DOES NOT add shine.</li>
    <li> This has a really good hold, and makes your hair look dry while still styled (which is what I like) Just make sure your hair is clean when you use it, because greasy hair + the pomade &#x3D; ew.</li>
    <li> I have the straightest hair and it is difficult to find a product that hold a short haircut in place without flattening it out.  This product worked well - nice fragrance</li>
    <li> This product works great on my short, fine hair. No muss no fuss! Seems to add alot of body, without much extra work or mess. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product about 8 years ago in college because a friend of mine who had nice hair recommended it to me.  I haven&#x27;t gone back to anything else.  No flakes, non greasy look.  Perfect</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for short hair.  First, dry your hair. You put a small amount of Frenzy in the palm of your hand and rub your hands together.Then you put it in your hair. It gives your hair a fullness and control when you blow it out. This is the best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> i threw this out.  maybe i got an old jar,but, it is dry and impossible to use.&lt;br /&gt;just an unworkable product</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected!  Thank You!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was expecting great things, but I don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s any better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  My hair seems to get frizzy after using it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products for my hair.  I have a faux hawk / mohawk and I use this and ONLY this.  It holds great and is not oily or gets hard.  I buy these suckers 4 a time and the price is great.  Almost 1/2 the price what the salon charges.  They last a good month to 2 months each.  Maybe longer, depending on how much you use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  Great styling pomade for short hairstyles.</li>
