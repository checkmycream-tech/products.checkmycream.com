      <li>I decided to look it up and Amazon and found that they have a much more affordable price than buying it in the salon:)</li>
      <li>I purchased the product on line from Authentic Skin Care.  </li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer for many reasons.</li>
      <li>This is my FAVORITE moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Love this face moisturizer... and love the price on amazon vs. the salon that I found it at.</li>
      <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have bought it in a salon and on Amazon once before but this time when I bought it</li>
      <li>Bioelements is the best skin care line I have ever used, and with a long history of problematic skin, that means something.</li>
      <li>Love how smooth my face is</li>
      <li>I tried it and loved it so much.</li>
      <li>Has no scent to it which is fine.</li>
      <li>I use this daily, my skin looks and feels great.</li>

      <li>maybe it&#x27;s my smile, I don&#x27;t know!</li>
      <li>If you have dry skin this will be great for you.  </li>
      <li>No greasy or oily feeling afterwards, blends right in!</li>
      <li>CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT BIOELEMENTS.</li>
      <li>Not a repairative product, but a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Skin isn&#x27;t supplemented with fancy schmancy ingredients that actually strengthen the skin, but if moisture is what you&#x27;re looking for, this is a good product.  </li>
      <li>Good for an economical daily product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for both oily and dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I user Bioelements Absolute Moisture primarily in the spring, summer, and fall.  </li>
      <li>It is pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>It was well worth the money I paid for it in the salon.</li>
      <li>It does however sink in fairly well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but although my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards, it doesn&#x27;t look very hydrated either.</li>
      <li>This mousse cream feels very much like wax and smells like it too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy, like so many other moisturizers do.</li>
      <li>This was my first experience purchasing skin care on line</li>
      <li>I like Bioelements and have used their Crucial Moisture product many times.  </li>
      <li>I feel very confident that I am receiving the necessary moisture required daily with this product.  </li>
      <li>Will use it on my chest and stomach to get rid of it fast as it does nothing for me.</li>
      <li>I use the whole bio-elements skin care line.</li>
      <li>This time I thought I&#x27;d try Absolute Moisture.  </li>
      <li>Absolute moisture.  </li>
      <li>I used a sample of Absolute Moisture and really like how it feels on my face.</li>
      <li>I really like how it makes my face feel.</li>
      <li>I really like this moisturizer for combination skin.  </li>
      <li>It is a very lightweight moisturizer with no sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>The jar is also very sturdy.</li>
      <li>I have really oily acne prone skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;For over a year, I did not want to go back on the pill (for my own personal reasons)</li>
      <li>I like Crucial Moisture better because I feel that it makes my skin feel moisturized as opposed to the dry finish the I find with Absolute Moisture.</li>
      <li>It is one of the few products I really love and agrees with my skin.</li>
      <li>Secondly it gets absorbed well and doesn&#x27;t leave a trace.</li>
      <li>It leaves the face looking dull and l&#x27;d much rather have a healthy \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Authentic Skin Care is not a reputable seller.  </li>
      <li>After using absolute moisture for 2 weeks I had no dry patches and it has not allowed for my skin as oily as it did before I began use of Bioelements.  </li>
      <li>moisturizer did not have a sell-by date, so I&#x27;m guessing it was a really, really old product from inventory.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Frequent purchase of this</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why it got such high reviews?</li>
      <li>This is very sensitive to those who have sensitive dry skin</li>
      <li>They focus on tertiary prevention while an estethician focuses on primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My one year old broke the jar and now I am waiting for my next one to come.</li>
      <li>However, the texture and smell of the last jar I bought from this seller is completely different from the normal ones.</li>
      <li>Can only buy it in New Zealand from one outlet and it cost over double the price.  </li>
      <li>but i didn&#x27;t like it as much as the other bioelements moisture creams.</li>
      <li>This is the best person to see in this situation-because plain and simple-derm&#x27;s are bad at treating acne and if they do, it&#x27;s just a treatment.</li>

<li> I typically use beyond hydration and noticed that I continued to get dry patches.  </li>
<li> I usually buy the crucial moisture and will stick to it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s creamy, not greasy and you only need a small amount.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Feels light and non-greasy, but provides great moisturizing.  Will definitely order again.,</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling or looking greasy like some moisturizers do.  It&#x27;s good for both oily and dry skin.  I use the whole bio-elements skin care line.</li>
    <li> I used a sample of Absolute Moisture and really like how it feels on my face. When I found the prooduct on Amazon I was very happy. It arrived Friday June, 28 and I used it that evening. I really like how it makes my face feel. I am set up on auto delivery..I don&#x27;t want to be without this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading tones of reviews from various websites. I have broken out while using this, when my face was clear and I hadn&#x27;t had any spots for 6 months. This mousse cream feels very much like wax and smells like it too. It does however sink in fairly well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but although my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards, it doesn&#x27;t look very hydrated either. It leaves the face looking dull and l&#x27;d much rather have a healthy \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. Will use it on my chest and stomach to get rid of it fast as it does nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I do not understand why you would bill me on (September 1st) and not ship my order until (September 7th).  I know Labor Day was on September 6th; however, you had 3-days,\\&quot; Wednesday, Thursday &amp; Friday\\&quot; to ship my order prior to the holiday weekend.  So, in summary, I paid for my merchandise on September 1st and it is now September 10th and I have an estimated delivery date of September 13th... that&#x27;s just about half of a month between billing and receipt of my merchandise.  As per our experience and other reviews that I have read, it looks as though you need to reevaluate your policies &amp; procedures...</li>
    <li> Just a great product to use</li>
    <li> I use this daily, my skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Love this face moisturizer... and love the price on amazon vs. the salon that I found it at. Way better deal here!</li>
    <li> I use this lotion everyday - day and night!  It&#x27;s lightweight and does not make your face feel greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I feel very confident that I am receiving the necessary moisture required daily with this product.  It is not greasy and I have no acne breakout with this product.</li>
    <li> I user Bioelements Absolute Moisture primarily in the spring, summer, and fall.  It is a very lightweight moisturizer with no sunscreen.  I use a liquid foundation and can&#x27;t stand oily/greasy feel of a heavy moisturizer under my foundation.  This fits the bill.  As I live in the Midwest, I do use a heavier moisturizer in the winter months when the horrific cold combined with forced air heat takes its toll on my skin.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and I love it.m I went through a phase where I tried some other products and finally returned to this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used bioelements before and no one local is carrying it. This is very sensitive to those who have sensitive dry skin</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s creamy, not greasy and you only need a small amount.  Lasts forever!  You will love it too!!</li>
    <li> I have used it for more than three years and I loved how I feel when it is applied.  This product was recommended by the skin care specialist in a salon.  I tried it and loved it so much. So I continued using it and have not changed ever since.</li>
    <li> I do love this product. Can only buy it in New Zealand from one outlet and it cost over double the price.  So thank you Amazon for making it affordable.</li>
    <li> Product is amazing. I have combination skin and this leaves me hydrated without feeling weight on my skin.  Looking forward to trying other Bioelements products.</li>
    <li> Frequent purchase of this</li>
    <li> great product. been using for over 5 years</li>
    <li> Has improved my skin drastically. I use this and the flas foam cleanser. I had a facial recently and she told me how great my skin is.</li>
    <li> I use this creme often and I buy it from amazon. It is one of the few products I really love and agrees with my skin. However, the texture and smell of the last jar I bought from this seller is completely different from the normal ones. I can tell almost immediately that the product does not act the same on my skin. I have had one other experience similar and amazon returned it.</li>
    <li> I use proactiv and it has been difficult to find the right face lotion for me.  I have to have something hydrating to balance out the drying effects of proactiv but not something so rich it makes my skin breakout. This was recommended by a skin care expert to me and I have been using it for over a year now.  My skin looks great, hydrated and does not breakout.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I love the way it makes my skin feel. This product actually makes my skin feel like it is getting the moisture that it needs. My skin looks softer smoother and healthier.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily and heavy after you&#x27;ve applied. Has no scent to it which is fine. This is a great product the gives your face great moisture throughout the day without making if feel oily!</li>
    <li> I had a bad reaction to this product.  Within 3 days of using the product, my skin developed painful red bumps under both eyes.  I stopped the use of the product and all painful bumps cleared up.  I purchased the product on line from Authentic Skin Care.  I contacted them regarding the problem.  They indicated I must return the product at my expense and they would then charge me a restocking fee.  Not sure why I am charged a restocking fee for something they obviously should not restock.  It should be returned to the vendor.  I presented them with that information and did not receive a response.  I also purchased the cleanser which arrived unsealed.  Authentic Skin Care is not a reputable seller.  I would give them a very bad rating.  This was my first experience purchasing skin care on line and I will not do so again.  Authentic Skin Care made this a very disappointing experience.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer for combination skin.  It keeps the dry parts of my skin moisturized without making the oily portions of my skin oilier.  I like that it comes with a scoop so you don&#x27;t put your hands in the jar.  The jar is also very sturdy.</li>
    <li> I have got to say, I never ever had a problem with acne until I ditched my birth control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then within a few months, all hell broke loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For over a year, I did not want to go back on the pill (for my own personal reasons) and I felt I had tried EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I tried out a facial as a friend had suggested. The esthetican recommended Bioelements and I fell in LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO other brand has worked like this for me. and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. From neutrogena to proactiv to home remedies to panoxyl and everything in between including expensive dermatologist visits and microdermabrasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now, with the combination of regular facials and using the Bioelements decongestant cleanser, absolute moisture or beyond hydration (with the change of the seasons I switch), and the pumice peel 2-3x a week, my skin has improved DRASTICALLY in the past 3 months than it ever has in the year and a half I&#x27;ve been suffering from terrible HORMONAL acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use benzol peroxide cream to spot treat once or twice every 2 weeks or so. I&#x27;ve basically cut that out of my skin care regimed completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT BIOELEMENTS. SIMPLY AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with them for as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more tidbit, if you are a sufferer of acne and feel nothing is working, SEE AN ESTHETICIAN. This is the best person to see in this situation-because plain and simple-derm&#x27;s are bad at treating acne and if they do, it&#x27;s just a treatment. They focus on tertiary prevention while an estethician focuses on primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stick with them, facials can be a life saver.</li>
    <li> Bioelements is the best skin care line I have ever used, and with a long history of problematic skin, that means something. If you have congested skin, I recommend their cleanser for congested skin. The best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, love it! People think I&#x27;m at least 10 years younger than my age…maybe it&#x27;s my smile, I don&#x27;t know!</li>
    <li> This creme has been so helpful after I do my swim workout. The chlorine dries your face out and this product just absorbs and makes your face feel great, quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife got me started on this stuff years ago.  It&#x27;s light, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy, like so many other moisturizers do.</li>
    <li> Only moisture I use.  Doesn&#x27;t feel  greasy and don&#x27;t have break outs.</li>
    <li> I too suffer from acne but have issues with my skin drying out when I use products for acne prone skin. I am in my late 30&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t done well with products like proactive because of issues with drying.  Although this isn&#x27;t necessarily marketed for acne prone skin, I use it to moisturize. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized but nongreasy and I&#x27;ve not had any breakouts since using it. It was well worth the money I paid for it in the salon. My only regret? My one year old broke the jar and now I am waiting for my next one to come. I would recommend to this to acne sufferers with combination skin who need a good moisturizer. It works great with the bioelements flash foam cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years and love how it is not greasy or oily on my skin.  I will continue to use it forever and hope I can find it on Amazon again because the price was wonderful!</li>
    <li> Was introduced to this product at my salon about 6 months ago as they stopped carrying the brand that I had been using. I have been very happy with this product since switching. I have combination skin but it is on the drier side of things and this works so great. No greasy or oily feeling afterwards, blends right in! I decided to look it up and Amazon and found that they have a much more affordable price than buying it in the salon:)</li>
    <li> this product works well overall but i didn&#x27;t like it as much as the other bioelements moisture creams. i use it at night and after my suncreen</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer for many reasons. First of all, it doesn&#x27;t have the usual toxins like SLS and parabens. Secondly it gets absorbed well and doesn&#x27;t leave a trace.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE moisturizer.  It&#x27;s thick but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  If you have dry skin this will be great for you.  I have combination skin and I feel that it evens everything out in combination with the flash foam cleanser.  It is pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as promised This company is GREAT</li>
    <li> I typically use beyond hydration and noticed that I continued to get dry patches.  After using absolute moisture for 2 weeks I had no dry patches and it has not allowed for my skin as oily as it did before I began use of Bioelements.  I would have given 5 stars if I did not get any extra oil build up.</li>
    <li> I have really oily acne prone skin so I decided to try this out. Firstly, it smells really gross, almost like some weird asian herbal medicine scent.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is like a gel, and it feels weird on my skin. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I don&#x27;t understand why it got such high reviews?</li>
    <li> Absolute moisture.  Not a repairative product, but a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Skin isn&#x27;t supplemented with fancy schmancy ingredients that actually strengthen the skin, but if moisture is what you&#x27;re looking for, this is a good product.  Suitable for use after brow waxing, facials etc.  Good for an economical daily product.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer!! I have sensitive skin and this product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I like Bioelements and have used their Crucial Moisture product many times.  This time I thought I&#x27;d try Absolute Moisture.  I like Crucial Moisture better because I feel that it makes my skin feel moisturized as opposed to the dry finish the I find with Absolute Moisture.</li>
    <li> I have purchased (and used) this product from local salons previously, with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;This time, I purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately upon opening the product, I smelled a rotten almost rancid smell.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer did not have a sell-by date, so I&#x27;m guessing it was a really, really old product from inventory.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it was exposed to a contaminant at some point ?&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I would not recommend buying this product from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Does not work for me. I usually buy the crucial moisture and will stick to it.</li>
    <li> Always the best quality product!</li>
    <li> Love how smooth my face is</li>
    <li> I love this product and have bought it in a salon and on Amazon once before but this time when I bought it something was different. The cream has a different texture and smell and does not moisturize nearly as much as previous purchases. I don&#x27;t know what happened this time because this normally is an excellent cream. I used it for a week and my skin was not moisturized at all - but  having used this product in the past I know that&#x27;s not right. Something was off don&#x27;t know what maybe I should go back and buy it at the salon across town.</li>
    <li> Great for combination skin</li>
