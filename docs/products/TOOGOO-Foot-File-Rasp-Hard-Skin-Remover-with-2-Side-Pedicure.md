### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>perfect price and quality is good too i use on my feet after shower and it sands and asmooths my feet nicely.</li>
      <li>this works so good on my feet</li>
      <li>then file works good</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so flimsy it would very easily break.</li>
      <li>If the dollar store runs out again, I may order more.  </li>
      <li>Just seems more sanitary too.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend much more than that though.</li>
      <li>Ok for the price.</li>
      <li>My $5 one is much better.</li>
      <li>I would have been better off walking over to a beauty supply store or target and buying a better quality product.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m happy to have the extra at a slightly better price.  </li>
      <li>This foot file is flimsy and the sandpaper is too fine.  </li>
      <li>So if you want to use it for a disposal one it is fine.</li>
      <li>It works just fine.</li>
      <li>and I could see the scrubby part lifting off the cheap plastic...</li>
      <li>It does look like it is cheap quality, but then again, it was 99 cents.</li>
      <li>While the price was good, the product is quit flimsy, and almost a single use file.  </li>
      <li>The plastic is flexible so it&#x27;s pretty cheaply made but the price is right.</li>
      <li>It finally came, it works perfectly and get all my excess dry skin I&#x27;ve been meaning to file off.</li>
      <li>Not even worth the $0.99 pricing.</li>
      <li>For a couple bucks its worth the price.</li>
      <li>Good for light callus or dry skin removal but not for bigger, tougher jobs.</li>
      <li>At less than a buck each, it&#x27;s worth it to use it and toss it, and always have another fresh one handy.  </li>
      <li>Plastic is soft and flimsy, the sanding part is glued to the plastic handle by some really cheap glue that doesn&#x27;t even hold it in place.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t last more than two or three uses.</li>
      <li>Scholl&amp;#34;s comparable unit with fine and coarse file.</li>
      <li>would have liked it to be a little rougher</li>
      <li>Better off paying a little extra and get a better quality one.</li>
      <li>Do not throw your money down the toilet, cheap cheap and cheap...</li>
      <li>It took weeks to get here and it is a very flimsy product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even really work.  </li>
      <li>that being the case I have to work a bit harder to get desired results ( I just use it a bit more often )</li>
      <li>Very flimsy</li>
      <li>It does ok so far, though I had to grip it in the middle</li>
      <li>the cheap plastic bends so easily when you&#x27;re holding the handle so its pointless because then you can&#x27;t attempt to scrub your feet.  </li>
      <li>this is not as stiff as I&#x27;d have liked ..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had much better satisfaction with other purchases from Sodial.</li>
      <li>The pads came off pretty quickly and it never really worked to begin with.</li>
      <li>took the callas right off and dry skin soak your feet first</li>
      <li>wish i had a few more to give to girlfriends</li>
      <li>The white plastic part is very flimsy and bends too much when you try to scrub your feet.  </li>
      <li>Definitely was cheap enough.</li>
      <li>First time I used it, one of thd pads fell off and I had to glue it back.</li>
      <li>trash, do not waste your money</li>
      <li>The handle is totally flexible bending left and right, the plastic is not sturdy...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just like a nice file, but less harsh for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, the black exfoliating part separated from the handle/base on the first use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little cheap and flimsy but for the price that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money.</li>

    <li> Very flimsy but I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> man this works so good on my feet took the callas right off and dry skin soak your feet first then file works good</li>
    <li> Good for light callus or dry skin removal but not for bigger, tougher jobs.</li>
    <li> First time I used it, one of thd pads fell off and I had to glue it back. But it was $0.99 so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This foot file is flimsy and the sandpaper is too fine.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Awful quality! I am sorry that such a defective item  bought!! :(( I hope in the future I will not allow such an error</li>
    <li> It works just fine. It does look like it is cheap quality, but then again, it was 99 cents. My $5 one is much better.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s a little cheap and flimsy but for the price that&#x27;s to be expected. Works great</li>
    <li> It took weeks to get here and it is a very flimsy product. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts. It does ok so far, though I had to grip it in the middle becuz it was so bendable.</li>
    <li> Do not throw your money down the toilet, cheap cheap and cheap...The handle is totally flexible bending left and right, the plastic is not sturdy...Will break in no time...</li>
    <li> I like feeling some resistance with my foot scrubbing care. Living in Fl we seldom wear shoes other than flip flops and I expect my feet to be as well cared for as my nails/ hands...this is not as stiff as I&#x27;d have liked ..that being the case I have to work a bit harder to get desired results ( I just use it a bit more often )</li>
    <li> fell apart even before I started using it... very bad quality. Plastic is soft and flimsy, the sanding part is glued to the plastic handle by some really cheap glue that doesn&#x27;t even hold it in place. Not even worth the $0.99 pricing. Better off paying a little extra and get a better quality one. Returning it, and hoping they would accept my return and issue a refund since this is shipped all the way from China. Would give ZERO star if can. Buyer beware, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> The white plastic part is very flimsy and bends too much when you try to scrub your feet.  Also, the black exfoliating part separated from the handle/base on the first use.</li>
    <li> Ok for the price. Goes dull very fast.</li>
    <li> trash, do not waste your money</li>
    <li> Not very durable. Flimsy.</li>
    <li> would have liked it to be a little rougher but it seems to be doing the job. Definitely was cheap enough.</li>
    <li> Very small and flimsy.</li>

    <li> So stupid...  the cheap plastic bends so easily when you&#x27;re holding the handle so its pointless because then you can&#x27;t attempt to scrub your feet.  ANNNND after the second day of just being in the shower (too lazy to throw away) the &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; stopped working and I could see the scrubby part lifting off the cheap plastic...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job. It doesn&#x27;t remove any of the dead skin and it&#x27;s so flimsy it would very easily break.</li>
    <li> perfect price and quality is good too i use on my feet after shower and it sands and asmooths my feet nicely. wish i had a few more to give to girlfriends</li>

    <li> Quite a long wait for the product to ship. Sadly, the black file was paper thin and the adhesive was kindergarten strong. I would have been better off walking over to a beauty supply store or target and buying a better quality product.</li>
    <li> ease in acquiring, but lack of sturdiness to &amp;#34;Dr. Scholl&amp;#34;s comparable unit with fine and coarse file. Unfortunate that I can no longer locate the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s unit or quality.</li>
    <li> While the price was good, the product is quit flimsy, and almost a single use file.  I&#x27;ve had much better satisfaction with other purchases from Sodial.</li>
    <li> It finally came, it works perfectly and get all my excess dry skin I&#x27;ve been meaning to file off. It&#x27;s just like a nice file, but less harsh for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that it took almost a month to get to my place, but it&#x27;s an overseas shipment.  No complaints--I expected to come so late.</li>
    <li> I usually get these at the dollar store locally, but for some reason, everyone was out of stock.  I ordered these, knowing they were coming from China, so I expected a long wait.  It took about 4 weeks, and in the meantime, I did find some locally at the dollar store.  But I&#x27;m happy to have the extra at a slightly better price.  I got a dozen and received  a mix of colors in turquoise, white and pink.  I consider these to be disposable and really only use them a few times on each side.  Just seems more sanitary too.  Yes, they&#x27;re a bit flimsy, but so are the ones from the dollar store, so I&#x27;m used to working with it.  At less than a buck each, it&#x27;s worth it to use it and toss it, and always have another fresh one handy.  If the dollar store runs out again, I may order more.  I just need to account for the long shipping times.</li>
