### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s one the best I&#x27;ve had</li>
      <li>Best ever.</li>
      <li>that, it is not the best.</li>
      <li>Great curling iron!</li>
      <li>Great buy!!!</li>
      <li>Once you master how to operate the iron, it is an awesome tool!</li>
      <li>Wait a good 10 minutes for it to reach optimal heat before using, and it works best if you curl in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
      <li>Really easy to use and makes the perfect curls.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>and I love the results!</li>
      <li>Amazing iron.</li>
      <li>It grips the hair nicely.  </li>
      <li>So much better than the one with the gold rod.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>There are way better ones like everywhere.</li>
      <li>My favorite curling iron ever.</li>
      <li>It heats fast and has a great finish.</li>
      <li>I have to use both hands, since I still can&#x27;t figure out how to maneuver with one hand, but I think I will get better with time.</li>
      <li>I get a better, fuller curl with this, but still find it does take longer than a clip curling iron.</li>
      <li>It is not the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; type most people are used to using.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>GREAT Heats up FAST and stays hot!!</li>
      <li>The hair slides easily through the rod so as not to leave pressure/heat indents.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>And you could see that it does not look very safe to put near your face and touching your hair.</li>
      <li>I got the hang of it pretty quickly and definitely liked that the iron&#x27;s handle spins in your hand to make things easy.  </li>
      <li>The Marcel iron is great, but remember that if you&#x27;re going to go with this iron over a standard one with a spring loaded clamp, it will take some getting used to.</li>
      <li>Overall, very good product thus far.</li>
      <li>This size (1.5\\&quot; barrel) will give a nice large curl to longer hair (mostly at the ends), if you are looking for a tighter curl, I&#x27;d say to go with a 1\\&quot; or smaller barrel.</li>
      <li>I will say this style of iron gives much less of a crease in the hair in comparison to the normal spring loaded clamp as you determine the amount of pressure put on the clamp, which is great!</li>
      <li>Although, it takes a little getting used to at first, the end result was very nice...</li>
      <li>My hairstylist uses one of these on me, and got great results, so I wanted to try one without spending a fortune on a more expensive brand.</li>
      <li>and it is heavy duty enough where this curler has a temp I can set it to in order to get the best curls!</li>
      <li>Get better curls from a regular curling wand.</li>
      <li>Overall, it works great, as is to be expected from Hot Tools.</li>
      <li>and they claim they get hot fast</li>
      <li>Overall excellent product, choosing the barrel size is the most difficult part!</li>
      <li>I got the 1 1/2 inch marcel curling iron, and I really did like it.</li>
      <li>I really like this curling iron.</li>
      <li>These are really for professionals or people that know how to use marcel curling irons.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like that feature, there is actually a switch that locks the handle in a fixed position--which is very useful!</li>
      <li>I have high end irons</li>
      <li>I do use the higher end irons for my flat irons.  </li>
      <li>Going back to old reliable gold barrel.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve always purchased hot tools curling irons but this one just doesn&#x27;t work for my thick hair.</li>
<li> I did send it back though, only because I didn&#x27;t realize how loose the curls would be</li>
<li> It is heavy, so if you are using it on your own hair, be prepared for a tired arm!</li>
<li> but I am not a professional hair stylist.  </li>
<li> but the curls don&#x27;t hold for a long time!</li>
<li> I picked this curling iron because it is the choice of many celebrity hairstylists but upon inspection I realized that it is too cumbersome to use and very complicated for a curling iron</li>

<li> It was a little scary at first (extremely hot iron in hand and learning to work it in your hair could be potentially dangerous).  </li>
<li> I have course, frizzy, wavy hair that I typically straighten but sometimes use this iron to add curls.</li>
<li> I like this iron a lot because i have thick long hair</li>
<li> They should take that picture down and put the actual curlers that you will get once purchased because this is false advertising in a way.</li>
<li> It will take practice and patience, so give it a few test runs before giving a verdict.</li>
<li> so i thought i was going to get regular curlers like the picture, well i was wrong.</li>
<li> Nothing wrong with actual product Hard to judge the size.</li>
<li> I have thick heavy hair!</li>
<li> i suggest you do not buy these as they are a little difficult to work.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it but the curls don&#x27;t hold for a long time!</li>
    <li> My favorite curling iron ever.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron. Easy to use and I love the results!</li>
    <li> I like this iron a lot because i have thick long hair and it is heavy duty enough where this curler has a temp I can set it to in order to get the best curls!</li>
    <li> i know the curlers say marcel curling irons but the picture provided are not marcel curling irons so i thought i was going to get regular curlers like the picture, well i was wrong. If you do not know how to use marcel curlers i suggest you do not buy these as they are a little difficult to work. (thank goodness i used marcel&#x27;s before) also i paid for 2day shipping and it came in 3days. There is a way to lock the handel so it won&#x27;t be so loose if that helps. and they claim they get hot fast but it seemed to take a while to heat up to me. These are really for professionals or people that know how to use marcel curling irons. They should take that picture down and put the actual curlers that you will get once purchased because this is false advertising in a way.</li>
    <li> just by looking at the picture you see that, it is not the best. And you could see that it does not look very safe to put near your face and touching your hair. I would not recommend this. There are way better ones like everywhere. You do not have to take my advice, but if you use common sense you would think the same</li>
    <li> I picked this curling iron because it is the choice of many celebrity hairstylists but upon inspection I realized that it is too cumbersome to use and very complicated for a curling iron so I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> We had to return  too big and not easily to handle</li>
    <li> I got the 1 1/2 inch marcel curling iron, and I really did like it. It worked well and the curls would last a long time. I did send it back though, only because I didn&#x27;t realize how loose the curls would be and I didn&#x27;t want them to be that loose. Other than that, I did like the iron though. I also have the gold version in 1 1/4 inch and I absolutely love it. I use it a lot.</li>
    <li> Had this same iron but the gold metal.  I have used this style (marcel) since I was a teenager but I am not a professional hair stylist.  However, you must be trained to use this type of iron.  It is not the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; type most people are used to using.  I have high end irons but this works just as well!  I do use the higher end irons for my flat irons.  I have course, frizzy, wavy hair that I typically straighten but sometimes use this iron to add curls.</li>
    <li> This is my 1st marcel iron.  Although, it takes a little getting used to at first, the end result was very nice... I got the hang of it pretty quickly and definitely liked that the iron&#x27;s handle spins in your hand to make things easy.  It was a little scary at first (extremely hot iron in hand and learning to work it in your hair could be potentially dangerous).  If you don&#x27;t like that feature, there is actually a switch that locks the handle in a fixed position--which is very useful! Overall, very good product thus far.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist uses one of these on me, and got great results, so I wanted to try one without spending a fortune on a more expensive brand. Before I ordered it I watched a couple youtube tutorials and felt that I could manage. I read some reviews and picked this one. I get a better, fuller curl with this, but still find it does take longer than a clip curling iron. I have to use both hands, since I still can&#x27;t figure out how to maneuver with one hand, but I think I will get better with time.</li>
    <li> It heats fast and has a great finish. It isn&#x27;t as slippery as other irons I have used. It grips the hair nicely.  The nicest iron I have ever used.</li>
    <li> For my wife. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Best ever. I&#x27;m a hairstylist and my last one got me through 7 years of daily use. The hair slides easily through the rod so as not to leave pressure/heat indents. So much better than the one with the gold rod.</li>
    <li> Once you master how to operate the iron, it is an awesome tool! It will take practice and patience, so give it a few test runs before giving a verdict. I will say this style of iron gives much less of a crease in the hair in comparison to the normal spring loaded clamp as you determine the amount of pressure put on the clamp, which is great! Wait a good 10 minutes for it to reach optimal heat before using, and it works best if you curl in about 1/2\\&quot; to 1\\&quot; sections leaving the iron for about 15-20 seconds per section. This size (1.5\\&quot; barrel) will give a nice large curl to longer hair (mostly at the ends), if you are looking for a tighter curl, I&#x27;d say to go with a 1\\&quot; or smaller barrel. Overall excellent product, choosing the barrel size is the most difficult part!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works GREAT Heats up FAST and stays hot!!</li>
    <li> Broke within 30 days. I have had a bunch of these from this brand and this on sucked. I replaced with local distributer for ease of exchange. I did not have a box or warranty paperwork or I would have tried to return.</li>
    <li> Too big for my hair, had to return for a smaller barrel. Nothing wrong with actual product Hard to judge the size.</li>
    <li> The Marcel iron is great, but remember that if you&#x27;re going to go with this iron over a standard one with a spring loaded clamp, it will take some getting used to. Learn how to use the iron before you get too frustrated with it, because it will take some time. Overall, it works great, as is to be expected from Hot Tools.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased hot tools curling irons but this one just doesn&#x27;t work for my thick hair. Going back to old reliable gold barrel.</li>
    <li> Get better curls from a regular curling wand.</li>
    <li> Amazing iron. Curled my hair no problem. I have thick heavy hair! Great buy!!! :)</li>
    <li> Great curling iron! It took me forever to finally find the Marcel iron that was this big. It is heavy, so if you are using it on your own hair, be prepared for a tired arm!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! I use it almost every day.. Really easy to use and makes the perfect curls. Can&#x27;t wait to get the other sizes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one the best I&#x27;ve had</li>
