      <li>Maybe this scent just agrees well with my body chemistry, but I love the way I smell</li>
      <li>Seems many are hating the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>I used to use Eternity, this is a way better deal.</li>
      <li>After about 10 minutes on my skin, I like it even more.</li>

      <li>This spray really smells good and is nice.</li>
      <li>I Love the scent, more importantly, my wife loves it!</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>Boyfriend and I both love the scent.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell of this cologne.</li>
      <li>my favorite cologne on him</li>
      <li>im sure that&#x27;s why they&lt;</li>
      <li>The smell seems to change over time, and I think I like it even more as time passes.</li>
      <li>This scent is great, very masculine and lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>And the bottle is also very cool.  </li>
      <li>Glad I could get it on the cheap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great masculine scent with staying power that my wife likes on me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the lid design, and took it apart for simpler use (easy to do).</li>
      <li>Very masculine and clean with something very unique and pleasant about it.</li>
      <li>The cologne smelt pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>As for the cap, I think it&#x27;s fashioned after a Grolsch beer bottle (One of my favorite beers), but it was certainly designed more for aesthetics than functionality.</li>
      <li>Found it at Ross for cheap.</li>
      <li>Happy to find it on Amazon and even happier that it was cheaper here than in local stores.  </li>
      <li>I prefer his original - VINTAGE</li>
      <li>Great scent that lasts a long time</li>
      <li>Not as good as the original colonge but a close second.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite cologne and it is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I like a musky sweet scent for my husband.</li>
      <li>Never thought Converse would have the best cologne that&#x27;s better then most very expensive brands.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very clean scent that is sophisticated enough to be versatile.</li>
      <li>Probably my new favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>If you are interested in a clean, fresh fragrance this is for you.  </li>
      <li>The bottle itself is pretty cool, like a fliptop bottle.</li>
      <li>It is a light yet very male scent that has respectable staying power.</li>
      <li>The bottle is also pretty cool.</li>
      <li>I smelled this cologne in a department store a while ago and loved it, but did not buy due to the price (retail).</li>
      <li>I just now bought a second bottle to take advantage of the great price and low stock.</li>
      <li>Really, if the top breaks, it seems like you could pretty easily put the wire back in the hole; and even if that&#x27;s too much, the product itself shouldn&#x27;t be affected as it&#x27;s still sealed in the bottle by the sprayer.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely get more when I run out.</li>
      <li>AND IT IS SO MUCH CHEAPER TO BUY HERE THAN IN A DEPARTMENT STORE!  </li>
      <li>I first bought it at the Cesar&#x27;s Palace Forum Shops in Las Vegas and will keep buying it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Pleased with the smell and amazed at how long the sent lasts.</li>
      <li>Smells really good, heavy and light at the same time.</li>
      <li>Cedar, Ginger, Juniper and a cross between lemon and lime predominate, but blend well in a strong yet not overly obtrusive cologne.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very fresh for daily use.</li>
      <li>Think of that first whiff you get from a fresh from the oven Key Lime pie.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this scent.</li>
      <li>A little bit pricey at the retail stores plus many don&#x27;t carry it</li>
      <li>My significant other really likes the fragrance and that is a plus.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s easily removable for everyday use.</li>
      <li>it shut tight and securely</li>
      <li>smell seems to disappear relatively soon after you add it, but that very well might be just me getting used to the smell.</li>
      <li>I have to reapply frequently.  </li>
      <li>It is by far</li>
      <li>I really like the scent, and this has recently become one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>I can spray the whole bottle and still won&#x27;t last a minute</li>
      <li>But again, so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a reasonable cost choice for those whose pockets are not deep or whose priorities lie elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Simple with a few layers for you fragrance junkies out there to enjoy.  </li>
      <li>Also, the product comes in a really cool bottle, different from the average cologne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong when you put it on, so a little goes a long way!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Took a gamble and bought it cause it was on sale. Pleased with the smell and amazed at how long the sent lasts. I would&#x27;ve given it five stars if not for the awkward bottle.</li>
    <li> Item arrived with out delays. This is my favorite cologne and it is the real deal. Not the imitation. Will be re ordering this from now on. The malls dont carry this anymore. Happy to have found it with amazon.</li>
    <li> I smelled this cologne in a department store a while ago and loved it, but did not buy due to the price (retail). I found this on here and had to get it due to the price. My girlfriend is always complementing me on how great I smell when I wear this. I have also had numerous people compliment me on it and inquiries from co-workers on what cologne I was wearing. I really like the scent, and this has recently become one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> It smells terrific. Go grab a bottle for your man. I love it. The bottle is also pretty cool. He makes great cologne and clothing.........PERIOD!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and it smells absolutely wonderful! He loves it and wears it all of the time. After each bottle he usually likes to try a new cologne, but he likes this one so much he will probably get another bottle when its finished. Also, the product comes in a really cool bottle, different from the average cologne.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this.  However, it does not last.  I have to reapply frequently.  Strangely, I sampled this a couple of times at a local department store, and the scent lasted for a few hours.  I have no reason to suspect anything regarding the seller, who is well reviewed.  But this is a curious thing, and I am very disappointed in my purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne. I used to use Eternity, this is a way better deal.</li>
    <li> This cologne has a subtle, manly scent. My significant other really likes the fragrance and that is a plus. It&#x27;s a reasonable cost choice for those whose pockets are not deep or whose priorities lie elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I was nervous ordering this without smelling it, I was looking to get Varvatos Vintage.  Couldn&#x27;t beat this price though.  Been using for two weeks now and I love it!  Great scent that lasts a long time and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.  Beats getting strong armed into a $80 bottle at Macy&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne. Never thought Converse would have the best cologne that&#x27;s better then most very expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores as it was always sold out.  Happy to find it on Amazon and even happier that it was cheaper here than in local stores.  Boyfriend and I both love the scent.  And the bottle is also very cool.  I will def buy this again for him in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. Found out about it randomly through my wife&#x27;s birchbox subscription. A little bit pricey at the retail stores plus many don&#x27;t carry it, so I decided to check amazon to see if I could get a deal. Everything worked out great. Price was good. Shipping was timely. Definitely a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Where I&#x27;m from this perfume is like $40 ... Here I bought it in $13, amazing price and the product arrived before the estimated date, no joke. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Solid Toilette Spray for Men by Jon Varvatos in a 3.4 ounce container! I will likely buy this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Any Varvatos fragrance has the ladies swooning.  I prefer his original - VINTAGE but you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of his products.</li>
    <li> This cologne is awful I can spray the whole bottle and still won&#x27;t last a minute don&#x27;t waste your money.....</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne. Glad I could get it on the cheap.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this fragrance, especially for the money. Maybe this scent just agrees well with my body chemistry, but I love the way I smell and so does everyone else. It&#x27;s a very clean scent that is sophisticated enough to be versatile. The smell seems to change over time, and I think I like it even more as time passes. I find the fragrance to last a long time, and I also find it to be uplifting. As for the cap, I think it&#x27;s fashioned after a Grolsch beer bottle (One of my favorite beers), but it was certainly designed more for aesthetics than functionality. No big deal.</li>
    <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this cologne. That said, the bottle cap broke on me after about 10-15 uses. The design of this bottle is awful which is too bad.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Arrived promptly, smells great.</li>
    <li> I received John Varvatos Star U.S.A as a Christmas gift. It is a light yet very male scent that has respectable staying power. Think of that first whiff you get from a fresh from the oven Key Lime pie. Cedar, Ginger, Juniper and a cross between lemon and lime predominate, but blend well in a strong yet not overly obtrusive cologne. After about 10 minutes on my skin, I like it even more. I find Star U.S.A. a bit pricey, but of a quality that justifies the extra cost. I&#x27;m not a fan of the lid design, and took it apart for simpler use (easy to do). I&#x27;ll admit that it is great for travel though. No inadvertent knock will open that lid unless you want it open!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great masculine scent with staying power that my wife likes on me. What more could you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> It was a great valentine gift i love the smell I got it more for me then for my mate it goes great with his body chemistry</li>
    <li> This scent is great, very masculine and lasts for hours. I have gotten a compliment every-time I have worn this cologne!</li>
    <li> If you are interested in a clean, fresh fragrance this is for you.  Simple with a few layers for you fragrance junkies out there to enjoy.  Quite overlooked in comparison to the other Varvatos scents. Seems many are hating the fragrance.  I have seen that before and those fragrances are second to none now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not say this fragrance is soapy, but indeed like you showered in a woody citrus gourmondish sauna.  try a sample ...what have you to lose..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  TRAP</li>
    <li> smells terrible, my husband wears other John Varvatos fragrances and they all smell great but not this one, im sure that&#x27;s why they&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t sell it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I Love the scent, more importantly, my wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Smells really good, heavy and light at the same time. The bottle itself is pretty cool, like a fliptop bottle. Unlike a couple of the lower star reviews, my bottle has yet to break, and from what I can tell it doesn&#x27;t seem like it will either. Really, if the top breaks, it seems like you could pretty easily put the wire back in the hole; and even if that&#x27;s too much, the product itself shouldn&#x27;t be affected as it&#x27;s still sealed in the bottle by the sprayer. At the sale price for the amount you receive, I wouldn&#x27;t even complain if it did break. But again, so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;The smell seems to disappear relatively soon after you add it, but that very well might be just me getting used to the smell. It&#x27;s strong when you put it on, so a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Great scent...refreshing. Not as good as the original colonge but a close second.</li>
    <li> Love it. Hate that they are not making it any more.</li>
    <li> This spray really smells good and is nice. However, the bottle makes it a bit difficult to spray as you can remove the cap from the bottle. It falls behind it and then you are stuck having the cap in the way. Can be a problem with people with small hands. If it wasn&#x27;t from that, it definitely would get a 5-star rating.</li>
    <li> I love it, great perfume.</li>
    <li> I like a musky sweet scent for my husband. My favorite is Kouros cologne but this is very good.  Not very strong.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend always tells me I smell good when I have this on and she hugs me.  A little goes a long way.  Slight complaint about the container, it&#x27;s a tad difficult to open and close.  Just awkward.  Overall, 5 stars, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for quite a while and Iove it. It&#x27;s very fresh for daily use. I first bought it at the Cesar&#x27;s Palace Forum Shops in Las Vegas and will keep buying it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne that my boyfriend wears! Not a overbearing scent at all. The top of the bottle is a little annoying to open.</li>
    <li> The cologne smelt pretty amazing. I was impressed on how fast it got here too. I will definitely get more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this once and liked it. Found it at Ross for cheap. Then found it here even cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Think it smells just swell.</li>
    <li> Probably my new favorite cologne. It just smells so darn good on my skin. I put a few sprays on my neck and I just can&#x27;t get enough of it. I find myself moving my head around just to get whiffs of the incredible smell. Very masculine and clean with something very unique and pleasant about it. I just now bought a second bottle to take advantage of the great price and low stock. People are complaining about the lid design, but it&#x27;s a great lid for travelling, keeps it shut tight and securely but it&#x27;s easily removable for everyday use. Highly recommend this scent.</li>
    <li> Good product. Order delivered on time.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend loves it.  that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> Scent didn&#x27;t last 5 mins.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this and it smells absolutely wonderful.  It is by far my favorite cologne on him and he has quite a few others.  AND IT IS SO MUCH CHEAPER TO BUY HERE THAN IN A DEPARTMENT STORE!  It is unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Great seller and great price.</li>
    <li> Love it..fast shipping and great price..</li>
    <li> Does not stay so long. Smell is good, but you have to spray it couple of times in a day...</li>
    <li> The scent is very masculine with citrus and spice, yet very subtle.  I find a little in the morning behind the ears and on the inside of each wrist lasts throughout the day.  I would give it five stars, but the container it comes in, while looking cool, is fairly impractical.  Its a bit tough to work the sprayer with the &amp;#34;beer cap&amp;#34; hanging off to the side.</li>
