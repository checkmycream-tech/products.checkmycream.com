      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>One of the best hair products I&#x27;ve used for volumizing.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel great.</li>
      <li>This is good but does not work as well as the Kerastase resistance volumifique mousse.</li>
      <li>It works great on my hair which is very fine.</li>
      <li>I thought the sensational product too liked it, I will repeat the use and purchase for sure&lt;br</li>
      <li>This spray adds great texture and volume to my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>The nice thing about this spray is that you can spray it on your damp hair and then NOT also have to spray an additional heat productive product on it, too.</li>
      <li>Nice volumising spray.</li>
      <li>and she says that this one is the best so far.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>works well for my fine hair</li>
      <li>This product is nothing special.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s more reasonably priced than Keratase.  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair and it makes it much fuller.</li>
      <li>you want - strong to soft.</li>
      <li>Really like this product!  </li>
      <li>I have found other salon products that work much better, namely Living Proof&#x27;s Full mousse, which gives me tons of volume without weight, stickiness or crunchiness.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t mind paying more for products that actually work and LP</li>
      <li>works really well for me.  </li>
      <li>but I like it so much</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t add much volume at all to my medium/fine wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>I suggest you try it before this Keratase product, which I really don&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
      <li>I will be sticking with LP Full mousse for the foreseeable future.  </li>
      <li>I always add a bit water, to make it last longer, a bit costly spray, but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The same is my first time</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years and find it helps give volume to my hair - I really like it.</li>
      <li>I have tried a different product from the Keratase line and enjoyed it, so I bought this as a present for my mom who has thin hair with no volume.</li>
      <li>No significant build up and really helps with body and curl, of whatever degree</li>

    <li> Excellent product.  It works great on my hair which is very fine.</li>
    <li> The same is my first time but I like it so much</li>

    <li> This product is nothing special.  It didn&#x27;t add much volume at all to my medium/fine wavy hair.  It also felt quite sticky and stiff and I really wanted to wash it out immediately after applying it.  This is the third Keratase product I&#x27;ve tried and I am, once again, disappointed with the results.  I don&#x27;t think Keratase products are worth their expensive price tag.  I have found other salon products that work much better, namely Living Proof&#x27;s Full mousse, which gives me tons of volume without weight, stickiness or crunchiness.  Quite simply, it expands the volume of my hair and protects it against frizz as well.  And it&#x27;s more reasonably priced than Keratase.  I will be relegating this product to my hall closet where hair product FAILS go to die.  It was a complete waste of money.  I will be sticking with LP Full mousse for the foreseeable future.  I really don&#x27;t mind paying more for products that actually work and LP works really well for me.  I suggest you try it before this Keratase product, which I really don&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
    <li> This is an improved version of Volumactive. It works well. But I don&#x27;t see a difference between the two of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and find it helps give volume to my hair - I really like it.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser uses this product so I thought I would try it at home and I love it.  I have baby fine hair and it makes it much fuller.</li>
    <li> Really like this product!  It works to give my hair body.</li>
    <li> This volumizer really puffs up my thin flat hair (when used with a blow dryer).  I&#x27;ve used it without a blow dryer too, and it adds some body to my hair.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do any of the things i was hoping for - leaves hair softer than it was and flat as a pancake. . .. I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> This is good but does not work as well as the Kerastase resistance volumifique mousse. The nice thing about this spray is that you can spray it on your damp hair and then NOT also have to spray an additional heat productive product on it, too. This product does the job of both.</li>
    <li> This works well and does what it says it will do. A little heavy but probably necessary for the formulation. But hey, Kerastase and others, would it kill you to make the instructions in a larger type so I don&#x27;t need a magnifying glass. Talk about small print.</li>
    <li> works well for my fine hair and I get the volume I want.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and it works well.</li>
    <li> Nice volumising spray. Heat protectant too. Love it. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey though.</li>
    <li> I have tried a different product from the Keratase line and enjoyed it, so I bought this as a present for my mom who has thin hair with no volume. She&#x27;s tried a number of different products (Fekkai, etc.) and she says that this one is the best so far. Gives her volume without as much of an oily feeling that her Fekkai product leaves behind.</li>
    <li> I have hard to curl, straight hair.  I use this product everyday.  No significant build up and really helps with body and curl, of whatever degree you want - strong to soft.</li>
    <li> Great product! Received timely</li>
    <li> Thickens without adding sticky residue</li>
    <li> Perfect! I thought the sensational product too liked it, I will repeat the use and purchase for sure&lt;br /&gt;grateful&lt;br /&gt;Mirian</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> Been using for a while. I have thin hair and this spray help a lot to build a volume during styling. I always add a bit water, to make it last longer, a bit costly spray, but worth every penny.</li>
