    <li> I bought this bag for my sister because she works at the airport in a retail store. It&#x27;s a decent size! She really liked it. I recommend for anyone looking for a clear bag... :)</li>
    <li> I can fit almost anything in this bag only bad thing is that there&#x27;s no pockets for your phone or keys but great bag.</li>
    <li> There are gaps on the sides under the zipper, the handles are made very cheaply.  I hate this bag.  I got it for work and it just looks cheap and ugly.  I advise you not to buy this.</li>
    <li> Very larger than expected and just a little bit disappointed about the physical look of the bag. Use it for work but just not happy with size nor appearance, would not recommended to someone look for a small neat and cute bag. Wish Amazon had more selection for this item.</li>
    <li> Great for work (I work in a prison) and got a bunch of compliments on it. Good size and easy to carry.</li>
    <li> I got so many compliments about my bag at work!&lt;br /&gt;Its a little big in size but the Lost prevention team doesn&#x27;t seem to oppose to it. Its clear so that&#x27;s what it matters, great quality, I can bring lots of items inside of it. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is my errand bag.  Love it!</li>
    <li> just what she needed it</li>
    <li> It looks like those stylish, clear purses or lucite clutches, but this one is wallet friendly (making my own would&#x27;ve cost way more as well). Plenty of room to bedazzle or add embellishments. The pictures don&#x27;t really show that the sides are open on the left and right below the zipper (even when closed), so that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
    <li> This bag is Huge !!! Way too big for what I needed. Hopefully I will find a way to use it !!! Otherwise its OK!!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Arrived before expected date</li>
    <li> My mom loved it so yep</li>

    <li> Poor quality, handle broke first day.</li>
    <li> Good bag, but does not support alot of weight</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Something you would buy at a dollar store.</li>

    <li> This bag is strong and even though its clear the items look organized inside. Beautiful piece of accessory.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because it was left un finished at the zipper had to hand sew myself .Poorly made.</li>
    <li> The zipper broke after only having it for about a month. I really liked the size and the style of the bag.</li>
    <li> I was happy with how roomy it is and the thickness of the plastic. It is falling apart rather quickly though,especially the handles which are really put together badly. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be looking for another plastic bag to take it&#x27;s place within the next month. It&#x27;s ok, that&#x27;s the best I can say.</li>
