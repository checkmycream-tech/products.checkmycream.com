      <li>Hope for the best till it ends</li>
      <li>Love it because it works!</li>
      <li>Just good as I thought man:)</li>
      <li>I see the thinner hair start growing:)</li>
      <li>sure not as the guy in the picture</li>
      <li>is really important if so then you will find in time how to overcome these difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a good product, i started using it in January and after a month of use i could see a difference, Im starting to grow sideburns at the age of 29yrs and prio to that i only had mastuche.</li>
      <li>Save your money and invest in real product rather than a marketing trick.</li>
      <li>Also use sintetic shirts like polyester, sports shirts because if you got a spot on this it will be removed much easier.</li>
      <li>I grew a few more hair, but</li>
      <li>It did not help new hairs grow.  </li>
      <li>and I advice any one who want to buy it to buy a better than that one because it&#x27;s too small</li>
      <li>It is a shoe blue, smells funny.</li>
      <li>But what all other buyers said are true.</li>
      <li>and so far it has worked and showed some improvement.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF S*IT PRODUCT</li>
      <li>I havnt really used it much but for the past week my hair has been growing faster</li>
      <li>Twice daily for 3 months with supplements, barely made any results.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

    <li> Will help grow I grew a few more hair, but sure not as the guy in the picture</li>
    <li> melt black crayons and throw it at your face, same s***</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF S*IT PRODUCT ITS JUST A FORM OF BLACK PAINT THE EQUIVALENT TO BLACK MAKE UP THAT WILL STAIN SHIRTS AND WASH OFF LIKE PAINT DOES.... I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND DON&#x27;T BE STUPID LIKE I WAS.... THIS PRODUCT WILL NOT WORK WILL NOT WORK.... AMAZON SHOULD PULL ALL PRODUCTS LIKE THIS OFF THERE SITE</li>
    <li> I knew this was a long shot but it did nothing but stain a few of my lighter colored shirts don&#x27;t waste your time because it takes about 3 weeks for delivery</li>
    <li> Because you wrote that&#x27;s hair grow but it&#x27;s paint (black), it&#x27;s poor and I didn&#x27;t like it and I advice any one who want to buy it to buy a better than that one because it&#x27;s too small</li>
    <li> All this did was turn my skin black. It did not help new hairs grow.  I take some pills and use some cream (two different products) that works.  I know the pills are working cause not only has my face started to sprout new dark hair but the hair on my head is thicker and nails are stronger and I only apply the cream to my face.  So save your money and don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Please dont buy it!!!!It will not grow any hair but once u apply it it looks as though u have grown a beard</li>
    <li> this crap does NOT work dumb punks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it from last 2 weeks and so far it has worked and showed some improvement. Hope for the best till it ends</li>
    <li> Waste of money and time</li>
    <li> This is a good product, i started using it in January and after a month of use i could see a difference, Im starting to grow sideburns at the age of 29yrs and prio to that i only had mastuche. I just bought my second bottle so will see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible, and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Twice daily for 3 months with supplements, barely made any results.&lt;br /&gt;But instead, many skin problems occurred due to its abundance of oil.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed. It&#x27;s not worth it. Save your money and invest in real product rather than a marketing trick.</li>
    <li> I like how it smells Like baby powder but it is slightly difficult to rub in all the way until it&#x27;s invisible. it leaves a slight shadow on the skin but the hair has been feeling silky lately in his chin beard.</li>
    <li> jajajajajajaja... this product is a jocke  seriously. I bought it and  it is like a shoe wax. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Just good as I thought man:) It needs time to grow and about two week I see the thinner hair start growing:) after that keep applying until it thicken!</li>
    <li> Love it because it works! But what all other buyers said are true. It is a shoe blue, smells funny. So you will have to decide if grow beard is really important if so then you will find in time how to overcome these difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major issue is the color blue: To deal with it put small amount and spread it out. Doing so you will be a little blue dark skin guy, but that would be manageable. Also use sintetic shirts like polyester, sports shirts because if you got a spot on this it will be removed much easier.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me. I want a refund. I bought two of these products and i want my money back.</li>
    <li> I havnt really used it much but for the past week my hair has been growing faster</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money! Doesnt work</li>
