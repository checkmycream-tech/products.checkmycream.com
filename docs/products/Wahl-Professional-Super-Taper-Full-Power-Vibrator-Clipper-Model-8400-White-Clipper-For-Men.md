      <li>Got the US version and am pleased with it</li>
      <li>I had a cheaper Wahl clipper before and wanted to buy something with better precision blades as advertised in its description.</li>
      <li>I was expecting this one to be better.</li>
      <li>Got back to my country, and plugged it for usage, it gave an excellent performance!!!</li>
      <li>I found it very easy to cut my own hair with the Super Taper</li>
      <li>Professional clipper for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>My best companion offshore, I use it almost every other day year in year out to shave and cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>pleased with item is original USA</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews for various brands and models, all of greatly varying prices, I realized there were many aspects to look for: weight, vibration, noise, longevity, heat, length variations, cordless, etc etc etc.</li>
      <li>Super maquina!</li>
      <li>it is easy to use and easy to clean after cuts</li>
      <li>Great for styling and shaping facial hair.</li>
      <li>They are relatively quiet, cool to the touch and cut beautifully.  </li>
      <li>Good machine thus far, I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times</li>
      <li>el producto es excelente calidad cumple con las expectativas que tenia sobre el el producto es el original la maquina es pesada lo cual indica que es de calidad</li>
      <li>muy contento con el articulo es original USA&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
      <li>These clippers have good power, and because of the firmness on the open/close lever they will give you good control in making subtle changes to you fade levels.</li>
      <li>They cut great the first use, but started grabbing my hair the second.</li>
      <li>The best tool for the least money.</li>
      <li>The half size guards and adjustable taper lever are great for fading.  </li>
      <li>They cut wet or dry, nice and light, design handle fits like a glove, especially good for smaller hands.</li>
      <li>is very good and effective in cutting hair satisfactorily</li>
      <li>Lightweight and powerful.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had Wahl clippers in the past and were happy with them...</li>
      <li>THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST MACHINE</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>A real treat to me and my clients!</li>
      <li>Last wahl super taper model I had lasted 15+ years and is still working be it not as smooth sounding.</li>
      <li>Vibrates too much.</li>
      <li>I am a self-barber who had been using a basic/intro set of clippers (Wahl Designers) and felt I was ready to upgrade.</li>
      <li>It was well worth the extra expense to get the higher end model.</li>
      <li>, they Remind Me of the Classic Wahl Clippers, that were Used When I was a Kid in  the Seventies and Eighties.</li>
      <li>I would buy these again and highly recommend to any stylist or barber</li>
      <li>Although I cannot attest to the longevity (an edit will be made to this post if they die on me), they seem to be of sturdy USA made quality, whisper quiet, doesn’t heat up after 15minutes of use, and doesn’t leave any unsightly rogue hairs.. not to mention it has a clipper setting adjustment that won’t easily reset itself in the middle of your buzz, leaving you with an unexpected surprise when you look in the mirror!</li>
      <li>Since using the new set, I have had a lot of compliments on my cuts.</li>
      <li>: These clippers are insanely loud!</li>
      <li>Simply clean and maintain your machine properly oiled, and you should have this machine for a long time.</li>
      <li>Works great, but does NOT come with &amp;#34;8 color coded cutting guides&amp;#34; as the product listing indicates.  </li>
      <li>I dont speak english very well.</li>
      <li>The Pound for pound king as far as barber tools go.</li>
      <li>30 + year old clippers that I dropped &amp; broke).  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed for cutting my own hair&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Recently I had to replace my old Wahl clippers (</li>

<li> Recently I had to replace my old Wahl clippers (</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised Amazon has not figured this out as other reviews state the same</li>
<li> I hope it last as long as my other one (15 years).</li>
<li> Also, like everyone states, they only come with a few short guards.</li>
<li> Highly recommended if your serious about your craft.</li>
<li> that it does not come with a wide range of guards so they need to be purchased separately depending in what you require.</li>
<li> The Clippers Work as Expected</li>
<li> so careful when using.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve oiled them and tried to adjust them, but nothing dulls the roar.  </li>
<li> Blades sharp</li>
<li> Really sharp.</li>
<li> I have four other clippers and these</li>
<li> The clipper set I got was fake, It was really loud and vibrated really bad, the blade was off set and very crooked everything it was made with looked cheap and Brittle.</li>
<li> Totally rips through thick hair.</li>
<li> I wanted a buzzer that would be reliable, have an adjustable setting and not be too harsh on the wallet.</li>
<li> Heavy.</li>
<li> I never knew how complicated making a decision on something as simple as a hair buzzer would be.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t even want to manscape with these clippers vibrate excessively...</li>
<li> I made the very difficult choice to completely buzz all my hair of, except maybe an 1/8”...  </li>
<li> Loses two stars since I am having to purchase the 8 color coded guides separately for $15.74.</li>
<li> I am forced to wear earplugs while I cut my hair.</li>
<li> This product is like &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34; not good quality.</li>
<li> Not good for Europe  because  of the&lt;br /&gt;Hertz,  even though they claimed  it is  compatible .&lt;br</li>
<li> andis master clippers can&#x27;t ever go wrong with those.</li>
<li> sorry</li>
<li> You cant go wrong with this purchase.</li>
<li> I bought two clippers, and each one came with only 3 cutting guides, not 8 !!!!</li>

    <li> The best clipper in my arsenal. The Pound for pound king as far as barber tools go. The best tool for the least money. You cant go wrong with this purchase. Highly recommended if your serious about your craft.</li>
    <li> I hope it last as long as my other one (15 years).</li>
    <li> i sebd you it back,when you will give me my money? i&#x27;m waitting my money!!! please tell me when you will give me back my money</li>
    <li> Works great, but does NOT come with &amp;#34;8 color coded cutting guides&amp;#34; as the product listing indicates.  Loses two stars since I am having to purchase the 8 color coded guides separately for $15.74.</li>
    <li> Got back to my country, and plugged it for usage, it gave an excellent performance!!! Have been using one since 1997 and it is still working very fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Wahl clippers in the past and were happy with them...great product line for the most part.  Recently I had to replace my old Wahl clippers (30 + year old clippers that I dropped &amp; broke).  I bought an inexpensive model that didn&#x27;t work well and subsequently returned.  These, however are AWESOME!  They are relatively quiet, cool to the touch and cut beautifully.  It was well worth the extra expense to get the higher end model.</li>
    <li> These will run all day all week. Totally rips through thick hair. I would buy these again and highly recommend to any stylist or barber</li>
    <li> Lightweight and powerful. A real treat to me and my clients!</li>
    <li> this does not come with the listed accessory attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only had 2 guides in my box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised Amazon has not figured this out as other reviews state the same</li>
    <li> great product and seller</li>
    <li> I never knew how complicated making a decision on something as simple as a hair buzzer would be. I made the very difficult choice to completely buzz all my hair of, except maybe an 1/8”...  I wanted a buzzer that would be reliable, have an adjustable setting and not be too harsh on the wallet. After reading the reviews for various brands and models, all of greatly varying prices, I realized there were many aspects to look for: weight, vibration, noise, longevity, heat, length variations, cordless, etc etc etc. I was about to tear my hair out before I even made a purchase!&lt;br /&gt;After weeks and perhaps even months of sifting through buzzers online, I just decided on this one. I don’t know what exactly compelled me to purchase these clippers, but I am very happy with the choice I made. Although I cannot attest to the longevity (an edit will be made to this post if they die on me), they seem to be of sturdy USA made quality, whisper quiet, doesn’t heat up after 15minutes of use, and doesn’t leave any unsightly rogue hairs.. not to mention it has a clipper setting adjustment that won’t easily reset itself in the middle of your buzz, leaving you with an unexpected surprise when you look in the mirror! BUZZ ON!</li>
    <li> HAve used the Whal clipper, Uk version of it and it worked perfectly well and it&#x27;s durability is next to none.. Got the US version and am pleased with it</li>
    <li> It is defect. It is not possible to become a replacement.</li>
    <li> Love it i told my family and friends to use this site great product great service&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Good machine thus far, I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it. Simply clean and maintain your machine properly oiled, and you should have this machine for a long time.</li>
    <li> Thank you for offering to the consuming market a product of good quality, excellent machine of court of hair, good size, good weight, suitablly for different fashionable court ... good seller I come to destination in good conditions</li>
    <li> Very nice but had to return. Only 1104v</li>
    <li> My best companion offshore, I use it almost every other day year in year out to shave and cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is very good and effective in cutting hair satisfactorily</li>
    <li> Cuts good. Vibrates too much. Really sharp. Heavy.</li>
    <li> Last wahl super taper model I had lasted 15+ years and is still working be it not as smooth sounding. I expect this replacement to also go the distance. Professional clipper for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that it does not come with a wide range of guards so they need to be purchased separately depending in what you require.</li>
    <li> The product fulfilled expectations. excellent</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for cutting my own hair&lt;br /&gt;And it is easy to use and easy to clean after cuts</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;m in love with these baby&#x27;s! I have four other clippers and these are my go go&#x27;s. They cut wet or dry, nice and light, design handle fits like a glove, especially good for smaller hands. I&#x27;ve never had a clipper that I was so in love with, with exception of my Oster 76&#x27;s. As a Barber Shop owner/barber I plan to gift these.</li>
    <li> The Clippers Work as Expected, they Remind Me of the Classic Wahl Clippers, that were Used When I was a Kid in  the Seventies and Eighties.</li>
    <li> Products made in usa are goods. This product is like &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34; not good quality. I dont speak english very well. sorry</li>
    <li> Super maquina! Aguanta todo!</li>
    <li> Product came as stated</li>
    <li> muy contento con el articulo es original USA&lt;br /&gt;very pleased with item is original USA</li>
    <li> Not good for Europe  because  of the&lt;br /&gt;Hertz,  even though they claimed  it is  compatible .&lt;br /&gt;Giving the money to a charity organization would have been  better.</li>
    <li> excellent your product</li>
    <li> I bought two clippers, and each one came with only 3 cutting guides, not 8 !!!! What I have to do??</li>
    <li> the power rating of the equipment wasn&#x27;t changed by the seller for me so i have to buya voltage converter in order to use in south korea which comes as an extra cost for me.</li>
    <li> I chose to purchase the Super Tapers on the advice of a family member who is also one of the best barbers I know. He told me that these were his &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; set for tapering. I am a self-barber who had been using a basic/intro set of clippers (Wahl Designers) and felt I was ready to upgrade. My standard cut is #1 ceasar/taper fade. Since using the new set, I have had a lot of compliments on my cuts. These clippers have good power, and because of the firmness on the open/close lever they will give you good control in making subtle changes to you fade levels. While I am still a somewhat of a novice on fading (I understand the basic principles) these clippers compensate/enhance my ability. Would recommend for self-barbers once you have practiced or gained skill with a lesser set, like I did.</li>
    <li> I had a cheaper Wahl clipper before and wanted to buy something with better precision blades as advertised in its description. I was expecting this one to be better. But it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. So I only give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> The clipper set I got was fake, It was really loud and vibrated really bad, the blade was off set and very crooked everything it was made with looked cheap and Brittle. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;m gonna go with Sally&#x27;s and get andis master clippers can&#x27;t ever go wrong with those.</li>
    <li> el producto es excelente calidad cumple con las expectativas que tenia sobre el el producto es el original la maquina es pesada lo cual indica que es de calidad</li>
    <li> Excelente producto...</li>
    <li> HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON .... THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST MACHINE BUT WHEN I WENT TO TURN IT DID NOT DO AS TO SEE IF YOU HAVE A STAND FOR UNDER</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and holding up well so far. Great for styling and shaping facial hair. Blades sharp so careful when using.</li>
    <li> Pros: The half size guards and adjustable taper lever are great for fading.  I found it very easy to cut my own hair with the Super Taper clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: These clippers are insanely loud! I am forced to wear earplugs while I cut my hair. I&#x27;ve oiled them and tried to adjust them, but nothing dulls the roar.  They cut great the first use, but started grabbing my hair the second. Also, like everyone states, they only come with a few short guards. I lucked out by having guards from my last set of Wahl clippers but wouldn&#x27;t have bought these otherwise. 3 stars is probably a generous rating.</li>
    <li> the wahl shaver is very good quality</li>
    <li> My barber uncle loved it. These aren&#x27;t very cheap in the Dominican Republic so he was very happy with his new machine. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The machine is excellent, but did not bring me absolutely none of the accessories that said the box. !</li>
    <li> ouhhhhhh my goodd ist perfect</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
    <li> this is one of the best trimmer machines you can get last for many years and we use like every days</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even want to manscape with these clippers vibrate excessively...</li>
