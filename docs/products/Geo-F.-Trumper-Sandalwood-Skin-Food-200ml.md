      <li>It smells nice</li>
      <li>I prefer the Lime better, yet just as effective and smells nice.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild but pleasant.</li>
      <li>Very light, neutral scent.</li>
      <li>Scent is very light and not fully sandalwood, but that is not a deterrent for me.  </li>
      <li>The scent lasts most of the day, but like I said, it&#x27;s not overpowering in any way.</li>
      <li>I do love the lime skin food they make, though</li>
      <li>I bought this for my hubby and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I have purchased many bottles of this stuff.</li>
      <li>the smell is satisfying, and feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Love the aroma and feel.</li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>More of a perfume like citrus smell.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the way this makes my face feel after shaving.  </li>
      <li>Tried the lime version before the sandalwood, but after using both I can say the sandalwood smells much better IMO.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great and moisturizes very well</li>
      <li>I thought that was a brazen claim, but I must say it&#x27;s fitting.  </li>
      <li>That keeps the scent from being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I started shaving with DE razors about 4 months ago, and like many beginners, felt the wrath of nicks and razor burn.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful following a shave for soothing the skin.</li>
      <li>Went out on a limb based on Shave Nation&#x27;s Owner, and glad I did.</li>
      <li>It would seem to be best for someone seeking a dry finish to their after-shave experience.</li>
      <li>3 if you want good cover for all day added protection of your whole face,ears,neck.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>The smell is not overpowering in any way and it goes on smooth and greaseless.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny in my book......and won&#x27;t hesitate to buy again (when this bottle ever runs out - for sure will make it to Father&#x27;s Day).</li>
      <li>Light cologne scent, not overpowering</li>
      <li>This is a non issue since the reason I bought it was to smooth my face after shaving.</li>
      <li>Feels great after using the alum block, non-greasy, with a not-to-powerful ave scent (and I&#x27;m a big time cologne guy).</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and soothes whatever agitation I may have.</li>
      <li>Nice smell and really works</li>
      <li>This is my favorite after shave balm right now.  </li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>He was recommended this product when he started shaving with a straight razor which needs a better after shave to combat razor burn.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to submit your face to double edge/safety razor shaving, a good after shave is required.  </li>
      <li>Coming from warm climate I prefer the cooling nature of Coral but could easily imagine someone with a different skin composition preferring Sandalwood.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, thus why I went with the 200ml bottle this time for only $10 more.  </li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product more highly.</li>
      <li>It smells a bit harsh in the bottle, but once you apply it develops beautifully.</li>
      <li>Very soothing and alcohol free.</li>
      <li>Has a good scent to it that the wife loves, with enough staying power to be present but not at all overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth it.  </li>
      <li>Its worth the \\&quot;price of entry.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Worth the cost.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome, it only takes a little dab and makes my face feel refreshed</li>
      <li>It makes skin really smooth and soft too.</li>
      <li>I first bought a 100ml bottle of this over the winter.  </li>
      <li>It takes a bit to dry - maybe 30-45 seconds - and doesn&#x27;t leave a notable residue.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it as my after shave because it is alcohol free and does not dry your face out</li>
      <li>The scent is great, but its strong enough that you can really only use a little dab of this or you&#x27;ll fill the air with your scent.</li>
      <li>Bought for my husband, smells awesome, a very small amount goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Applying this &amp;#34;skin food&amp;#34; after a rough shave immediately made my face feel better.  </li>
      <li>Complements very well with Trumper&#x27;s sandalwood cologne, which is the intent.</li>
      <li>I use a straight razor, so I&#x27;d recommend it to straight razor owners.</li>
      <li>When I received this product, the whole seam along the side of the bottle was cracked causing the product to leak out.  </li>
      <li>Give yourself a treat, feed your skin what it wants.</li>
      <li>I actually really like the scent</li>
      <li>The scent is great, and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this after shave lotion.</li>
      <li>I recently got more into shaving as I got a job that requires me to be clean shaven and with my facial hair that means shaving every single day.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, I apply just a little before my shave and then use it as an after shave when my shave is done.</li>
      <li>I was a little hesitant to spend this much money on an aftershave, but it is has been my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>Your face feels new.  </li>
      <li>I was intrigued by something new by a reliable producer.</li>
      <li>Subtle smell is nice too.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for safety/straight razor users, or anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but since literally a few drops can be used effectively, it lasts forever and will be much cheaper than generic alternatives in the long run.</li>
      <li>Considering how frugal he can be, I was surprised to hear that he would like to buy another bottle again despite the price.</li>
      <li>I used to get razor burn fairly frequently; I have not had it once since I started using Skin Food.  </li>
      <li>Really soothing after a shave, especially if you need a balm after an aggressive shave.</li>
      <li>Quickly absorbs (you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ll pour too much in the beginning - because a little goes a long way), so you don&#x27;t feel greasy, but like you have put on a shield of sorts.</li>
      <li>A few drops goes a long way to smooth skin after a close shave.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both agree that this does not remotely smell like sandalwood.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, with a feel like a thick oil - akin to hand sanitizer in viscosity.  </li>
      <li>I find myself, more mornings than not (even though I shave art night) splashing on a little Lucky Tiger (to waken up a bit) and a follow with a thin coat of Skin Food, a spritz of Armani Code Ultimate, Spicebomb, or Yves Saint  </li>
      <li>Wow, purchased this one on accident--it&#x27;s bigger than the one we got last time.</li>
      <li>The only knock I have on it, is because of the seller, they tape their own UPC over the UPC on the bottle, now that is fine in itself, but they crudely taped it to the bottle, forcing me to peel it off and making the bottle a sticky mess to handle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of other after-shave balms and oils, but this one is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that gives me the results I really desire.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Skin Food daily for 5 months now &amp; I have barely used 1/4 of the bottle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Skin Food changed my shaving life a few years ago when I started using it.  The Sandalwood product smells great and makes my skin feel and look very healthy post-shave.  I used to get razor burn fairly frequently; I have not had it once since I started using Skin Food.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product more highly.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both agree that this does not remotely smell like sandalwood. More of a perfume like citrus smell. Very disappointing, will be returning.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It smells a bit harsh in the bottle, but once you apply it develops beautifully. A little goes a long way, and I see this bottle lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll put my two cents in: This will be the last time I buy an aftershave online.  Boy, did I hate the scent of this!  I do love the lime skin food they make, though, I am going back to that.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma and feel.</li>
    <li> As a devotee to Coral Skin Food I was intrigued by something new by a reliable producer. This is a not just a different scent but a different style altogether. If asked to identify an adjective it might be \\&quot;dry\\&quot;. It would seem to be best for someone seeking a dry finish to their after-shave experience. Coming from warm climate I prefer the cooling nature of Coral but could easily imagine someone with a different skin composition preferring Sandalwood.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  Yes, it is a bunch of chemicals, but no matter how poor a shave, put a little of this stuff on and viola! Your face feels new.  Have a good shave and your face feels great.  It will even stop the bleeding on small nicks and cuts.  Scent is very light and not fully sandalwood, but that is not a deterrent for me.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this after shave lotion. I have purchased many bottles of this stuff. Each bottle lasts me about a year. Just a little dab will do you. Very soothing and alcohol free. Not greasy or sticky. Absorbs quickly. Very light, neutral scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on here again to order this for hubby. He was recommended this product when he started shaving with a straight razor which needs a better after shave to combat razor burn. I bought this one year and one month ago and he&#x27;s now down to the last dregs and needs me to reorder. Nice smell and really works, the other after shave wasn&#x27;t cutting it with the straight razor, but this stuff does.    Update:Wow, purchased this one on accident--it&#x27;s bigger than the one we got last time. So the small bottle was what lasted one year and one month. Very long lasting stuff.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, yes..... But when you see just how little you need to cover your mug, it&#x27;ll last twice, to three times as long as other lotions. Feels great after using the alum block, non-greasy, with a not-to-powerful ave scent (and I&#x27;m a big time cologne guy). I find myself, more mornings than not (even though I shave art night) splashing on a little Lucky Tiger (to waken up a bit) and a follow with a thin coat of Skin Food, a spritz of Armani Code Ultimate, Spicebomb, or Yves Saint  Laurent por homme Parfum, and I feel and smell like a million bucks. Quickly absorbs (you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ll pour too much in the beginning - because a little goes a long way), so you don&#x27;t feel greasy, but like you have put on a shield of sorts. Worth every penny in my book......and won&#x27;t hesitate to buy again (when this bottle ever runs out - for sure will make it to Father&#x27;s Day). Went out on a limb based on Shave Nation&#x27;s Owner, and glad I did.</li>
    <li> This must be the worst aftershave balm (skin food) I had the chance to try. It came in generous size bottle but it looked  (is?) separated. You get watery liquid with gel lumps when you squeeze it out of the bottle. Do not know if I got an expired sample, but if you shake the bottle for a while the content becomes gel-ly. It smells nice but I would not say Sandalwood.If I got bad sample, then that&#x27;s my bad luck, because I am NOT buying another one again.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to spend this much money on an aftershave, but it is has been my favorite so far. I&#x27;ve been using Skin Food daily for 5 months now &amp; I have barely used 1/4 of the bottle. Four drops on a wet face is all I need to moisturize after shaving. It makes skin really smooth and soft too. The sandalwood scent smells really good but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. This is a non issue since the reason I bought it was to smooth my face after shaving. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again once this is used up.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite after shave balm right now.  I happen to like the scent of sandalwood, but it does come in various other types.  It goes on smoothly, with a feel like a thick oil - akin to hand sanitizer in viscosity.  It&#x27;s quite soothing, quelling a bit of burn when I shave too closely.  It takes a bit to dry - maybe 30-45 seconds - and doesn&#x27;t leave a notable residue.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it, as suggested on the package, as a preshave oil, but it doesn&#x27;t do as well on that front.  However, it excels in it&#x27;s purpose of being used post shave.  I don&#x27;t know if it is any different for other shave types - I use a straight razor, so I&#x27;d recommend it to straight razor owners.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I prefer the Lime better, yet just as effective and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby and LOVE it. The smell is not overpowering in any way and it goes on smooth and greaseless. The scent lasts most of the day, but like I said, it&#x27;s not overpowering in any way. GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way this makes my face feel after shaving.  I started shaving with DE razors about 4 months ago, and like many beginners, felt the wrath of nicks and razor burn.  Applying this &amp;#34;skin food&amp;#34; after a rough shave immediately made my face feel better.  The scent is great, and a little goes a very long way.  I know that it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side, but I will probably get about 9-12 months out of the bottle. The only drawback that I can see, is that it does leave a shine behind on your skin.</li>
    <li> I recently got more into shaving as I got a job that requires me to be clean shaven and with my facial hair that means shaving every single day. Now, I have the unfortunate combo of having very sensitive skin with a very thick, fast-growing beard. I&#x27;ve tried lots of other after-shave balms and oils, but this one is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that gives me the results I really desire. It calms irritation and cools the skin immediately. Everything about it is great. The only knock I have on it, is because of the seller, they tape their own UPC over the UPC on the bottle, now that is fine in itself, but they crudely taped it to the bottle, forcing me to peel it off and making the bottle a sticky mess to handle.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and moisturizes very well I use it as my after shave because it is alcohol free and does not dry your face out</li>
    <li> I picked this up after some suggestions I saw on Reddit and a couple of other shaving information sources. I was not disappointed. Has a good scent to it that the wife loves, with enough staying power to be present but not at all overwhelming. Goes on smooth and soothes whatever agitation I may have. Give yourself a treat, feed your skin what it wants.</li>
    <li> I use it as aftershave, and a small dab works for my entire face and neck. Very pleasant and understated scent. Really soothing after a shave, especially if you need a balm after an aggressive shave.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, it only takes a little dab and makes my face feel refreshed</li>
    <li> Great, great product. Tried the lime version before the sandalwood, but after using both I can say the sandalwood smells much better IMO. Light cologne scent, not overpowering, Price seems a bit steep up front but since literally a few drops can be used effectively, it lasts forever and will be much cheaper than generic alternatives in the long run. Highly recommended for safety/straight razor users, or anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> When I received this product, the whole seam along the side of the bottle was cracked causing the product to leak out.  Thankfully I had tried to take it out of the plastic to wrap it as a gift and discovered the issue before giving it my husband.  In terms of the actual product, assuming this one is not a knock off, my husband loves the same product we received from another seller.  He thinks that the improvement in his skin is mostly due to the use of this product.  The sent is really great as well, and isn&#x27;t over powering. Considering how frugal he can be, I was surprised to hear that he would like to buy another bottle again despite the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now and it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s a little expensive but you do not need a lot so it lasts a long time. Great fragrance and soothing after a shave. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that provides a scent detectable by everyone around you until lunch, this is not it. If you are looking for something to soothe, moisturize, and protect your face, this is the stuff. I recommend finishing off your shave and leaving your face slightly damp, not dripping, and then apply this. The scent is mild but pleasant. Complements very well with Trumper&#x27;s sandalwood cologne, which is the intent.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that since it&#x27;s sold as a lotion, I could use it as a lotion.  Well, if you do, you&#x27;ll end up sending your scent out about 5 times further than is politely allowable. The scent is great, but its strong enough that you can really only use a little dab of this or you&#x27;ll fill the air with your scent. Scents are meant to entice someone to get closer to you, not to drive them away.  I use a little bit of this and mix it with an unscented lotion after I shave. That keeps the scent from being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Have used for years. Wonderful following a shave for soothing the skin.</li>
    <li> I first bought a 100ml bottle of this over the winter.  It lasted several months using 3 drops before I shaved and 3-4 drops after I shaved.  I love this stuff, thus why I went with the 200ml bottle this time for only $10 more.  Absolutely worth it.  I actually really like the scent but I can&#x27;t tell you whether or not it smells like sandalwood or not because I&#x27;ve never purchased anything in my life with a sandalwood scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
    <li> A few drops goes a long way to smooth skin after a close shave. My wife loves the scent too.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to submit your face to double edge/safety razor shaving, a good after shave is required.  This stuff is after shave on steroids-skin food.  I thought that was a brazen claim, but I must say it&#x27;s fitting.  A little dab will do your face well.  Subtle smell is nice too.</li>
    <li> The scent on this balm is VERY addictive. Once you rub it on..the smell is satisfying, and feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;You must remember, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.&lt;br /&gt;You will be surprised how little it takes. I would recommend 1-2 drops just for the beard area. 3 if you want good cover for all day added protection of your whole face,ears,neck.&lt;br /&gt;Once you have it on, wave your hand towel at your face or just let it air dry. All done. Amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Try it. Its worth the \\&quot;price of entry.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband, smells awesome, a very small amount goes a long way.  Will last well over a year.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I apply just a little before my shave and then use it as an after shave when my shave is done. Great scent and condions my face and beard very nicely!</li>
