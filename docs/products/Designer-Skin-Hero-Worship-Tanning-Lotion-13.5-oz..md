      <li>The best part about this lotion is that it doesn&#x27;t have a very sticky residue like others, but won&#x27;t come off as easily as others.  </li>

      <li>This moisturizers and smells pretty good, more manly than most others.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite tanning lotion @ a reasonable price. Received quickly &amp; shipped neatly.</li>
    <li> works great, my tan was a deep bronze after using it and it even brought out the freckles on my nose that i love</li>
    <li> It is okay. Pretty nice feeling, but kind of smells a little like cologne.</li>
    <li> Used this lotion for the first time and developed a contact dermatitis,and no, I do not have sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite tanning lotion! I absolutely LOVE the smell, (and bonus! it&#x27;s unisex), it is fresh and leaves you smelling amazing after you tan as well as before. It is an accelerator/activator, NOT a bronzer, so it does take a few sessions in the bed before you notice a dramatic difference, but it is 100% worth the wait. You will develop a stunning tan that lasts rather than washes off after a few days. I used it last summer for only two months of tanning, and I had a good tan until Christmas! Hero Worship is the best tanning lotion I have ever used, out of the fourteen I have tried, and I would recommend it to anyone. Unfortunately most salons no longer carry it, so you will have to buy online. Make sure and get the REAL product, it is worth a little extra money.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion and it is exactly what I expected.  I will say that the bottle needed to be sealed letting customers know that it has not been used before and to insure no leaking during delivery.</li>
    <li> This lotion keeps skin moist and evenly tanned whether you use it in a tanning bed or out in the sun! Smells nice as well!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well by its self or with other tanning lotions. Leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say that I love this lotion it works well and seems to really treat my skin well. It smells clean and I love that. I got my order through Glamor Tanning and I got it in record time! I would recommend to anyone.. Thanks .. Christina</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and a lot of allergies and this was the only lotion at the tanning salon I could use based on the ingredients. It contains no castor oil, bronzers, or other ingredients that cause my skin to break out but has lots of great conditioners like avocado, shea butter, cocoa butter, and more. It absorbs really well into the skin and gave me a really even tan. The smell is a lot more neutral than other lotions and it doesn&#x27;t contain any fake looking bronzers in it. It takes probably about 30-60 minutes to completely absorb but you&#x27;re left with perfectly silky smooth skin with no residue.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price according to my son. He says he likes the consistency and color of his tans .</li>
    <li> Works great for those with medium to fair skin tone.  Definitely worth a try.  The smell or fragrance to the lotion is more of a masculine nature and isn&#x27;t very strong.  The best part about this lotion is that it doesn&#x27;t have a very sticky residue like others, but won&#x27;t come off as easily as others.  It&#x27;s found a sweet spot for tanning lotions. Don&#x27;t expect to turn out orange with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product / received  a free sample  with each bottle</li>
    <li> The girl at the tanning salon told me this is a great lotion for men because it smells like cologne.  It does smell like men&#x27;s cologne (which I actually like) and afterwards you just smell clean and fresh and your skin with be amazingly soft.  It didn&#x27;t get me much darker because I have been switching lotions everyday to see what I like but it worked better than the last few I tried.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great inside and out of the tanning bed. You can use this lotion as a daily moisturizer too, that&#x27;s how pure of a lotion it is. No added color or anything. This is a good lotion to alternate with a bronzers so you don&#x27;t get orange if you tan.</li>
    <li> My only gripe with this is it IS pretty greasy after the fact. Not shiny and wet looking, but I have left some armprints on glass an hour or two after the fact. As for color, it&#x27;s pretty noticeable an hour after you tan. Like the other reviewer said, I would put it on and let it sit for 30 mins or so. Feels real nice after tanning, but for as expensive as it is, and how well it works before, I tend to leave it to pre-tan. I think the greasy is just a little too bad to use on days i want to tan before work. I use this for days I have off. For days I gotta work, I&#x27;ll use Devoted Creations Couture Sport. They both smell similar, and suitable for males. (Think regular Dial bar soap.) The Hero Worship blows away the Couture Sport for color. Doesn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin. I&#x27;d like to one day see it in a bottle that makes getting the last bit out easier. Or maybe even in the gel style like Couture Sport to go on cleaner.</li>
    <li> The product was sent within 3 business days and is a great product.</li>
    <li> The best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. Excellent subtle fragrance, too.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast from Sealed Tanning Lotions and normally I love Designer Skin lotions, but this smells kind of like aftershave, nothing a female could ever pull off. I guess I should have taken a hint from the image of a man on the front of the bottle. As a lotion, it&#x27;s not too heavy, and if I was a man, I&#x27;m sure I would like it.</li>
    <li> It has a decent guy smell and leaves your skin moisturized even after the tan</li>
    <li> perfect! fast shipping! thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I alternate Goddess, Worship Me, and now Hero Worship. I noticed a change in color after first application. Another plus, there is no after tan odor. Goes on silky smooth, and does not feel heavy/greasy.</li>
    <li> This lotion works good. It seems to work very well as an accelerator and the scent is mildly masculine. It&#x27;s like a mild cologne. I&#x27;m not sure if it works as well as others I&#x27;ve tried for moisturizing, but it does work good for tanning. It spreads nicely and doesn&#x27;t sit on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lotion if you&#x27;re working on your base tan. It took about a week or so to really notice much of a difference though but then I did get really dark. The smell is pretty musky but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely, not too greasy. Smells good and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great, give me a awesome tan.  no tingle, great tan, really dark, real tan look too.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with Hero Worship Lotion. It went on without any sticky residue and it had a good smell to it.</li>
    <li> Not to much odor after use I and really  does the job. I don&#x27;t use it too often but it works well when I do.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and likes the more manly smell compared to other tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> After trying more than a half-dozen tanning lotions, I was glad to try this one. The scent is very light and is acceptable for both men and women. It seems most tanning lotions are aimed at women, and many of the tanning lotions I have been using are strongly scented with feminine smells (flowers, roses, etc...). I&#x27;ve always liked the Designer Skin series of lotions and they never fail to offer a wide variety, but if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;ve been tanning for years, you may soon find out that Designer Skin stopped making the lotion you like and you have to start all over again. I should also mention this is for indoor-tanning use. I don&#x27;t beleive it is recommended for outdoor tanning. Overall, this is my favorite indoor tanning lotion so far. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> He still didn&#x27;t like the design on this when he saw it, but it definitely doesnt smell girly!! It has a real fresh, soapy, cologne smell to it. I liked this even more than the one i got for myself, the one thats called &amp;#34;smile, you&#x27;r darker&amp;#34; by designer skin as well, it smells peachy</li>
    <li> Men, this is a great indoor tanning lotion that has a great cologne like scent to it. Works great and keeps my skill healthy and healthy moisturised skin holds a tan longer!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance.  He is a first-time indoor tanner and was looking for a nice lotion that was male friendly.  The smell is nice for men...not too frilly or flowery.  I was also looking for lotion WITHOUT bronzer which is hard to find these days.  This lotion fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Nice non-floral scent can be used by everyone. Silky texture on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites for men. If you want a lotion without bronzers, this one is for you.  Great all around lotion, even if your not using it to tan.</li>
    <li> I think it works great and leaves your skin feeling smooth. I would really like to recommend this product to others to try.</li>
    <li> It is good but my previous &amp;#34; Worship Me&amp;#34; is better. I would buy this one again if I cannot find &amp;#34;Worship Me.&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> The tanning salon I go to charges 80 *&amp;^%ing dollars for this exact same lotion.  it smells good on me (i&#x27;m a dude) and keeps me from getting dry.  I like how there aren&#x27;t any stupid bronzers in it either so i don&#x27;t look like those ugly muscleheads.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. No unpleasant smell. Has no sticky residue. Can be used for indoor tanning.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the product it does have a bit of a manly smell but I don&#x27;t mind it, I didn&#x27;t want anything with bronzer , I just want to build a tan over the winter and this seems perfect for that- first time using it I could tell I got more color.</li>
    <li> SUPER quick shipping. This item smells great and helps keep the burning hair smell at bay in a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I have used Designer Skin products previously, and they still continue to surprise me. I only tan in the spring so I can get a good base tan and prevent getting burned by the summer sun. This product does have bronzers in it, but not much. Unlike a lot of other bronzers that leave you orange. This product does not leave you orange.</li>
    <li> not the real thing...</li>
    <li> I personally do not mind the scent, however, it is not what I prefer and it&#x27;s a bit plain and unoriginal compared to the fun, exciting ones I&#x27;ve used.  It is a good moisturizer, but that&#x27;s about it.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change at all in color.  I feel like it&#x27;s a tad expensive for what it&#x27;s worth.  It&#x27;s just not anything special. I&#x27;d rather use Angel for moisturizing- that smells better.  I didn&#x27;t get any extra acceleration or evenness.  As for being Designer Skin, 2 stars.</li>
    <li> i get really good results using this in a tanning bed. reasonable pricing too</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that this stuff works. And it seems to work well. Smells great, too. I&#x27;ve always been one of those people who have an extreme difficulty tanning and look pale no matter how much time I spend in the sun. Even with this tanning lotion I&#x27;m not as dark as I wish to be, but I&#x27;m darker than I have ever been in my life, which means that my skin color is at the &amp;#34;normal - I don&#x27;t tan&amp;#34; phase which most of you reading this are already at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this year I opted to try a different route. I purchased a tanning package at my local gym and did loads of research on tanning lotions and this was the best that I could come up with. I knew I wanted an accelerator, I didn&#x27;t want a bronzer/tingle, I wanted it to smell masculine, and I wanted it to work! This fits the bill for all of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things that I don&#x27;t like about it. Maybe it&#x27;s just my inexperience with tanning lotions, but maybe, just maybe, there is a chance that I may be on to something here. There are no recommended application instructions. Nothing that gives a hint as to if I should apply immediately before I get in the tanning bed, or if I should apply at least 30 minutes in advance. So I have been trying a mix of both seeing that no matter what I read online there is always someone who says to apply immediately before tanning and then there is someone else who says to let it &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; for at least 30 minutes. Then we go to application. I feel as though it should go further when applying, but it seems like a handful is just enough to do half my leg. I just feel like the bottle is going fast for as little as I have used it (I&#x27;ve only gone 5 tanning sessions while using this). Now, this is the part that got me the most. All these great reviews about it no matter where I looked online. But there is one thing that it doesn&#x27;t have that I wish among everything else that it did. This tanning lotion does nothing to help protect tattoos.I saw that there are plenty of them out there, but none of them met my criteria. I&#x27;ll most likely be switching to the option I almost chose over this when I get a darker tan, only because it is tattoo safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, this product is great. There is no &amp;#34;I just went tanning and you can tell by the smell of burning skin&amp;#34; when using this product. You come out smelling almost exactly as you did when you went in, which is very much like a cologne. And it definitely helps to build that base tan that is needed for more &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; tanning methods.</li>
    <li> Scent is good and neutral.  The tan is better than another lotion i was using, so i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;d buy it again however Designer Skin has SOOOO many tanning lotions that I must try more before I settle. I&#x27;m a huge fan of this tanning line. My favorite so far is &#x27;Believe In Me&#x27; by Designer Skin simply because of the amazing smell.&lt;br /&gt;This one works great too though and smells sweet!</li>
    <li> Way cheaper than from the salon, love this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd order of this prodcut &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a girl either</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I don&#x27;t even want to give it one star. It deserves a quarter of a star, and it&#x27;s only because of the cool design on the bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;I am an avid indoor tanner, and have used all sorts of different lotions. My best tans are with accelerators. I seen so many positive reviews for this lotion that I thought for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Boy was I wrong! I&#x27;m not sure if the actual tanning lotion was replaced with moisturizing lotion that you would use for when you have dry skin or what, because there is no tingle what so ever, and I don&#x27;t even tan !!!! No color at all!!!!! I Will defiantly not buy this lotion again, nor buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> item was on time exactly as I expected it great stuff great company thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion based off the reviews from other users. I am not disappointed at all. It smells good and i use it for indoor and outdoor sunning. GHreat price and great product. Dont hesitate to purchase!</li>
    <li> This lotion does NOTHING. I used it for about 6-8 months - I bought one bottle online that I used for a few months, then I bought one from the salon. NEITHER ONE gave me any results. This has to be the worst lotion out there.</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion!  Smells nice after the tanning bed as well.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Works great.  Gives you a good gradual tan without being completely obvious that you have been in a tanning  bed.  Smells good too :)&lt;br /&gt;I got several compliments when using this lotion versus other ones I tried before my wedding.  Everyone said it looked really natural and were suprised when I told them it was a lotion.</li>
    <li> Good color, great smell - big fan of this.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion; it&#x27;s just creamy enough without being too thick. Soaks into my skin perfectly &amp; has a light scent. Looking for something not too perfumy &amp; I found it in this product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this lotion! Also love the fact that there are no bronzers, I like the pure lotions that you can gauge your actual color with not ones that tend to make you look orange! This lotion is a must try...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pale as all can be but after only 4 sessions you can see a niticabke difference and it smells good. Best part though is it isn&#x27;t to unnaturally fast and the color looks amazing so no one thinks your going tanning at a salon.</li>
    <li> Guys, this is a great tanning lotion and has a nice masculine scent. It absorbs well into the skin and isnt greasy</li>
    <li> Great smell, and a terrific tanning product</li>
    <li> I tried going without this for a week and definetly did not tan nearly as much. This moisturizers and smells pretty good, more manly than most others. It certainly helps tanning, prevents dry skin. It is not a bronzer, which I like, nor is it a tingle lotion. It is not advertised as such, so the one star review that says it does not tingle is correct. I use this exclusively and am very pleased. Every other lotion I tried either smelled too feminine or had other objectionable issues. This one is excellent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very pleaased.</li>
    <li> Works great on a white guy who can&#x27;t tan</li>
    <li> As a guy I am always nervous about my tanning lotion as I don&#x27;t want to smell to femine.  Hero Worship has a nice manly smell to it.  I am fair skinned and after two weeks of tanning using this product I am showing a nice tan.  The only part of me that burned are on my back where i could not reach.  I tan every year prior to my vacation and this is my quickest darkest tan yet.  The lotion itself is a little thicker than my previous lotions which means it will need to be replaced quicker than I would like.  Main ingredient after water is aloe which sooths my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes me brown with only one tanning session. I also love the smell so much that sometimes I wear it as regular lotion and it still helps achieve a bronzed look without streaks. When I ran without this lotion, I kick myself because this lotion practically adds an extra session to your tan immediately following getting out of the bed.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely great tanning intensifier.  No bronzer, no tingle, no cold, just great tan.  I could tell the first time I used it that I would love it.  I have had people in the salon ask me what I am using because my tan is so fresh.  It has a very slight clean smell even after tanning.  Last, but not least, the price is great.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! Works amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a tanning bed. Gives you a instead tan within a couple of uses! :)</li>
    <li> I used to use Smile Your Darker and wanted to give something new a try. I bought hero worship because it was Designer Skin but wasn&#x27;t too expensive. Unfortunately I was disappointed from the start. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin soft like most DS lotions and the scent is strange and leaves you smelling like you&#x27;ve just gone tanning. It was only mildly affective too. It isn&#x27;s one of Designer Skins better products.</li>
    <li> Great product works as expected and smells great.  This is much cheaper to buy online than in tanning salons.  Definitely for men though</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion in the past and have liked the results I got. As far as tanning lotions go, it definitely has a more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell. I have used other tanning lotions in the past but I am happiest with this tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I changed from Tao to this brand and it seems to work just as well.</li>
    <li> My partner and I enjoy and recommend this lotion. I do encourage people to read the directions and follow them.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it and like the scent and the lotion for the skin as well.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps skin moisturized</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells like a man scent, it&#x27;s more of a neutral (clean) smell which I like. I don&#x27;t like coming out from tanning and smelling like I just rolled in tropical fruits, not my thing. It goes on very smooth and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling at all. I am highly sensitive to many lotions and this one did nothing but make my skin soft and smooth. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I love how this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, and makes my skin feel soft and no burn smell.</li>
    <li> Smells funny ... not really manly.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great for fair skin. With this lotion I tanned quickly and the tan stayed really well.  Also it smells nice!</li>
    <li> Bought this for hubby. He really likes it and I always compliment him on how good he smells after he tans.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this lotion again and again.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;tanning lotion smell&amp;#34;. It also has done a good job to moisturize and keep my skin tanning evenly.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as I would have thought, but price was right! Probably not going to use this one again.</li>
    <li> Great lotion,  softens my skin!</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying a good product after doing a lot of research but for one, the bottle I received expired last year and for two, it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been tanning for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m still as white as I was before. Thank you for wasting my money!</li>
    <li> I have fairer skin, and I tried Hero Worship and SUPRE-Domination Dark Maximizer as my first tanning lotions.  I don&#x27;t have any scientific evidence, but I felt that Hero Worship was a better product overall when compared to the SUPRE-Domination Dark Maximizer.</li>
