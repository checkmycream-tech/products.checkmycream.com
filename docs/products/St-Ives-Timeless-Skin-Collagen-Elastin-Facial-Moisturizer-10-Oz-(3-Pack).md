      <li>I gave it to my mom who also got kind of allergy.</li>
      <li>This is the best facial cream I&#x27;ve used ever, the results are incredible, I love it</li>
      <li>But they really should keep selling it because it&#x27;s the best moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used for my face</li>

      <li>Very glad to find this product at a fair price and available.</li>
      <li>With that being said I&#x27;m ordering my second batch because It&#x27;s awesome !!  </li>
      <li>AT MOST 9.00 THE DESIGN HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really light, not sticky and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>how much I love this cream.</li>
      <li>I love St. Ives Collagen Elastin Moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years</li>
      <li>I truly love St. Ives Collagen Elastin Moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over 25 years and simply love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more than a face cream to me --  </li>
      <li>MORE AWAKE</li>
      <li>i noticed how it made my skin hydrated and supple and just glowing! :)</li>
      <li>Hopefully I will be able to purchase it again through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to find anything better...</li>
      <li>This could be a tad more moisturizing for my liking</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all, so even if you have oily skin, you should be able to use this.</li>
      <li>I liked the light consistency and that it smelled lovely, but it made my skin too oily.</li>
      <li>so this makes my skin appear more oily</li>
      <li>For the price, its pretty good.</li>
      <li>I have used this for many years and it is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I gave it to my mother, who fell in love with it and now uses it as a night cream (and her skin looks fantastic).</li>
      <li>The scent of the cream is pretty nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This does improve the look of your skin and reduce fine lines.  </li>
      <li>It is too cheap and trully moisturize your skin.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I rediscovered St. Ives Collagen Moisturizer on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is a light moisturizer that does not leave you feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>It gives my skin a fresh, \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;, healthy appearance.</li>
      <li>It is a light cream.</li>
      <li>If my skin needs extra help during summer or winter months, I use it together with Jason&#x27;s Anti-Aging Tea Time cream, Jason&#x27;s 20% vitamin C creams or their Hyper C serum (is a booster in minimizing wrinkles and especially good at erasing sun and acne spots fast).</li>
      <li>BTW, I also recommend the St Ives Collagen and Elastin body lotion, that stuff makes cellulite less noticeable over time and is also a great moisturizer. :)</li>
      <li>Goes on and is absorbed into the skin and instantly improves skin texture, feels great</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels and know it is making a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>I tried this cream a while back when I was looking for a good night cream.</li>
      <li>so I tend to use it more at bedtime and on weekends when it does not matter as much if my face is a bit a shiny.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Taking all this into consideration, I really was pleased with the effectiveness of this moisturizer compared to the higher-priced creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I love this product and it is so reasonable on Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This cream spreads pretty easily.</li>
      <li>Right off the top of my head, I can name 4 or 5 other moisturizers that are superior to this one.</li>
      <li>See if it&#x27;s good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also pleasantly surprised to see the rather large amount of moisturizer inside of the jars.</li>
      <li>It goes on like pudding, but your skin quickly absorbs it.  </li>
      <li>IT GIVES YOU A FRESH LOOK WHEN YOU PUT IT ON AT NIGHT AND WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY GOOD FOR FACE AND NECK AND CHEST.</li>
      <li>I have loved this product for a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick enough to help with dry skin, perfect for sensitive skin types, yet light &amp; absorbs perfectly.</li>
      <li>This cream also makes me look younger, tighter , just a nice fresh face.</li>
      <li>This is the only moisturizer I can use for my sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or anything else it gets near, it is great!</li>
      <li>i love this face moisturizer because i have really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d estimate I still have about 2-3 weeks worth of uses</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been usig it for about an year and my skin feels really soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>Side bar always remember that what works for one person may or may not work for the other, but I so love this moisturizer. :)</li>
      <li>I have used it for many years and would use no other.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for carrying it and your quick shipment response.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin smooth &amp; soft, &amp; there&#x27;s no irritation (which I have had issues with when using most every brand of facial moisturizer).</li>
      <li>Test it out first, of course.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been about five moths since I opened my first jar</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my neck, after shaving, and it seems to sooth the skin pretty well.</li>
      <li>Most local stores no longer stock the product.</li>
      <li>per jar is pretty sizable.</li>
      <li>I realize the price of an item is not the most important characteristic, but I&#x27;ve learned that when it comes to Hygiene/Cosmetic products, the quality items do tend to have a fairly high double-digit price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love fancy skincare, but this is hands down my fave moisturizer, and the packages are huge.</li>
      <li>Great product for overall smoothness--very inexpensive compared to other products as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought 3 tubs the first time around, even though you don&#x27;t need much at all for a single application.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin soft and it absorbs quickly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used many different high end products, even though they were great, they were very expensive. My mom let me try this and I saw results within a few days. The lines starting to show under my eyes are disappearing.  The same for the lines on my forhead. I will continue to use this. Plus a little goes a long way. It is cheap enough to try and if you do not like it then you have not wasted your time or money.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this product for over a year. The price was great and the product was in perfect condition when I got it. It was here within a few days. Thanks</li>
    <li> nice moisturizer  helps dryness.  good under makeup, makes it easier to apply, even the powder makeups go on well.  large container.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer per the recommendation of a beauty blogger (maskcara.com) and could not be happier. It&#x27;s not to heavy and my skin seems to drink this moisturizer up. I bought the pack off Amazon because it doesn&#x27;t seem like St. Ives has this product in stores anymore (maybe discontinued?) But they really should keep selling it because it&#x27;s the best moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used for my face and I like it more than expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> They have changed the collagen elastin facial moisturizer! I was looking for the old version, which matches the photo posted for the product. Was sent the newer version. Disappointed - although shipper sent the product quickly...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m dissatisfied with the product, don&#x27;t notice any difference as promised by St. Ives, but the person sending it to me did nothing wrong.  Their service was great.  I&#x27;m just not happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives Collagen Elastin Moisturizer. I have used it for many years and would use no other. This product was sold in drugstores some years ago and discontinued.I used substitute products which were very disappointing. Fortunately, I rediscovered St. Ives Collagen Moisturizer on Amazon. I have gotten a number of relatives and friends hooked on this moisturizer.Thank you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for your skin! People can&#x27;t guess my age! I have used all kinds of products for much higher prices and not gotten such pretty skin. This is my go-to-can&#x27;t-live-without every day face and body cream. I apply it after I rinse my face or take a bath to lock in the moisture. It keeps your skin moist and supple and as well as minimizes wrinkles. If my skin needs extra help during summer or winter months, I use it together with Jason&#x27;s Anti-Aging Tea Time cream, Jason&#x27;s 20% vitamin C creams or their Hyper C serum (is a booster in minimizing wrinkles and especially good at erasing sun and acne spots fast). I get amazing results for a great price. I love St, Ives and Jason products!</li>
    <li> Very glad to find this product at a fair price and available. It works well without a greasy feeling. Most local stores no longer stock the product.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased within the last couple of months and have been using it at least 5 days per week.  My skin feels supple and moisturized.  In addition, my skin appearance has improved in regards to dryness and the appearance of wrinkles.  I am proned to oily skin so this makes my skin appear more oily so I tend to use it more at bedtime and on weekends when it does not matter as much if my face is a bit a shiny.  But I can see why Dr. Oz recommended this cream.</li>
    <li> This is really a good product.  Must be faithfully used to see results.  A very good moisturizer!  Don&#x27;t use a little.</li>
    <li> I can feel the difference in my skin. I will certainly purchase this product again. Hopefully I will be able to purchase it again through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and am having trouble finding it now. There are similar products, half the size, and over twice the price.  You will like this.</li>
    <li> I love fancy skincare, but this is hands down my fave moisturizer, and the packages are huge. Keeps my skin really glowy and moisturized, no breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 my skin is very sensitive. I&#x27;ve used this facecream since I was 23. It is the only cream that does not make my skin breakout. This cream also makes me look younger, tighter , just a nice fresh face. They stopped selling it in any stores where I live so I stopped using it for about 6 months. My face broke out and my skin looked tired and dry. Thank goodness I found this on amazon. It&#x27;s not as cheap as the store was but still a great price. This cream is the best . Use it on your body also. It makes you look and feel years younger.</li>
    <li> I truly love St. Ives Collagen Elastin Moisturizer.  Have been using it for years - it is so light and makes my skin look and feel great!</li>
    <li> I love this product and it is so reasonable on Amazon. I personally like that it absorbs into my skin almost instantly. I get a lot of compliments on my skin at the age of 60. I will always buy this product.</li>
    <li> It is too cheap and trully moisturize your skin. If you suffer from dry skin this is your product. It is a light cream.</li>
    <li> I received my purchase in 2 days via &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; and oh my  goodness this moisturizer is awesome!!!  Seriously it is !!  Listen I had a really bad reaction to some cologne that got on my skin from a simple hug.  Well it left a very bad rash on my neck and I decided that well if this moisturizer has collagen it&#x27;s got to heal this rash and guess what?  You got it.  After a week there was no sign of a rash on my neck. With that being said I&#x27;m ordering my second batch because It&#x27;s awesome !!  Side bar always remember that what works for one person may or may not work for the other, but I so love this moisturizer. :)</li>
    <li> I can afford an expensive moisturizer, but I doubt I would like it as much as I like this product.It is light but makes my skin feel really great. I also use it on my hands. I get great results.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has made my face smoother and softer.  I love the way it feels and know it is making a positive difference in my skin.  Have always loved St. Ives products but I can&#x27;t ever find what I need in local stores anymore so have to order online or use other products that are much more expensive and don&#x27;t work as well for me. Wish St. Ives would have their products in local stores again.</li>
    <li> HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS SINCE I WAS 16  IT GIVES YOU A FRESH LOOK WHEN YOU PUT IT ON AT NIGHT AND WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY GOOD FOR FACE AND NECK AND CHEST. SOMETIMES I USE IT AT NIGHT WHEN I FEEL SLEEPY BUT I DON&#x27;T WANT TO SLEEP I PUT A LITTLE UNDER MY EYES AND IT FOR SOME REASON MAKES ME FEEL MORE AWAKE IT TINGLES A LITTLE AND I CAN STAY UP 2 HRS LONGER LOL ALSO I NOTICED THE PRICE FROM 2.99 TO NOW AT MOST 9.00 THE DESIGN HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS. I MISS IT. LOL</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple years. It is a light moisturizer that does not leave you feeling greasy. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Each jar last me two to three times longer than the more expensive brands at a fraction of the cost. The only reason that I gave it four stars is that it does not have sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Great product for overall smoothness--very inexpensive compared to other products as well. I bought it in build! My son also likes it.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream a while back when I was looking for a good night cream. I liked the light consistency and that it smelled lovely, but it made my skin too oily. I gave it to my mother, who fell in love with it and now uses it as a night cream (and her skin looks fantastic). The definite upside to this cream, however, is that it is pretty cheap despite its size and lasts a long time depending upon how much you use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other face creams.. They either burn or leave my face greasy. St Ives Timeless is the only face cream I use, now. It&#x27;s more than a face cream to me --  I had a serious dry patch on my forearm that wouldn&#x27;t go away (too much leaning on the left arm at the job). Regular lotions would not heal it up, so when I put Timeless on my face, I would rub some on my forearm, too. I noticed a change within a couple of days... I&#x27;ve yet to find anything better... This product sells out fast at the local walmart.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cream I&#x27;ve used ever, the results are incredible, I love it and I will stick with it!</li>
    <li> One of the best product! No need to spend a fortune to get the same results as a higher cost product.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because a well-known talk show host said she uses it and that&lt;br /&gt;it is great for her skin.  Perhaps I purchased the wrong St. Ives, but the product I&lt;br /&gt;purchased, left my skin dry.  Now, I&#x27;m trying to find something else for which I can use these two large jars of St. Ives Colleagen Elastin Face Moisturizer Timeless Skin.</li>
    <li> This could be a tad more moisturizing for my liking but I have very dry sensitive skin. I gave one tub to my sister and she loves it. For the price, its pretty good.</li>
    <li> This moisture cream is very hard to find in my area and I was glad to find it in a three-pack. I&#x27;ve used it for many years and it&#x27;s the only moisture cream for me. It arrived fast and well packaged. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought it on this site and will do so again!</li>
    <li> This does improve the look of your skin and reduce fine lines.  I use it 2x a day, when I arise and when I go to bed.  It goes on like pudding, but your skin quickly absorbs it.  I wait 20 minutes and then use Alpha Hydrox 10% glycolic lotion.  It&#x27;s been 2.5 years, and my skin looks 10 years younger from both of these products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Goes on and is absorbed into the skin and instantly improves skin texture, feels great I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  My skin is very dry and this face cream is very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years and it is fabulous.  You can buy it for $6 at the drugstore and it is just perfect.  It leaves your skin soft and it absorbs quickly.  I use it to take off makeup, as a moisturizing mask, and as a cream.  It is definatetly something you should try.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin and Dr. Oz recommended this moisturizer which is not too expensive but will work wonder for your face, AND IT DID!!! I just ordered 3 jars of it and just for few weeks i noticed how it made my skin hydrated and supple and just glowing! :)</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has become my all-time favorite! It&#x27;s thick enough to help with dry skin, perfect for sensitive skin types, yet light &amp; absorbs perfectly. I wear it day &amp; night, alone or under foundation. It gives my skin a fresh, \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;, healthy appearance. I&#x27;m glad I bought 3 tubs the first time around, even though you don&#x27;t need much at all for a single application. It makes your skin smooth &amp; soft, &amp; there&#x27;s no irritation (which I have had issues with when using most every brand of facial moisturizer). I hope they keep this affordable product on the market well into my senior years! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I can use for my sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or anything else it gets near, it is great!</li>
    <li> love the texture and price but do not like the slightly heavy fragrance. not good for my face. just using it on my hands and el bows and knees.  good luck!</li>
    <li> I have loved this product for a long time. It smells great, goes on smooth, without being greasy. It is the ONLY moisturizer I have ever used!</li>
    <li> By no means is this the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Right off the top of my head, I can name 4 or 5 other moisturizers that are superior to this one. However, all of those are about 10x more expensive. I realize the price of an item is not the most important characteristic, but I&#x27;ve learned that when it comes to Hygiene/Cosmetic products, the quality items do tend to have a fairly high double-digit price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking all this into consideration, I really was pleased with the effectiveness of this moisturizer compared to the higher-priced creams I&#x27;ve used. It works well also on the neck, hands, feet, knees and elbows. I&#x27;ve used this on my neck, after shaving, and it seems to sooth the skin pretty well. The scent of the cream is pretty nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream spreads pretty easily. You don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your entire face. I simply dip my index and middle fingers about half an inch into the cream and scoop some out, dab it all over my face and then spread it with both hands. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, so even if you have oily skin, you should be able to use this. Test it out first, of course. See if it&#x27;s good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also pleasantly surprised to see the rather large amount of moisturizer inside of the jars. 10 oz. per jar is pretty sizable. This should last you a long time. It&#x27;s been about five moths since I opened my first jar and I&#x27;d estimate I still have about 2-3 weeks worth of uses left. Even if you use twice a day, as the instructions suggest, just two jars should last about an entire year. Very good value, if you ask me.</li>
    <li> This product feels so good and makes my wife look so good.  She wishes she had found this product years ago.</li>
    <li> DISAPPOINTED!!THIS PRODUCT MAKES MY FACE RASH AND ITYCY. I gave it to my mom who also got kind of allergy. Not suitable for us.:(</li>
    <li> how much I love this cream.It&#x27;s really light, not sticky and it smells amazing.My whole family loves it. I&#x27;m in my twenties and I&#x27;m glad I found something so wonderful already.I&#x27;ve been usig it for about an year and my skin feels really soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> i love this face moisturizer because i have really sensitive skin but this one does work on my skin, i do not get rash or anything</li>
    <li> I was soooo happy to find my favorite moisturizer on Amazon! My local stores stopped carrying it and I was at a loss to what to do. I have been using this product for over 25 years and simply love it. I took a chance and checked on amazon. Great price so I ordered the 3 pack. Thank you so much for carrying it and your quick shipment response. I will always check on your site in the future. Amazon is great :)</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer!!! I used to use Aveeno and the Garnier gel moisturizers.... this one beats those to town and back! This stuff STAYS on throughout the day instead of the cold weather sucking it off your skin. My skin is not dry at all anymore and is very soft, smooth and moisturized. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer. BTW, I also recommend the St Ives Collagen and Elastin body lotion, that stuff makes cellulite less noticeable over time and is also a great moisturizer. :)</li>
    <li> Feels comforting and soothing on my sensitive skin. No offensive scent at all. It does not seem to cause breakouts. Plus you can certainly not beat the price.</li>
