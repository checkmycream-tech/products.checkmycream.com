      <li>Burt’s Bees makes good products of all types, but I think this is one of their most useful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It reminds me of some kind of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product as a gift through BzzAgent and was asked to share my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>It hydrates nicely and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me</li>
      <li>A must try if your a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan and a nice addition to their line.</li>

      <li>Smells nice</li>
      <li>: The Body Shop Nutriganics Softening Cleansing Gel and DHC Cleansing oil, happily this Burt&#x27;s Bees (BB) product is significantly cheaper, something I appreciate.</li>
      <li>BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Cream Cleanser offered a very pleasant experience.  </li>
      <li>I am very glad she did, we love the products and will continue to use them.</li>

      <li>Okay, I don&#x27;t know how to rate this because I decided to read up on Clary sage and found that it should not be used during pregnancy and that it could be a skin  irritant.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is by far the best cleanser for my combination skin i&#x27;ve tried to date. I&#x27;ve used department store face cleaners like lancome and drug store cleaners like Clean and Clear but this is the best. I can&#x27;t find it at my local stores, although I saw it at Target once for 7 dollars for a single bottle. I&#x27;m happy I can get this on amazon! The smell of the cleaner is excellent and the texture is creamy and smooth like being at a spa.</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin. It is a pretty mild cleanser and you may need a make up remover before you use it.</li>
    <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs. I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
    <li> The other drugstore cream cleanser I have tried is Yes! To Carrots (fragrance-free). I really don&#x27;t recommend their fragranced one. It is very overpowering. The fragrance-free one I found that one decent enough. Yes! To Carrots had more of a smooth, thick, lotion-like texture. It did what it needed to and I actually wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to using it again. The problem is, between Target, Rite Aid, and Amazon, it ranges between fluctuates $8-$11 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Burt&#x27;s Bees one has a very light, lemon scent that is actually really pleasant and makes this product more enjoyable to use. I find the product also very creamy, but a tad bit more airy, like a mousse. Like the other product, it does what what it needs to and I&#x27;m happy with it. The price is more reasonable, and I really think the mousse texture and pleasant lemon has got me (as well as the price).</li>
    <li> This feels great going on and my skin feels soft after it is washed off.</li>
    <li> It hydrates nicely and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but it burns my face. It doesn&#x27;t make me rashy or anything but it&#x27;s definitely not pleasant.</li>
    <li> Last year I was treated for Lyme disease with very strong antibiotics, and afterwards I had a persistent problem with folliculitis (in the form of tiny whiteheads) all over my face, especially near my hairline. It looked like I had a terrible rash all over my face. My doctor told me that the antibiotics had likely killed off some benign bacteria that kept the folliculitis bacteria in check. I was able to manage the folliculitis by applying a mixture of 50% white vinegar, 50% water, and sea salt to my face once a day-- this basically inhibits bacterial growth of all types. However, if I stopped applying this solution for a few days, the folliculitis would come right back, starting at my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I saw this Burts Bees product with probiotic properties, and within a few days of using this product I was able to stop using the vinegar/salt solution completely. My folliculitis is totally gone. Also, my skin feels good after using this product, not dry and awful (PS: Neutrogena cream cleansers all suck). I am 27 and don&#x27;t have major acne problems, so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but I do highly recommend this for anyone struggling with folliculitis.</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash and it smells great. I just wish I could find it for this price at the stores.</li>
    <li> Bought for pre-teen...love this product. Smells great skin feels soft.</li>
    <li> PERFECT! this is exactly what i have been looking for. i just recently gave birth to my daughter, and my face has been so dry ever since. i have never had dry skin before so i had no idea what kind of cleanser to use on my face. i tried everything! this removes my make up so well and really does leave my skin feeling very moiusturized! i now want to buy all of the burt&#x27;s bees facial products. i am already on my 2nd bottle and will continue to buy more :)</li>
    <li> This was a big help to my very very dry skin</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and will keep buying their products, just not this one.  It neither hydrated, nor cleaned particularly well.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, and have been looking for a moisturizing cleanser for, well, my whole life.  This was no better than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love it, any of Burts Bees cleansing products are great</li>
    <li> I prefer the cotton extract, but this one still smells good.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I love the creamy consistency. And it works great with the intense night moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few years now. Using it on a consistent basis has helped my skin clear up, and I have not had any outbreaks. This works wonderfully even in winter, and my skin does not feel taut after washing - something really hard to find in a facial cleanser. I have tried various brands, including high end cleansers, and none have measured up to this!</li>
    <li> use this daily and I love that it does not dry out my skin....and best of all, it is natural!</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a box of free samples that Amazon was giving away to expectant mothers. Ironic as one of the ingredients (Clary sage) is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Once I could use it, I tried it for several days. I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell. Reminded me of cheap hotel lotion. However, the real reason I threw away the sample is it doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans very well. It doesn&#x27;t lather, just sorta smears. It leaves a residue behind that I couldn&#x27;t rinse away. Some people may like this product but I sure won&#x27;t be buying it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has terrible excema. Have tried about a zillion different persciption meds without much help at all. Stumbled upon this wonderful product and am more than pleased. Cleared up her excema and then some! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees products for 10 years and I am also please with the result their products gives.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser, it doesn&#x27;t leave skin&lt;br /&gt;taunt, red, or dry.&lt;br /&gt;In the past other cream cleasners&lt;br /&gt;left a residue on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This Hydration Creme Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;is perfect for dry, or aging&lt;br /&gt;skin. It&#x27;s very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;I Love it!! No breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give it an ample&lt;br /&gt;trial period before I introduced&lt;br /&gt;the Intensive Night Creme.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a chemical&lt;br /&gt;smell but a natural one that&lt;br /&gt;I believe most everyone&lt;br /&gt;would enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that&lt;br /&gt;it came in a bigger&lt;br /&gt;bottle but you don&#x27;t need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;For removing make-up I recommend&lt;br /&gt;a double cleanse, it is good&lt;br /&gt;for removing eye makeup as well..&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!!!</li>
    <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t know how to rate this because I decided to read up on Clary sage and found that it should not be used during pregnancy and that it could be a skin  irritant. After destroying my skin by washing it with Avalon Vitamin Cleaner, I needed something that was hydrating since my skin was so dry it  was flaking from the Avalon crap. I try to buy organic products but it always seems there is something wrong with all of them, questionable ingredients that is. Just because it is labeled organic doesn&#x27;t mean its good for you. This helped hydrate my skin but now I am wondering about the Clary sage. Please look it up and read for yourself.</li>
    <li> Can smell the sage in the product! Makes my face look and feel moister</li>
    <li> Smells great, takes off make up, and gentle on skin.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!  I tend to get eczema around my eyes in the winter and also dry skin around my nose - this product completely eliminated this.  In addition, there is no need for a separate makeup remover for mascara with this product - it goes on like a heavy cream but rinses all makeup and oils away without leaving skin feeling greasy.  I have now gotten my family hooked on it - works well on menopausal skin as well as teenage skin.  And, smells great.</li>
    <li> Perhaps the first thing you’re going to notice about this formula is its pleasant scent. This is quite possibly the nicest smelling cleanser I’ve come across. The cleanser itself is very cool to the touch and feels like it really is deeply cleansing the skin as you’re massaging it about your face. This also works well on the neck area. I’ve used this right after shaving on several occasions and it does a good job of moisturizing and soothing my freshly shaven face.&lt;br /&gt;There are several other cleansers on the market that also claim to moisturize your face, in addition to cleansing. In my experience, they usually do not. This one, however, does! Burt’s Bees makes good products of all types, but I think this is one of their most useful.&lt;br /&gt;I think it’s important to also take notice of the price here on Amazon. I have seen this very item at several retail stores and none of them can match this price. As I type this, the price on Amazon is $9.47. Every other store I’ve been to sells this cleanser for at least $15 for the very same product. I think you’re getting a good value by purchasing this online instead of in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> This is some of the best Burt&#x27;s cleanser I have ever used, and I have used many of them.  It leaves my face feeling smooth and soft, and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since using it.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> There are small particles in it.Is water.my face very moist after used it.I Will buy again next time.I love it so much.</li>
    <li> Works good enough to take my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Also doesn&#x27;t give me any acne.</li>
    <li> I really like that this didn&#x27;t lather and the smell is pleasant. It does however, specifically say that it removes make up, but I used it with my clairasonic and the brush head had to be washed again to get the make up off the bristles and a swipe of cotton soaked with witchazel showed that there were more then traces of my make up still in play. If you have to wash repeatedly to get your make up off it kind of defeats the purpose of a gentle moisturizing cleanser. I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I normally have to lather my face with lotion after washing it because my skin soaks it up.  With the BB&#x27;s Hydration cleanser, I use less lotion and at the end of the day my face still looks nice and not oily, plus it does not clog my pores.</li>
    <li> This cream cleanser is one of the few products that won&#x27;t make my skin break out and look like a teenager all over again.  It says it helps retain moisture, and when I use it in the shower, my face doesn&#x27;t feel stripped of oils like other cleansers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only mistake is not buying the moisturizer that is paired with this cleanser - I know it would have made a huge difference in my skin when my brother got married!</li>
    <li> I suffer from mild to moderate acne, and after from cleanser to cleanser containing all kinds of acne fighting chemicals, I finally decided that maybe being harsh to my skin wasn&#x27;t a good idea. At least, not with a daily cleanser. I was shopping in Duane Reade when this cleanser caught my eye. I&#x27;ve never really had a good experience with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s for fighting acne, but I had heard good things about them, and since this cleanser didn&#x27;t really advertise any acne-fighting properties, I decided it would be mild enough for me to try. Best decision ~10$ I&#x27;ve ever spent. Turns out all the harsh cleansers I had been using in the past just dried my skin out horribly, causing my skin to produce more oil to try and fight it. This cleanser keeps my skin hydrated enough that I can afford to use some harsher chemical peels on my skin without having to worry about dryness. It really works to keep my skin moisturized! I love the smell, and it&#x27;s pretty cheap for what it doesâ€”one tube lasts me about 6 months of using it twice daily. Definitely recommend for anyone of all skin typesâ€”being gentle with your skin can never be a bad thing!</li>
    <li> This is the second line of Burt&#x27;s Bees cleansers I&#x27;ve tried and it works pretty well. The cleanser isn&#x27;t too thick, it smells nice and rinses off easily. Natural cleansers don&#x27;t always smell that great in my opinion but this has a nice scent that isnt too over whelming. A must try if your a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan and a nice addition to their line.</li>
    <li> I like that it was exaclty as described.it has agreat smell and makes my skin feel nice and soft.Im very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I use almost the entire Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration skin care line, and this cleanser is a life saver. I&#x27;ve had to use a lot less moisturizer and other products thanks to the hydration it&#x27;s added to my skin. I have two bottles just in case I run out! I would also recommend the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin cleanser and skin care line. Heck, I&#x27;d recommend almost every product from Burt&#x27;s Bees because I&#x27;ve loved everything from their blemish treatment, to chapstick, to skin care. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
    <li> I gave this a try as a daily cleanser at night but it doesn&#x27;t work and I still have dirt in my skin afterwards so now I&#x27;m just using it after the gym but that&#x27;s it. The good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin at all.</li>
    <li> Works great and is nice on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My face stays dry most of the time. This cleanser hydrates my face so well that my face seems moist &amp; bright! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> cream is a great cleanses my red skin. it is used every day before going to bed, there is nothing better</li>
    <li> I have always liked Burts Bees products and took a chance on this one.  I used to use Noxzema exclusively for my facial cleanser, but this one seems to clean better and more thoroughly.  It did break out my face for the first two months, but I felt it was bringing out  impurities from my skin.  I have been using it for 6 months now and my face feels cleaner and more pores look much cleaner.  I no longer have any black pores.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> This left my face feeling soft and refreshed.  It has a tinglyness to it which is nice.  It is a thin lotion like consistency which makes me feel like I have to use more than usual to clean my whole face/neck.  It is not for removing eye make up but I found that it did a great job unlike some other cleansers.  I used this in combination with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration day lotion, and my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> I bought for a first time, Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration cream cleanser and I am very satisfied with the results. The skin is smooth and feels clean, after washing the face with this cream, twice daily. I love Burt&#x27;s products so, when I saw on Amazon store the cleanser I decided to try it and I&#x27;ll order it again. I hope the price won&#x27;t go up soon.</li>
    <li> I thought this wld be rlly good because of how natural it sounds and all the ingredients but after using it just once ALL I was left with is that my face feels CHALK dry and very gritty with a film.It sucks save your money.My skin feels so gross!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mild cleanser that I could use for a quick and gentle wash. It seemed like an ok cleanser until I rinsed it off, and then I was left with a gross film on my face. Had to use another cleanser to make my face feel clean.</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser in the morning and before bed time with the suggested moisturizers.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and washes off easily. Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin and love this cleanser because it cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
    <li> Its amazing! Smells good, does NOT dry out my skin like other cleansers do. It is cream based, which is what I needed for my dry skin. Does not make my skin oily or dry. Just perfect. One drop is enough to clear and clean my face after I come home from work. Will order again to replenish!</li>
    <li> Very like this little bee, brought beauty to our family. Although there is no bubble.</li>
    <li> This face wash works great! It doesn&#x27;t overly dry your skin but cleans it just as well as the pricer ones. I love this and have been using it for over 3 years. I recommended it to over a dozen of my friends and family. They all love it!</li>
    <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to use lotions or creams after I clean my face with this.</li>
    <li> I typically enjoy Burt&#x27;s Bees face washes, shampoos, and body washes buuuut I felt like this one left a thin layer of something on my face. Every time I use it, I feel like I need to rewash my face. I&#x27;m going to continue using up the entire bottle. However, what I have started doing after I wash my face with this is use their garden tomato toner right after. I feel like this helps me lose that thin film after effect. Smells nice and I really like that its all natural.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and have been using it for about one week now. I must say I really like this facial cleanser. This is almost like using a lotion for a cleanser. But I really like that aspect of this Burt&#x27;s Bees product. I have fairly dry skin so having a facial cleanser that does not lather really makes my skin feel soft, clean and moisturized. The smell of this facial cleanser is so incredible. The product has several different citrus based essential oils which give it a delicious clean scent. Because this product is a non-lathering cleanser I have found that this works best with a wash cloth. If you have dry sensitive skin I think that this product will really impress you. However if you are prone to breakouts because you are sensitive to products with oil then I suggest you pass on this one.</li>
    <li> Says it a cream, but not really what I expected, have to use water, and&lt;br /&gt;wash off with towel my face it dryer.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars.  Burt&#x27;s Bees IHCC is awesome and performs as it states.  I have been using it for years &amp; it cleanses great &amp; leaves my skin moist &amp; not weighed down.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Firstly, let me say that I got this product at no cost from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Cream Cleanser offered a very pleasant experience.  It is a rich cream that did not strip my skin of its moisture.  It did not produce any foam, which I do not mind; however, I would not recommend it for someone who likes a lot of lather.  It does not remove all of my makeup, but I usually use a separate makeup remover before I cleanse because I use a lot of makeup.  Overall, I would give this product a positive review.  The only thing I found lacking was its inability to remove all of my makeup, but as mentioned before, to expect it to remove all of my makeup without lather or stripping would be unrealistic.  I give BURT&#x27;S BEES® INTENSE HYDRATION Cream Cleanser four and a half stars.  ***UPDATE*** This product did remove my everyday makeup.  Glitter and eyelash glue is a little more tricky!</li>
    <li> I love this face cleanser and the price is so much cheaper than it is in stores.  My dry, sensitive skin loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> As with many things, I decided to Google  what I was looking for and when I input &amp;#34;best moisturizing facial cleanser&amp;#34;, this product was one that came up in top 10 reviews. After reading the reviews on Amazon, i decided to give it a try. i received it today and was first impressed with the smell. i was expecting it to be unpleasant as some &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products are, but this wasn&#x27;t the case. i didn&#x27;t notice a sage smell either, it was a refreshing slight lemon smell, but nothing overpowering. i have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin either. it was very creamy, went on very easily and removed all of my makeup. my skin gets very dry in the winter so i was looking for a moisturizing cleanser and this left my face feeling soft, smooth and clean without feeling greasy. i fell in love right away and just had to leave a review! This is a product that i would put on subscribe and save if available. Because of the quality of this product, i am going to check out their facial moisturizers.  i was using the Olay Thermal Mini-Peel Scrub, but this is 10 times better. Although this does not exfoliate, it seems to leave my skin glowing and feeling so much better. i will keep the olay for a once a week exfoliator instead of using every night as i was. Now i am on a mission for the perfect moisturizer for dry skin that will work for under eyes as well as the rest of my face that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune! i just purchased organic jojoba oil and use that for under my eyes as well as for split ends, dry hands/feet/ but i want a real facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t do better than Burt&#x27;s Bees. It&#x27;s quality and doesn&#x27;t contain anything that will hurt your skin. The price, even with shipping, was so good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what Bzzz is and I&#x27;ve never heard of it so I&#x27;m not a part of that campaign.  I bought a sample size at Rite Aid to try it because I love most of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  I LOVE this cleanser, I&#x27;ve been using it about a week.  It feels thick and silky and it feels like it will leave a greasy residue once you rinse it off but as far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this I was using Cetaphil but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t cleanse my face thoroughly.  I don&#x27;t use a separate makeup remover so what I do with the Burt&#x27;s Bees is I cleanse my face and wipe it off with cotton balls to remove my foundation then I cleanse my face again with it this time rinsing it off with water so basically I am cleansing with it twice.  But I only do that when I wear foundation, otherwise, I just wash it off with water and I love the way it feels!  I bought the full size yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin, especially in the winter so I need something that won&#x27;t dry me out, I want something to hydrate me.  I also bought the Burt&#x27;s Bees day lotion travel size and so far I love that too!  I&#x27;m dying to try the night cream but it&#x27;s too expensive for me right now.</li>
    <li> I am a true fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and am becoming especially fond of the &amp;#34;Intense Hydration&amp;#34; line of products; I just started using the cleanser today and am a big fan with only one cleansing!</li>
    <li> Creamy with a light, citrusy scent. I wish it cleaned a bit better, sometimes my face still feels a bit dirty, but as a general cleanser it works fine :)</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products work well for me usually, and this one is no exception.  I use this cleanser with my sonicare facial brush cleaner.  Makes a great combo!  Great value for the price, I will order again.</li>
    <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like other cleansers but it isn&#x27;t nearly as hydrating as I was hoping. Plus after just a couple days of using it, I broke out like crazy. Definitely not the product for me. If you&#x27;re looking for a hydrating cleanser, I highly recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange Essence.</li>
    <li> It keeps my skin clear and free of zits without drying it out.  My husband doesn&#x27;t like the tingle, but I personally do.</li>
    <li> Before this I was using Burt&#x27;s bees orange face wash. I&#x27;d recommend that product also but this one is easier to rinse off. This is a cream but not a heavy cream. It&#x27;s actually quite light but does not leave my skin feeling stripped of moisture. Follow with Burt&#x27;s Bees facial moisturizer and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Love this! Good clean and half the cost of local store prices. Nice smell, too. Even though I have oily skin that dries out a bit in the winter; this helps.</li>
    <li> I am on my second tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees Cream Cleanser.  This has become my favorite way to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like wearing make-up but dislike the process of removing it. Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; cream cleanser actually makes the process of removing make-up pleasant. I wet the face, then apply the cleaner cream to my face with my finger tips. I lightly massage it into my skin and then wipe my face with a warm wash cloth. The cleanser does not foam just spreads evenly over my skin. It has a very light fresh scent. I have used several Burt&#x27;s Bees product, and the cleanser has the lightest scent of them all. Once you remove the cleanser cream, you don&#x27;t smell it on your skin. My skin feels soft and clean. Also my skin feels softer than normal, so it cleanses and moisturizes at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description says it is a natural scent of Clary Sage. It does not smell like a herb sage I am familiar with, it reminds me more of a cucumber plus clover scent. I don&#x27;t like strong scents and I did not find Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; heavy or overpowering, it is light \\&quot;background\\&quot; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging of Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; cream cleanser. I am attaching a photo collage under customer photos for reference. The cleanser comes in a tube with a large cap so you store the tube upside down standing on the cap.  The gravity keeps the cream at the opening and it is easy to get out even when there is just a little bit left. I also was impressed that the new tube came sealed with foil, so you are guaranteed to have fresh and wet cream when you open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> This hydrates well! I have dry winter skin and wanted something that made a noticeable difference.  This does the trick! I pair it with the Intense Hydration Day Lotion and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  I usually find that these products do NOT do what they advertise - this does.  Also has a nice light smell, a large bottle (a little goes a long way) and a reasonable price.  Has not caused greasiness or any breakouts at all.</li>
    <li> I have always used a Bath and Body Works shower gel to take off my makeup since I was about 16 and am now 38.  The scent I use has been discontinued and the others I have tried on my face burn my eyes.  It was time for me to find something else that was &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; that was safe to take off my makeup.  This doesn&#x27;t lather like a soap, but it&#x27;s not exactly like a cream.  It&#x27;s somewhere in-between, and it works well.  It takes off my mascara and eye liner with just a little work and scrubbing.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or skin problems as I have switched to using this, and I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this line by Burts Bees. I use the mask, the night cream, the cream cleanser, and the day lotion. All are wonderful at moisturizing my dry skin. I love the light herbal scent.</li>
    <li> Does a good job cleaning my face. Gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Container&#x27;s terrible though. When I couldn&#x27;t squeeze out any more, I cut it open and found quite a bit left. Enough to wash my face for another week and half.</li>
    <li> Removes dirt, oil and make-up all while hydrating my skin....yes please! It has a strong citrus scent. If you love the smell of fresh squeezed oranges you’ll love this cleanser because that’s mostly what it smells like with some of that Clary Sage scent added to the mix. Personally, I love how this stuff smells!  I have extremely dry skin living here in the desert so this stuff is a God send for me.  It is a non-foaming cleanser with a thin, lotion-like consistency.  If you wear a lot of make-up I have to warn you that although it says it removes makeup I have had mascara left under my eyes even after cleansing with it. But that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me, as I love it so much I can look past that and just remove my makeup first with a facial wipe or makeup remover and then follow up with the Burt’s Bees cleanser.</li>
    <li> Nice and mild.  Nice fresh scent. Reasonable price. Quality ingredients. Left my skin hydrated, but not greasy.  Worked wonderfully with my clarisonic. But the issue was that the last quarter to a third was almost impossible to express from the tube.  I wish they would consider a plastic jar  or other container.</li>
    <li> For me, it is gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin much, and hasn&#x27;t cause any problem for my skin. So it is not a bad purchase at all. I am not sure I like the smell though. It reminds me of some kind of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by this product because it was very effective.  I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like strong scents but had no issues with this product which cleaned without drying my face.  The scent is refreshing and I am delighted that even a small amount is very effective.  I had the good fortune of qualifying to participate in a Bzz campaign that provided me with the Intense Hydration Night Cream, Treatment Mask and Cream Cleanser and am really pleased to have been introduced to this great product.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser, but when I went to pick it up from a store, they were out, so I decided to try this instead.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that the fragrance is pretty strong, and if you are used to their Sensitive Facial Cleanser, this might be pretty bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find that smell \\&quot;natural\\&quot; either, unlike some products that uses natural oil to add fragrance. It smells very  artificial and I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I spent closed to $10 so I decided to give it a try- but I was not a fan of the texture and the feel of my face after the use. Then I first noticed the little bumps on my forehead after 1week. I didn&#x27;t think too much of it first, but it got REALLY bad after 2 weeks. I have stopped using the product after 2 weeks of use, and it took another 10 days for all the zits to go away. I am not particularly too sensitive to facial products (I was using the sensitive Facial Cleanser just because I liked it, not because that was the only kind I can use on my face) , but I was definitely sensitive to this particular product.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 30s and I usually have pretty healthy skin so this was a nightmare! I am not entirely sure if it was connected to this face wash, but about the same time I started breaking out, same thing was happening to my neck... This has never happened to me before, and I didn&#x27;t change any other routine in my life (food, sleep pattern, exercise, other facial/body care products). Even thought my face has been cleared I continue to have a problem with my now rash-looking zits on my neck to the point where I am thinking to seek the medical help from dermatologist...&lt;br /&gt;(I will come back and edit this post if my breakout had nothing to do with switching to this product, just to be fair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that every individual reacts to products in different ways so I wouldn&#x27;t condemn this product, but it was absolutely a disaster for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, although Burt&#x27;s Bees carries a brand name that suggests natural formula, it would be impossible to supply such high volume of \\&quot;high-quality natural ingredients\\&quot; to its current customers (just Walmart, Target and major drug stores themselves sell HUGE amount of their products), so one has to assume that their products cannot be the same as the good ol&#x27; natural brand that started in a small city once upon a time.</li>
    <li> About two years ago during a pregnancy, I started dealing with very dry skin. I tried product after product and asked two doctors about it. They gave me random samples but nothing seemed to hydrate my skin. FINALLY I have found a system that works! I love it!! I have always loved the Burt&#x27;s Bees line and this just adds to the list of things that I love!! My fine lines are plumped up and less noticeable and the flakes are almost non-existent now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately I fell in love with the cleanser. The smell woke up my senses and it went on very smoothly. I like that it is rich and hydrating, yet washes off cleanly without a greasy film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using the whole system together to combat dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product as a gift through BzzAgent and was asked to share my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have tried different types of face washes and this is my new hg! Cleans thoroughly without drying and no breakouts on my sometimes sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser! I have always had problems with acne and within 2 weeks my face is clear. Pleasant fragrence and clean feeling. Does not dry out my face either.</li>
    <li> Nice price, thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry AND combo skin (as some combo skin is actually caused by overproduction of oil from over-drying skin).</li>
    <li> I usually like Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products, but I just have to say that this face wash reminds me of motel soap--the way it smells and feels.  It gets the job done but I think it is over priced and it is NOT hydrating at all.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good face wash that won&#x27;t dry out my skin - been using a basic apricot scrub forever and it started drying out my skin pretty bad. This has been amazing, been using it for about 4 months now. I highly recommend this! Smells great as well : )</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for my skin, to be fair I was trying this to replace a creamy cleanser that I love, but has been discontinued. My skin felt drier and not as clean with this, but maybe for someone that is not use to a creamy hydrating cleanser it would be ok. I tried it for 2 days and gave the remainder away.</li>
    <li> It has sodium benzoate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently testing this product through bzzagent. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and so far, I&#x27;m thrilled. It&#x27;s super silky and I massage it into my face and neck. It removes the make up and cleanses well. I love the scent, although it may be a little much to scent sensitive folks. It smells like a citrus/sage mix and reminds me of the spa. I&#x27;ve had an improvement in hydration of the skin, especially since its fall and my skin always dries out during this season. I&#x27;m very impressed so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still figuring out how to properly use this product. When I use this, it feels like my face isn&#x27;t completely cleansed (even when I just wake up in the morning with a fresh makeup-less face), but maybe it is because I just use my fingers. So I&#x27;m gonna try to use a washcloth as some others have suggested and see if it gets deeper into my pores. But my skin does feel very silky soft and hydrated, so four stars for that, I&#x27;m gonna try to use some different methods to get the best results. By the way, it smells really good. I&#x27;m new to cream cleansers so if you know any good tricks let me know. Before, I just used St Ives (which would cleanse greatly, but dry out my skin), then follow with face lotion.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin very soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> Love it! Ok, the real test will be this winter... but, so far, I&#x27;ve gone through a tube of this and liked it. I tend to have drier skin... sometimes oily in t-zone, occasional blemish here and there... in my 30&#x27;s, so wanting clear skin but also trying to hydrate it as much as I can. This stuff seems good for my needs. I&#x27;ve repurchased and will reassess if my skin gets flaky this winter... but the fact that I&#x27;m not having issues right now... I&#x27;m guessing its not drying, so will be looking at my moisturizers first if I do have issues! I&#x27;ve bought another tube. I used to use a nuetrogena face wash for wrinkles and blemishes... I feel like this has better ingredients.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I feel like an expert on cleansers for dry skin, I have tried them all! This cream cleanser has delivered wonderful results for a good price- the bottle/tube is large and lasts a decent while. I would compare this favorably with other go-to dry skin cleansers I use: The Body Shop Nutriganics Softening Cleansing Gel and DHC Cleansing oil, happily this Burt&#x27;s Bees (BB) product is significantly cheaper, something I appreciate. My routine is to dampen my face, massage in the BB cream cleanser and place a hot wet face cloth over my face and gently wipe of the cleanser, it leaves my skin baby soft with zero residue. This cleanser is free of parabens, something I look for. It does contain glycerin, which is fine for my skin (dry skin cleansers/oil cleansers with mineral oil make me break out). All in all, I&#x27;m a big fan of this product. It was an impulse buy at my local drug store and previously I&#x27;ve not paid much attention to BB products - I guess I feel my face product is working harder if it contains some &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; miracle ingredient (such as retinol, alpha hydroxy acid etc...) so natural products fly a little under my radar. I&#x27;m impressed enough with this product to look seriously at other BB products now.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! Would highly recommend especially if you have sensitivities to facial products!! I have dealt with acne and sensitive skin for more years than I care to count and have tried so many face products but this is by far on the top of my list!!</li>
    <li> Combine this with a natural sponge for scrubbing your face, and you&#x27;re set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dry patches of skin below my nose, and a dry patch on one side of my chin. After a week of scrubbing with the sponge and using this, the dry patches are completely gone. It&#x27;s amazing it&#x27;s like a miracle fix for my face.</li>
    <li> I will try this tomorrow if it is as good as the deep cleanser it will be great. I have now used this cleanser and I just love it, my skin feels soft and clean with out the tightness your skin feels with other products.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes skin and very soothing to use.  A bit pricey so will only continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available through subscribe &amp; save.  And the best thing about it, Burt&#x27;s Bees do not test their products on animals.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this cleanser. Doesn&#x27;t remove makeup well at all and seems to leave a film on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works so well and smells amazing. It even has helped my acne. I still have white head but my zips and blackheads are going away. I can&#x27;t wait to try more products.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser, as it is sensitive, gentle, and effective at removing dirt, oil, and makeup. The fragrance is pleasant. This does sting the eyes, which is a draw back, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long (but maybe I use too much).</li>
    <li> Great and natural face wash.</li>
    <li> LOVE BURT&#x27;S BEES. This cleanser was something I was looking for all my life (believe it or not), I suffered with acne as a teenager and could not find anything outside of a doctor to control my acne. Now as a middle aged adult I don&#x27;t have the acne as much but I have noticeable pores, and even if it&#x27;s not that bad I wanted something to keep them from looking even a little bit noticeable. When I wash with this cleanser I don&#x27;t notice the pores at all and my face looks much younger and softer. My makeup looks even goes on better when I wear it, (which is not everyday). My whole family are BURT&#x27;S BEES FANS after my daughter introduces the product to us. I am very glad she did, we love the products and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I love this!  Wonderful gentle cleanser!  Smells good too!</li>
