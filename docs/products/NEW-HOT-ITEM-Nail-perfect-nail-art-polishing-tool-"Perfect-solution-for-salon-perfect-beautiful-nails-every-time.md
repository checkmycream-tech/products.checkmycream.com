      <li>This is the best gift to myself ever!</li>
      <li>It do not appear to be the original product!!!!</li>
      <li>this is great no matter what stage you are at painting your nails.</li>
      <li>Good idea though.</li>
      <li>i even tried it to see if i could make it look nice.</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Yes for the most part it&#x27;s self explanatory</li>
      <li>This product was okay, it worked and it was convenient.</li>
      <li>I received this for Christmas from a friend who knows how much I love nail polish.</li>
      <li>I ended up getting nail polish over the top of the dial.  </li>
      <li>I used fingernail polish to remove most of the polish, however, I never could get all the stain stain off of it.  </li>
      <li>am giving it 3 stars because once you are able to master the technique, it does work.</li>
      <li>The plate you put on top of you</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is as easy as one would think.</li>
      <li>easy to put together, take apart and store.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>Fine product for a beginner.</li>
      <li>The kit is cheaply made in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Disks are warped and mislabeled, and it is cheaply made.</li>
      <li>None of the finger plates fit my fingers to paint.</li>
      <li>It is cheap looking when you get it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep still and is made of cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>Serves no purpose the plates are not shaped to fit the contours of a fingernail.  </li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t give a clean line on the edges.  </li>
      <li>The only good thing is the polish holder.</li>
      <li>but if u dont know how to paint ur nails is cool.</li>
      <li>Overall the concept is a good one</li>
      <li>It works, it is a good thick plastic, nice storage space for when you put it away.  </li>
      <li>The demonstrations and hype that a TV commercial gives you is always way better than you can do!  </li>
      <li>It seems like a good idea , but it is hard to find a slot that will fit onto your nail comfortably, still allowing some polish to get on your fingers.</li>
      <li>, I just dont paint my nails often enough to get really adept at using this.</li>
      <li>Even harder when doing your own nails.  </li>
      <li>i dont use this much!</li>
      <li>I find I get good results using a small brush and nail polish remover for clean-up.</li>
      <li>Junk - pure junk.</li>
      <li>I tried it for a month and was very unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>Takes some practice thanks barb</li>
      <li>This product came with no instructions - very flimsy - basically a piece of junk.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very flimsy.</li>
      <li>but there was a second &amp;#34;topper&amp;#34; and I wasn&#x27;t sure what that was even for, it doesn&#x27;t fit in the drawer provided and neither to the other &amp;#34;wheels&amp;#34; I just had to lay them on the table</li>
      <li>Fingers don&#x27;t fit the way I expected them to.</li>
      <li>Item is a little cheap like..</li>
      <li>I do recommend it for do it yourself and for your young girls.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>It is worth the money I spent for it.</li>
      <li>No mess at all.</li>
      <li>This product is cheaply made and very hard to keep still while polishing nails.</li>
      <li>Nails do not really fit into available slots so the mess is just as if I didn&#x27;t have a guide.</li>

    <li> Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She is a 10 yo little glamour diva and loves to do her nails and dress up. This item not as durable as it looked online and was even more difficult to use once I rece it. The only reason I gave  it 3 stars was it did arrive on time and it did have a kids size tray to use for her do her nails.</li>
    <li> Bought for my niece for Christmas. Did not hold up. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Found it to be highly disappointing.  Did not fit my fingers at all. I tried it for a month and was very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this product.  I thought it would save time when doing my nails but sadly it didn&#x27;t.  I eventually gave it to my niece.  I find I get good results using a small brush and nail polish remover for clean-up.</li>
    <li> Did not like this at all. Nails do not really fit into available slots so the mess is just as if I didn&#x27;t have a guide.</li>
    <li> this is great no matter what stage you are at painting your nails. this works for any size nails and it&#x27;s easy to use. easy to put together, take apart and store. My daughter loves using this to paint her nails with. No mess at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter because I saw it on TV.  When I received the product, it appeared to have been previously used with scrapes and hair on it.  I called and received a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, the product does what it is advertised to do, it is cumbersome to me. I ended up getting nail polish over the top of the dial.  I used fingernail polish to remove most of the polish, however, I never could get all the stain stain off of it.  I don&#x27;t think it is as easy as one would think. The kit is cheaply made in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it 3 stars because once you are able to master the technique, it does work.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how I feel about this Item....I think it is one those things that takes some practice. I will view the tips and guidlines to see if I am doing it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Teresa Alstott</li>
    <li> This is the best gift to myself ever! I never knew how much extra time i spent cleaning up the edges of my nails. Oh and the polish holder is the added bonus.</li>
    <li> This product is cheaply made and very hard to keep still while polishing nails. Even harder when doing your own nails.  It doesn&#x27;t keep still and is made of cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I thought it would be. Fingers don&#x27;t fit the way I expected them to.</li>
    <li> Takes some practice thanks barb</li>
    <li> It is cheap looking when you get it. None of the finger plates fit my fingers to paint. I will give it to one of my little cousins. I would definitely not buy this again or anything made by them if its like this. I had high hopes but no good. I mean really not good.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter.  She used it once and said is was pointless.  Her nails looked worse using it than not using it.  I found this product to be useless.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product was okay, it worked and it was convenient. I do recommend it for do it yourself and for your young girls.</li>
    <li> Not the quality I thought it would be. Very flimsy. No instructions with it at all. Yes for the most part it&#x27;s self explanatory but there was a second &amp;#34;topper&amp;#34; and I wasn&#x27;t sure what that was even for, it doesn&#x27;t fit in the drawer provided and neither to the other &amp;#34;wheels&amp;#34; I just had to lay them on the table the put them back on when I was finished using it.</li>
    <li> This product came with no instructions - very flimsy - basically a piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;do nort waste your money.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing! Very cheaply made. When you try to polish using one of the disks it wobbles all over the place! The only good thing is the polish holder. Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
    <li> The disks you lay your fingernails between are very wobbly and unstable which can make doing your nails difficult.  I think they should have made some sort of stability system.  Good idea though.</li>
    <li> i dont use this much! but if u dont know how to paint ur nails is cool.</li>
    <li> The demonstrations and hype that a TV commercial gives you is always way better than you can do!  Unless, of course, you practice day in and day out!  It works, it is a good thick plastic, nice storage space for when you put it away.  Overall the concept is a good one, I just dont paint my nails often enough to get really adept at using this.</li>
    <li> Fine product for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Hoping I can return it</li>
    <li> Item is a little cheap like.. but for what I paid I cant complain. My niece likes it and it helps her with her nails. So it does the job</li>
    <li> It showed up broken.  The quality was pure crap!  I would not even give one star.  This product belongs in the garbage!  Please do NOT buy this item, I do NOT recommend this trash for anyone at any age!</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas from a friend who knows how much I love nail polish. It seems like a good idea , but it is hard to find a slot that will fit onto your nail comfortably, still allowing some polish to get on your fingers. Disks are warped and mislabeled, and it is cheaply made. It still helps if you are really messy, but a poorly executed idea.</li>
    <li> Plastic, worthless junk. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. If your nails are not perfectly shaped like a hand models and long, this thing is just a paperweight that takes up too much space. Junk - pure junk.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t send this back! I was so mad I just threw it in the trash.  The plate you put on top of you finger flops around so you actually end up with worse looking nails by using this</li>
    <li> received  broken, was not made well</li>
    <li> Serves no purpose the plates are not shaped to fit the contours of a fingernail.  It&#x27;s poorly made. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girls hoping that it would help turn their nail painting forays from massacre to managable.  this was a pain to set up and store and it didn&#x27;t give a clean line on the edges.  i even tried it to see if i could make it look nice.</li>
    <li> Hard for my daughter to figure out how to use.</li>
    <li> This item came in a second hand box with a taped sticker on it, as if it was bootlegged! It do not appear to be the original product!!!! There was no instructions in the bootleg box. The item is not that great at all! I would not purchase from this seller again! And would not recommend!</li>
    <li> I should not have bought this item.  It is worth the money I spent for it. I should have returned it.</li>
