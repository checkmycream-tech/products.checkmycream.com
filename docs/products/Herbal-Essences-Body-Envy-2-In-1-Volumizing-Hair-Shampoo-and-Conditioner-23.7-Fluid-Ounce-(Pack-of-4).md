      <li>the smell is nice and isn&#x27;t too strong, the price is good...</li>
      <li>Excellent shampoo, love the large pump container.  </li>
      <li>I had 100% healthy hair when I started and a week into using this</li>
      <li>and I love the fact that this has a pump because I limit my shampoo squirts to 5/6 a day</li>
      <li>This shampoo has one of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>I Love it and my hair had become more manageable.</li>
      <li>But I think the price is comparable to the price in the store, and if you get it on free shipping, then it makes sense to buy it to get shipped to your door!</li>
      <li>SO GLAD</li>
      <li>I shower every evening and this shampoo keeps my hair nice and fresh between showers!</li>
      <li>Pretty fair value for the price.  </li>
      <li>It smelled mainly like a Nectarine, or a Peach, which I loved.</li>
      <li>When I used this in the shower, the first thing that I noticed was the amazing scent.</li>
      <li>I received a full size bottle sample from Herbal Essences.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Herbal Essences Body Envy shampoo on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo , I can rarely find it in stores Kansas City , MO area .</li>
      <li>This shampoo has a light sort of citrusy scent that is not perfumey at all.  </li>
      <li>and I always get compliments on how fantastic my hair smells.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really clean and easy to use</li>
      <li>It was in a very nice packaging as well, a yellow orange bottle with an orange-and-green cap.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get these on Amazon when I couldn&#x27;t find them in the store anymore.  </li>
      <li>Always made my hair feel squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>My stylist has told me for years to never use Clairol products, especially their hair coloring kits, because they are notorious for using ingredients that aren&#x27;t good for you hair.  </li>
      <li>I am 14 years old, and I was trying to find the right kind of shampoo for my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair was very healthy when I switched to using only the Suave Naturals shampoo/conditioner line, and the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo as well.</li>

      <li>A nice big bottle.</li>
      <li>have been using this product for about a month (along with my Suave, of course!), and I constantly get compliments about how nice my hair looks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s right.</li>
      <li>and I find that this shampoo cleans without stripping and leaves my hair quite soft and easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>Since using this product, I constantly get complimented on how my hair smells :)  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and the price from Amazon is better than buying this product from the place that I usually buy this product from.</li>
      <li>If I needed to shower every other day, I feel this shampoo would easily be able keep my hair clean between showers.</li>
      <li>It was soft, super sleek, and had the highest level of shine that I had ever seen.</li>
      <li>But at least it had a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>The botttle is what mainly held my attention first.</li>
      <li>I also have very oily hair</li>
      <li>So I ordered it and was happy with the size and all but the pump was broken .</li>
      <li>Thanks Herbal</li>

      <li>(Yes, I know I sound like that old commercial.)</li>
      <li>Its not breaking a budget and the product line is decent.</li>
      <li>This is a high quality shampoo and the pump makes using it easier that opening and closing the cap.</li>
      <li>I threw out the Herbal Essences and went to a higher quality shampoo and my hair is back to being full of body, it has shine, and it is not dry and brittle.  </li>
      <li>and my hair was dryer than normal.  </li>
      <li>Normally like Herbal Essences products</li>
      <li>This product also lathers extremely well, and, when I applied it to my hair and scalp, it felt smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>There hadn&#x27;t been any significant weather/climate changes, my diet was the same and my health was the same.  </li>
      <li>I use this along with their conditioner which leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny and never weighed</li>
      <li>Even though this is a clear shampoo, this did not strip the natural oils from my hair either.</li>
      <li>I am also extremely sensitive to scents.  </li>
      <li>I love using amazon for recieving  a simple little product like: getting a shampoo in the mail!</li>
      <li>Since my hair was so tangled I had to go back and wash it out with my normal shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Even my hairstylist asks me what I use to make my hair so thick and strong.</li>
      <li>Even my hairstylist asks me what I use to make my hair so thick and strong.</li>
      <li>It is not strong and the scent dissipates fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>I was so suprised when I blow-dried my hair on the usual cool setting.</li>
      <li>But, because I have naturally pin-straight, but VERY thick hair, I wanted more volume instead of having a flat look all the time.</li>
      <li>Even complete strangers, from the doctor&#x27;s office, to my school teachers, ask me the same question, and I reply with the same answer.</li>

    <li> I usually go to the market to buy a regular size, but I thought I&#x27;d give it the large size on Amazon a try. It&#x27;s really clean and easy to use and there&#x27;s plenty of it.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Herbal Essences since back in the 80&#x27;s.  Always made my hair feel squeaky clean.  I use this along with their conditioner which leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny and never weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I already have thin, dry, brittle hair.. this made it even worse. It didn&#x27;t cleanse my hair but it definitely stripped it. After rinsing it out and blow drying, my hair was so tangled and there was no extra body like the bottle said there would be. Since my hair was so tangled I had to go back and wash it out with my normal shampoo and conditioner. But at least it had a pleasant smell. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has one of my favorite scents. It is a very nice fruity smell to it and I always get compliments on how fantastic my hair smells. I also think the shampoo itself does a good job! I shower every evening and this shampoo keeps my hair nice and fresh between showers! If I needed to shower every other day, I feel this shampoo would easily be able keep my hair clean between showers. Also, my hair is incredibly thick and long and I love the fact that this has a pump because I limit my shampoo squirts to 5/6 a day (so I can go for a run and shower twice if needed). This is a smaller amount of shampoo needed compared to other shampoos that are very water or don&#x27;t spread very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo to anyone!</li>
    <li> Normally like Herbal Essences products but this does nothing and made my hair feel like straw.  Plus made no difference with volume.</li>
    <li> Since using this product, I constantly get complimented on how my hair smells :)  I have long hair (to the lower part of my back) and it only takes me 1 pump to wash my hair, so this is going to last forever. I don&#x27;t find my hair any different than when I started using it, it&#x27;s not more dry/oily/etc. I got this on subscribe and save when the price was 15% off. But I think the price is comparable to the price in the store, and if you get it on free shipping, then it makes sense to buy it to get shipped to your door!</li>
    <li> I have gone thru countless products for my teenage daughters, 3 of them. We have half used shampoos and conditioners littering our bathroom. None of them worked for all three of our girls, until this one. Two of our girls have long hair, goes to the middle of their back, and one has short bobed hair. This product works for them all. I have also noticed that a little goes a long way. Instead of half a bottle of the other products our girls with long hair dont need to use much as all. With the three girls we have dry hair, course curly hair, oily hair, and color treated hair. Its worked for them all. Also, the girls adore the scent, when they leave the bathroom you can smell the pleasant fruity scent. This is our 2nd bottle and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I have asthma.  I am also extremely sensitive to scents.  As such, it is often very difficult for me to find products that don&#x27;t burn my lungs, cause me to sneeze all day, or just generally irritate me enough that I rush to wash them off.  This shampoo has a light sort of citrusy scent that is not perfumey at all.  It is not strong and the scent dissipates fairly quickly.  I also have very oily hair and I find that this shampoo cleans without stripping and leaves my hair quite soft and easy to manage.  (Yes, I know I sound like that old commercial.)</li>
    <li> I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and it does have some pros...the smell is nice and isn&#x27;t too strong, the price is good...but it essentially ends there.  My stylist has told me for years to never use Clairol products, especially their hair coloring kits, because they are notorious for using ingredients that aren&#x27;t good for you hair.  Thinking only of costs I bought this product and threw it out before I even made it half way through the bottle.  I had 100% healthy hair when I started and a week into using this I was getting split ends and my hair was dryer than normal.  There hadn&#x27;t been any significant weather/climate changes, my diet was the same and my health was the same.  It continued to get worse.  I went to my stylist to get my ends cleaned up and he demanded I stop using whatever products I was using in my hair as they were making my hair weak and brittle.  I threw out the Herbal Essences and went to a higher quality shampoo and my hair is back to being full of body, it has shine, and it is not dry and brittle.  I will avoid ALL Clairol hair products from here on out.</li>
    <li> I had this shipped twice, but both times I received the citrus.  I was so excited to get these on Amazon when I couldn&#x27;t find them in the store anymore.  I LOVE the passion flower, but it looks like it may be discontinued! :(</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo , I can rarely find it in stores Kansas City , MO area . So I ordered it and was happy with the size and all but the pump was broken . Its not the end of the world but I wanted to replace the item at least but I would have to pay to ship it back so its really not worth all of that but other then the broken pump I love it.</li>
    <li> I love using amazon for recieving  a simple little product like: getting a shampoo in the mail! I like the herbal essence line of haircare. Its not breaking a budget and the product line is decent. This makes my hair feel good and Ive got no issues w it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for ethnic hair! I Love it and my hair had become more manageable. Thanks Herbal</li>
    <li> A nice big bottle. Lathers well. The smell is not overpowering. It did not leave an oily residue like some volumizing shampoos do.</li>
    <li> Large bottle for the sale price and the excellent stuff of Herbal Essence.  My choice since 1972 for great scents  and quality.  SO GLAD IT IS ON Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am 14 years old, and I was trying to find the right kind of shampoo for my hair. I have tried literally every shampoo brand on the market, Tressemme, Matrix, Pantene, Garnier, Aussie, Aveda, L&#x27;Oreal, and, I even went all out and blew right through my $90.00 of birthday money on stupid, useless Wen...ha! what a waste that was! My hair was very healthy when I switched to using only the Suave Naturals shampoo/conditioner line, and the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo as well. It was soft, super sleek, and had the highest level of shine that I had ever seen. But, because I have naturally pin-straight, but VERY thick hair, I wanted more volume instead of having a flat look all the time. I saw this in my local Walgreens one day, and decided that I would buy it along with my Suave products. The botttle is what mainly held my attention first. It was in a very nice packaging as well, a yellow orange bottle with an orange-and-green cap. The price was also astonishingly cheap as well, $3.00, which is as much as my Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo. So, I decided to give it a shot, and at least attempt to try it. When I used this in the shower, the first thing that I noticed was the amazing scent. It smelled mainly like a Nectarine, or a Peach, which I loved. It also did not cause my severe asthma, sinus disease, and chronic bronchitis to flare up as well (the Garnier, Tressemme, Aveda, and even Wen made it flare up really bad to the point that I would be suffocating/wheezing in the shower.). This product also lathers extremely well, and, when I applied it to my hair and scalp, it felt smooth and creamy. Even though this is a clear shampoo, this did not strip the natural oils from my hair either. I was so suprised when I blow-dried my hair on the usual cool setting. My pin-straight, thick, and shiny hair was even thicker, and was shining like glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a month (along with my Suave, of course!), and I constantly get compliments about how nice my hair looks. My friends (who use Wen), ask me \\&quot;What shampoo do you use on your hair? It looks so thick and shiny!\\&quot;, and, I simply reply \\&quot;Suave and Herbal Essences\\&quot;, and they look at me, dumbfounded. Even complete strangers, from the doctor&#x27;s office, to my school teachers, ask me the same question, and I reply with the same answer. Even my hairstylist asks me what I use to make my hair so thick and strong. She, herself looked shocked when I told her it was the $3.00 bottle of Herbal Essences, and the $1.00 bottle of Suave Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and, I forgot to mention this before, but, the amazing scent of this shampoo lingers for DAYS! Yesterday, when I was walking home from school with my best friend, she asked me what perfume I was wearing, because it smelled so nice. I actually told her that It was the Herbal Essences shampoo that I was using. She jokingly replied \\&quot;That shampoo does it all, huh?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s right. This shampoo has to be the best shampoo that I have used besides Suave, hands down!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* AMAZING SMELL that lasts for days!&lt;br /&gt;* Great lather.&lt;br /&gt;* Intense body and shine.&lt;br /&gt;* No unnecessary buildup.&lt;br /&gt;* It made my hair stronger within 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Ummmm...NONE!get compliments about how nice my hair looks.

She, herself looked shocked when I told her it was the $3.00 bottle of Herbal Essences, and the $1.00 bottle of Suave Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and, I forgot to mention this before, but, the amazing scent of this shampoo lingers for DAYS! Yesterday, when I was walking home from school with my best friend, she asked me what perfume I was wearing, because it smelled so nice. I actually told her that It was the Herbal Essences shampoo that I was using. She jokingly replied \\&quot;That shampoo does it all, huh?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s right. This shampoo has to be the best shampoo that I have used besides Suave, hands down!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* AMAZING SMELL that lasts for days!&lt;br /&gt;* Great lather.&lt;br /&gt;* Intense body and shine.&lt;br /&gt;* No unnecessary buildup.&lt;br /&gt;* It made my hair stronger within 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Ummmm...NONE!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and the price from Amazon is better than buying this product from the place that I usually buy this product from.</li>
    <li> *disclaimer * I received a full size bottle sample from Herbal Essences.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Herbal Essences Body Envy shampoo on my hair.  It smells delicious and leaves my hair softer than the cheaper brands.  I didn&#x27;t notice an increase in my hair body specifically but I did notice that my hair didn&#x27;t require conditioner 1/2 the time I was using it.  Pretty fair value for the price.  If you like Herbal Essence products, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed with Body Envy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this 33 oz bottle at a price per ounce far less than at local stores.  This is a high quality shampoo and the pump makes using it easier that opening and closing the cap.</li>
    <li> It made my hair so bad.never ordered it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo, love the large pump container.  Been using this product for a long time and will continue to use it.  Comes packaged perfectly and in a timely manner.  Will continue to use this product and supplier.</li>
