      <li>/&gt;The loose powder allows for excellent blending of the makeup.</li>
      <li>After applying the makeup, it&#x27;s so light that I can apply lotion and then reapply more makeup without it looking streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would also rub off easily on anything.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you know your shade and order the right one!</li>
      <li>if you love bare minerals, this is a good buy.</li>
      <li>Make-up is easy to apply and clean off.</li>
      <li>It seems to be really light on my skin and doesnt feel &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; on my face.</li>
      <li>I got light and after I ordered it I started doubting my choice thinking it was going to be way too light...</li>
      <li>This SPF 15 Foundation in Light was listed at a fantastic price.  </li>
      <li>The product came super fast(within a week) and was definitely the large (8oz) size, unopened and flawless.</li>
      <li>After getting a sample size of BareMinerals foundation and loving it, I bought the full size and overall, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>I tried the starter kit of the Bare Minerals first and fell in love!!</li>
      <li>The container wasn&#x27;t even full all the way.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this foundation.</li>
      <li>Item arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
      <li>The shipping was incredibly quick and the product was well</li>
      <li>This is such a velvety, nice light coverage product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know if id buy it again because of how expensive it is, and for that price I expect magic to happen and for it to be completely flawless.</li>
      <li>It looks super natural and once you get down the application, gives you flawless skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The finish is lovely- very natural without looking too dewy.</li>
      <li>I think it actually matches my skin better!</li>
      <li>It is so worth it for the money.</li>
      <li>This is a nice powder foundation that goes on nicely, without caking or looking thick.</li>
      <li>The price was right, and it was delivered on time.</li>
      <li>This is AUTHENTIC BARE MINERALS.</li>
      <li>Came in a day before estimated arrivnd date and was exactly what ordered.</li>
      <li>Also, if you have acne scars, it does cover pretty well</li>
      <li>Never fails to impress .</li>
      <li>I was concerned about the shade matching my skin, but I actually think that this makeup matched even better than my Clinique makeup that was matched by a Clinique employee.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>This was exactly the same item as found in name brand cosmetic stores for a much better price and no need to go to the mall.</li>
      <li>I am a long time user of BareMinerals and love it.  </li>
      <li>but it is the large size foundation.</li>
      <li>I know it can be put on more heavily for greater coverage, but I usually dust it on pretty lightly to even out skin tone and get rid of any sheen.</li>
      <li>After being a faithful Clinique user for years &amp; years (Perfectly Real Compact Makeup 108G), I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to expand my horizons to see if there was anything else that might surpass it.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Next time I will try the fairly light, as well.</li>
      <li>It didnt seem to cover much at all and didn&#x27;t do much about the shine on my nose or skin.</li>
      <li>I love how light it feels compared to other concealers and that it evens out skin tone without the cakey, flat, covered-up look and feel.  </li>
      <li>I can apply a light coat to even out my skin a little, or apply it more heavily for full coverage.</li>
      <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product, I have some acne scarring and uneven/reddish skin tone</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am half Mexican and half white with golden undertones to my skin, which can get very tan in the summer and very fair in the winter.</li>
      <li>I inadvertently selected the wrong color the first time, and, since I hadn&#x27;t opened the package, it was easily and quickly exchanged for the correct color!</li>
      <li>I wonder if I should switch to a liquid foundation, but I usually just moisturize more.</li>
      <li>It came to me a day early too !</li>
      <li>It does offer light coverage and does help to tone down my redness flareups too</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, stays put, looks natural but will hide those little imperfections.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin look naturally even and glowing.</li>
      <li>but if you still have moderate to severe acne, I don&#x27;t feel it will help much.</li>
      <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and this foundation doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate it at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product I could find on the market that safely covers it up without all the harsh chemicals associated with makeup.  </li>

    <li> I love, love, love this stuff. I am a middle-aged female,  but this stuff makes me feel a lot younger. It covers all my scars, and it just evens everything out. It is so worth it for the money. I had been using Clinique liquid foundation and liked it, until I used this!! I will keep buying this! Next time I will try the fairly light, as well. I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this foundation. I used the tiny buki brush with this,&lt;br /&gt;and I like that as well!</li>
    <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for about 4 years now.  I love how light it feels compared to other concealers and that it evens out skin tone without the cakey, flat, covered-up look and feel.  It makes my skin look naturally even and glowing.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this make up. Best price I have found!</li>
    <li> This is AUTHENTIC BARE MINERALS. I have been using for years and LOVE IT! Glad I found a bit of a cheaper place to buy! :)</li>
    <li> This is a nice powder foundation that goes on nicely, without caking or looking thick. I only wish it came with an application pad. For the price, that should be included.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and was as described. I neglected to read the gram amount in the description and the item is bigger than what I was imagining. So...bonus for me!</li>
    <li> Not real Bareminerals. Was disappointed. Doesn&#x27;t  apply the same way, goes on poorly and doesn&#x27;t give even coverage.</li>
    <li> it is the best for overall coverage!! it is great for setting the under eye area and the t zone for me. I have very oily skin and works great with a setting spray and does not crease in the lines for me  Then great for light coverade for summer time and when want more coverage over liquid fioundation to set it  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED! IT WAS NOT THE SIZE IT SAID IT WAS! THE ADVERTISEMENT SAID IT WAS 8g AND IT WAS NOT!!!!!!!! I TRULY DO NOT APPRECIATE BUYING A PRODUCT FROM YOU THINKING I WOULD GET THE SIZE YOU ADVERTISED AND GETTING A SMALLER ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used before.  Great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting. I was afraid it would be the smaller size but it is the large size foundation.</li>
    <li> I love this item.  I&#x27;ve been using BareMinerals for years and it always meets my expectations.  Will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> It was a bargin and I couldnt be happier I have already told friends about it. I will order again</li>
    <li> I tried the starter kit of the Bare Minerals first and fell in love!! I was a little skeptical about ordering online, but I am amazed! The product came super fast(within a week) and was definitely the large (8oz) size, unopened and flawless. I did scare myself because I accidentally ordered \\&quot;Light\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Fairly Light\\&quot; because I have very fair skin. Thankfully, you can&#x27;t tell the difference and it still blends great. I think it actually matches my skin better! I would HIGHLY recommend this product, I have some acne scarring and uneven/reddish skin tone and this works great! It looks super natural and once you get down the application, gives you flawless skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: This stuff works and the price is much better than what you pay in the department stores. Just make sure you know your shade and order the right one!</li>
    <li> I love the product and the price was great. Name brand and good quality for a price that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and have used Bare Minerals for years.  It&#x27;s the only product I could find on the market that safely covers it up without all the harsh chemicals associated with makeup.  However, this container, did not cover my rosacea.  I used it for 2 weeks, thinking it was something I was doing wrong.  I finally got frustrated with the splotchy, uneven redness on my face an order from another website that I knew was the real deal.  Alas, my skin is no longer uneven, splotchy or red with the new Bare Minerals I purchased.  Very disappointed with this Amazon purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter is fair and fair.  She LOVES this product, and it&#x27;s the only brand she will use.  The price was right, and it was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Flawless perfection in a jar. It goes on evenly, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t come off on clothing. I love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I do have rosecea and this does not irritate my skin like some other products do. It does offer light coverage and does help to tone down my redness flareups too</li>
    <li> I received it in 2 days! I was super happy. The Product is as described- if you love bare minerals, this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> This was exactly the same item as found in name brand cosmetic stores for a much better price and no need to go to the mall.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  This is the best make up for your skin and it looks great on.</li>
    <li> Its the only makeup I will ever use. Period. I love this brand. No other brand compares.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite makeup products. Never fails to impress . It came to me a day early too !</li>
    <li> Best makeup I have ever purchased.  Best price for it I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
    <li> Had previously purchased. Make-up is easy to apply and clean off. Great price! Happy with purchase and service received. Shipped as expected. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Came in a day before estimated arrivnd date and was exactly what ordered. As always I am very satisfied with the order.</li>
    <li> After being a faithful Clinique user for years &amp; years (Perfectly Real Compact Makeup 108G), I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to expand my horizons to see if there was anything else that might surpass it. After seeing all the glowing reviews about BareMinerals, my decision was made. To apply, I use the Ecotools Baby Kabuki (which is the perfect size!) that comes in [[ASIN:B001EM1BBK EcoTools MINERAL 5pc Make Up Brush Travel Set 1213]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loose powder allows for excellent blending of the makeup. It feels super light, but the coverage is great. I was concerned about using loose powder since my skin has a tendency to get dry (especially in winter). After applying the makeup, it&#x27;s so light that I can apply lotion and then reapply more makeup without it looking streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am half Mexican and half white with golden undertones to my skin, which can get very tan in the summer and very fair in the winter. I was concerned about the shade matching my skin, but I actually think that this makeup matched even better than my Clinique makeup that was matched by a Clinique employee.</li>
    <li> I order this for my daughter, and it is by far, the best matching foundation, and doesn&#x27;t smear or turn orange--it just does what it is supposed to. This seller has been wonderful to work with too. I inadvertently selected the wrong color the first time, and, since I hadn&#x27;t opened the package, it was easily and quickly exchanged for the correct color! They were very pleasant and the exchange was very easy to accomplish!</li>
    <li> long-time user...good product, good seller</li>
    <li> This is such a velvety, nice light coverage product. It does not make my skin irritated or break out from wearing it! It is a smooth finish and has some sun protection too..nice!</li>
    <li> I made the switch to the Bare Minerals makeup a few years ago because a friend was raving about it. I know it can be put on more heavily for greater coverage, but I usually dust it on pretty lightly to even out skin tone and get rid of any sheen. The color works well on my fair skin (it goes with the ginger hair) and I don&#x27;t feel too guilty if I fall asleep without washing my face. When my skin is a bit dry I wonder if I should switch to a liquid foundation, but I usually just moisturize more.</li>
    <li> I usually use Pur Minerals but wanted to find something a little less in price. Big mistake. This makeup gives off an orange tinge and also did not apply well to my skin. It does not blend well with dry patches. It would also rub off easily on anything. The small price difference (about $5) is not worth the far inferior product.</li>
    <li> Have bene using BareMinerals for years and the product never lets me down. Goes on smooth, stays put, looks natural but will hide those little imperfections. I was afraid with age that the &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; would sink into wrinkles--but no such issue.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the REAL ID Bare Minerals. The coverage was not great and even after using a primer the coverage was still very spotty. The container wasn&#x27;t even full all the way. I&#x27;m not sure about this product but not worth my money when I could go buy from the source for a few dollars more.</li>
    <li> This product was a counterfeit!  Obviously not authentic, and very poor quality!  I should&#x27;ve known better!</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered this and I am now a believer in the BareMinerals Foundation because it provides coverage and looks natural at the same time.</li>
    <li> This makeup brand has been a staple for me for years.  It is perfectly suited for my complexion type, is moderately priced, and I am able to find my shades at Amazon, when it is often a problem to find it in stores.</li>
    <li> I was so very pleased to find this product on Amazon! I am a long time user of BareMinerals and love it.  This SPF 15 Foundation in Light was listed at a fantastic price.  The shipping was incredibly quick and the product was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> After getting a sample size of BareMinerals foundation and loving it, I bought the full size and overall, I&#x27;m pleased. I love the adjustable coverage. I can apply a light coat to even out my skin a little, or apply it more heavily for full coverage. The finish is lovely- very natural without looking too dewy. My skin is extremely sensitive and this foundation doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate it at all. The container is generously sized and I feel like I got good value for my money. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I have used Bare Minerals for years and have yet to be disappointed  with the product.I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> was darker then i like i wear&lt;br /&gt; IVORY  i have pale skin and the darker shades make me look to dark</li>
    <li> When I first tried this product I was actually really disappointed. It didnt seem to cover much at all and didn&#x27;t do much about the shine on my nose or skin. However, once I let it set in for a few minutes it blended really well! I applied it once and it has stayed on all day. My suggestion to people who haven&#x27;t bought this product before is to go a shade lighter than you think you are. I got light and after I ordered it I started doubting my choice thinking it was going to be way too light...but im really glad that I went lighter! It seems to be really light on my skin and doesnt feel &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; on my face. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know if id buy it again because of how expensive it is, and for that price I expect magic to happen and for it to be completely flawless. Also, if you have acne scars, it does cover pretty well but if you still have moderate to severe acne, I don&#x27;t feel it will help much. It does help cover my acne scars but I don&#x27;t have much active acne so I thought it served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Looks amazing and it&#x27;s very light and washes off easy.</li>
