      <li>okay,</li>
      <li>best shampoo for colored gray dry hair</li>
      <li>It makes your hair feel clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>Great for dry hair - doesn&#x27;t over moisturize and hair still feels very clean.</li>
      <li>Moisturizing, but light.</li>
      <li>If you want a quality, sulfate free product, buy this.  </li>
      <li>I do need to use a different product to control buildup/flat hair, but otherwise great.</li>
      <li>It is very pricey but worth the money if you want a really really good all around shampoo.</li>
      <li>It does not contain sulfates, which I really look for and it foams very easily.  </li>
      <li>It is pricey, but it is worth it!  </li>

      <li>Hair feels very clean and is very shiny after use</li>
      <li>Both my husband and I use it and it leaves hair clean, shiny and fresh.</li>
      <li>so was glad to find it in a larger, more affordable size.</li>
      <li>Thank you for turning the order around quickly.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re paying $80-100 every 8 weeks to get your hair colored, this product is well worth the money to keep the color from fading.</li>
      <li>My hair tends to be frizzy curly and this shampoo makes it soft and easy to style.  </li>
      <li>Love having this size so I can refill my smaller bottle</li>
      <li>Bought the big bottle and it has lasted more than two years.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo has more of a minty smell and up in the land of large mosquitoes that is a big help.</li>
      <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A LONG TIME NOW AND LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS</li>
      <li>In addition, it is gentle and nourishing.</li>
      <li>we wont go back to the cheap stuff.</li>
      <li>It really helps to conserve your hair color.</li>
      <li>You only need a tiny bit to get great lather and there is no oily residue left on your hair when you are done.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE NORMAL TO OILY HAIR.</li>
      <li>With the amount product that was missing from the bottle, versus what I saved buying online, I would better off buying retail.</li>
      <li>This big size lasts me a whole year and has no sulfates.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and have frequently tried out new shampoos but always come back to Pureology hydrating products.</li>
      <li>andcsilky will use no other</li>
      <li>Works very well on my thick, straight color-treated hair.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this I thought that it felt a little different, but didn&#x27;t think anything about it.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is very concentrated so we are using way less than a regular shampoo too.</li>

    <li> Works very well on my thick, straight color-treated hair. Moisturizing, but light. Hair feels very clean and is very shiny after use and I have been using this product for several years.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this product.  It does not contain sulfates, which I really look for and it foams very easily.  It has a great smell and I feel a noticable difference in the softness of my hair after it&#x27;s use.  It is very pricey but worth the money if you want a really really good all around shampoo.</li>
    <li> love this stuff and the price is great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and have frequently tried out new shampoos but always come back to Pureology hydrating products.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  It is for someone who either colors their hair or has low lights and hi lights.  Buying in bulk is a great savings to the buyer.</li>
    <li> my tween daughter had terrible greasy hair and nothing was working for her to get it clean. Our hairdresser recommended this product and I was very hesitant because it is so expensive. The shampoo is doing the trick she can even wash her hair every other day. This shampoo is very concentrated so we are using way less than a regular shampoo too. Great product for greasy hair even though it states its a &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; shampoo. we wont go back to the cheap stuff. same price for 64 0z on Amazon as it is for 1 liter in retail stores.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever.  This big size lasts me a whole year and has no sulfates.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a staple in my house for over fifteen years.  You only need a tiny bit to get great lather and there is no oily residue left on your hair when you are done.  It makes your hair feel clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for color treated hair which I have used for many yrs  and always pleased with the consistency of the product.</li>
    <li> Love having this size so I can refill my smaller bottle so I don&#x27;t need to order this product so often.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo. It can&#x27;t be compared to any other shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner line. It really helps to conserve your hair color. I&#x27;ve used different products and my hair dye definitely stays longer when I use this exclusively. If you&#x27;re paying $80-100 every 8 weeks to get your hair colored, this product is well worth the money to keep the color from fading. It also keeps your hair moisturized and shiny.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has more of a minty smell and up in the land of large mosquitoes that is a big help. The flower scented shampoos encourage the biting behavior. In addition, it is gentle and nourishing. I have used this product for over 5 years.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for color treated hair and does just what it promises, It has a lovely aroma as well. Thank you for turning the order around quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for cleaning my motorcycle. It does a great job and is quick and easy to use. I was thrilled to find this size as it is a much better value.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo makes hair clean andcsilky will use no other</li>
    <li> I love pureology, but this one made me change my mind..</li>
    <li> I bought the Pureology Hydrate Shampoo &amp; Conditioner in the 64oz container, &amp; am SO glad I did! Instead of going through Shampoo &amp; Conditioner monthly, I only have to buy it once a year! It lasts me that long, SERIOUS!</li>
    <li> best shampoo for colored gray dry hair</li>
    <li> Using as a refill for my smaller bottle. This one did not come with a pump so you need one if using this bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is great for my hair which is fine.  It gives it body and also protects the color.  It is very expensive to buy a little bit in the salon so was glad to find it in a larger, more affordable size.</li>
    <li> The shampoo itself was good, the shipping speed okay, but the bottle was NOT full. Some of the product was missing. I double checked the product level in this size bottle at a retail location, and it was where one would expect it to be. My estimates are that I was shorted at least 3-4 oz....so, either this bottle was not filled to capacity as it should have been at the factory, or product went missing somewhere along the line. With the amount product that was missing from the bottle, versus what I saved buying online, I would better off buying retail. Buyer Beware.</li>
    <li> the only shampoo I buy.  I buy it here because it is one-fourth the price of buying it at the salon</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A LONG TIME NOW AND LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS AND MAKES MY HAIR FEEL. I HAVE NORMAL TO OILY HAIR. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Most shampoos make my hair clump together and all but unbrushable, but not this one! I have used it daily for years, usually just a small amount at the root and I don&#x27;t even need to condition because the shampoo is so good. I do need to use a different product to control buildup/flat hair, but otherwise great.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Pureology.  If you want a quality, sulfate free product, buy this.  It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> great value for pureology shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using pureology for years. If you buy it in the salon, it is pretty expensive, so I figured I would just bite the bullet and buy a big bottle to use. The first time I used this I thought that it felt a little different, but didn&#x27;t think anything about it. Then I realized that instead of going 5 or 6 weeks between coloring my hair, my color was fading in 1 or 2 weeks... Pureology is the best color safe hair products on the market, so it is CLEAR that this isn&#x27;t what it is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo. Started using several years ago after receiving a sample. Great for dry hair - doesn&#x27;t over moisturize and hair still feels very clean. Short haired people would likely not have to use conditioner after. Smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> Like this product a lot. Both my husband and I use it and it leaves hair clean, shiny and fresh.</li>
    <li> Pureology is a great shampoo for any type hair.  It is pricey, but it is worth it!  My hair tends to be frizzy curly and this shampoo makes it soft and easy to style.  I don&#x27;t need hairspray anymore.  I bought the big jug and use it to fill a regular bottle to keep in the shower.  The 64oz size is a better bargain.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she is thrilled with the product, it arrived quickly and is all round good value. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner for years- love it for curly hair. Plus you can use this product if you have had a keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for someone age 60 plus who dyes her own hair.  Bought the big bottle and it has lasted more than two years.  I do add a bit of water because it thickens over time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite for years.  Keeps hair silky, shiny and healthy</li>
    <li> I bought a regular size bottle at an expensive price.  This 64 oz. bottle will fill up an empty regular size bottle several times.  It is especially great for color treated hair.  (won&#x27;t fade)</li>
