      <li>I have found that it is moisturing and feels good on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be good at evening out skin tones, as the color goes on in streaks.</li>
      <li>This is perfect light coverage without breakouts.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really good makeup and looks good.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s good stuff for a good price.</li>
      <li>The product itself seems good, but the color is a deal breaker, since there&#x27;s no way to order a lighter shade.</li>
      <li>I had seen it recommended by a woman in a magazine to which I subscribe, and she had said that she needed nothing more for her skin to look great.  </li>

      <li>Great, smooth coverage.</li>
      <li>Amazing.  </li>
      <li>My own fault.  </li>
      <li>my nice tan and found out how I got it.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell the difference after applying this.</li>
      <li>I liked the coverage, but the smell made my eyes water and the smell lingered on all day.</li>
      <li>Expect to use more product to get good coverage.</li>
      <li>I just know not to buy this kind of product again.</li>
      <li>I know I am doing good things for my skin while looking better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wore it today, and I was asked what kind of makeup I had on.</li>
      <li>My skin is incredibly sensitive, and this product has been wonderful to have!  </li>
      <li>The best, most natural, most comfortable, most beautiful foundation on the market.  </li>
      <li>This works perfect for me, it isn&#x27;t a heavy makeup &amp; covers great without looking like I have a lot on</li>
      <li>I thought BB creams were supposed to have a very light tint, so I wasn&#x27;t worried about the light/medium</li>
      <li>Very comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>That, of course, does constitute anti-aging as sun damages skin more than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t care for the scent, it kind of smells like cheap mascara to me.</li>
      <li>Either way I feel instantly better after putting on just the cream.</li>
      <li>My grand daughter had bought some and said it felt greasy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d really love to find the one that I have.</li>
      <li>The more I blended the more the product rubbed into clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>I love this stuff...</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s MUCH better.</li>
      <li>and I love that there&#x27;s SPF in it.</li>
      <li>Waaaaaaay better than $70 and $80 foundations.</li>
      <li>Okay so if I am inside all day I do not have to apply but</li>
      <li>This covers without making the flakiness more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I have a suspicion that it is better suited to someone with younger&lt;</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light, maybe kind of rosey or grassy.  </li>
      <li>You will love it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll be glad you got it.</li>
      <li>My favorite BB cream of all time.</li>
      <li>need I say more?  </li>
      <li>good color and moisturizing, but gets quite greasy looking almost right away.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a good product; I didn&#x27;t know exactly what the product did when I purchased.  </li>
      <li>It last all day and the price is very good.  </li>
      <li>I do apply a light dusting of translucent powder over it to make it more finished looking.  </li>
      <li>color is actually pretty light and works on my fair skin.</li>
      <li>What more could one want from something that takes two minutes to apply on clean skin?</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work well for light skin - they would have done better sticking with separating the &#x27;light&#x27; and &#x27;medium&#x27; rather than trying to cover the shades in one product.</li>
      <li>I had bought this product in a drug store and liked it very much.  </li>
      <li>hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I&#x27;d say that this version is much better for my winter skin, but the new combination/oily is better for me in the summer!</li>
      <li>This feels silky, blends easily, moisturizes, provides SPF protection, and provides light, natural-looking coverage - all without leaving my skin looking or feeling all made up.  </li>
      <li>Love it so much!!</li>
      <li>I have light-medium skin, and I didn&#x27;t find that the light-medium shade made any difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance after applying, so just putting on for light coverage days instead of foundation didn&#x27;t have the effect I wanted.</li>
      <li>This cream is great, and it is just enough so that I don&#x27;t feel like I am clogging my pores.</li>
      <li>Smooth makeup.</li>
      <li>For example, when I used too much product, it would sort of pill on top of my skin and wouldn&#x27;t blend easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving two stars because this isn&#x27;t the original product.</li>
      <li>Also, just to let first time BB cream users know, it&#x27;s best to go to the store and test these on the back of your hand before you buy, because if I hadn&#x27;t done that, I would&#x27;ve bought 4 other creams before trying this one (which is the best for my skin, personally).</li>
      <li>The formula is a bit thinner, but seems to cover more, and it doesn&#x27;t get shiny even when it&#x27;s very</li>
      <li>It has a more gel-like consistency (before it was a liquid-like foundation) which doesn&#x27;t spread very well</li>
      <li>used to use so many different products and powders to do my makeup, but I must say I love the simplicity of this BB cream.</li>
      <li>Good product...not the same coverage you&#x27;d get with a higher end brand</li>
      <li>I am fair with pink undertones.</li>
      <li>and this was able to diminish it to the point where it looked more like a slightly pink glow in my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>I think it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I can just pick up and go for bare minimum or put on more make up for a more complete look.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 53, and have pretty good skin, and I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in tone or texture after using the cream for several weeks.</li>
      <li>A little oily, but good product for cost</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, if you have very fair skin (always buying the ivory powders and foundations) then this product will likely be too dark for you.</li>
      <li>I tried out several drugstore BB Creams when the fad hit, and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
      <li>I saw results after first use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to wear traditional foundation, it always made my skin break out.</li>
      <li>I have light to medium skin and am not heavily blemished or anything.</li>
      <li>Not that I need it, I&#x27;m still young darnit!!!!</li>
      <li>I am searching for the original formula, but so far I&#x27;ve had no luck.</li>
      <li>Clean feeling, covers well, keeps skin soft and does not cause breakouts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m probably not able to give a fair review as I haven&#x27;t used it consistently since&lt;br /&gt;I bought it.  </li>
      <li>I decided to use it only for weekends at the lake or when we&#x27;ll be outdoors doing yard work, because it doesn&#x27;t look good enough for use at work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m aware that the product is on my face pretty much all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did a lot of research on BB creams before getting this. As a freckled person, who has never worn foundation, I needed something natural that would make my skintone even. yep, this worked. It&#x27;s thin, moisturizes, and makes me look more youthful. Not that I need it, I&#x27;m still young darnit!!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to write this review after seeing the many bad reviews out there claiming that it left their skin &amp;#34;too oily&amp;#34;.  This is the Anti-Aging formula, people!  In my humble opinion, this means it is made for women who are old enough to be experiencing the issues of aging skin, such as wrinkles, dryness, etc.  Therefore it is made to be extremely moisturizing.  If you do not have aging skin, you will likely find it too greasy and should try their regular formula.  I personally do not apply moisturizer before using this as if I do, I will have the same problem.  A BB cream is supposed to replace moisturizer, sunscreen and foundation, however it is difficult to find one that is made for more mature skin - most are not moisturizing enough.  This one is and I do not find it heavy feeling at all.  I do apply a light dusting of translucent powder over it to make it more finished looking.  I find that it evens out my skin tone enough to give me a very natural look.  As far as coverage goes, I find it covers my light freckles and broken capillaries next to my nose as well as light under eye circles but I still need concealer on sun spots.  I also find that if I forget to wash my face before going to bed (bad, I know), it tends to make me break out slightly.  In regards to the color, if you are fair to light skinned as I am, this will be too dark for you unless you have a bit of a tan - for that reason I am sad to have to move this to the back of the bathroom cabinet in the winter time.  Over all, I do like this a lot - I am in my late 40&#x27;s.  Hopefully they will come out with a lighter shade for those of us who glow in the dark!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to wear traditional foundation, it always made my skin break out. This is perfect light coverage without breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is great! I&#x27;m not very fan of makeup, I don&#x27;t like the heavy feeling in my face, but... I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;This is really soft and cover little blemishes and looks very natural</li>
    <li> I am fair with pink undertones. I wanted/needed a BB cream and noticed the garnier one only came in light/medium and medium/dark. The light/medium is very dark with strong orange tones. I doubt my skin even gets this dark in the middle of summer. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference after trying it either but I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good makeup and looks good.  I wish it didn&#x27;t have the problem of being so intensely perfumey.  I am having a hard time adjusting to having that scent on my face - where I can really smell it.  They should consider scent-free or using less scent.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s good stuff for a good price.</li>
    <li> perfect skin  makeup for combination skin</li>
    <li> As described. Delivered promptly. Love this stuff and it&#x27;s now impossible to find at my local stores.</li>
    <li> The shade does run dark as others have noted.  Its purpose is sun protection, so its use as a foundation isn&#x27;t really what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I have found that it is moisturing and feels good on my skin.  I had seen it recommended by a woman in a magazine to which I subscribe, and she had said that she needed nothing more for her skin to look great.  Although it is called Skin Perfector Anti-Aging, it is clearly sun protection.  That, of course, does constitute anti-aging as sun damages skin more than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product; I didn&#x27;t know exactly what the product did when I purchased.  My own fault.  Mea Culpa.</li>
    <li> awesome product. Arrived fast and well packaged. Product performs well and we are still testing.</li>
    <li> This works perfect for me, it isn&#x27;t a heavy makeup &amp; covers great without looking like I have a lot on</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer! (and it adds a little color :-)) Okay so if I am inside all day I do not have to apply but once a day but if I am outside quite a bit during the day then usually halfway through the day I have to reapply no biggy. I really like it and doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your entire face! I will buy this again I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product upon its initial release to the market.  It was AWESOME! The only downside was the cap, which was a screw-top.  I have oily, rosacea-prone skin and found this to have amazing coverage and great skin benefits.  I purchased another tube when I was running low, only to find a new formulation.  It has a new cap, which I love, but the texture and coverage is completely different.  It has a more gel-like consistency (before it was a liquid-like foundation) which doesn&#x27;t spread very well (I use a professional foundation sponge).  It has a very light coverage now, far different from the first tube I purchased.  Sadly, this will be my last purchase of this product and I will be on my quest for a new foundation...unless they decide to return to the initial formulation.  Let me know if it changes!</li>
    <li> In my 50s and my skin is dry with some flakiness, even after exfoliating.  This covers without making the flakiness more noticeable.  It doesn&#x27;t look cakey, like some products do, even though they are designed for dry skin.  The fragrance is light, maybe kind of rosey or grassy.  Went on well.&lt;br /&gt;It came out of the tube kind of thick, so I thought it wouldn&#x27;t spread well, but it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be glad you got it.</li>
    <li> This feels silky, blends easily, moisturizes, provides SPF protection, and provides light, natural-looking coverage - all without leaving my skin looking or feeling all made up.  What more could one want from something that takes two minutes to apply on clean skin?</li>
    <li> The best around. I have combination skin that is prone to acne, but also gets dry and taunt. this is perfect. Clean feeling, covers well, keeps skin soft and does not cause breakouts. The only thing I use. The tube is big and last a few months without it smelling old or getting cakey.</li>
    <li> I have been using Garnier Miracle Skin Perfector Anti-Aging BB Cream for over a year.  I like it so much because you can feel the ingredients mosturizing my skin.  It last all day and the price is very good.  It hydrates and has excellent coverage.  It also has a sunscreen which I really like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably not able to give a fair review as I haven&#x27;t used it consistently since&lt;br /&gt;I bought it.  I have a suspicion that it is better suited to someone with younger&lt;br /&gt;skin than mine.</li>
    <li> The best, most natural, most comfortable, most beautiful foundation on the market.  Waaaaaaay better than $70 and $80 foundations. Do not hesitate!</li>
    <li> First....the wrong shade was sent to me - medium to dark.  I needed light/medium.  Then, I learned that for optimum effectiveness you would need to apply it at least two times a day.  The reason I wanted to try a BB cream was that it combined the moisturizer, etc. with foundation so that I could skip a step.  But if I have to apply it multiple times during the day, it defeats this purpose.  I did not return the item because it&#x27;s too much of a hassle. I just know not to buy this kind of product again.</li>
    <li> It feels like I&#x27;m wearing grease paint.</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  I have oily skin and all this does is make my face feel icky and greasy.  Can&#x27;t stand the feel on my face.  I need something lighter and not so greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t cover my uneven shade either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a BB cream, and while trying to decide between two at the store, I chose this one because it says &amp;#34;anti-aging.&amp;#34;  I thought BB creams were supposed to have a very light tint, so I wasn&#x27;t worried about the light/medium label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, if you have very fair skin (always buying the ivory powders and foundations) then this product will likely be too dark for you. I tried to apply it as thinly as possible, but after I was done, my face was darker than my neck and chest.  I will have to stick with moisturizer and foundation that I can match to my skin.</li>
    <li> Super thick; in order to get decent coverage you have to use a bit, and that leaves my skin feeling greasy; moreso than any other BBs I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I should note that this is only the second BB cream I have tried. The first was Urban Decay&#x27;s, which I personally like better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the formula of this BB cream is quite thick. Though it felt moisturizing I don&#x27;t like having heavy product on my face and this product feels heavy. It also feels like it never dries or absorbs into the skin. I&#x27;m aware that the product is on my face pretty much all day. I suppose for some people that could be a pro, but I expected (much like face moisturizers do) that this cream would eventually settle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also note that a little goes a long way. The first few times I use this cream I put on way too much. Once I stopped using so much a lot of my complaints subsided. For example, when I used too much product, it would sort of pill on top of my skin and wouldn&#x27;t blend easily. The more I blended the more the product rubbed into clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the price it&#x27;s okay as an everyday BB cream. It certainly is not my favorite product but I cannot argue the price. For times when I really want my make up to be spot on and I want to feel flawless wearing it, I will probably still reach for my urban decay BB cream over this one. I was just looking for another one to use on every day basis since the urban decay bb cream is  a little bit pricey for my current financial situation.</li>
    <li> Ugh made my face look greasy and oily!</li>
    <li> Great, smooth coverage. Does not puddle in creases. Med. color is actually pretty light and works on my fair skin. Generous size compared to some 1 oz products. This is my second tube. Very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, because I have been using the other (not anti-aging) BB Cream and really liked it. However, this stuff smells odd--almost like menthol--and the fumes bother my eyes. This stuff is also very greasy and heavy feeling. I don&#x27;t find it to be good at evening out skin tones, as the color goes on in streaks. I decided to use it only for weekends at the lake or when we&#x27;ll be outdoors doing yard work, because it doesn&#x27;t look good enough for use at work. It really doesn&#x27;t do what it promises when it comes to appearance, and the smell is awful.</li>
    <li> It has a nice thick creamy texture, goes on well, covers very well.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Every morning is my base for initial the day and make me wonderful all day. Perfect to used any one.</li>
    <li> Good product...not the same coverage you&#x27;d get with a higher end brand but you get what you pay for.  Expect to use more product to get good coverage.</li>
    <li> This cream is great, and it is just enough so that I don&#x27;t feel like I am clogging my pores. I have dry skin, especially after washing my face and usually have to moisturize and then put on a base. With this I do it all at one time. I can just pick up and go for bare minimum or put on more make up for a more complete look. Either way I feel instantly better after putting on just the cream.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be a little heavy, with a slight greasy feel.  It doesn&#x27;t work well for light skin - they would have done better sticking with separating the &#x27;light&#x27; and &#x27;medium&#x27; rather than trying to cover the shades in one product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sad that they&#x27;ve changed the formula to this product. I am searching for the original formula, but so far I&#x27;ve had no luck. This product is more of a watery consistency, and the other one is creamier. I&#x27;d really love to find the one that I have. It&#x27;s the best! I wore it today, and I was asked what kind of makeup I had on. I didn&#x27;t apply a primer or anything! I&#x27;m giving two stars because this isn&#x27;t the original product.</li>
    <li> Nice natural color without being too dark, too yellow, too orange or too streaky. I really like it. My co-workers got it too after they commented and my nice tan and found out how I got it. I bought the one for Fair/Medium skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...the color is perfect, consistency smooth, and best of all the  pigments are all mineral.  I usually wear dry mineral pigments but in the wintertime, it is just to dry for my old, dry skin! LOL..true story.  What I like best is the combination of nutrients and color..I know I am doing good things for my skin while looking better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it and try it..You will love it.  I have gotten lots of compliments....My skin , which is scarred and discolored and pitted, and everything bad you can think of...has a healthful glow to it and the coverage is great. I do not wear any extra cover-up at all...and normally I have to use a cover-up under my dry mineral makeup..but not with this.</li>
    <li> Smooth makeup. Love it so much!! Lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I ordered this BB cream in the light/medium, and it&#x27;s too dark for me. I typically wear a &amp;#34;buff beige&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural beige&amp;#34; foundation, which is usually the 3rd or 4th from lightest in most brands of foundation. I feel like I clearly fall into the middle of the category of light/medium skin, so I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ll keep this to wear in late August once I&#x27;m tan, but the product is basically unusable as is. The product itself seems good, but the color is a deal breaker, since there&#x27;s no way to order a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely Amazing! I saw results after first use.  Just gets better with each time I use it!</li>
    <li> I had bought this product in a drug store and liked it very much.  My grand daughter had bought some and said it felt greasy and she did not like it and gave it to me.  I am now on my third tube and really like it.  It gives a bit of moisture and with a bit of color on days when i am not going anywhere and do not want to fool with makeup or anything time consuming.  I have very dry skin and have to apply moisturizer a couple time a day and this works fine for me</li>
    <li> I liked the coverage, but the smell made my eyes water and the smell lingered on all day. Way too much smell for me.​</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had acne in over 5 years...until I started using this BB cream.  It made my skin oily.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> My husband told me my skin looked glowing without any prodding need I say more?  The coverage of this BB cream is light but the benefit of that is that it&#x27;s hard to make it look caked on or overdone.  I have some redness on my cheeks and this was able to diminish it to the point where it looked more like a slightly pink glow in my cheeks.  It smells good too!</li>
    <li> My skin is incredibly sensitive, and this product has been wonderful to have!  I have used it now for several weeks and it has never done anything but what it is supposed to do!</li>
    <li> I bought this to even out my skin and freckles. I have light to medium skin and am not heavily blemished or anything. Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell the difference after applying this. I even tried only doing half my face. It really doesn&#x27;t do anything. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell and it goes on nicely, not oily or too dry, but it doesn&#x27;t do what I&#x27;ve heard all the rage that a BB Cream can do. I&#x27;m Korean so I think I&#x27;ll find a Korean market and try out a real BB Cream.</li>
    <li> Too greasy and shiny for me.</li>
    <li> good color and moisturizing, but gets quite greasy looking almost right away. I don&#x27;t have that problem with other BB creams/tinted moisturizers (like Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer or Smashbox Camera Ready CC cream).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good just not good for me. I have pretty bad allergies and can&#x27;t even tolerate mascara. This stuff has a terrible effect on my eyes and sinuses and I just couldn&#x27;t continue using it even avoiding any areas around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I tried out several drugstore BB Creams when the fad hit, and this is definitely my favorite. The Light/Medium tone is a great match for my skin tone, and a little product goes a long way. The formula is creamy and I love that there&#x27;s SPF in it. Also, it&#x27;s great that you can build up product for more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use so many different products and powders to do my makeup, but I must say I love the simplicity of this BB cream. I prime my face, put on concealer, then massage a bit of this into my skin and voila! It&#x27;s very natural looking, but can look a little shiny in my T-zone, so then I have to put on some translucent powder. That&#x27;s the reason for four stars--BUT, Garnier just came out with their new formula for combination to oily skin and it&#x27;s MUCH better. The formula is a bit thinner, but seems to cover more, and it doesn&#x27;t get shiny even when it&#x27;s very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I&#x27;d say that this version is much better for my winter skin, but the new combination/oily is better for me in the summer! Also, just to let first time BB cream users know, it&#x27;s best to go to the store and test these on the back of your hand before you buy, because if I hadn&#x27;t done that, I would&#x27;ve bought 4 other creams before trying this one (which is the best for my skin, personally).</li>
    <li> I like to try new skin care products, but this is a repeat performer for me.  Goes on like a cream, covers like a light makeup, I use it every single day</li>
    <li> A little oily, but good product for cost</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, but, I find that I get breakouts when I use it. I have light-medium skin, and I didn&#x27;t find that the light-medium shade made any difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance after applying, so just putting on for light coverage days instead of foundation didn&#x27;t have the effect I wanted. I&#x27;m 53, and have pretty good skin, and I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in tone or texture after using the cream for several weeks. Instead of feeling silky when applying, I feel like I&#x27;m putting a petroleum-based product on my skin, an oily undertone. I also don&#x27;t care for the scent, it kind of smells like cheap mascara to me.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  Don&#x27;t buy the under eye bb though, waste of money.</li>
    <li> If your a human being you should be using this. It&#x27;s the best thing ever.</li>
    <li> Not for normal/oily skin. I like the color but it leaves your face feeling wet/oily. Doesn&#x27;t have a very long lasting power either.</li>
    <li> My favorite BB cream of all time.</li>
    <li> This is the best BB cream I have found.  It has a great light scent, and has made my skin smoother.</li>
