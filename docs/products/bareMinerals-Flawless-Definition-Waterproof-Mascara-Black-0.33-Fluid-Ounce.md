      <li>Nice Mascara!</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a brush but rather a wand which works surprisingly well.</li>
      <li>Great mascara, your brush comes out very clean and that is one way you can tell if you have a good mascara or not.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>The cheaper Maybelline is better than this!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better than this for any price!</li>
      <li>Works great and comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
      <li>Eye friendly, not as easy to apply as its none Waterproof counterpart,  but does not irritate and is wonderful for being in the water or menopause.</li>
      <li>Just yesterday at the gym, my friend asked what kind of mascara I was using because she&#x27;s having problems with smudging.      </li>
      <li>but you can stack coverage on this one...meaning apply wait a bit and apply again and it builds your lashes nicely.</li>
      <li>best mascara i&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>How nice to be able to get it through Amazon, saving me a trip to the mall.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I have very fine lashes...</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s paraben free, and the brush prevents clumping fairly well.</li>
      <li>I appreciate that everyone needs to find their own product for their own needs, but this is worth a try!</li>
      <li>Then, of course, the more I put on the more it smudged.  </li>
      <li>I love almost all of their products</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this mascara.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>i have use so many mascara</li>
      <li>and I love my Clinique stuff.</li>
      <li>I like better than Clinique mascara</li>
      <li>The applicator is like a comb with teeth rather than a brush with many bristles.</li>
      <li>I have used this mascara for years and was thrilled to see it available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s another story); by its 4th or 5th use, it was more tricky to put on (formula wouldn&#x27;t cooperate) and by the end of the day, I noticed it had flaked all over my cheeks.</li>
      <li>I love the brush on this product as well as the product itself.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for better, wanting a safer choice that&#x27;s waterproof...</li>
      <li>This is ok mascara.  </li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara, so easy</li>
      <li>My eyelashes fall out easily and this is great for people with sensitive skin / eyelashes -</li>
      <li>Plus is it comes off easily with face wash and water.</li>
      <li>I received it very quickly in the mail.</li>
      <li>and I was super impressed with its staying power, even after long periods of time in the water.</li>
      <li>i look fine in photos, came off easily with face wash</li>
      <li>The seller was fine.</li>
      <li>My lashes are fine and light</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have specs of mascara getting into my eyes by the end of the day and that is huge for me as I have allergies</li>
      <li>so I am comfortable.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still easy for me to clean off.</li>
      <li>always end up with light raccoon eyes by the end of the day though.</li>
      <li>Light feel without clumping and flaking</li>
      <li>and it goes on fairly smoothly....</li>
      <li>It stays on well when swimming, but is easy to clean off at night.</li>
      <li>It went on great, but the next morning I have raccoon eyes.</li>
      <li>The mascara is not waterproof, it does not have much mascara it it, and it does not do it job!!!</li>
      <li>being said, I was not disappointed by the mascara.</li>
      <li>This one not only smudges more, but you can&#x27;t build up your lashes with repeated strokes very effectively because it dries so fast and then starts to clump.  </li>
      <li>My lashes look great and long with this product!  </li>
      <li>Nice mascara for a light, natural look.</li>
      <li>Remember it is waterproof so you will want makeup remover to fully clean your lashes of the product.</li>
      <li>It covers well without leaving clumps that I have to clean up after.</li>
      <li>It does however come off cleanly with the Loreal eye makeup remover</li>
      <li>There was not really enough to determine how good the product was.</li>
      <li>Actually it can be a struggle to find a good mascara which doesn&#x27;t make me look like Tammy Faye.</li>
      <li>and it stays on for so many hours.it&#x27;s truely made of natural ingredients  and also easy to wash.to me</li>
      <li>This satisfies on both counts, plus it&#x27;s a pretty easy clean-up for a waterproof.</li>
      <li>this small wand does a very good job of separating and coloring them without it washing away with tears or perspiration or even rain.  </li>
      <li>love Bare Mineral products!!!!!</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a great everyday mascara.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something that REALLY makes your eyes pop, you will most likely not find this product satisfying.</li>
      <li>but this mascara isn&#x27;t right for me</li>
      <li>However, this isn&#x27;t my favorite of the Bare  Escentual&#x27;s line.</li>
      <li>Does stay put pretty well....until our summer weather became quite hot with some humidity.</li>
      <li>This was my first experience with any mascara from BE.</li>
      <li>Both of those have the larger more bristly brushes and I&#x27;ve gotten used to using them</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Bare Escentuals.</li>
      <li>I bought this with high hopes of it actually working, I had better luck with the Maybeline brand I tried after this.</li>
      <li>I wish this mascara elongated my eyelashes more, but I&#x27;m 40 and may not be able to get that kind of help anymore. :(</li>
      <li>it works really well.</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>This really did the trick for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>That or I blink too much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>but i found swiping some natural coconut oil on it is a gentle way to get it to wipe right off.</li>
      <li>I love their other products</li>
      <li>I can apply from the top of my lashes first and make the long sweeps without touching my eye lids thus messing up my shadow and liner and then go under my top lashes without getting any in my eye, thus going blind!</li>
      <li>The amount of mascara on the brush is just enough without getting my lashes full of clumps.</li>
      <li>I also prefer a more natural (not high volume) look.</li>
      <li>I love their non-waterproof mascara, but it did smudge slightly.  </li>
      <li>This is truly waterproof, which is the main reason I bought it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You will like this mascara if you are looking for a mascara that is gentle on the eyes, waterproof, and want a subtle/more natural looking effect.</li>
      <li>My eyes tend to be pretty sensitive, but I&#x27;ve had no issues with this product so far, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over a year now.</li>
      <li>I first tried the ID Weather Everything -- also by Bare Escentuals.  </li>
      <li>The item was new.</li>
      <li>I have used many of Bare Escentuals products, so I naturally thought this mascara would match the quality of their other products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I find that this particular formula is not the same quality as the same formula I bought a few years ago. I believe the manufacturer may have &amp;#34;cheapend out&amp;#34; a bit. The seller was fine. the formula flakes a lot underneath my eyes around noon.</li>
    <li> I have used many of Bare Escentuals products, so I naturally thought this mascara would match the quality of their other products. It went on great, but the next morning I have raccoon eyes. II do not like mascara that leaves dark circles under your eyes. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This came on time!!!&lt;br /&gt;But I thought that it would be the same as me buying it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I love Bare Mineral products!!!!! But this must be a rip off one. The mascara is not waterproof, it does not have much mascara it it, and it does not do it job!!! This sucks. This cant be the real Bare Escentuals product. Sorry but I would have returned it if I didnt use it!</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with any mascara from BE. I also reviewed the lip gloss that I bought with this mascara in the kit Lustworthy Lips and Lashes from BE. I have naturally really long and curly eyelashes (yeah I know, so sad for me right). Actually it can be a struggle to find a good mascara which doesn&#x27;t make me look like Tammy Faye. I typically use one of two- Covergirl professional super thick lash OR Loreal voluminous. I may be replacing them with this. Both of those have the larger more bristly brushes and I&#x27;ve gotten used to using them so I am comfortable. This one has the rubber skinny barely any on it (or so it seems) brush. I LOVE IT! I can apply from the top of my lashes first and make the long sweeps without touching my eye lids thus messing up my shadow and liner and then go under my top lashes without getting any in my eye, thus going blind! It covers well without leaving clumps that I have to clean up after. It also doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look strange being black while my hair is brown. I also sometimes wake up with smooshed lashes due to sleeping on my tummy and so far the brush seems to straighten those out too rather easily.&lt;br /&gt;My one concern is that the CG mascara dries and makes my lashes seem almost brittle. The Loreal seems to stay a tad tackier and takes longer to dry when first applied. This one seems to dry and then much later turns dusty. Meaning, I have rubbed my eye (slightly, not vigorously) and little mascara dust falls onto my under eye area or into my eye (and I have contacts). Not sure how I feel about that.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product. I appreciate that everyone needs to find their own product for their own needs, but this is worth a try! I love almost all of their products so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I can&#x27;t speak to the waterproof abilities since as I&#x27;ve said I have contacts and don&#x27;t typically find myself near water during the day and I haven&#x27;t cried while wearing it. Sorry. It does however come off cleanly with the Loreal eye makeup remover I use after I shower.ver I use after I shower.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, so easy on  my lashes with no mess or tearing. I give it a thumbs up...</li>
    <li> I am never caught without this product on vacations, the lake, the pool, ect!! During the summer it&#x27;s on my lashes all the time--no smudges, no irritation, and no worries about any running!  My lashes look great and long with this product!  Remember it is waterproof so you will want makeup remover to fully clean your lashes of the product.</li>
    <li> This mascara clumps easily, and doesn&#x27;t seem to go on thick or extend lashes long unless I work and work at it. I don&#x27;t like the wand but can&#x27;t exactly explain why, it&#x27;s too straight or shallow or something. I was hoping for better, wanting a safer choice that&#x27;s waterproof...I will keep on looking!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Bare Escentuals. I am very picky about what products I use on my skin and few brands can make the cut, but I&#x27;ve yet to experience any sensitivity or other issues with their products.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I was not disappointed by the mascara. However, this isn&#x27;t my favorite of the Bare  Escentual&#x27;s line. I don&#x27;t usually wear waterproof products. But I bought this for a trip to Mexico and I was super impressed with its staying power, even after long periods of time in the water. My only complaint is that it may accomplish its job too well! I usually use baby oil to remove eye makeup, but this mascara is pretty stubborn.</li>
    <li> Long-lasting, non-smudging mascara. Does not clump up so it applies evenly. Been using for years and will continue to.</li>
    <li> I love the brush on this product as well as the product itself.  Works great and comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
    <li> You have to apply about three coats of this to even see that it&#x27;s on. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have very fine lashes... but once the product is on, it stays on all day. It lasted through a shower, so it definitely is waterproof.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, your brush comes out very clean and that is one way you can tell if you have a good mascara or not. Learned that the hard way.... A brush that comes out messy and all clumped up well, that&#x27;s how it will look on your eyes. I like better than Clinique mascara and I love my Clinique stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Bare Escentuals bareMinerals black mascara on 3/04/2011. It was a very good transaction. The total price was $19.99. I received it very quickly in the mail. The seller was great.The item was new. However , there was hardly any mascara in the tube. There was just a little enough to use one time and that was all. It was regular size. I wasted my money. There was not really enough to determine how good the product was.</li>
    <li> i have use so many mascara but this one is so perfect and it stays on for so many hours.it&#x27;s truely made of natural ingredients  and also easy to wash.to me is the best mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara claims to be &amp;#34;smudge free&amp;#34;. Wrong. It smudged within a few hours of putting it on. I bought this with high hopes of it actually working, I had better luck with the Maybeline brand I tried after this. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> After a couple of applications the liquid gets clumpy. It is too bad because it is one of the better waterproof mascaras. It truly does not run if your eyes get watery.</li>
    <li> This is ok mascara.  It&#x27;s a little clumpy and I don&#x27;t think it stays on as well as other waterproof mascaras I&#x27;ve used.  Plus is it comes off easily with face wash and water.</li>
    <li> This is truly waterproof, which is the main reason I bought it. It stays on well when swimming, but is easy to clean off at night. It doesn&#x27;t go on very thick, so I have had to reapply throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Nice Mascara! Lengthens and lasts all day - cried throughout a weekend (my son graduated from Basic Training - with Honors…)and i look fine in photos, came off easily with face wash</li>
    <li> I tried with alone and with their waterproof coat, and unfortunately, I had raccoon eyes...not really waterproof :(, try Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous Butterfly waterproof mascara, it stays on!</li>
    <li> I purchased this despite seeing an earlier review that it smudged...I should have listended to her!  I love their non-waterproof mascara, but it did smudge slightly.  This one not only smudges more, but you can&#x27;t build up your lashes with repeated strokes very effectively because it dries so fast and then starts to clump.  Then, of course, the more I put on the more it smudged.  They need to go back to the drawing board on this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I love it. I haven&#x27;t found anything better than this for any price!</li>
    <li> I wish this mascara elongated my eyelashes more, but I&#x27;m 40 and may not be able to get that kind of help anymore. :( On a different note, this mascara is easy to apply and is definitely waterproof, as my eyes tear up regularly (not from the mascara). I love that it&#x27;s paraben free, and the brush prevents clumping fairly well. My eyes tend to be pretty sensitive, but I&#x27;ve had no issues with this product so far, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over a year now. All in all, it&#x27;s a great everyday mascara.</li>
    <li> And I recommend that you try this in a department store before you order it, too. I wear contacts and prefer waterproof mascara so that all my blinking doesn&#x27;t leave me with raccoon eyes. I also prefer a more natural (not high volume) look. This satisfies on both counts, plus it&#x27;s a pretty easy clean-up for a waterproof. If this is all you need to know, go ahead and order. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be unhappy.</li>
    <li> I have been pleasantly surprised with this mascara  My lashes are fine and light colored and this small wand does a very good job of separating and coloring them without it washing away with tears or perspiration or even rain.  The wand sold it for me and the long wear was a bonus</li>
    <li> Eye friendly, not as easy to apply as its none Waterproof counterpart,  but does not irritate and is wonderful for being in the water or menopause.</li>
    <li> I hate getting racoon eyes from mascara, so I&#x27;m always looking for a good mascara that won&#x27;t smudge.  I first tried the ID Weather Everything -- also by Bare Escentuals.  I was happy with it, but had problems (with availability) re-ordering.  This one goes on easier and provides excellent lash coverage.  Just yesterday at the gym, my friend asked what kind of mascara I was using because she&#x27;s having problems with smudging.      I recommend this one -- it works really well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. Doesn&#x27;t clump or smudge.</li>
    <li> The brush is too big for my eyes and went on dry and flaky.  I threw it away the next day.  I love their other products but this mascara isn&#x27;t right for me</li>
    <li> Really disappointed by this mascara. I purchased it in hopes of finding a no-fuss, fool-proof mascara to bring with me on a long trip overseas. The first few times I used it, the product lived up to its promises: lashes were defined, slightly volumized (in a natural way), soft and lush.  However, the tube seemed to dry out really fast (despite my scrupulous care with products... but that&#x27;s another story); by its 4th or 5th use, it was more tricky to put on (formula wouldn&#x27;t cooperate) and by the end of the day, I noticed it had flaked all over my cheeks. Not cute. I threw the tube out when this happened again the next day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, but was not happy with it because while it is waterproof, it&#x27;s very thin and you have to swipe it multiple times through your lashes for anything to stay. It is not very bold and doesn&#x27;t show up very well. Also, difficult to clean off of eyes.</li>
    <li> best mascara i&#x27;ve tried so far. it&#x27;s affordable and makes my lashes look so long! plus it lasts all day without melting and giving me raccoon eyes which is what i was looking for. its sometimes hard to clean off but i found swiping some natural coconut oil on it is a gentle way to get it to wipe right off.</li>
    <li> The amount of mascara on the brush is just enough without getting my lashes full of clumps. It seems to be waterproof as it stays on overnight.</li>
    <li> The mascara is not waterproof as is falsely advertised.  I&#x27;ve had other non-waterproof mascaras that smear less than this one.  Also the brush leaves clumps of mascara on my lashes.  Not very good for a natural &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; look I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara for a light, natural look. No clumping. The applicator is like a comb with teeth rather than a brush with many bristles. Does stay put pretty well....until our summer weather became quite hot with some humidity. Then I noticed after a couple hours in the heat I had smudging and a bit of &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found it! Love this mascara. Waterproof, very dark and coats my lashes pretty thick. Highly recommended! Get it!</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. The brush seperates my lashes without leaving clumps. I don&#x27;t have specs of mascara getting into my eyes by the end of the day and that is huge for me as I have allergies and it is hard for me to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate them.</li>
    <li> About the only mascara I could find that doesn&#x27;t clump up on the brush.  Would purchase this item again on-line.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes fall out easily and this is great for people with sensitive skin / eyelashes - no loss whatsoever with this product and it goes on fairly smoothly....</li>
    <li> Light feel without clumping and flaking</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years and was thrilled to see it available on Amazon.  This mascara is truly waterproof and totally amazing!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m past the age of ever having thick full lashes again so I need a product that will color my very pale lashes without additives (sensitive eyes) or clumping. Every tube is perfect and I can use it with ease. This isn&#x27;t a brush but rather a wand which works surprisingly well. Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always end up with light raccoon eyes by the end of the day though. It&#x27;s not really waterproof. That or I blink too much.</li>
    <li> Best water proof mascara I&#x27;ve found but I like not having clumpy lashes.  I tend toward the natural look but you can stack coverage on this one...meaning apply wait a bit and apply again and it builds your lashes nicely.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years.  I use all the Bare Escentuals line of products, so does my daughter.</li>
    <li> The worst mascara I have ever used.  Gives me raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof but it&#x27;s still easy for me to clean off. I like the brush on it because it doesn&#x27;t leave chunks and it helps define my lashes. I&#x27;m glad I found this mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought this product knowing that it is not as thick or as flashy as other mascaras out there.  I did not really want any crazy flashy eye makeup, I was just looking for something that would make my eyes stand out a little more.  This really did the trick for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will like this mascara if you are looking for a mascara that is gentle on the eyes, waterproof, and want a subtle/more natural looking effect. If you are looking for something that REALLY makes your eyes pop, you will most likely not find this product satisfying.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara because of the reviews. I needed a mascara that could stand up to the humidity of summer.  This by far was the the worst one I have tried.  My eyelashes ended up curling down even after using an eyelash curler and applying several coats. The cheaper Maybelline is better than this!</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that I use.  The brush does not get all cakey over time and the mascara remains creamy.  How nice to be able to get it through Amazon, saving me a trip to the mall.</li>
