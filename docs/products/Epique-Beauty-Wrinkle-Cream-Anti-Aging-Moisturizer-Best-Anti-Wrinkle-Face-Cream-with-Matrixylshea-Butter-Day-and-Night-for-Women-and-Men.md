<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have dry skin and this product makes it worse--I was really surprised!</li>
    <li> I had my order within 2 days of placing my order. Fast and reliable. Cream is not greasy like others I have tried in the past. Over all good product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff.  It works great for those fine lines around the eyes.  You only have to use a small amount so this makes the bottle last a long time.  My skin always feels silky and very moisturized.  I would recommend this for anyone like me needing a good moisturizer that helps decrease the fine lines!</li>
    <li> This is great Anti aging Moisturizer cream. I hate to see fine lines and creases under my eyes. It shows more when i smile. I was looking for a anti aging serum/cream. Luckily I got this product. It is light weight on skin. It makes my skin so soft, smooth and helps me in dryness. It smells really nice. This product is amazing. I would highly recommend this product for the wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
    <li> This Epique Beauty Anti-Aging Moisturizer Cream is my first purchase from this brand name, as well as the Seller.  It includes an array of ingredients for beauty enhancement, firming skin, anti-aging properties, and to decrease fine lines/wrinkles in the face area and hands.  It includes Matrixyl, Glycerin, Tetrapeptide, Shea Butter, Peppermint Oil, and Green Tea Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there are so many anti-aging moisturizer creams, it would take years for each woman to try all of them.  I decided to purchase and test this brand first; the ingredients would be a correct combination for my skin/face, and/or hands, at a very reasonable price.  If you do not like the product you have options, and a good return policy.  You only need to spray a few drops of this moisturizing cream in your hands, mix, and apply to your face, as it seems concentrated.  It has a non-greasy, silky feel to your skin, since I have sensitive skin, it did not burn, or itch with any red spots appearing.  I have not had any sensitive or allergic reactions to this moisturizer cream, so that tells me it is made of great ingredients.  It is a great moisturizer cream that I can add to my collection of beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you apply it to your face, you would smell a minty smell for at least a few seconds, then the smell goes away, and you do not smell anything that is strong to your senses, or your environment.  I used some on my hands to test first, before applying to my face; it is a very silky and smooth moisturizing cream, keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day/night. It keeps your skin very moisturized, it would not be necessary to use with another moisturizer, unless you have a facial regime that requires layering/mixing other products together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely wrapped very tight and shrink-wrapped.  Please remember to have patience with opening and un-wrapping the seals around this spray, it is sealed very tight. It was extremely hard to open and sealed very securely.  The Seller described this product accurately, and also claims that it has the best ingredients for daily hydrating skins of all types, absorbs quickly, and improves the appearance of facial wrinkles by aiding the build-up of collagen. The Seller also stated that the product has an advanced formula that works and is proven in eliminating and reducing fine lines, wrinkles and sign of aging. When used regularly, you will see significant results on your skin. It helps your skin by building up collagen needed to keep your skin healthy. We stand for our quality and rest assure that you&#x27;ll have the best possible anti-aging cream in the market.

    <li> Epique anti-aging moisturizer is wonderful for your face and neck.  It comes in a great pump bottle with all the many ingredients listed.  Total weight of the bottle is a full 1.0 oz. The bottle also has a caution section listed.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I am in awe at the new appearance of my skin after using this cream.  I glides on over my skin and has a very nice light scent, and after only a few days of use the fine lines are smoothing out and my skin has a healthier glow! The combination of ingredients works well together for all skin types especially on combination skin.  I like the fact that it is a day and night cream.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love this stuff!!!!! I had no idea what to expect due to me receiving if as part of a promotion . But I was pleasantly surprised . I was so excited I got my husband to try it !! He loved it as well !!! I like the packaging the texture of the cream and the scent it fresh and clean !! I highly recommend this to anyone really man child</li>
    <li> I am a face cream freak.  I am obsessed with not getting wrinkles and love to try different products.  That&#x27;s why I was so excited to receive this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.  This cream dispenses easily and has a light, fresh scent.  It absorbs easily into my skin and does not have a greasy feeling.  I put it on in the mornings under my makeup and is keeps my face moisturized all day.  It makes my face feel hydrated.  I also like that this product in made in the USA.</li>
    <li> 7/11/15: Update....I decided to give this product 4 stars, instead of 3, because it relieved my sunburned face today! However, here is what I wrote earlier and I still support this: This cream is very light, which I like, but I needed to use use A LOT of this (4 pumps) because of my dry skin. That can become very expensive with only 1 oz in a bottle! I am 51 years young and even with using more product, it was not enough to soften my &amp;#34;smile wrinkles&amp;#34;.  However, it did help other areas between my brows and forehead. I do not plan on buying this product again.</li>
    <li> There are so many wonderful reasons why we should all try this product and to trust that we will see results that will make us smile from using this Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream by Epique Beauty.  First of all this product is made here in the United States and it is made with natural ingredients that we have all heard/can pronounce correctly the first time.  I  received this product in exchange for my opinion and unbiased review. I&#x27;ve been looking to try an anti-aging product to help with a few wrinkles appearing recently by my eyes, and this product will help revitalize your skin to regain the youthful glow again.  I have been looking for a product that will help slow down the signs of aging with wrinkles by my eyes, that is effective without costing a fortune at the same time.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something to help keep their skin smooth and soft; while slowing down the signs of aging  or damage to the skin from the environment.</li>
    <li> Not as great as it claims to be. Have not noticed any difference and not recommended for sensitive skin type.</li>
    <li> I thought this moisturizer was very rich on my skin, it has a very thick texture but not greasy. I liked how easy it was to use and fit in perfectly with my evening beauty regime. I&#x27;ve used shea butter in the past but not from this brand. I really liked the feel of this product and it did give my skin a nice shine to it. I&#x27;ve still got young skin so I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to test that part on but it works well as an under moisturizer for make-up.  I would recommend this product from my experience so far.</li>
    <li> It is the best rejuvenation cream for me to build-up my collagen and add on protection to against UV rays or harsh damage from external environment. The combination material in formula has includes Pentapeptides, this nutrition improves the appearance Of facial wrinkles situation. After I used this product a span of 14 days, my face was looks younger than before.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer cream! This definitely tops all ive had so far, I definitely would buy this over expensive stuff. Not only does this work effectively but quick! You actually are getting whst you pay for and you see results! Dont believe me? Try for yourself and youll see! Its cheap and works!</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Not to heavy. Has a cool sensation when you put it on. Nice smell. Leaves my face soft. It&#x27;s strainge, but I can feel it it working ing my skin later after I put it on. Saw a nice difference in the texture of my skin in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin an suffer from adult acne. This product does wonderful and no reaction. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t look my age, and I plan to keep it that way. If you want to find an inexpensive way to try all the latest advances in anti-aging technology, get this cream! It has everything! Matrixyl, rose hip oil, shea butter, pentapeptide... the list goes on and on. This cream is packed with good stuff to keep your skin looking young, fresh, and wrinkle free. I cannot tell you how much my skin loves this cream. It just drinks it in and reaps the benefits. With all of the world&#x27;s hottest and best anti-aging supplements and a 30-day money back guarantee, what do you have to lose? I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity to try this product, and I know you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>

    <li> My skin has always been very dry, since using the anti aging moisturizer cream my face feels much smoother and the wrinkles are disappearing daily.  My crows feet have have dramatically decreased and with continued use i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll they will vanish.</li>
    <li> I love this product so light and makes your skin feel amazing. I recommend this product highly i use it daily and love the results.</li>
    <li> Im glad that I made this purchase. Very moisturizng cream. I use it along with Olely Niacinamide Serum, they work very well together.</li>
    <li> Thank you it&#x27;s amazing item</li>
    <li> I am in my sixties and was looking for a good wrinkle cream. Only been using it for a few days but already see diminished wrinkles. Not greasy and no odor. Only need a small amount so should last a long time. Hard to get out of bottle. I bang it against my palm and dip fingers in to apply. Great product. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This cream is one of my top five moisturizers that i have used. It is good for all the skin types. i have very dry skin especially on my forehead and cheeks and after even one use it leaves my skin flawless, rejuvenated and refreshed. I also let my sister use it and she loves it as well. Her skin is the opposite of mine. Hers is very oily. It works miracles for her skin as well. I had to tell her her and to order her own moisturizer because she was using mine all the time. It has also helped me with the wrinkles on my forehead and my co-workers complimented my skin already.</li>
    <li> I have finally begun to hit that age where signs of aging are beginning to creep up on me. As I have found that time waits for no man, or no woman, that I need to start using the Anti-Aging Moisturiziers  now. For me the hard part was finding a good one that did not cost a fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Anti Aging Moisturizing Cream that is made by Epique Beauty is a great product. It has all kinds of wonderful things in it like Shea Butter and Green Trea Extract.  I have always been a great fan of anything with Shea Butter in it and I love the smell, and Green Tree Extract is great too, and mixing them together just makes for a good smelling natural product that adds moisture to your skin and makes you look youthful and radiant and ads a glow to your skin without making you look oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worth the price, and it worked above my expectations, and I was very pleasxed with how it looked, so pleased in fact that I have begun to share this new beauty secret with all my friends. I am glad I came across this product and I will be using it for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> The creme is working great so far. I have only used it a few times. For sure, I am continuing use to get the best results!</li>
    <li> I love it I&#x27;m 44 and I look like I&#x27;m in my early 30s this and another product I bought have helped me remove the wrinkles from my life and give my skin that nice glossy look I once had back in the day! Everyone needs to order this and try it from themselves no disappointments here!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad I got this cream. I&#x27;m at the age of getting fine wrinkes and it has made pretty sad. But this cream has already smoothed out some and I can feel my skin firming. I love it.. :)</li>
    <li> Awesome results! Very rich lightweight formula. Mild scent! Didn&#x27;t make my skin too oily ;)</li>
    <li> product minimized wrinkles. They don&#x27;t appear to be as deep as they once were</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. I&#x27;ve had a problem with moisturizers making my skin too oily. This product doesn&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s a day and night cream in one bottle. It has a pleasant scent and feels like silk going on and its reasonably priced. I like that it&#x27;s for all skin types because my boyfriend uses it too and it&#x27;s made in America. I use it in conjunction with Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> This is one great item. I am totally in love with it. I started using this every night after I get my bath. I am in my 50&#x27;s and I am starting to show my age a lot because I have been through rough times and bad health. Since I have been using this I have had people tell me that I look a lot better and I am younger looking by at least 5 to 7 years they tell me. I also see that I am looking a little younger and my face is so much smoother now also. Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
    <li> One of the better wrinkle creams i have ever used!!!  I started getting crows feet around 25 years old. This is amazing. Around my eyes are smooth just after a few days!!  Great product! I am so happy I got it!! I will recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.  This is my first experience using this brand.  I am loving it.  It has a nice pump bottle.  It&#x27;s made in the USA.  I have been using about 10 days.  I do have some crows feet and they are dimishing.  My eyes are looking smooth.  I have oily skin and this moisturizer is not greasy.  Has a nice smell of mint.  My skin is definitely looking more radiant and youthful.  I  did receive this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for any skin type. Both myself and my daughter use it, I have normal/oily skin and she has normal/dry skin. It is quick absorbing and non greasy, it is also very light and does not feel heavy on the skin. It&#x27;s has a nice clean scent that is not harsh. I love the fact that it is all natural and made in the U.S.A. If you are looking for a light moisturizer that is pretty much skin perfect in my book look no further, cause it&#x27;s right here! I really like this cream a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A disclaimer and disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product in exchange for a review.

    <li> I love this product, always did not feel comfortable going out specially because the wrinkles i have but soon after i got this product i noticed its amazing results such a great product for a reasonable price would totally recommend it for anyone trying to have perfect skin.</li>
    <li> Finally an anti aging product that isn&#x27;t sticky and gummy! This is a high quality product and it really works! I love the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles that I&#x27;m seeing!</li>
    <li> My face feels so refreshed and soft.  I love the feel the Shea Butter ...peptides...green tea....give my skin...nice feel...nice smell.</li>
    <li> This Anti Aging Moisturizer is definitely a miracle product. I have always had dark baggy circles under my eyes. I tried several different products but none of them really worked like they were supposed to. I had a wrinkle cream grave yard like they say on that commercial. This product does everything you need in just one moisturizer. The skin under my eyes has tightened and I do not have any more dark circles. My face is no longer dry it is soft and smooth. I use it once a day and I am so happy with the results.  The fine lines and wrinkles I had around my eyes have smoothed out. I recommend this product to anyone looking for real results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always in the market for a great face cream and I have to say I am extremely impressed with the Epique Beauty anti-aging moisturizer cream. The light scent is really quite nice and the cream itself isn&#x27;t terribly heavy like a lot of anti-aging creams are. I use a BB cream during the day and I started using this at night. After only a few nights, I did notice a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes. Not a huge difference, but to see any difference in just a few uses is impressive. I am going to continue using this product and reap the benefits of newly rejuvenated skin!</li>
    <li> It works on the 1st day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers over the years and this is the absolute best. From the discount drug store brands to expensive department store counter creams none compared. The cream goes on smooth and smells clean. There is no strong fragrance or greasy feel left on your fingers after applying. I&#x27;ve been using it in the evening before bed and wake up with smoother skin every single morning. I wish I would have bought this decades ago. Definitely would recommend it even for those with sensitive skin or that have not noticed many wrinkles yet. Combined with a good exfoliating process this would be a powerful anti aging tool.</li>
    <li> I like the Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream.  I find it a little hard to put my foundation on though because once it dries I cannot get my foundation on my face as it does not glide on easily therefore I put another moisturizer over top of it to make it easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Awesome. I hit that age where I am aging and need some cream. I have tried many other creams, but this one stood out to me. The other expensive ones like $50 or so, I do not see any difference on them, but when I use this one I can tell it works way better. The price is great too!</li>
    <li> Got this and is really great!!! I feel younger every time I use this Anti Aging Moisturizer. It made my face really clean and smooth which is really amazing. One great feature about it is that it absorbs really quick and makes your face really clean. I highly recommend this cream if you want to have healthier skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now have not seen the results that others have talked about, fine lines still sit on my face! Very smooth and soft and price was good, still using twice a day so maybe a future update will follow with better results.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer cream because it absorbed fast. After just a few day of usage I feel my skin looked better.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this moisturizer. The smell was heavenly. I&#x27;m approaching 40 and knew I needed a little something extra. I noticed my skin looks like it glows!</li>
