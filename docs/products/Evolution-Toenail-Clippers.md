### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I now have perfect nails.  </li>
      <li>but I think this is the best.</li>
      <li>Clips the nails perfectly and without effort.  </li>
      <li>Best 20 bucks I ever spent ---easy to use!!!  </li>
      <li>I would have ordered more.  </li>
      <li>After trying for a moment, she braced herself, got a better grip and applied more pressure.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to use.</li>
      <li>This toenail clipper is very sharp and gives you excellent force to cut your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Arthritic hands could not get a good grip on the short handles.</li>
      <li>Bought a set for my 86 year old Mother who can now do her own nails again.</li>
      <li>Sharp edge, great leverage, makes a clean cut, without &amp;#34;chewing&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>But better than the standard type, for sure.</li>
      <li>These Denco clippers clip the nails quickly and easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First time ever!</li>
      <li>Nice and sharp and easy to use if you only have one hand; metal is rather light weight.</li>
      <li>Denco has a lifetime guarantee and my girlfriend through my first pair away before I could send it in for a replacement.</li>
      <li>Fell apart (handle broke and separated from clipper body) upon the FIRST use.</li>
      <li>Large handles make operation a breeze with large fingers like mine!</li>
      <li>I wondered about the plasticky handles but it seems very sturdy.</li>
      <li>must admit I did not realize it did not close for storage, but is always at the ready for use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them but they should be used with care.</li>
      <li>The jaws open just a little more than the current one which is quite popular and a pretty shade of blue and white and swivels, but swivel or no, my hubby had less trouble with this one.</li>

<li> /&gt;These are sharp and held edge, and really make cutting nail easy; also bought pair for family member who loves them.</li>
<li> The jaw did not open wide enough.</li>
<li> The wider opening have been too long in coming.</li>
<li> did not open far enough for one thick toe nail.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t open wider than any other toenail clipper.</li>
<li> the opening is a little wider than regular toe nail clippers</li>
<li> We have gone through several of these little guys</li>
<li> With age it becomes harder to reach down and do your toe nails.  </li>
<li> Works well, though a little large for my small, weak hands.  </li>
<li> Too bad they are no longer available.  </li>
<li> The clippers are very sharp.</li>
<li> Not strong enough to clip really, really hard toe nails.  </li>
<li> Due to thick nails I have needed these for ages.</li>
<li> Mine broke after a few trims on tough nails</li>
<li> I have a very thick nail on one toe, so I bought this on the basis that it cut thick nails.</li>

    <li> Nice and sharp and easy to use if you only have one hand; metal is rather light weight.</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper is very sharp and gives you excellent force to cut your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit I did not realize it did not close for storage, but is always at the ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Metal Broke within 3 mos</li>
    <li> Sharp edge, great leverage, makes a clean cut, without &amp;#34;chewing&amp;#34;. I wondered about the plasticky handles but it seems very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough to clip really, really hard toe nails.  Arthritic hands could not get a good grip on the short handles.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t open wider than any other toenail clipper.</li>
    <li> I had a similar product before this and, somehow, lost it.  This is just what I was looking for.  With age it becomes harder to reach down and do your toe nails.  This is perfect.  Clips the nails perfectly and without effort.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Mine broke after a few trims on tough nails</li>
    <li> The wider opening have been too long in coming. The extra power with no effort is another topper. Due to thick nails I have needed these for ages. Bought a set for my 86 year old Mother who can now do her own nails again.</li>
    <li> A piece of junk - same as the fingernail clipper. It has been pitched in the trash bin.</li>
    <li> Denco Evolution Toenail Clippers 8530 [Misc.]&lt;br /&gt;Ultra&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sharp and held edge, and really make cutting nail easy; also bought pair for family member who loves them.</li>
    <li> Too bad they are no longer available.  I would have ordered more.  Large handles make operation a breeze with large fingers like mine!</li>
    <li> Best 20 bucks I ever spent ---easy to use!!!  I now have perfect nails.  First time ever!</li>
    <li> did not open far enough for one thick toe nail. the opening is a little wider than regular toe nail clippers</li>
    <li> Fell apart (handle broke and separated from clipper body) upon the FIRST use.</li>
    <li> Said it would cut the thickess nails...well if that is the truth....the opening needs to be bigger.</li>
    <li> My toenails are tougher than US Steel. When I was laid up after a hip replacement, my daughter tried to trim my toenails for me. After trying for a moment, she braced herself, got a better grip and applied more pressure. The toenail clippers broke! I bought some of the plier type, which did the job, but with some effort. These Denco clippers clip the nails quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution. The clippers are very sharp. While clipping one toe, the edge of the clippers caught the skin of the adjacent toe and brought blood. I highly recommend them but they should be used with care.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick nail on one toe, so I bought this on the basis that it cut thick nails. It did not. The jaw did not open wide enough. I discarded it and went for a pedicure.</li>
    <li> We have gone through several of these little guys but I think this is the best. The jaws open just a little more than the current one which is quite popular and a pretty shade of blue and white and swivels, but swivel or no, my hubby had less trouble with this one. I&lt;br /&gt;will say that the only drawback is that it does not fold up. Doesn&#x27;t matter to us, but it might matter to you.</li>
    <li> Works well, though a little large for my small, weak hands.  But better than the standard type, for sure.</li>
    <li> My second pair !! Denco has a lifetime guarantee and my girlfriend through my first pair away before I could send it in for a replacement. That clipper works so well I ordered and paid for another !!!</li>
