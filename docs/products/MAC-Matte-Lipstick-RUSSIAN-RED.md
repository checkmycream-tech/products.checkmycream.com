<li> if your looking for a red with pink in it, go for this color.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t stand the mess, so I am sticking with my long lasting Covergirl lipstain.</li>
<li> I love the color of the lipstick but a little disappointed bcuz it won&#x27;t stay that long when i drink or eat , I had to do retouch</li>
<li> Was skeptical at first about buying a lipstick without seeing the color in person, but the name of the color caught my eyes and once I received it</li>
<li> The lipstick glides on smooth but even with a good lip pencil base it bleeds VERY badly.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> One of the sexiest reds I&#x27;ve ever used. Smooth &amp; velvety, high pigment.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first about buying a lipstick without seeing the color in person, but the name of the color caught my eyes and once I received it I couldn&#x27;t believe how gorgeous the colored looked against my tan skin! This color is amazing, it defineitly made my lips stand out and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it during an outing with the girls!!!</li>
    <li> i love this color, is my favorite!</li>
    <li> as expected, a nice blue-red tint.  stays on well, would buy again</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this lipstick as I had read many good reviews. First of all it is a darker color than I expected. I was told it was more of a Marilyn Monroe red, but that is not the case. The lipstick glides on smooth but even with a good lip pencil base it bleeds VERY badly. I can&#x27;t stand the mess, so I am sticking with my long lasting Covergirl lipstain.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;re dreaming of finding the perfect Madonna lipstick from Desperately Seeking Susan - rich, velvety, pigmented, like clothing for your skin. I read somewhere that this is the lipstick she used on the blonde ambition tour, but I don&#x27;t buy it. Either that was some kind of PR trick or they changed the formula. This is one is not that highly pigmented, it&#x27;s shiny, and it&#x27;s more magenta to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally stumbled  upon NYX&#x27;s Matte Lipstick in Perfect Red and that&#x27;s really what it is - perfect. Try that. Dense, gorgeous color, stays on (except after eating). It has the kind of waxy, rich, thick formula that you actually need to pull off the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway that&#x27;s my 2 cents!!</li>
    <li> Everything is fine thanks!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous matte color. MAC quality.  If you like reds, this is a great shade to have. I love red mattes because they are classic and glamorous.</li>
    <li> TOTALLY amazing! most expensive make up i have but its totally worth it (senior picture ready)</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, applies easily and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the same complexion as Jennifer Hudson.  A PERFECT MATCH for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several MAC lipsticks.  And I don&#x27;t believe that this a MAC product.  BUYER BEWARE</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I was expecting a deep rich red. It wears like a red lip stain. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color, been looking for this red for long time. Delivery excellent</li>
    <li> I seriously LOVE Russian Red. This is my favorite red so far from MAC. It matches with pretty much any skin tone, very complimentary.</li>
    <li> As red as it gets, not for everyone and not for daytime wear. Great for the night out but less is more.</li>
    <li> if your looking for a red with pink in it, go for this color. looks great on and feels soft and smooth when applied</li>
    <li> The order came right away :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is so beautiful too. 5 stars</li>
    <li> Beautiful colour and amazing quality. I&#x27;m loving this lipstick. Totally worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous velvety color on the lips</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT RUSSIAN RED ALL THE WAY........</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick!! Great shade and it stays on forever practically. It lasted about 4 hours through eating, drinking and smoking cigarettes. Applied after that and it lasted all day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lipstick! It&#x27;s a darker red and not too bright, and it lasts all day! I have gotten so many compliments on this lipstick and plan on keeping this one in my lipstick rotation.</li>
    <li> I love the color of the lipstick but a little disappointed bcuz it won&#x27;t stay that long when i drink or eat , I had to do retouch</li>
    <li> Great color lipstick.  Stay on all day.  I will continue to use this.</li>
