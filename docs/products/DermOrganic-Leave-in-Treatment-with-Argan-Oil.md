<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for hair! One of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair that tends to be on the fuller side, but the individual strands are somewhat thin.  Thus, it is imperative that I keep the ends well hydrated.  I am going on my fourth bottle because this leave-in does such a great job of staving of split ends and keeping my hair very healthy.  I am generally able to wait at least 60, and sometimes up to 90 days before needing a trim.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair oily, but I guess it is expected since it is OIL:)</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and use this as a detangler after I shampoo. I only use a couple of drops to make it easy to comb my hair without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used another brand of a similar argan oil product, and it was thicker. I prefer this weight. It adds shine and manageability without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> I received the product earlier than expected.There were no problems.  Well done.&lt;br /&gt;The oil leaves the hair soft and silky.  I love the feel of my hair after I put the oil on.</li>
    <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful ingredients.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair weighed down or oily and has a really nice smell.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this on my hair when I visit her. I used to buy it from her, but she recently raised her price to $25 a bottle! I decided to look on Amazon and was pleased to see it for sale for much less money. I bought two bottles and it was shipped quickly (and for free). I use this product because I have naturally wavy, frizzy hair. I use a flat iron usually and this product not only protects from the heat, but smooths and defrizzes at the same time. I even use it on my daughter&#x27;s VERY curly hair (think tight ringlets). It takes away her frizz and leaves her curls soft and fragrant. I use throughout the styling process: on my wet hair (about quarter sized dallop--I have med. long hair), then during blowdrying and flat ironing (just rub a little through out section being straightened or dryed), and a little afterwards smoothed through my hair to take away the last of the frizzies. If you use too much, your hair gets oily faster.</li>
    <li> I just received this and let me tell you it is wonderful.  I have many Argan products and they are just too oily for my fine thin hair.  But this is perfect.  I used a few drops and ran it through my wet hair and when I blew it dry it was full and shiney.  All of Dermorganics haircare that I have tried is wonderful.  There hasn&#x27;t been a product yet that I haven&#x27;t been happy with.  Try them all you will love them!!!</li>
    <li> I moved to Wyoming a few years ago and panicked when my hair lost its shine and became brittle and dry.  My sister gave me a bottle of this fantastic repair in a bottle, and my hair is so healthy now, it doesn&#x27;t even want to hold the curl.  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used by far, and my hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s been in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl Bradshaw, Author</li>
    <li> Argan oil is one of those great products that you can use for anything from cooking to using as a facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is on the dry side. It is also fine. I have been using this for about 2 months now and I like it very much. Used minimally this goes a long way. I normally apply a small amount (less than a dime) and work it through my freshly washed wet hair paying special attention to the ends and then I style it with a blow dryer on a low setting. The end result is shiney and smooth hair that seems to have a good moisture balance.&lt;br /&gt;This has a slightly fruity scent that is pleasant and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I normally use Josie Maran Argan Oil on my face and neck, but forgot it so I used this on my face and arms as well and was surprised that this actually did a good job and was comparable to the Maran product. For what it&#x27;s worth, I think argan oil must be the equivalent to liquid gold. It is as marvelous moisturizer, but works well on the hair as well.</li>
    <li> I started using this after my salon put it on my hair one day.  I literally came back and asked to purchase a bottle.  I know they have used the Morraccan oil on my hair, but this left much better results.  After I had my hair colored and cut, it kept my hair soft and bouncy long after.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Dermorganic Leave-in Treatment with Argan Oil, 4 Ounce is a great, nourishing treatment. I have very fine hair which, up until i began using this product coupled with an organic shampoo, used to be very damaged. Instant results with this  leave in treatment, better than usual leave in conditioners. CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG WITH ARGAN OIL :)</li>
    <li> I love the leave in treatment!  I actually got a sample from the girl that cuts my hair. I instantly loved it. My hair had the just got my hair cut feel. I also have a natural wave in my hair that causes a frizz if I just leave it after I get out of the shower. I put this in my hair.... It dries faster and less frizz. Looks so great!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of all the talk about Argan Oil.  I thought I should give it a try.  I chose DermOrganic because it has the least cones compared to the other brands - it&#x27;s more natural.  A little goes a long way.  This leave-in treatment made my hair shiny and helped reduce frizz and fly-aways.  I actually like the grape scent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
    <li> the product did not meet my expectations</li>
    <li> I had a keratin treatment, and this is a safe product to use.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a polish look and avoid unruly hair.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. My hair has an excellent shine to it, and it conditions/softens very well. Also, it speeds up the drying time for your hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I first learned of it through my professional hair stylist who recommended it for my hair. As I age, my has become drier and finer in texture. DermOrganic is lightweight and a little goes a long way. With heat activation, this product soaks into the hair shaft, smoothing fly-aways.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Only draw back is if I use it everyday my scalp starts to break out</li>
    <li> I was given this product as a sample from my hair dresser - went to Barbados recently and used this every day straight out of the ocean - my hair looked and felt amazing and manageable. Its hard to have both being that I have extensions. I used it from my ends on up and brushed it in. Weightless and scentless - my vacation was that much better because my hair was manageable.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil, it leaves my hair soft with shine, and helps keep it from tangles.  The only detriment is the smell, but its a minor complaint.</li>
    <li> Never ever buy it. So disappointed. Smell is a big put off at first. and does nothing just weighs down hair and they look oily like any cheap serum out there.</li>
    <li> First off let me just say that this is a really awesome price for this product. I&#x27;ve bought it for around $25 so this is a major steal. This stuff is amazing! Leaves your hair super soft and manageable while protecting from heat damage. The smell is great and it lingers even after you use the flat iron on Your hair. I love this stuff and you will too!</li>
    <li> This leave-in treatment has done a lot of repair and restoration to my hair!!! I love the fact that you leave it on and it will help your hair no matter what you do to it or how you style it. It is an amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles on Amazon after discovering the shampoo at TJ Maxx. I was told by a hair dresser argan oil is great for colored-treated hair. I have both the non-spray bottle formula &amp; the spray bottle formula - both are referred to as a leave-in treatment to seal, protect and add shine and ingredients are pretty close although the spray does seem lighter and a tad less oily. I recently had thumb surgery and have to wear a fiberglass cast for 4-6 weeks. My husband washes my hair with the Dermorganic conditioning shampoo. Rather than ask him to comb conditioner through my hair and rinse, I&#x27;ve been using this as an alternative to traditional shower conditioner. Very happy and some vendors on Amazon sell for less than TJ Maxx; FYI both leave-in treatments are $12.99/bottle @TJM and shampoo is $16.99 @TJM.</li>
    <li> Nice texture!Excellent fragance, and does facilitate drying time, which was boasted as a product description. I have medium length hair, and it last quite a while.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair soft and shiny, not greasy. I&#x27;ve never used anything like it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used this item before, and it is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;It makes hair very soft and gets rid of frizz. A little goes a long&lt;br /&gt;way so it lasts. Difficult to find in stores. Similar items at Sephora&lt;br /&gt;cost 2-4 times as much!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a whole. It&#x27;s helps my hair dry faster puts a beautiful shine to it. Just something I use every time I wash my hair</li>
    <li> This product prevents my hair from frizzing up. I apply a small dime size in my medium lenght hair each morning. I wish it smelled a little better. It doesn&#x27;t stink but I&#x27;m used to other products that smell more pleasant. besides that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> The chemicals used for a recent perm dried and damaged my hair.  The oil has been great to soothe and soften it.</li>
    <li> My Dad brought me home a sample of this over a year ago, along with the shampoo and treatment conditioner. I really loved all of them but feel like this was the most beneficial product of the three. I have naturally curly hair. This really makes my curls much smoother and adds shine without being greasy or curtailing the volume, as well as eases brushing. It also decreases the time it takes to dry my long hair, which is great because I travel and don&#x27;t bring a hair dryer. You don&#x27;t need a lot of the product, and I usually work gel thru after the oil, but even when I don&#x27;t gel up, my hair looks old Hollywood glam with the Argan oil. This size bottle lasts me around 6 months, and is not foul smelling or overly flowery.</li>
    <li> I have been using biosilk for many many years now, and recently my bottle was running low and i wanted to try something new. My hair is naturally oily. I have to wash it once daily to prevent it from looking oily. This product did not leave my hair greasy, and i recently started having these little flyaway hairs sticking up all over the place. This product left those hairs evenly blending in with the rest of my hair (they didn&#x27;t stick up anymore) and also left my hair VERY shiny and soft (much softer than the biosilk did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell to me was kinda fruity, like a grape candy almost, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stay on your hair when you put the product on, it seems to just intensify whatever smell (such as the scent of your shampoo) is already in your hair. Personally i do like the way it smells though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and am still very pleased with it. My only suggestion is to not use too much of it. A little bit really goes a long way. The days that I used more than recommended, my hair the next day when I woke up was more oily than normal. My hair is very thick and long and I only have to use smaller than a dime size for all of my hair, then I use another size half that amount for the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last but not least, you can also use this product on your skin. I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs after I shave and it leaves my legs silky smoothe and soft and also decreases the skin irritation from the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel so luxurious!  Use sparingly - a little goes a long way!.</li>
    <li> I WAS TRYING TO REPLACE MY MOROCCAN OIL WITH THIS MORE NATURAL DERMORGANIC HAIR OIL/LEAV-IN TRMT, BUT WHEN I GOT THE PRODUCT AND TRIED IT FOR A FEW DAYS, IT DID NOT LIVE UP TO THE REVIEWS OR DESRIPTION.  I ASKED IF I COULD EXCHANGE IT (OR RETURN IT, IF NO EXCHANGES WERE ALLOWED), AND I GOT ZERO RESPONSE FROM SELLER.</li>
    <li> Love it works good.. And smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Argan Oil will make a wonderful difference in your hair.  Your hair will feel softer, will dry faster(don&#x27;t understand how that part works, but it does)and look healthier.  I use this everyday, sometimes with my styling products and sometimes by itself.  Great stuff.  It&#x27;s not oily or heavy and a little goes a long way.  Especially great for color-treated or damaged hair.  Give it a try--you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this from my hair dresser for $20.00 a bottle and found it here on Amazon for $12.99.  A fantastic deal.  This product will make your hair look perfect, without any flaws.  I have baby fine hair but a lot of it.  This is the best conditioner I have every used.</li>
    <li> Have been using  this product  ever since my hairdresser used it on me a few years ago. It&#x27;s something I always have in stock. I use a small amount after washing my hair and sometimes when I use a straightener on my hair I will apply a small amount beforehand on my hair. I think it has a pleasant perfume like smell as well.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and most of the time where it straight.  I flat iron my hair on a regular basis.  I&#x27;ve noticed since using the Argan Oil my hair looks and feels healthier!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with Dermorganic argan oil. My hairdresser used it on my hair and I loved it. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy which alot of serums tend to be on my hair. I also use it on my skin and it works great! The price on Amazon was alot less than what my hairdresser sold it for which was another bonus. I will definitely continue to buy it once I run out of it.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend has shoulder-length curly hair that he brushes regularly (?!?!?) and was told by his boss to either cut it or get it under control. I bought this for him to try and the frizzed-out mop was gone, he retains defined curls all day using only a nickel-size drop on his towel dried hair and allows it to air dry. a bottle lasts him approximately 3 months with use 5 days a week.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser and liked the way it brought out my natural curls.  It&#x27;s truly a leave-in treatment, apply it to wet hair and it dries quickly.  My only complaint is that I think it must have a lot of alcohol in it since my hair seems to be drier than usual.  But, all considered, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a redhead, with problems with the frizzes especially in our typically humid summers.  This is a great product for helping without seeming oily or adding weight.</li>
    <li> This item has new packaging (no problem) and a slightly different smell than I am used to. I prefer the old smell over the new.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair stronger</li>
    <li> This leave-in treatment really gives my color-treated hair the nourishment it needs! RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY.WILL PURCHASE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used this for years. Price here much lower than at hair dresser.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because I have really long hair and it&#x27;s $30 cheaper than a competitors I was using.  The main ingredient in the other brand is argon oil so I thought they would be similar.  They&#x27;re not.  I didn&#x27;t find this product as moisturizing or cutting down on the drying time of my hair.  I also had to more than double the amount I was using to get the same result except this product left my hair greasy instead of moisturized.  It&#x27;s only saving grace is that you can buy 3 for the same price as the other one.  With that being said, I&#x27;m going back to the original version I bought and spending the extra money.</li>
    <li> This product is average. It does not do as it claims. In addition, it is has several ingredients that are not good for the hair. You are better of buying 100% pure virgin cold pressed argan oil and adding several drops to your conditioner or shampoo. Slice of nature has an excellent one for sale from amazon with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products.  This one WORKS.</li>
    <li> Really Makes My Naturl Hair Very Soft!</li>
    <li> I use this as an hair conditioner at night.  The product does not have any strong synthetic perfume smell and keeps your hair moist for a short time.  In humid climate it is not effective for fizz control.  I use it to prevent graying, shedding and strengthen it roots.  .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products to combat frizz and help protect my hair from heat styling.  This one is the best.  It also helps speed drying time.</li>
    <li> Good product and cheaper than I could get it from a beautician.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil.. at least the Morrocan Oil brand.  But that brand is pricey so I was looking for a less expensive alternative.  This was cheaper but it doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a friend who spends way more than I did for this at a beauty supply store. It&#x27;s an awesome styling product.</li>
    <li> As a colorist I see a lot of products come and go that are meant to recondition hair and the scalp and retard fading. Actually I can&#x27;t even count how many over the year I have used myself trying to get the promised result. However, I can honestly say that the DermOrganic line lives up to its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of my color clients use the Conditioning Shampoo, Masque and Treatment oil now and I have seen 70% less fading in high fade clients who have uneven or overly porous hair (these hair types shed color much faster) and my clients with normal porosity have almost no color fading in the 5-6 weeks between touch ups. I myself have seen little if any fading in my own colored hair (dark red) and that is unheard of for a redhead because it is the largest of the color molecules and the most prone to fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment oil alone is really great for anyone who has any type of scalp issue as the Argan Oil has natural anti-bacterial properties. I have seen big reduction in break outs for clients with contact dermatitis of the scalp and near complete resolution of clients with chemical sensitivity when I add the oil directly to the color formula before applying the color. It acts as a wonderful smelling buffer without effecting the quality of the lift and deposit of permanent hair color. I have had clients report back that they have used it on sensitive skin as well as their hair with great results as well. Also it does not discolor highlights as some of the more pricey Argan oils can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the way around whether it be scalp, skin or hair all of my clients are so pleased with the DermOrganic line that I have come to depend on its ability to retard fading. So much so that I will not guarantee the life of a coloring without them using DermOrganic as part of their daily regimen.</li>
    <li> I have chemically treated hair and it gets very dry and limp.  I use this oil after every shampooing and also in between.  It never makes my hair feel greasy, just seems to give it moisture and shine.</li>
    <li> Best organic Argan Oil on the market.  I love all the Demorganic products.  Tried more then I can count and even my dermatologist gave up. Thankfully I found the Dermorganic Line.  I have Celiac Disease  ( auto immune ) it traveled to my scalp with psoriasis. Demorganic  products completely cleared it up in less then a month.  I love and am very grateful to this company.</li>
    <li> Buy it. It will change you hair for the better! Enjoy:)It makes my hair so shiny and soft. It also speeds up drying time and protects your hair.</li>
    <li> Put in damp hair &amp; tangles fall out.  Put on dry hair get a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> perfect for any hair types. makes your hairy come alive with shine and silk</li>
    <li> I have dry hair.  I use a nickle sized amount of this produce in my hair every day and I can brush the tangles out without a problem.  It leaves my hair nourished, soft, and manageable, never oily.  It also has a pleasant smell.  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This products first two ingredients are SILICONE.  If you want a true oil conditioner, this is not it...... it feels so strangely slick, like putting teflon in your hair.  Did not like it though it smells good.</li>
    <li> Just got less then a week ago, and love this. Move over Moroccan Oil, this is way better, and way cheaper!! Love the smell, leaves my hair looking and feeling great with out looking greasy. Ordered more right away</li>
    <li> I was using Biosilk before, but this is by far 100 times better! You DO have to use it with heat to see results though. I tried it as a leave in on wet hair, but when it air dried, I didn&#x27;t see the same results as when I blow dry or flat iron my hair. It has reduced the amount of split ends I get by 90%! I&#x27;m not even exaggerating! At first, I thought the bottle size was a bit small, but the small amount you need to use to get results makes this small bottle last a LONG time! It also has a nice fragrant smell when you are putting it on, but it goes away after you blow dry/flat iron, so it&#x27;s definitely not overwhelming. This stuff is GREAT! I have already bought it for my mom, sister, and sister-in-law! And for the price you can buy it on Amazon for, it makes it even greater!</li>
    <li> I wasted my money purchasing another lesser grade Argan oil just to learn they are not all created equal.  Many companies use a filler oil and mix too much of it with the Aragan so you never know exactly what you are getting.  This brand works the best for me and I don&#x27;t just use it on my hair.  I use it as a body oil and to relieve dry, ashy feet as well.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I was first recommended this product by a buddy who found it at TJ Max ($14.99). It is such a nice alternative to putting product in my hair. Especially if your partner likes to run their fingers though your hair.  I know smell is subjective, but this stuff is amazing. I have about 5 or 6 friends who use it and love it. All guys and one girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than any argan oil stuff I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser uses this and I found that I could find it for less here than purchasing it from her.  I use it every day, good for curly hair.</li>
    <li> THE ARGAN OIL WAS INTRODUCES TO ME BY THE GUY THAT CUTS MY HAIR, AS A GREAT AFTER SHAMPOOING ADDITIVE. IT GIVES MY HAIR A WONDERFUL SHEEN AND LEAVES IT SOFT. I APPLY A FEW DROPS ON TO MY STILL MOIST HAIR AND RUB IT INTO MY SCALP AND HAIR. I HAVE HAIR THINNING HAIR AND IT GIVES IT SOME BODY AND ALSO IS A GOOD SKIN TREATMENT.&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG.</li>
    <li> This is the best argan oil i&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve gone through tons of different brands, but for some reason DermOrganic&#x27;s works the best with my hair. It smells amazing and a little bit goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this brand to anyone looking for a fabulous argan oil for their hair. A bit of caution: avoid your roots with this stuff. If it you put too much in, or put it too close to your roots, it can leave your hair feeling heavy and looking greasy</li>
    <li> My stylist gave me a sample of this hoping I would buy it at her salon.  Not for $33, thank you very much!  Amazing what you can find on Amazon!  I like the product, but don&#x27;t love it.  It is a good, surprisingly light-weight moisturizer for dry hair.  I use an amount smaller than a dime, rub it in my palms and apply from mid-strand through the ends only.  My hair is just below the shoulder and that is plenty of product for me.  It does seem to control the fly-aways, but if I use too much I have to shampoo the next day (I typically shampoo every other day).  The smell of the product is quite chemical to me, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay in the hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t get it anywhere near my scalp or I&#x27;d be a grease head.  Not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again, but at 4 ounces this will probably last me at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to help your hair dry up to 30% faster and I do think it does help in that regard.  Not much Argan oil in the product.  I found pure Argan oil at Vitamin Shoppe for $28 for 1 ounce and may try that next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent product, but not \\&quot;wowed\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of December 15, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m adding an additional star.  I have now been using this product after every washing and as suspected, still have plenty of product left.  I am adding another star because my hair stylist commented that my hair is stronger and healthier than ever.  So, even though I think their advertising the content of \\&quot;Argan Oil\\&quot; is over inflated, the product is obviously doing something to improve my hair. Most of the time I let my hair air dry or just rough dry it with a blow dryer.  As stated above, it does speed up the drying process.  An added bonus I&#x27;ve noticed is that when I use a heated styling tool (usually an InStyler, flat iron or hot rollers) I don&#x27;t have to add a thermal protection product as the oil provides enough protection and \\&quot;slip\\&quot; to really smooth out the hair shaft.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recently gave me a small amount of this to sample.  I have jaw length, dirty blonde hair, stick straight, baby fine &amp; thin, and the ends are fried from coloring and blow drying.  Since I have an oily scalp and wash my hair daily, I didn&#x27;t want to use it as a leave in product, afraid it would make my hair greasy.  Every few days, I mix a drop or two in with a little conditioner (Matrix Biolage Cond. Balm), leave it on my hair for a few minutes, then rinse it out.  Because this product is mostly silicone, with a small amount of argan oil, it coats the hair shaft, and doesn&#x27;t completely rinse away.  This stuff is FANTASTIC!  It makes my hair feel super soft, combing and styling are a breeze, and my hair style seems to hold up longer, doesn&#x27;t go flat as fast.  Best part of all, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.  I would recommend this DermOrganic w/Argan Oil product to anyone.  If you have very dry hair and scalp, try using it as a leave in product.  Normal or oily scalp, try it as a rinse out product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I use it when my hair is too dry. Now I don&#x27;t have to do hot oil treatments. Just use a little on wet hair.</li>
    <li> I discovered this from my hairdresser originally. Best product I&#x27;ve found to silken up my hair without being overly greasy. Good for all types of hair. Puts a nice natural shine on hair. Now I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> It is light and not greasy and it dries in great. It makes my hair very soft and smooth. I love to use it especially on the ends of my hair</li>
    <li> ~Love to use a little on my ends before blow-drying. Works wonders. ♥~</li>
    <li> I use this with my other dermorganic products and love it. It makes my hair shiny and smooth. I love their products</li>
    <li> I was going to buy this instore at Ulta or at Nordstrom rack but it was so expensive! luckily i found it on Amazon and for a great price! saved a lot of money and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Takes so little to do the job as described  at Amazon. Will order more as needed.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell and no oily feel or look in your hair! I love all of dermorganic products!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I use it after shampooing and use about a quarter size amount for my long hair. Rub it on my palms and pull it through the hair. I use this as a heat protector but it is great at adding softness and shine. Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> great for hair and skin.  I have very dry skin, esp in winter and dry hair from processing and this stuff is great.  Good bath oil too.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for using just after a shower. It really has made my hair much healthier with a very nice shine.</li>
    <li> Everytime I use this I feel a difference in the softness of my hair.  The oil protects against heating damage when using hot curlers or irons.  Excellent product.  Would recommend and will order more.</li>
    <li> BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.  I HAVE TRIED OTHER ARGAN OIL, BUT FOR ME AND MY FAMILY THIS IS THE BEST.</li>
    <li> I have dry, processed hair, and this product is a new favorite discovery. Helps make my crispy hair silky again :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Makes my curly hair straight.  Have been using it for years, but just found out I could buy it from DermOrangic.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product and leaves my hair nice and soft. Easy to use and smells great! Highly recomend</li>
    <li> I have used it for almost 2 years, and use it daily.  smells good and keeps hair healthy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> works well on hair keeping it more manageable.</li>
    <li> If I use too much it makes it looks greasy. If I use a little it does nothing. Not sure what right amount is so I will be using a little each day until it&#x27;s gone but not worth buying. spray leave ins are much easier.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I love it! I use about a dime size every time after a shower when my hair is damp. It leaves my hair feeling great and manageable. I notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I put it in my hair once a week for more shine and body. Highly recommend this product along with the shampoo and conditioner of the same brand. Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year or two.  It only takes a few drops to condition my hair and leave it shiny &amp; soft.  Helps dry it faster after the shower, also!</li>
    <li> For my hair, nothing can weigh it down enough.  It&#x27;s dry, curly/frizzy - and I have a ton of it.  I use this while it&#x27;s still damp, after shampooing.  A little goes a long way...but my hair looks shiny, but by no means greasy or oily.  And it helps keep my frizz under control too!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> It is not greasy, smells great and leaves my hair looking &amp;#34;frizz free&amp;#34;.  I use it on my hair wet or dry.</li>
    <li> for a girl with curly hair that turns to straight frizz in a humid environment, this is my go-to product!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves my hair soft, shinny, and I don&#x27;t have to use to much of it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s not greasy and works really nicely with a flat iron.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I have been using coconut oil and aloe vera oil for ages, but argan oil is a true miracle product - conditions without making your hair look oily</li>
    <li> This product smells great and it keeps my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this treatment for over a year now and my hair is in wonderful condition.  My hairdresser always comments on how great my hair looks even going many months between trims.  My hair is softer and smoother than before I was using this product.  I also use it on wet hair to help brush the tangles out.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works wonders on my hair and I have pin straight thin hair. Somehow this oil adds body to my hair and protects it from damage. Helps with styling as well. A MUST HAVE for every woman!</li>
    <li> This is Luis A&#x27;s wife: Absolutely love it, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now. Best of all is that a little goes a long way. Use it to style my hair on an everyday basis</li>
    <li> Tried a different brand the first time. This fragrance is much lighter and far superior to other one. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is the best!! I ordered two, and they last a long time.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry. I apply to my dry ends. It leaves my hair feeling oily but smooth. I give it 3 stars because I believe other products work the same way and are less expensive.</li>
    <li> I have not actually received this yet... But my stylist gave me a small bottle to try it. Using this has put life back into my over processed hair! I have been covering grey with permanent color for more than 20 years (I&#x27;m 54) For the past 4 years I have gone blonde (my formerly brown hair is now white!) The bleaching has really taken it&#x27;s toll on the condition of my hair and scalp. I used to be oily. Now I&#x27;m dry and brittle. After using this brand if organic oil I have begun to see repair and healing come back to both my hair and scalp...  I have been using this daily for about a month.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil with very high expectations.  Just like the shampoo and conditioner, this was recommended by a gf.  In short, this oil doesnt do much for thick Puerto Rican hair.</li>
    <li> love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It leaves my hair shiny and healthy! Protects from heat damage!  I use it before blow drying and after heat appliances</li>
    <li> Why is this product not on more black hair forums or talked about more often? There is NOTHING that compares to this  bottle of liquid gold. A few drops is ALL you need. I section my hair into four, massage in a few drops per section, wait a few seconds and comb. Its like nothing ive tried before. BTW, I buy a lot of products from curlmart.com AND I am a product junkie so believe me when I say this stuff works. The hair is soft and managable. It almost didn&#x27;t feel like my hair after I put it on. Here are some more benefits of argan oil, in general (FOUND ONLINE):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. It softens dry, cracked skin- Argan oil is known for having a high content of unsaturated fatty acids. It even has more than shea butter so its an ideal all-over face, and body moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s used in the prevention of stretchmarks- The oil absorbs extremely well deep into the skin and helps with collagen production. It also doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It lightens scars- For acne sufferers, argan oil should be your best friend. It can help diminish scars including acne scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It keeps the skin&#x27;s natural oils balanced- Argan oil is a non-comedogenic so just because it&#x27;s an oil doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it clog pores. It actually does the opposite to keep the skin clear and acne-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Suffer from eczema or psoriasis? Argan oil healing properties is due to its abundance of Vitamin E. It treats a number of skin ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Keeps cuticles soft by leaving argan oil on it overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Suffer from split ends? Argan oil penetrates the hair for an intensive hair treatment. Make a great hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Alleviate dry, itchy scalp- Apply to scalp and wrap head in a warm towel for 30 minutes or overnight to soothe irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Shiny hair- If your hair lacks luster, smooth it on for intense shine and vibrancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE MY ADVISE AND TRY IT! YOU WILL LOVE THE RESULTS. HOPE THISREVIEW HELPS. : )</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m an African American woman with relaxed hair. DermOrganic oil is great when you first apply it but after an hour my hair was very dry. The treatment made my hair look thick and puffy but not in a good way.  The product was not great for my hair but I do love it on my skin.  So, if it doesn&#x27;t work for your hair you can always apply it to your skin.</li>
    <li> The first time I was introduced to this product was at the hairdresser&#x27;s. I, as well as my daughters, are now hooked! We have naturally curly (read frizzy) hair and this stuff is great. Applied to damp hair, it protects against damage. Applied to dry hair, tames frizz and creates great shine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this stuff for a couple of days, but I think it&#x27;s the absolute best product I&#x27;ve found for my hair. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to leave my hair soft and shiny. This stuff works!! I&#x27;ve been putting it on my damp hair at night. When I wake up the next morning, my hair looks so nice, shiny, and feels so soft!! Works all day long, too! This is definitely worth a try!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser got me hooked on this Argan Oil years ago.  I had been looking for a better price than she was charging and found it on Amazon.  Love the product!</li>
    <li> For a long time I used the One n Only Argan Oil Treatment, after naively buying it under the misconception that it was actual pure argan oil (why I didn&#x27;t thoroughly read the packaging, I don&#x27;t know), and I thought it was the greatest hair invention in all of the history of mankind. Then I looked at the ingredients. The main thing that bothered me was that fragrance came before any inclusion of argan oil. Also, I realised that the treatment itself didn&#x27;t really have any lasting conditioning effects on my hair. It made it smell delicious and feel silky (almost slippery) smooth for about a day, and that was pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months later, I was still on the hunt for a good hair oil, and I found this (the DermaOrganic treatment) in my mom&#x27;s collection of haircare items that she hadn&#x27;t been using in a while. Low and behold, this was the true magical treatment I had been waiting for. Yes, it has silicones, but so do pretty much all hair products, especially the ones intended to protect hair from heat. The silicone coats the cuticle and protects it from further damage as well as locking in moisture. Also, this treatment seems to have a higher concentration of argan oil than the One n Only version (though I could be wrong about that) as well as some other nice extracts thrown in. This also doesn&#x27;t have dyes which was one of the features of One n Only&#x27;s product that really bothered me because it just didn&#x27;t seem necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the DermaOrganic oil wins 100%. I use it on my damp hair after every shower and it makes it feel so much softer and smoother (which is saying something bc my hair has been massively over bleached in the past and I&#x27;m lucky if it resembles the texture of steel wool rather than barbed wire), without feeling *too* artificially silky to the point where it&#x27;s borderline greasy. Plus, the effects are way longer lasting. I actually feel like this is treating my hair, not just temporarily disguising the problem. I only took off astar because I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance of the product, but that&#x27;s just me nitpicking, and unlike the One n Only, it&#x27;s not a super long lasting scent, at least not for me. Other than that, this is a flawless edition to my haircare routine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! It does wonders for my hair after coloring it! It helps it stay so soft and moisturized, amazing!</li>
    <li> Great product, definitely has helped the quality of my hair.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and she really likes this product.</li>
    <li> So far this is my favorite hair oil. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and after trying a number of others (like Moroccanoil which I don&#x27;t like at all) I keep going back to this one. I love the scent too.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the Dermorganic mask and it has helped my hair heal and become stronger and smoother after being dyed and damaged. I have used this for over four years now, and cannot live without out. Highly recommend for its yummy smell and amazing results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of Moroccanoil products, but decided to see if there was anything else out there that is just as good.  Well, this product fits the bill!  I have hair that is down to my mid-back and drying it without this product takes about 30 minutes.  I was able to blowdry my hair in half the time!  Not only that, but it makes my hair silky smooth.  It feels nourished and not so dry and brittle as it was before.  The smell is also amazing!  It reminds me of grape bubble gum.  The bottle is a bit smaller than my Moroccanoil, but I think it will last just as long.  A little goes a long way.  On my hair, I use a nickle-sized amount and that is all it takes.  This really is a great product and I will definitely repurchase as soon as I run out!</li>
    <li> This product works great to moisturize your hair for a good price. It smells nice and I only need to use about a quarter size on my long hair, so it lasts a long time. It arrived fast and nicely packaged. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite hair products. I am half white and half black with thin, dry, and curly hair. This smooths out my frizz, helps my curls bounce, and doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy. I do use it with other products such as curl definer.</li>
    <li> By far the best leave-in conditioner for my unruly and dry hair. Even in super humid weather, it never felt overly oily and sticky.</li>
    <li> If you have thick curly hair, this is perfect for you.  I never use shampoo because it strips your hair of all its natural oils, and when you have curly hair, you need all the oils you can get. ( lack of oils makes the dreaded frizz).  So I wash my hair with conditioner ( personally I like Pantene for curly hair), put on a little leave in conditioner ( I like Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask ) and towel dry ( just pat hair minimally with towel or you will frizz later).  Then I apply about 3 drops Dermorganic ( depends on hair thickness and length) and scrinch throughout my hair.  You can let dry natural but I prefer blow dry, with a defuser. When pretty much blown dry, I then put another 3 or so drops of Dermorganic in.  The last step reduces fizz through out the day.  If you use more it will leave a slight shine to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dermorganics lasts me many months, so its well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years now after receiving it as a gift.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product that keeps my very thick hair manageable and easy to style.  I even take it traveling with me as it makes such a difference.</li>
    <li> I feel this product did not meet my expectations. I have very long, thick hair, and this product is not meant for my hair type, as it takes way too much to get it soft.  I have used a moroccan oil that is much better for me.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair strong and soft</li>
    <li> Loved his product!!! Best place to purchase is on Amazon</li>
    <li> Great coconut product that I use on my hands and ends of my hair. Keeps the frizzies down and hands soft and moisturized. My stylist recommended it highly and I&#x27;m glad I waited to buy on Amazon because it was MUCH cheaper on this site! Smells nice too. A+++ Will be buying this again and again and skipping ALL those other hair products I&#x27;ve wasted my money on. Rgg.</li>
    <li> I have Celiac disease, and I have tried a ton of products, searching for ones that meet my expectations.  I bought the DermOrganic shampoo, masque, facial moisturizer and leave-in conditioner.  They are all fantastic.  I highly recommend them for everyone.  Best products EVER!!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended that I start using Argan Oil to help heal my dry/damaged hair. I decided to go online rather than paying a higher price in the salon-- and found this Dermorganic Argan Oil-- the same kind sold at the salon! Within 2 days I noticed my hair was softer, and now 2 weeks later it already looks so much healthier. Apply to mids- and ends before drying and it works like magic!</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle of this Argan oil a few weeks ago. I ran out of my bottle I purchased from my hair dresser. It was definitely different consistency. I smelled the oil...it&#x27;s ALMOND OIL! Dont buy this product from this company.</li>
    <li> Received quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using this Argan Oil treatment for over a year and it really makes a difference in the softness and shine of my very fine hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  It makes my hair shiny.  I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t use it more often.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair (unrelaxed, Black-girl hair) and I discovered Dermorganics Moroccan Oil (I know it&#x27;s Aragan oil but that&#x27;s what I call it) three years ago when my hair stylist used it on my hair just after she washed it. She used it as a detangler, leave-in conditioner and heat-protectant just before she blew-dried it and flat-ironed it. Since then, I&#x27;ve been purchasing it and use only a dime-size amount in my hair, before wrapping it. It leaves my hair manageable, soft and less frizzy. What I love about it is that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy whatsoever! I also really like that a 4oz bottle lasts a year... and I have A LOT of hair! I get compliments on my hair all of the time and they ask me what I use... I always respond with Moroccan Oil by Dermorganics *smile*</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great price. Arrived fast. Well packaged.</li>
    <li> Face, hair, body soft, silky. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for a few years and love it! Keeps my hair healthy. I use it daily. Plus- natural ingredients are always a bonus.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly, thick, coarse hair and trying to straighten this mess in the summer takes forever. And because I live in the southern united states, the humidity would just cause my hair to immediately poof back up again. I changed my hairstylist about a year ago and she recommended this product to keep my frizzy hair smooth, and I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells so wonderful! And it lasts a long time. The 4oz bottle I bought from my hairstylist has lasted me a year, and I&#x27;m only halfway through the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, I put about a dime size amount on my hands, rub them together to warm the product, and then evenly distribute through my damp hair with my fingers and then run a fine tooth comb through my hair once or twice. Then, I&#x27;ll get just a dabble more and make sure my ends are nicely coated. The product isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy on my hair, and I&#x27;ve noticed while I&#x27;ve been using Dermorganic that after I am finished blow drying and straightening, all I need is a light coat of hairspray and my hair holds all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply wonderful, I&#x27;m about to order two more bottles so that I&#x27;m all stocked up!</li>
    <li> This smells really good and makes my hair not so frizzy</li>
    <li> Everything about this stuff is great. It is just like the Moroccan Oil brand only it uses organic oils and less synthetic garbage. Granted, it is not completely free of synthetics, but the whole chemistry behind why this and Moroccan Oil work is based on the liquid polymers that constitute the majority of what makes up both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polymers in both products have molecules too large to be absorbed into the skin so that is not an issue. Moroccan Oil has some stuff though that is not natural that may not be something you want in your body, as well as Dermorganic. The only ingredient in Dermorganic I do not like if the fragrance they use, it is not all natural and not necessarily something you want absorbed into your body. However if you love MOroccan Oil like I did, but want something a little less toxic and that has organic ingredients, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works just as well as Moroccan Oil, I&#x27;d say the only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good. BUT did I mention its way cheaper for better quality ingredients? Its a no brainer, get this product.</li>
    <li> I am a male and this product makes my coarse, wavy/curly, frizzy hair smooth. Hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all even though it is oil. Some others complained about the smell, but I don&#x27;t think it is not pungent and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product, makes my hair softer a gives a nice sheen without the look or feel of &#x27;oily&#x27; hair. Can be applied to either wet or dry hair. I just use about 10 drops but can use more if wanted..</li>
    <li> smells delicious and makes my hair dry faster- i have a lot of it- and it&#x27;s softer and shinier than anything else I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> It really does the trick.  Unless you use too much, then you look like an upside down salad bowl.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether this has done anything that it claims to do (&amp;#34;restores shine and softness while strengthening brittle hair,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;replenishes nourishment to dry, damaged, hair,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;protects hair from styling heat and UV damage&amp;#34;) but it seems like I should put something in my hair at the very least, and this seems nice?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 55 and my hair gets the triple whammy:  dye for the gray, bleach/highlights, and flat iron to straighten it. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and have been thrilled with how it makes my hair smooth and soft (my gray hair has come in coarse and kinky, and the bleached sections are straw-like without this treatment.)  I comb-in a nickel-size amount into my still-wet shampooed hair, then blow-dry, then straighten.  My husband has commented on the smoothness and softness of my hair now, compared to what it was before I used this.  My hair is as smooth as my 20-something daughters!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Disappointed.. I had a little bit of this left over from another bottle and one of the things I love about this stuff is the smell. I compared the two because the new bottle didn&#x27;t seem the same. The smells were totally off. This bottle seemed as if it had been diluted or old. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new convert to Argan Oil as it as helped my dry hair feel fabulous!  The light, fragrant smell is pleasant and my hair hasn&#x27;t had this much shine in ages.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and was absolutely AMAZED with the results!! Nothing has ever tamed my frizzy hair except this!! I simply wash my hair, towel dry it and then apply this to my hair and comb it through. My hair dries in beautiful waves, super soft and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy, greasy and limp like other oils have (cough cough, L\\&quot;Oreal Extraordinary Oils). I purchased mine through sleek hair.com which is a great site but they charged me WAY TOO MUCH for shipping to the Netherlands so I will find an alternative next time. This product is so amazing I&#x27;m thinking of buying a whole case &#x27;cause I&#x27;m so scared they&#x27;ll stop producing it or change the formula or something! Hope not! My frizzy haired friends, this is the solution to our hair woes!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go with out it! It all natural and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with terribly greasy or heavy. I have thick course hair and this stuff has helped me tame it a lot better than bio-silk.</li>
    <li> excellent . would recommend</li>
    <li> Love love love this product so much. It&#x27;s hard to describe what it does for my hair...but I have thick, coarse hair that tends to get dry and frizzy. This product gives it enough moisture and weight to keep it looking healthy and under control. Super product.</li>
    <li> I like all natural thigs, and this is the only oil that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  Coconut oil gives me pimples, especially when it&#x27;s in my hair and against my face.  This stuff could rub against my forehead and still not cause a breakout.  I love it!  Light smooth and smell great.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this argan oil treatment by a friend, and I&#x27;m not disappointed. It leaves my long hair soft, tangle free and shiny. The smell is great, and I only use 4-5 drops per day, so the bottle will last awhile. It&#x27;s not pure argan oil, but it&#x27;s worth the price you par for it. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> my grand mother uses these products and always has me ordering them so well i purchese them for her and when it comes to her house she gets exciteed and uses the product i must say she loved it with the other dermorganic</li>
    <li> LOVE, love. Love. A must for dry hair before blow dry. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a very good treatment for dry hair. I would recommend it to tame dry or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> First off....YES, It does leave ones hair greasy looking ...BUT...here is the fix.  I originally bought this from my local stylist, and this is the tip she gave me.  AT NIGHT, put a small amount in your hands and rub them together, then run your hands through your hair and work into the ends as well, then use the remaining oil on your hands to rub into your skin.  So every night before bed this is what I did, and within 3 days, there was a huge difference in, not only my hair, but in my skin as well!  My hair is beyond soft and silky, and my face just glows!  It made such a huge difference for me that I now have my teenage son using it in the exact same manor and even with teenage hormones his skin has cleared up and his hair is amazing.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough.  I am hoping it will be offered in gallon size!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair soft and even dry faster. Keeps my hair manageable throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. This is the second time I bought this product. Love that it is offered at a reasonable price and free shipping with a $35 purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This does help tame my frizzy dry hair.  I use a small amount after shampoo and start at the base of my head (that&#x27;s my frizziest part) then work it through the rest of my hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic treatment to leave in my hair and few weeks before I saw this product on amazon I saw a piece about the Argan oils. I have purchase this product and I am sensitive to perfume and there is no added perfumes in this product.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair feeling very soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; when we bathe our dog.  After we have towel-dried him off, I apply a small portion of the oil in my hands and rub all over him.  Not only does it enable him to dry more quickly, it leaves his coat shiny with a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have used this before.  I love it.  Amazon&#x27;s price was great, so I ordered it from them.  I love organic products, and this leave-in is a real winner.  This is a very good brand and you will not be disappointed!  :)  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for the past 4-5 months (and on-and-off prior to that) after washing my hair (description of usage below). It leaves my hair-tangle free and very manageable, so I don&#x27;t have to fight through knots. I&#x27;m Chinese, have thin hair that becomes oily after 24 hours or so. My hair looks straight, but is genetically naturally curly/wavy on the inside (if that makes sense). I don&#x27;t really do much to my hair other than brush it once to twice a day (usually after showering). So this product is nice for the tangles and my laziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: after washing my hair, I apply a dime-sized amount to the palm of my hand and run it through my hair (more specifically the ends of my hair and not my scalp, similar to applying conditioner). I&#x27;m then able to comb through my hair without encountering tangles. And then I blow dry my hair.</li>
    <li> i live in the south and as i&#x27;ve aged my hair has become curlier and a bit fly-away. this product makes it soft and non-flyaway without being oily. love it!</li>
    <li> I have dry, fluffy, color-treated hair that seems to really benefit from this oil.&lt;br /&gt; I also have moderately sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t make me break out along my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;I use a small puddle in the palm of my hand.. about the size of a nickel or a quarter and massage it into my wet hair, then style as usual.  (for me that is normally scatter-drying it with a regular blow-dryer then touching up my waves with an electric &#x27;round brush-blow-styler&#x27;.  I occasionally use a regular 1&amp;#34; curling iron also.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, but don&#x27;t put it in your hair when your hair is dry otherwise your hair will be very oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells BEAUTIFUL. Makes my hair shine and it feels much healthier. I use TheraNeem Shampoo and Conditioner by Organix for my Scalp Psoriasis. And a reviewer of those products recommended using this in conjunction with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great part is it makes my hair manageable. TheraNeem, like most Organic or Natural Shampoo/Conditioners leave my hair without much oil... And that is great --- but, without that heavy layer or gunk that normal Conditioners add, my hair is impossible to brush through when wet and if I let it dry without brushing it, it will become a curly, frizzy mess. But this stuff is the middle man and allows me to brush my hair while it&#x27;s wet.... and did I mention it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This oil is absolutely lovely.  I use a small amout (about 5 drops) in my hair after shampooing, and it leave it very smooth and hydrated.  It is also great on your hands as well.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and leaves your hair soft and healthy. I&#x27;ve been using it for years on fine, blonde hair with great results. It is a very light, clear oil. I put a bit on my hands and run it through my hair tips before I blow dry my hair every day. It really cuts down on the damage and the smell is wonderful. I like it much better than Moroccan oil, which seems too heavy for my hair leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I have tried argan oil by several sources and I like this the best.  It smells nice, is light weight but works.  It helps to keep my hair from frizzing, untangles and helps it grow without split ends.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair groomed, manageable and shinning..</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products for leave-in treatment. I use a few drops after I shower and it makes a huge difference when blow drying my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the dermorganic argan oil. I use it after I shampoo and condition my hair. I towel dry then I apply a quarter size amount to my damp hair. I must say that when I use it with heat my hair became smooth and sleek. My hair was so soft and silky. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses heat tools.</li>
    <li> Very nice for hair ends!  It smells good too :)</li>
    <li> makes my hair silky soft and a little goes a long way. works great on my skin too. i stopped using it for my hair because i found out too much silicone and glycerin dries out hair. smells good though</li>
    <li> This product smells so good and leaves my hair so soft. I love it. If you&#x27;re looking for a really good oil for your hair, this is it.</li>
    <li> I first tried this as part of a small sampler pack sold at Ulta. I loved the way the Dermorganic Leave-in Treatment with Argan Oil felt in my hair. It feels like a serum but it&#x27;s not oily or thick. I had to purchase the larger bottle because I liked this so much. I found the best price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product left my hair soft and glossy with such a tiny amount. This product will likely last a year or more. Until then, I will definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference. People remark on how healthy my hair looks when I use it. And it makes my hair SO soft. I also use it as bath oil.</li>
    <li> Item is something I have used but have had a hard time finding.  Greatful for the product.</li>
    <li> Great product  I can&#x27;t buy it wholesale this price</li>
    <li> The main ingredient of this product is cyclopentasiloxane, a silicone compound that coats the hair sort of like a  plastic sleeve. It will feel slippery because  of the silicone seal, but this can make hair dry and brittle over time. I wish the ingredients had been listed. I would not have purchased it.</li>
    <li> I use the leave-in treatment on my hair daily after using DermOrganic Shampoo and Masque. It gives my hair a great shine and has helped soften it as well. I am also someone that needs to wash my hair everyday, so I like that it also helps protect my hair from the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This is the finest argon oil I have ever used and first discovered it in a salon. The scent is light and pleasant. Dermorganic tames my frizzy hair while leaving it soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> I have long, color processed fine hair and this is the only argan oil product that I can use.  It doesnt weigh my hair down and I see some improvement in its quality after almost finishing up the bottle.  Had to get use to the argan smell.</li>
    <li> This product is also awsome on your skin try it on your face it will vanish into your skin very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine and thin hair and was looking for a product to soften my hair. and rebuild strength  I heard how wonderful Argan Oil was and wanted a cheaper alternative to Josie Moran, and this is it!  It&#x27;s only too bad it doesn&#x27;t come in a3oz bottle or less so I can take it on a plane. It actually has a somewhat pleasant smell compared to the more expensive similar products.  No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil. It leaves my hair feeling very soft and silky. It helps to keep flyaways and frizz at bay AND I love the way it smells. Probably the one thing I love the most is that when my hair is wet/damp, and I put it on, it seems to help my hair dry faster. But I do have to be careful - I have very fine blonde hair and if I use it too close to my roots or use too much, it can make my hair look slightly oily. But I just try to use a very small amount (not even a dime size) and keep it on my roots then it works great.</li>
    <li> Best organic oil for your hair. Great price for the amount you get. Smells sweet. Not overly oily...the product is absorbed into the hair and doesn&#x27;t linger on the hair shaft to rub off on clothing. I love this oil!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and value</li>
    <li> Silcones!!  Here is the problem with the first two ingredients:  they arent water soluble.  That means you need a SULFATE to get them out (or get BUILDUP).  If I&#x27;m not mistaking, Dermorganics&#x27; shampoo is sulfate-free? That means you have to use a drying sulfate rich shampoo of another brand.  Defeats the purpose of organic friendly.  RUN.</li>
    <li> I use about a dime size throughout my wet hair and makes it so soft shiny and healthy! When I don&#x27;t wash my hair, which I do not on a daily basis ... I use a small amount to help keep my hair in place and it does a great job!</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting my hair done. The stylist said it was her &#x27;magic weapon&#x27; for tangled hair. It also helps dry hair quicker.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was the softest it had ever been! I was obsessed- I text her a week after my appointment to get the brand and ordered it that day!!! Obsessed!!!!</li>
    <li> Have ordered it multiple times.  Works and smells great!</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. Because of multiple skin and scalp and eye irritation issues, I have had to stop using almost all hair products and soaps. Right now the only products I am able to use to wash my hair are baking soda and apple cider vinegar (see more on this at [...] - it works great!). Using any shampoo or conditioner or hair products causes my scalp to itch and my eyes to become inflamed. I have to use goat milk soap because any other soap causes a severe reaction on my skin. That is my level of sensitivity. My stylist suggested Dermorganic Argan Oil a few years ago, and it has become the only product that goes on my hair. If used in the right amount, it smooths out my frizz and keeps my hair soft near the tips where it can become dry and brittle. Back when I was blow-drying my hair, it helped protect against heat damage and helped the hair dry faster. Even though I&#x27;m living in Asia now, I still order this product and have someone ship it over here to me, despite the extra expense because I love it so much.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!! It has turned my hair, from dry and damaged , to silky, thick, healthy, beautiful hair. Before blow drying my hair, I just squirt about a nickel size into my hand and rub through my damp hair, making sure I get the very ends, where split ends can form and blow dry. I&#x27;m telling you...you will never go without!! Try it!! You may not see a dramatic difference at first, but I guarantee, after a few weeks you will be so thrilled to see life coming back to your hair!</li>
    <li> non-heavy oil and adds manageability to your hair. I have short hair that&lt;br /&gt;is frizzy hair  at the temples and it does help&lt;br /&gt;with control.  I use it after I blow dry my hair and before&lt;br /&gt;I style it.  I also use it throughout the week and it does not weigh&lt;br /&gt;my hair down .  It leaves your hair smelling great (my boyfriend says)</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing and smells great!  Highly recommend for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> This is so easy and inexpensive.  A small dot a day on the palm of your hand and worked through your hair restores shine, body and strength to hair.  It&#x27;s a must-have product.</li>
    <li> I love Argan oil, I use it everyday and gave a bottle to my daughter and she loves it also. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way.  It smells amazing and leaves curly/crazy hair silky and manageable.  Also use it on our little one - it is organic and does not appear to have any harmful substances in it.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Just a few drops give you shiny and healthy looking hair.</li>
    <li> This product used to be the best on the market, but this company is selling a fake product, i got this in the mail and used it, and instantly noticed that its thicker the the original product, they have replaced the \\&quot;argan oil\\&quot; for Kernel oil and its not the same stuff. this made my hair greasy and dry, what a shame, why do companies have to buy fake product and sell it on the internet???? why why why, i just want an answer?????????????????? [...]</li>
    <li> I just love the Dermorganic leave in treatment with Argan Oil! It is the perfect complement to the Shampoo and Conditioner. I use all three and my baby fine hair is softer and shinier that ever. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great organic oil. All the products work well together!.</li>
    <li> Hair feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> It works. Eighteen more words are required, so I will simply say that it works for me.  It works for me.  How silly that one must state more than it does what it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> This leaves your hair silky and not greasy like some of the other oils can.  Keeps the fly aways at bay.</li>
    <li> this stuff is liquid gold! the only thing I use religiously on my hair and it actually works the way it&#x27;s intended to work. My hairdresser is equally impressed.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have naturally wavy/curly hair, and this is the only product that keeps the frizz down. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while in conjunction with their shampoo and conditioner, and it works! I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a must use. I put it on daily</li>
    <li> It is ok to me. It is a little oily to me so I don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
    <li> This is a good one for hair  I never had, I very like it , i feel  my hair is smooth now,</li>
    <li> Let me start of by saying....I am a African American female with thick, coarse, shoulder lenght hair. Its also permed and colored....This LEAVE-IN works really good and you only have to use a little at a time..ususally i have to squeeze a nickel or more out of a regular store brought bottle....but no way not with this i dont i would say bout a dime size would do me good....and it leaves my hair and scalp feeling so refreshing and it smells fresh for days....i was riding down the road in the car with my sister and when we made to where we was gng she told am glad u didnt where no perfume today because you r hair smell good and strong but soft...i also use this with masque condition and shampoo....and its perfect for a daily wash or my once a wk wash....Do highly recommand this product to any one...i have using this for a month now...and nothing has gotten worse but better...for me..i looked in my local stores at the time i was comparing prices on Amazon while in Target and CVS Pharmacy in my local area...Amazon prices or a little bit cheaper and reasonable then those two stores....for DermOrganic Argan Oil products...</li>
    <li> Love this for making hair easy to brush and soft and shiny.  My daughters both love it too. Keeps the tangles away.</li>
    <li> This argon oil product is the best I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my hair soft, smells great and a little tiny bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since my hair stylist introduced me to it several years ago.  I have tried other things, to see if they were as effective, when I&#x27;ve run out, but I&#x27;ve not found anything as good.  My hair is shiny and moisturized and feels to nice!!</li>
    <li> i have used other Argan oil products &amp; they have all smelled lovely. Something about this just smells ok. it almost has a medicinal smell to it. I have rarely used it since buying it since i don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
    <li> My hair is smoother, fuller and shinier.  I can really tell the difference when I skip using it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product, use the shampoo and conditioner as well.  My hair is finally soft and healthy again.  Will keep on my purchase list.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser had initially recommended the DermOrganic conditioner which worked great for me. I then picked up the leave in oil when I saw it at TJX. Now, I have long, thick,dry,and color treated hair. The product just made my hair drier and frizzier after blow drying it. I was looking for a product that would moisturize and smooth my hair, this oil did not do it for my hair. I read a review that said it can be used on your skin. I like the scent it has, so I guess I&#x27;ll try it on my skin so that my $15 don&#x27;t go to waste!</li>
