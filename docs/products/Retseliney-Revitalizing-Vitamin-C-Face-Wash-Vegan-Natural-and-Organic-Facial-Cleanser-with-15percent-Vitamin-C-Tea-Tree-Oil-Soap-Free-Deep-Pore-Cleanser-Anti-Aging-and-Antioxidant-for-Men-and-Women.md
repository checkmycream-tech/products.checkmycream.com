      <li>did NOT recieve any discount and or free bottles for this review and still I posted my revised thoughts.</li>
      <li>did receive this free for the purpose of testing and review.  </li>
      <li>Just knowing all their products are FILLED with healthiness is reason alone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The odor has a clean fresh smell that smells a bit of citrus, but is more a combination of a lot of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>It does an excellent job of cleaning the skin without leaving it feeling stripped&amp;mdash;it actually makes it feel as smooth and soft as if moisturizer had been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Loving my new skin.</li>
      <li>My skin does not feel clean after washing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These products have a lot of good vitamins and nutrients in them like vitamins A, C, and E, and different oils like Rosehip and Jojoba.</li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>The reason I rate it a 5 star is because it is effective , has no harsh chemicals and lives my skin radiant.</li>
      <li>Even after just one use, my face was feeling so fresh and clean without any dryness what-so-ever.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try these products free through Tomoson as part of a product trial and the above opinion is my own unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>My face looks more vibrant.</li>
      <li>When applying the Vitamin C facial cleanser it has a very light citrus scent which smells soooo yum!</li>
      <li>I have had cleansers that you have to unscrew the top and squeeze,  and although it&#x27;s not hard,  I found myself skipping it when I was in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>A half of a pump is the perfect amount for my whole face and a full pump is plenty for your whole face and neck.</li>
      <li>Love the citrus scent and my skin feels very soft after use.  </li>
      <li>It has a light, uplifting citrus scent and doesn&#x27;t create much of a lather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth it.</li>
      <li>both of which are powerful anti-bacterials.  </li>
      <li>It totally natural and organic and contains many beneficial vitamins and oils.  </li>
      <li>I received a complimentary sample of Retseliney Vitamin C Cleanser for my view of the product.</li>
      <li>They are natural and organic and safe for all skin types.</li>
      <li>It has other ingredient like orange peel, Olive  Oil and Oregano (which I&#x27;ve only eaten up until now), Rose Hip Oil, Dandelion is good for a ton of things.  </li>
      <li>Also, this wash smells good, just a little can clean my face well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft, and smooth and definitely clean.</li>
      <li>It was clear, and light and my skin soaked it up quick.</li>
      <li>Some of the ingredients I am already familiar with a decent amount of what&#x27;s in it.</li>
      <li>I gave it a couple pumps the first use</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with neutrogena naturals and yes to carrots daily cream cleanser, both under $10.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve  most likely already read it.</li>
      <li>The texture was a silky smooth and clear texture.</li>
      <li>used the cleanser several times now and what I love is how my skin feels afterwards.</li>
      <li>This is the first time trying this product.</li>
      <li>The product is clear with a light citrus scent.  </li>
      <li>Not only is this Vitamin C Cleanser by Resteliney clean your face, but it&#x27;s also packed with Vitamins and amazing essential oils.</li>

      <li>and I used 2 whole pumps the first time trying it, which that turned out to be way too much.</li>
      <li>Though I am using it twice a day because I like it so much.</li>
      <li>They also have a wide range of products that can be used to cure imperfections, and give you more softer, tighter and radiant</li>
      <li>I have dyslexia and very often I don&#x27;t spell check.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I recently tried this Retseliney Vitamin C Cleanser and serum and moisturizer. I really like this brand&#x27;s products. They are natural and organic and safe for all skin types. They also have a wide range of products that can be used to cure imperfections, and give you more softer, tighter and radiant skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cleanser several times now and what I love is how my skin feels afterwards. It&#x27;s so soft, and smooth and definitely clean. I can tell a difference from before and it really does look more bright and less dull. The texture was a silky smooth and clear texture. And it smelled good, not like a chemical cleanser. It kind of had a citrusy smell and made my skin smell good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the cleanser, I used the Serum and it was a kind of spray on pump serum. It was clear, and light and my skin soaked it up quick. Then I used the moisturizer and it was smooth and creamy and light. It didn&#x27;t feel thick on my skin or feel like it was going to clog my pores. My skin definitely felt softer after this triple step regimen. And I can see myself continuing use of these products.  I even shared these with my family and they loved the way it felt. It didn&#x27;t smell harsh like some cleansers and serums or feel harsh on your skin either. It felt like we were giving a treat to our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products have a lot of good vitamins and nutrients in them like vitamins A, C, and E, and different oils like Rosehip and Jojoba. And they are organic so you know it&#x27;s not just some chemical treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try these products free through Tomoson as part of a product trial and the above opinion is my own unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so nice after using this cleanser.  The pump is easy to use.  The product is clear with a light citrus scent.  Just use a little pump full on wet hands,lather it up a little and then massage onto damp/wet face.  This lathers up really nice using your hands or a sponge.  It feels great on my skin and rinses off with no residue left behind.  No harsh ingredients in this product, just natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Love the citrus scent and my skin feels very soft after use.  A little bit of this face wash goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Not only is this Vitamin C Cleanser by Resteliney clean your face, but it&#x27;s also packed with Vitamins and amazing essential oils. This product will cleanse your face and help fight against aging and sun damage all the same time. I am so very impressed with this stuff! Even after just one use, my face was feeling so fresh and clean without any dryness what-so-ever. It&#x27;s always good to follow up with a moisturizer after a cleanser, but I almost felt like I didn&#x27;t need to after using this. I can usually feel my face drying out almost immediately after cleansing my face, but that was not the case at all with this one. A little really goes a long way with this product. It comes in a nice sizes bottle with a very convenient pump to dispense the product and I used 2 whole pumps the first time trying it, which that turned out to be way too much. A half of a pump is the perfect amount for my whole face and a full pump is plenty for your whole face and neck. It has a light, uplifting citrus scent and doesn&#x27;t create much of a lather. It&#x27;s made from all natural and organic ingredients, so it is gentle enough to use on all skin types. And the best part, in my opinion, is that this product is not tested on animals! It&#x27;s almost all too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. In fact I plan on making it my regular face wash. It only takes a squirt and though it&#x27;s a small bottle seems like it will last a while. Though I am using it twice a day because I like it so much. I purchased the vitamin C serum and night cream too. I also want to try a mask and the eye cream. This brand is great. It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks and my wrinkles are already going away. My face looks more vibrant. I am in love with this stuff.</li>
    <li> REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product helped to refine by skin texture and reduced the little wrinkles around my face.  I had a couple of sun spots on my cheeks and the cleanser helped reduce the appearance.  It helps build up the production of new Collagen and Elastin. It only takes a small amount to use at a time.  The bottle will last quite a while.  I like the fact that the product is made in the USA in a FDA registered facility.  I received a complimentary sample of Retseliney Vitamin C Cleanser for my view of the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to discontinue use of my acne medication that bleaches my sheets. So far I am using it once daily for about 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts. No real difference to my skin tone/hydration/appearance. Will continue to use and update. Would recommend so far!</li>
    <li> I use this with my Clarisonic.  The product is fantastic and is better than any cleanser I have ever used.  Makeup is gone!  Always remember to moisturize after a good cleansing.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is a clear gel that has a silky feel as its massaged on were skin.&lt;br /&gt;It turns into a white cream as it reacts with the water.&lt;br /&gt;For testing purposes, I left it on my face as I showered.  That way I&#x27;d know if it contained anything that would bother my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;No problem. No stinging then, no irritation later.&lt;br /&gt;Removes makeup effectively, with a pleasant citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE : Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned.</li>
    <li> My second bottle. I&#x27;m loving it. I&#x27;m 50 my skin looks more youthful. It does have a bad Oder. You get use to it.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ll keep using the product. Smell and all. It&#x27;s certainly worth it. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my skin. Even my husband noticed. Loving my new skin.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is a clear gel that makes very little lather.  It has a pleasant fragrance that combines elements of the citrus and herbal ingredients.  It contains plant-derived cleansers, amino acids, vitamins, and botanical oils and extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a mini facial, I rinse my skin with hot water, apply this cleanser, massage it in, and then let it stay on for a few minutes before rinsing it off with hot water.  It does an excellent job of cleaning the skin without leaving it feeling stripped&amp;mdash;it actually makes it feel as smooth and soft as if moisturizer had been applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has a combination of dry, normal, and oily skin and this cleanser works well on all areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 oz. (120 ml) bottle will last a while, as only a small amount is needed.  It has a convenient pump top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (97% naturally derived and 72% organic):  Organic Aloe barbadensis leaf juice (aloe vera), decyl glucoside, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, cocamidopropyl betaine (from coconuts), cocamide MIPA, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, sodium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin C), methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, (2S)-2-amino-5 guanidinopentanoic acid, Olea europaea (olive oil), retinyl palmitate (vitamin A), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), Rosa canina (rose hip oil), Borago officinalis (borage oil), Citrus aurantium dulcis (orange peel tincture), Origanum compactum (oregano oil), Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil), ethylhexyl glycerin, phenoxyethanol, organic Aloe barbadensis leaf (aloe vera extract), organic Centella asiatica (gotu kola extract), organic Equisetum arvense (horsetail plant extract), organic pelargonium graveolens (geranium extract), organic Taraxacum officinale (dandelion extract).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retseliney provided facial cleanser for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Pleasant citrus fragrance with light lather.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> I feel SO happy and excited to know that I&#x27;m nourishing AND cleansing my face with such amazing, vegan ingredients. What goes into your skin is so important and overlooked. I rest assured that I&#x27;ve got the goods with this.</li>
    <li> Retseliney Best Vitamin C  Face Wash  This is the first time trying this product. What caught my eye is that its ingredients are 72% Organic that are 97% Naturally Derived . Some of the ingredients I am already familiar with a decent amount of what&#x27;s in it. For years I&#x27;ve heard people talking about Melaleuca and had a friend who sold an entire line of products with it as the base, but I&#x27;ve never actually tried it until now. It has other ingredient like orange peel, Olive  Oil and Oregano (which I&#x27;ve only eaten up until now), Rose Hip Oil, Dandelion is good for a ton of things.  There are a lot of new natural ingredients that I&#x27;ve never used before. Horsetail plant, Geranium and Gotu Kola are all things that are new to me.. I&#x27;m not sure if it has anything to do with the fact it is a main ingredient, but the consistency and texture feels just like Aloe Vera gel. The odor has a clean fresh smell that smells a bit of citrus, but is more a combination of a lot of the ingredients. My face feels smooth after washing with it, but I haven&#x27;t been washing with it long enough to know the exact effect it will have on my skin long term. I would need to use at least one bottle maybe two. I don’t like claiming overnight miracles, but it compares to some of the higher prices washes I have used in the past. I&#x27;m almost 50, so I do have to be careful what I use. I would feel safe to say you will probably feel the same way, especially if you have issues with dry skin  DISCLAIMER:  My No Nonsense Thoughts: I could reiterate what is in the description above, but  you&#x27;ve  most likely already read it. What I will try to do is tell you what I see, smell, hear, what happens and what my opinion is as well as I can. In order to try to make easier for you to decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone. I have the money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description. As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.  I have no connection to this seller or this company who makes this product and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I haven&#x27;t been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review. I have dyslexia and very often I don&#x27;t spell check. But I will do my best to describe this item for you  .</li>
    <li> Dried out my face and did not help improve my skin. I&#x27;ve had better luck with neutrogena naturals and yes to carrots daily cream cleanser, both under $10. product now serves as an overpriced paperweight.</li>
    <li> This is very refreshing and my skin seems brighter, less discoloration. Smells nice, non-irritating - worth a try!</li>
    <li> Overall a good product. Does not leave my skin dry like other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s why I love this product.  It&#x27;s simple and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to....clean!  I have what I consider oily tzone.  This has managed to stop the oil perfectly.  I no longer have to blot my nose throughout the day to get rid of my oily look.  Yay!  Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. I gave it a couple pumps the first use and wow was I surprised. I only needed a little dab to wash my face and neck - this lathers up great and feels amazing during and after the wash.</li>
    <li> great cleanser, see a difference in my skin, age 60. Not drying either. Using it with a vitamin c toner as well.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re not allowed to mention the negative bits so, heres what I got...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the box from Amazon arrived I was BEYOND stoked to see what the &amp;#34;Retseliney&amp;#34; rave was all aboot? Upon opening the box and gazing upon the bottles (Vitamin C face wash + Face &amp; neck cream) I thought &amp;#34;Well, arn&#x27;t they cute? Smaaaall but, cute&amp;#34;. STILL, couldn&#x27;t wait to give these a go. When applying the Vitamin C facial cleanser it has a very light citrus scent which smells soooo yum! So, thats a plus. It&#x27;s not extremely soapy when lathering it in. And just knowing you&#x27;re applying goodness to your face feels ohhh so good! Cutting this shorter due to I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s gonna post due to recent attemps. I would reccomend Retselineys products. Just knowing all their products are FILLED with healthiness is reason alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT recieve any discount and or free bottles for this review and still I posted my revised thoughts.</li>
    <li> Best face cleanser I have ever used on my skin</li>
    <li> Smells very nice but this cleanser does not work for me. My skin does not feel clean after washing.</li>
    <li> very good! My face is like silk when I use it. Also, this wash smells good, just a little can clean my face well. Next time I will use it again!</li>
    <li> The pump never worked properly, never could get the soap to come out evenly. It was if the bottle was almost empty, but it was brand new. Not a great product by no means. Not sure how these products got a 5 star rating, but the ratings were so good I thought I would try it. Staying with Clinique.</li>
    <li> Once again the Retseliney products get a 5 star from me! I did receive this Vitamin C cleanser free of charge to test it and share my honest and unbiased opinion. The reason I rate it a 5 star is because it is effective , has no harsh chemicals and lives my skin radiant. I tried other vitamin C cleansers before but none left me with this amazing soft feeling after I am done. This product comes with a pump and that in itself makes my life easier, unmessy and you won&#x27;t waste product when pouring. The combination of ingredients is a winner, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Vitamin C, Rosehip ad Tea tree oil among other ones in it. Smells delicious on the citrusy side and rinses clean leaving your skin soft and ready for your moisturizer. I am very satisfied with it and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wow,  this cleanser packs a punch.  It not only cleans your skin,  but nourishes it at the same time.  It totally natural and organic and contains many beneficial vitamins and oils.  I especially like that it contains tea tree oil and oregano oil,  both of which are powerful anti-bacterials.  I know a lot of people still don&#x27;t understand the oils in cleansers,  but like attracts like,  and the oils in the cleanser help draw out the oils in your pores.  For that reason,  as well as all of the nutritional vitamins in the ingredients,  I leave it on my face for a longer period that I would other cleansers.  For an oil to work ,  it has to have a little time to acclimate with the oils in your skin,  so it can them pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a little bit of the cleanser to create a nice lather,  so you won&#x27;t waste it....and the pump makes it so convenient to use.  I have to admit,  I have had cleansers that you have to unscrew the top and squeeze,  and although it&#x27;s not hard,  I found myself skipping it when I was in a hurry.  Now this sits by my sink and it&#x27;s so easy that I find myself washing my face a lot more than I did before.  It has a wonderful citrus scent that awakens me when I use it.  BONUS.  LOL.  I am so happy with this product and can&#x27;t wait to try more of their line.  My final deciding factor on that is that they don&#x27;t test on animals !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this free for the purpose of testing and review.  All of these opinions are 100% my own.  This is a great product that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Great citrus scent and leaves my face feeling clean but not dry.</li>
    <li> No issues with sensitivity.  Cleans great!</li>
    <li> my bottle only had half the product in it. like a half empty bottle. not sure if this is normal... but seems very strange. perhaps i got a defected item?</li>
