<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> There are many facial wipes out there, most of which do a pretty good job at cleaning your face. Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects Clear Skin wipes are a bit out of the ordinary in that they have tiny dots on one side that gives it more texture that you can feel. The cloth is about 8x6\\&quot;- a good size that allows you to clean your face as well as your neck. Once dry, my skin felt soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package has a resealable label (cover) but after being opened less than a dozen times the cover was noticeably less sticky, so I would suggest storing this in a zip bag. The suggested usage is twice daily, so each package would last 10 days. This product is great for travel or the gym, but for home use it might become expensive to use. (Currently unavailable, there&#x27;s no price noted)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback is the product&#x27;s smell. It&#x27;s supposed to be citrus mint, but I cannot detect any mint at all- just an odd, chemical smell that lingered. If this was mint scented, it would be great.  As it is, it just smells odd and I found it unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these work OK, but no better than most other wipes. However the smell is off-putting and I would look for another brand. 3.5 stars</li>
    <li> These are great! They&#x27;re good for taking to the gym or anywhere a quick swipe is needed. They&#x27;re thicker and softer than many products promoted as skin swipes and they really work. They also work well at home if you&#x27;re feeling lazy or tired. I didn&#x27;t test them with heavy make-up.  I found they&#x27;re easy to use and feel good on my face. I have fairly dry skin and they were just fine for me.</li>
    <li> These are great go-to wipes to keep in your purse, car, gym bag, or desk.  They are textured to help clean your face/neck to get rid of oil or when you need to freshen up.  The citrus and mint give off a pleasant refreshing scent.  They are designed for acne prone skin but I think they can be used on all skin types.  I would love to have a pack larger than the 20 count.  They leave my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Alright.  I have a STELLAR review to write here.  I got these for my son, a 10 year old who already has an acne issue.  They happened to arrive about 10 days ago - and we have family pictures tomorrow.  I&#x27;ve had my son use a wipe every night at bedtime.  He doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but he isn&#x27;t even a teenager yet so I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it on his tender skin.  It was enough.  As of 2 days ago, ALL of his pimples were gone.  He had probably 7-8 on his nose and around his mouth.  Something that was, at minimum, normal for him for the last year.  Now there are no old or new pimples!  In just about a week it did that.  He experienced zero irritation.  One side of the wipe is textured to help remove a lot of built-up dirt.  The scent is unisex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried them one night to remove my make-up and those little textured bumps were really great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note we have tried 2 other brands of acne wipes in the past year or so.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving this a full 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I both like these wipes a lot.  The material is thick and each sheet is dotted with fixed scrubbing bumps.  I feel kind of guilty using these because I feel so wasteful using these, but they&#x27;re great for cleaning up on-the-go.  I feel like each sheet is actually twice as big as I would need; a 40 pack with half-sized sheets would be even better.</li>
    <li> These wipes really do help to decrease oiliness, and helped to make my skin feel refreshed. I really like the scrubbing &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; that helped to exfoliate. I don&#x27;t like the scent, though. I usually like citrus scents, but this one smells &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These cleansing clothes are convenient and great for removing makeup. They are smooth on one side and textured with hard micro-dots on the other side. The array of dots does a good job of exfoliating the skin. They also work well to clean the clogged spores and remove excessive oil from the skin. However, they do have a somewhat odd scent, borderline citric that isn&#x27;t unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes come with in a portable, resealable bag. It is easily put away in the purse or gym bag. However, with multiple uses, the sealing in this type of packaging may not keep the wipes moist for very long. The 20-count package is a good size, enough to last for a good week and not too many left to dry out in the package.</li>
    <li> A good wet wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Pleasant scent. The wipes give you a fresh, slightly citrus smell without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;-The tissues are a good size and durable, I&#x27;ve had no problem using them for a full face/neck refresher.&lt;br /&gt;-Convenient travel size. Some wipes are packaged in a longer, thinner format which can make them too long to stuff into various travel bags or pockets. These wipes are in a more square format, which is generally easier to stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The resealable flap is a little small, meaning if the package is wrinkled especially as you remove more tissues then it can be a challenge to get a good seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these definitely do the job. I tend to keep a pack stashed in my car for whatever emergency, and these wipes have been a nice addition to my rotation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not overly keen on these face wipes. I understand the need for blemish-prone skin to have a product that will help to reduce the oil on your skin but for me this just didn&#x27;t work as I have combination skin--dry in most areas with an oily T Zone--and therefore my cheeks felt chapped after using these wipes on a nightly basis.&lt;br /&gt;I also tend to use facial cleansing wipes as a make-up remover and these wipes didn&#x27;t work for that either. They are average at taking face powder/foundation off but not at all appropriate for removing eye make-up. Therefore it is just easier for me to use a facial cleansing wipe that also doubles up as a make-up remover. I then use the Olay Fresh Effects blemish cream directly on the areas of my skin that I need it, my T Zone, leaving my cheeks free from drying out with this facial wipe.&lt;br /&gt;They smell great, a lovely citrus scent, but overall these wipes just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin and not sure what to use that is easy and on the go, well these may work for you. I didn&#x27;t think these wipes would work at all let alone on someone like me. I am not really acne prone and i barely wear make-up. When I went to get make-up at Dillard&#x27;s the lady explained I have a really beautiful complexion and I didn&#x27;t really need make-up. Well that&#x27;s nice and all but I do have blemishes and they are so horrible. I rarely wear make-up because it seems to make them worse. So I am constantly looking for something I can use on my face that will help my blemishes and dark spots. I do get acne like every one else, more so in the summer from sweating. So when I saw these I figured &amp;#34;hey, what the heck&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these after working out, with a little make-up (had to see how these would hold up) and as a facial treatment before showering. My first mistake was using it immediately after working out, it burned and I know that probably had to do with my sensitive skin, so the second time I used it post workout I waited till I got home and cooled down and then used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I loved that one side exfoliates and the other side is nice and smooth&lt;br /&gt;Has a washcloth feel, not a cheap wipe feel that would easily tear&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels clean after using&lt;br /&gt;Removed all my make-up (however I did notice a little mascara left and I do not use foundation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell when I opened this hit me and I must say I almost didn&#x27;t use the wipes it was citrus to the max (it&#x27;s better now &amp; if you are a person that likes citrus smells, you will love the smell)&lt;br /&gt;I have been having issues with resealing my bag, wish they would come up with better seals than the standard sticky stick&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating side if you use to hard or without some kind of lather can leave the skin feeling raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the wipes, I took one star away for the smell citrus meets mint and punches you in the nose, I noticed the smell stuck with me for a while even after I used the wipe and if I am going to smell like citrus and mint, I&#x27;d like it to smell good.stuck with me for a while even after I used the wipe and if I am going to smell like citrus and mint, I&#x27;d like it to smell good.</li>
    <li> Picked this up on a whim. What a surprise this was. From a product design point of view, this is practically flawless.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is economical, and minimizes waste. The tear open dispenser seals tightly every time (with minimum care in keeping the surface dry and clean).&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are everything you&#x27;d need for taking off makeup or just keeping skin clean during those teenage years of acne.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a nice fresh blend of orange and mint. The wipes are moist with cleaners and astringents that aren&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, there are these little green microdots that are raised from the wipe that add a little extra scrubbing power.&lt;br /&gt;The girls love it, so this isn&#x27;t the only time I&#x27;ll be getting these.</li>
    <li> These wipes are amazing! I have acne prone skin, and I&#x27;m prone to flare ups anytime my skin gets sweaty or dirty, such as when I work out and after wearing a face full of makeup all day long. I loved using these wipes every night before bed. They clean my makeup off, and they&#x27;re gentle enough on my skin so I can use them every day. These wipes have exfoliating beads, so you can really feel them working: your face feels really clean and fresh after using them. Since I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;m unable to use most medicated wipes designed for acne: they tend to dry my face out and make my skin flaky. This product, however, was gentle enough to use daily and worked wonders on my skin! And as an added bonus, these wipes smell amazing! I loved this product, and I highly recommend it, especially for people with sensitive, acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> Orange mint can be a delightful scent to brighten the senses, but they don&#x27;t mesh well on this product. I move beyond the scent on focus on its more important feature -- cleaning the face. My face is typically a mix of dry, normal and oily. I liked the spots for scrubbing the tricky areas around the nose and chin. The rough surface felt nice on the face especially in troublesome spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save for the scent, it does make the face feel cleaner and fresher. The moisture level is just right -- neither too wet or too dry. I usually wash my face first thing in the morning (just a quick wipe or wash) and again within a couple of hours after working out. Another product stays moist in those two hours so I can reuse it again after the workout. These are dry as a bone and can&#x27;t be reused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this writing, there&#x27;s no price posted. I looked elsewhere online and could only find one where you can get 7 cloths for $1.99. That&#x27;s 42 cents a cloth. I&#x27;ve found others in the same category for 20 cents or less. This product gets the job done except for the scent and the moisture not lasting long. Whether I buy again depends on the availability of another scent and the price. Cloths are more convenient than the bottled version, but price always wins out.</li>
    <li> These have been great face wipes for the evening when I don&#x27;t feel like washing my face again or I am on the run. Sometimes these kinds of wipes leave a gross film on your face, but these don&#x27;t. They dry clean and leave your face feeling fresh. They are also perfect for traveling so you don&#x27;t have to worry about lugging face wash and it exploding all over your luggage!</li>
    <li> This wipes are nice, but there are a couple drawbacks which prevented me from giving them 4 stars. They come in a re-sealable package, which is great, but unfortunately the seal doesn&#x27;t work very long. I&#x27;ve only used it for 4-5 days, and the seal keeps popping up, allowing the wipes to dry out. And while it does get my eye makeup off well, it doesn&#x27;t help much with my blemishes. I don&#x27;t get many blemishes any more, but when I do, I want them gone fast, and these wipes don&#x27;t do well at that. So, 3 stars is my final rating.</li>
    <li> These wipes are very useful and convenient especially when you are in a hurry.  It&#x27;s saves time and trips to the bathroom when you find your face getting dirty or oily due to a day of traveling, sightseeing, shopping, or running errands.  It gives you a fresh clean feel as if you&#x27;ve just have your face washed. The scent is also light, pleasant and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to use this new Olay clear Skin Swipe because it seemed to be targeted to acne-prone, oily skin and I my skin is definitely dry but based on my experience with many other Oil of Olay products I decided to try it and much to my surprise, I liked it.  It removed my make-up easily, has a very pleasant scent and my skin felt as if it was getting a mini-massage.  I only gave this product four stars because I didn&#x27;t like the packaging since if it&#x27;s not used in what seems to be a very short time, the moisture in the little swipes dries out rendering them ineffective. I&#x27;d be willing to pay a little more for these swipes to be individually wrapped similar to the packaging used by Tena pantiliners.</li>
    <li> Great wipes for cleaning the face and the texture microbeads really make the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works very well for a crisp cleansing and is perfect for washing up at night for people that don&#x27;t want to use face soap and a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I really like these face wipes. They are great for your skin and good for travel. Having them for travel is my primary purpose for getting these. I have very oily skin and I need something that helps me clean my skin every night. It works very well. I really like the exfoliating dots, it allows me to better cleanse my face.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and these do not irritate my skin at all.  These are great for throwing in my gym bag and using after working out.&lt;br /&gt;One side is bumpy and made for exfoliating the other side is smooth. They are not overly moist so I do wet my skin first before using them.  For me they work better at removing makeup and cleaning my skin if I do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that they only have 20 in a pack, so these are not something that I would use on a daily basis when at home.  It&#x27;s just not cost effective.  But for on the road, at the gym, vacations, etc. these are great because they make no mess in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The citrus smell is nice and refreshing and I like that it doesn&#x27;t stay on my skin for too long and irritate my nose.  The package reseals well and keeps the wipes inside the pack instead of all over my gym bag.</li>
    <li> I used to use these little round pads (Noxema?  Clearasil?) as a last stage after washing my face, and be horrified at all the grime that appeared on the pad.  Perhaps that&#x27;s one reason why these &amp;#34;swipes&amp;#34; are so large -- I don&#x27;t notice any dirt even though I haven&#x27;t just washed my face.  They&#x27;re definitely pleasant to use, and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Not sure how well they&#x27;ll get rid of &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34;, but it seems to help some.</li>
    <li> These cleansing cloths are certainly convenient.  For times when you&#x27;re out and about and want to get your makeup off, cleansing cloths are a great solution.  I find them particularly useful for going to the gym after work, when I&#x27;ve still got makeup on but don&#x27;t want to sweat through it.  This pack can be tossed easily in a gym bag or purse, and travels well.  I generally liked the orange and mint scent.  That said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for times when you don&#x27;t need an on-the-go solution.  I don&#x27;t think these work as well as a traditional cleanser that one would use at home, in one&#x27;s bathroom.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be using these all the time and chucking all the extra waste they create into landfills.  I also wasn&#x27;t all that fond of the exfoliating texture.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I found the nubs on the cloths to be unnecessarily irritating.  I&#x27;d prefer these with a smoother texture.  In general, if you understand the limits of these cloths, and like exfoliation, I suspect you&#x27;ll be happy with these.  Don&#x27;t expect a do-all wonder cloth.  Expect a convenience product that delivers well for what it is.</li>
    <li> These wipes are about 8 in. x 6 in., a good size for cleaning the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution contains alcohol to remove oil and dirt but also has moisturizers to help prevent drying the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The citrusy scent is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for baby wipes for its soft texture, easy cleaning, and comfort. When I was offered these to try, I had to bite. The exfoliating beads on these wipes is the dealbreaker. They are soft, comfortable, and get some work done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little to no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has enough juice and real estate to wipe off my face and some body parts (mileage may vary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these a lot. For the price, I&#x27;d rather keep these as a luxurious emergency back up for those lazy days. For the current price, I&#x27;d use it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> If you have dry, mature skin, you may think you can&#x27;t use these wipes, but you can! I found they are not JUST for acne-prone skin, because they exfoliate VERY GENTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them in the following ways:&lt;br /&gt;--on &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; days, I just swipe them over my skin in the evening before bed, rinse, and follow with a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;--on days when I&#x27;m wearing makeup, I use them after a cleansing oil to remove residue.&lt;br /&gt;--as a mini-facial: swipe, apply a heavy cream cleanser and let it sit, swipe again to remove cream and exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used in any of those ways, they leave my skin soft, cleansed, and fresh. Scents are hard to describe, but these have a refreshing &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; scent to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the way they&#x27;re packaged, they&#x27;ll be great for travel. Unfortunately, the way they&#x27;re packed is also why I am giving them four stars instead of five. I&#x27;ve always found that these little envelope type packages don&#x27;t keep the products moist enough unless you use them up quickly. I think they would be better in a small, hard-case of some kind, with a better seal. Still, if you plan to use them everyday, the packaging should be effective enough, and you&#x27;ll enjoy the results the towelettes give.</li>
    <li> These Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Swipes are perfect for me. Soft and effective for my face plus doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. My makeup comes right off and my skin feels very hydrated my only true complaint is that my eye makeup doesn&#x27;t fully come off so I have to rewash the area. I tend to breakout if my skin is not completely cleaned but since using these wipes for over a month I haven&#x27;t seen any new blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use:&lt;br /&gt;Take 1 swipe out of package&lt;br /&gt;Wipe or gently scrub face&lt;br /&gt;DONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also rewash my face with water when done to remove any swipe residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and how well these work I  have to recommended them. For people with sensitive skin, I also have to say these are a big success.</li>
    <li> I only use this type of product when I am traveling or camping because I think it is sort of wasteful to fill up a landfill when I can just use a washcloth and soap anytime I have access to water. I have used the neutoagena make-up wipes and do like those, but was given the opportunity to try out these Olay wipes. The first thing that I noticed was the great scent. It is a pleasant fresh orange smell.The towels are very wet and I do see that as a pro. What I really liked most were the green beads on one side of the wipe. It is sort of a gentle scrub that I liked very much. If the scrub gets too intense it is easy enough to flip the wipe over and use the other side that is just a plain wipe without the scrubbing beads. My face felt very clean after I used the wipe and did not have any sort of residue I wanted to wash off. I will choose this as my travel wipes in the future.</li>
    <li> On days when I am too tired to go through my normal nightly facial cleansing routine, I reach for a facial wipe.  When I saw that Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin See Spot Swipe cloths reduced oil and exfoliated skin, I had to have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Oil of Olay has been a beauty product staple for decades.  See Spot Swipe is affordable and comes in an easy to carry resealable pouch.  The scent is citrusy, but not overpowering.  The cloths did help slightly reduce oil in my T-zone area after continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The idea of the textured dots is great; however, it did not do much to exfoliate my skin.  I found myself having to use my regular exfoliator in addition to the wipes.  Also the wipes were a bit rough on my sensitive skin, and seemed to cause some minor breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Olay&#x27;s See Spot Swipe cloths are convenient; however, there are other brand cleansing cloths that are just as affordable, but do a better job.  I would try Olay cloths again, but without the exfoli-dots, as they were harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m noticing less zits on my teens, but not completely clear skin. In fact, it seems to be drying out their skin a little much - especially around the nose and cheek. No issues with my sensitive skin, so maybe it&#x27;s more of an adult product.</li>
    <li> The Olay &#x27;swipes&#x27; are surprisingly effective - far more so than most wipes I have used in the past. They remove make-up and oils, and also have a combination of astringent and softening qualities which are very pleasing.</li>
