    <li> HERE&#x27;S A WONDERFUL HAIRSPRAY. I LOVE BEING ABLE TO BUY IT ONLINE AND NOT LEAVE MY HOUSE! I RECOMMEND IT.</li>

    <li> This is the one my hairdresser always uses!  The price on Amazon is much less than buying it at the beauty salon and it is so much more convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a micro-fine spray that&#x27;s not too light and not too heavy, and just right for holding my hair in place all day.  My favorite thing about it is there is no sticky residue.  It brushes right out.  It gives my hair plenty of volume and shine and the can lasts me a long time!  It protects my hair color from fading and makes my hair appear fuller and thicker.</li>
    <li> Great hair spray one you can work with after you spray.  Not sticky or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Convenient ordering.</li>
    <li> This is the best ever. Allows you to secure hair, but then still able  to come out to freshen up.</li>
    <li> I like this hair spray. it holds well without being stiff or sticky. I&#x27;m not sure it is all day hold buts lasts most of the day. There isn&#x27;t a lot of over spray which I like. I don&#x27;t feel as if I am breathing in copious amounts of hairspray.</li>
    <li> Not too stiff and really works!  I think Goldwell products are the best.. I have fine blonde hair and this is perfect!</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray - not sticky but this is firmer hold.  Great for bangs or up dos - not really run your hands through it hairspray though.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and hold. Build up is average-noted on bathroom fixtures.</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray and found it here for a much lower price!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t have a horrid scent and it holds my hair perfectly.  I use it both on my wet hair and dry hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hairspray.  It has a pleasant smell, not that hideous smell of, say Aquanet).  I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Nice hold without being too stiff. My hairdresser got me hooked on goldwell sign hairspray!  I have purchased numerous bottles!</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time, love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it really keeps my hair in place all day.  I like Goldwell products and this is one of the best.  It came very quickly so I was pleased with that.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is good and holds up my medium long hair. Smells nice, I used my first bottle in roughly 3 months</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this hairspray on my last visit, and it is excellent. I was happy to find it at such a good price.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Works better than any of the other sprays I&#x27;ve used before  Great price, and arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  I took a while (week and 1/2) to get to me but I still purchased it cheaper than I could have gotten at the beauty parlor.  Great product.  I can still manipulate my hair after spraying it on but it holds it together very well.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds extremely well while using only a  small amount of spray. Very pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I will never use anything else. It combs out easy and doesn&#x27;t take much to hold your hair in place.</li>
    <li> Keeps your hair in place for a cocktail party indoors. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for outdoor events or activities</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairspray after they changed the formula of the  redken hairspray I had been using for years. After trying many hairsprays on my very fine colored blond hair, I can see immediately, that this hairspray is perfect for my hair type. It gives you a lot of volume, and also it is strong enough to hold my many layers in place in place.</li>
    <li> Love it and it works great for my hair!</li>
    <li> Not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t make hair looked weighed down.  Will continue to use this product.  Please keep in stock.</li>
