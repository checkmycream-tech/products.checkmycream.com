<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Started using product and noticed results right away. I&#x27;ve tried several products from Mary Kay, Neutrogrena, to higher end products and this product I&#x27;ve gotten better results above the rest.</li>
    <li> I have only used for about a week but so far seems to work pretty well, although may be making me have a few breakouts. I haven&#x27;t used it continuously everyday though so I can&#x27;t tell much difference in my skin or fine lines. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not seen any difference in my face.</li>
    <li> This is a nice serum.  It is very thick so I use a little argon oil with it so that it covers more of my face with out using more serum.  It absorbs well and has a nice smooth feeling not greasy.  I have not used it long enough for results but I still like it.</li>
    <li> I like this product, I have very oily skin and this went on non greasy and works under ur makeup</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after the first application ! It&#x27;s a really great product and works as it says it does.  I really love this company and will continue to use their products.  I am a very happy customer. It also arrived early! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Using product. No adverse reactions.</li>
    <li> Great product for any skin type.  I have been using for a very short time and can already see the difference in my skin.  My skin is truly hydrated and the shine and glow is amazing.  The firmness and tightening of my skin is so great and very noticeable.  Also great for sensitive skin and just hoping to see results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> My face feels great using this product.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to try this, have not seen results yet, haven&#x27;t taken long enough.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my skin feel smooth and tight. Have noticed my fine wrinkles disappearing</li>
    <li> LOVE IT.  THIS REALLY DOES PLUMP YOUR SKIN.  I PLAN ON USING THIS FOREVER!!  I FEEL LIKE I LOOK SO MUCH YOUNGER.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I can see a considerable amount of diffference around my eyes. The crows feet have diminished greatly. Absorbs well into the skin. Just takes a dab.Doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I am 61 and I have been using for a couple of weeks and can tell a difference in my skin already. I use after my shower and my skin is softer, pores are smaller, and my skin is tighter. It leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed after using. I had age spots really bad on my neck and they are fading. There is no greasy feeling after using and I can apply my makeup right after using. A little goes a long way. I also have less wrinkles under my eyes since using this product.</li>
    <li> So far so Good!!!!!  I have been using Peptide Complex Serum for approximately two weeks.  I wash my face and apply the Peptide Complex Serum first thing once my face has completely dried.  I can immediately feel the firmness in my skin - 😄!!!!  I let the serum completely dry before applying any other products.  I feel this will be a keeper for me plus the price was reachable as I am definitely a Diva on a budget.</li>
    <li> Ok tried this out tonight,and love it!My skin was sooo soft and smooth after.It has a light pleasant scent that made me think of a ripe melon.I recommend this product highly and will purchase again myself.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in 2 days. I love the way it feels. I cant wait to see the results will be back in a couple weeks and let you know!</li>
    <li> This works very well. I had a allergy attack to my under eye and my lid. I use some of this under my eye after the swollen went down and it tighten the skin by my eye. I did get this to try.</li>
    <li> So far has worked really good. Only been using for a couple weeks but have noticed some difference.</li>
    <li> Brovo FOXBIRM (Peptide complex serum) company.  What an awesome serum.  My skin at the age of 55 has never felt so alive or radiant.  Everytime I use FOXBIRM serum.  I felt like I was getting a mini cuccumber facel at my favorit spa. I don&#x27;t know if it just me, but I can see a difference on my face. It&#x27;s. Texture, elasticity,firmness and my crow&#x27;s feet are fading away each and every day.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you FOXBIRM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS YOUR CUSTERMER Sylvia</li>
    <li> What exactly are peptides?  And who doesn&#x27;t want to have better-looking skin?  Well, for starters I had to look it up and they are naturally occurring biological molecules and different peptides work differentlly in your body.  But in a serum, they are used to help the skin absorb the ingredients quickly and give you the results you need as fast as possible.  This complex works to help stimulate the production of collagen and to tone and firm your skin quickly (thus the advanced delivery system with the use of peptides).  This is a great serum for dry skin, the serum is thick and not watered down like some I have tried.  It leaves your skin feeling silky soft and you will definitely notice a difference within a few days!  Foxbrim is a very good brand, one of the top brands I have used and I definitely trust them to make great products for your skin.  This product contains no additives, silicones or paraben and is natural as are all Foxbrim products.  And they are NEVER tested on animals.  So when you want the best for your skin, look for the &amp;#34;cute fox&amp;#34; :)  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t comment on the product yet as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see effects.  Excellent service by Foxbrim and Amazon though.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a  few days now. And I can say this much it is easy to apply and absorbs quickly into the skin. A little does go a long way. I have noticed that over the past few days my skin does feel softer and it&#x27;s not as dry as it can be during the winter.Since I have only been using the product for 4 days I can&#x27;t attest to any wrinkle repair effect as of yet but I can say that I have noticed an evening in my skin tone overall so that is a plus. I have also noticed that my complexion looks healthier. I am very happy thus far with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Foxbrim products and enjoyed each one. The opportunity to try the Foxbrim Peptide Complex Serum came along and I jumped at the chance to do so.  I tried a couple of peptide products several years ago from a high end cosmetic company and thought that these might be nice to use. They were, however, too pricey for my pocketbook. This Foxbrim Peptide is affordably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now what do I think of this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it very thick for a serum. When I tried to dispense it using the dropper, it was not going into the dropper as serums usually do. It seemed that the dropper was pulling air instead of serum. I&#x27;d have to kind of stir and then depress the dropper bulb to engage the serum.&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on the face nicely. I don&#x27;t notice any fragrance or odor. It does tend to have a &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; feel as it dries. But this is not such that would  make it undesirable to use.&lt;br /&gt;After applying the serum, I used my morning moisturizer. Then I applied my makeup for the day. Works fine.&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any real improvement in my skin after using it for a couple of weeks. But neither have I noticed any detrimental effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions expressed are solely my own. No compensation was received.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this on my skin.  Feels great</li>
    <li> Peptide Complex Serum by Foxbrim contains Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, and Vitamin E. I used it under a moisturizer and some makeup and it did well with my facial skin; it seemed to absorb right into my skin and it has a clear and healthy look. It didn&#x27;t look oily and didn&#x27;t look dry to me either. My pores also have looked good since I&#x27;ve used it.    I loved the eye dropper that was included with this product. It didn&#x27;t drop out too much of the product at once, which allowed me to apply it a little bit at a time to difference places on my face.    There are some organic ingredients listed on the ingredients label and the other ingredients sound healthy to me in this product also.     I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
    <li> Not really liking this serum. Really haven&#x27;t had any real results yet. I was hoping for some softness to my skin and may be softning of wrinkles.  This just has not done it for me.</li>
    <li> The Peptide Complex Serum arrived quickly and in undamaged packaging. I began using it right away, as I have a bit of a wrinkle problem! After applying as directed my skin felt fresh and a bit tighter. I also applied to my neck. After a week or so I can notice a bit of firmness in my skin that wasn&#x27;t there before. I&#x27;m excited to see what the long term results will be since I am noticing results after a week! Overall I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have been using for a few weeks and have noticed smaller pores and skin feels much firmer. Apply before putting on my makeup and makeup goes on much smoother.</li>
    <li> I use the FoxBrim Peptide Complex Serum in the morning before applying my moisturizer and make-up.  It has a faint but pleasing scent; not too overpowering.  It keeps my skin looking hydrated and refreshed.  It is like I got a great night sleep.  I will recommend this product to my friends and family and I will purchase in the near future.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews I decided to purchase this serum. I have used for about a week and I;m very satisfied about my purchase. My face feels very soft and moisturized</li>
    <li> Great peptide complex for my aging skin! My face is brighter and my overall complexion is definitely better.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging and look of the Foxbring Peptide Complex Serum. I looked at the company website and the amazon page before trying, because I only want to put good products on my face, not harmful ones. It showed Hyaluronic Acid + Jojoba Oil + Vitamin E as the ingredients, so I felt relieved. It comes in a cute bottle and is a clear-type gel. It smells slightly sweet. However, when it arrived, there were a lot more ingredients than 3. These are what are listed on the label, and should be listed on the website/amazon page for interested consumers like me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic herbal infusion, Organic Aloe, Witch Hazel, botanical hyaluronic acid, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carageenan gum, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Silk Amino Acid Blend, Organic Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I known it included Sodium Benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate and carageenan, both of which I try to avoid, then I would have not purchased this. If you&#x27;re not into reading ingredients as I am, then I say try this out and see if you like it! It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot. If you&#x27;re like me, then I&#x27;d say pass...</li>
    <li> I have only used for two days, but my face feels softer and the wrinkles are not as noticeable.  It also smells good</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this product!  I love the fact that the serum is thicker than the other products I have used.  I like the way the product glides over my skin.  I am using several Foxbrim products and so far I am very pleased with the results.  I have been using this product for several weeks. So far so good!  I will be purchasing other Foxbrim products in the future.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim is one of my favorite brands when it comes to skin care! I love their anti aging line and have tried quite a few of their products. I have never been disappointed with all their products that I have used. Some anti aging serums and creams can be quite drying and harsh to my sensitive skin – but not this serum! I am quite impressed with how moisturizing it is and how it eradicates my fine lines. I am loving this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Great serum , offers great benefits to skin and very affordable. Very light formula, perfect for any skin. Looking forward to see the result</li>
    <li> This serum feels velvety soft when applying, yet dries without residue!  A little goes a long way and I love how my skin feels!!  Great product!!</li>
    <li> This product is odorless and is not oily at all. I haven&#x27;t noticed too much improvement in my skin, but it is not hurting and I am hoping that with more use it will continue to nourish my skin. I love that the bottle is so big. It makes you feel like you are getting your moneys worth.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my skin in a very short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Just started using it so I will have to give an update to my review in a few weeks. Only thing I can say right now is the eye dropper is kind of a pain to work with.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It&#x27;s light and isnt sticky. It goes a long way as well.</li>
    <li> Spending lots of time out in the sun I decided it was time to try something new for my skin. I was pleased with the results after only a few days. My skin was clearer and less dull. I love how easily it applies and a little goes a long ways! I am looking forward to seeing the results after a few months!</li>
    <li> this is a nice product</li>
    <li> Seems to instantly moisturize, will have to see how it performs long term. Will update in a couple weeks</li>
    <li> Okay not fabulous. If the pump were easier to use I would have given it 5 stars</li>
    <li> I like the smell - so far so good.</li>
    <li> I use these products from Foxbrim brand for my beauty needs. I came across the brand , tried one of the products and now I buy them all. Great products, they work as they are supposed to.I love the texture, lack of funny or strong smells and the beat part is that I do not break out while using them. Perhaps, its just me but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> LOVE this serum!  Face feels fantastic after use!!</li>
    <li> Ingredients: Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Witch Hazel, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Silk Amino Acid Blend, Organic Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;The Product: This lightweight gel comes in an amber glass bottle with eye-dropper. This helps prevent oxidation and contamination from external sources. It is not tested on animals, is made in the USA, and the contents potency lasts for 12 months after opening container. Only a small amount is needed to be gently smoothed or patted on the face or other skin areas. It has only a very minor scent that lessens once it is absorbed. It spreads so gently it is like moving water across your skin. As soon as it is absorbed the skin feels very soft. Fine lines and wrinkles are minimized. With the use of hyaluronic acid, the serum will continue to boost moisturization of the skin. It absorbs so well that it can easily be used under makeup or sunscreen. Continued use keeps the skin soft with no dryness, tightness or itchy patches. After cleansing the skin remains soft, but it is wise to use this product daily, or even twice a day, to maintain the real benefits. I have used several products from Foxbrim before and they make high quality products that actually perform as well as they say. While your results may not be exactly like mine, I would recommend this product for everyone looking for improved skin appearance and ongoing smoothness and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. After a few days using i can see the difference. I have a few dark spots on my face and now they&#x27;re almost gone. After applying it my face feels soft and it does have a pleasant aroma. I would really recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have never used a peptide serum before, but I have ready many articles about it and how it boosts the collagen production and how beneficial it is to ad to your daily routine . The Foxbrim Peptide Complex Serum comes in a glass bottle with a dropper on it and it is a thick, off white cloudy serum that quickly absorbs into the skin. I have been using Foxbrim Peptide Complex Serum Advanced Delivery Serum for a little over two weeks now and have to say I am pleasantly surprised with it. I used it every morning and night after I wash my face. I let the serum absorb into my skin and then follow it with a light moisturizer. After daily use of this product I have noticed that my skin looks smoother and firmer.</li>
    <li> Product feels refreshing and firming can&#x27;t wait to see the results!!!</li>
    <li> I like the serum products a lot. I want to moisturize but almost every moisturizer is too greasy and I either don&#x27;t like the feel or I break out. This is fairly clear and is just thick enough to apply without it dripping like water. Subjectively I think my complexion looks a little brighter.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly in the skin. Nice feel under my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This serum is reasonable and has lifted fine and deeper wrinkles over time.  I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I gave this serum to my aunt who is 70 years old. She loves the smell and the result is visible after a week of use. She loves the bottle, it has really thicken the skin and refines the wrinkles. I&#x27;ll definitely come back for another bottle for her. Great product!</li>
    <li> Time alone will tell It certainly soaks into the skin</li>
    <li> Great serum very hydrating without beign oily</li>
    <li> The base of this stuff is aloe Vera.  It leaves my face sticky feeling and I don&#x27;t really like the smell. I like that it&#x27;s organic, but I don&#x27;t feel it worked as well as other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The serum was given as a gift to my Mom.  She absolutely loves the serum.  She tells all her friends about how great her skin looks and feels from using the serum.</li>
    <li> Love it!! and I got it for a super price :)</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> it left my face really soft</li>
    <li> So far I LOVE this stuff!  I have very sensitive skin and have to be very careful about what I put on it.  This serum feels wonderful and has caused me no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a week and notice the fine lines seem to be diminishing.  My face feels smoother too. This is my opinion</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t decided if I love this item yet. I can&#x27;t tell if its doing what its suppose to or not</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all in wrinkles/crow&#x27;s feet, etc. I&#x27;m younger so they&#x27;re not as defined and maybe that&#x27;s the problem but it hasn&#x27;t made a difference for me. It does help keep my skin feeling drier and less oily for longer, though that&#x27;s not why I purchased it. Very nice company with great customer service and friendly e-mails, but the product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Made my skin rash. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> not really seeing a difference and been using a week, I will update my review if I notice a change.</li>
    <li> Love this and a must have for your skin..</li>
    <li> I use this faithfully and my skin looks more refreshed and brighter.</li>
    <li> Great product. After looking around and doing some research I decided to try this serum. So far I love the way my face is looking younger, and the way it make it feel. I would buy again</li>
    <li> One of the best anti-wrinkle creams out there on the market. My wrinkles are getting less noticeable using this product!</li>
    <li> I started using this yesterday. I&#x27;ve used it three times and my thirsty skin soaked it right up. I feel smooth and already look glowy. I&#x27;ll review more once I&#x27;ve used it more</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference or feel one. Digging for a + side, non oily.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom.  She loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Ive been using Peptide for a good week now. I like the product and it hydrates my face well. Twp issues I have with it is that once applied it is a bit sticky and I get a headache every time I apply it for awhile.</li>
    <li> Love this I only wish I had more.</li>
    <li> leaves skin nice and soft Great product and quality... Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I have added it to my daily routine using it instead of a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This serum is great to use and effective.</li>
    <li> Great product, definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this, but after using it for 6 straight days, I am noticing some reduction with fine lines, especially around my eyes.  That right there makes me happy.</li>
    <li> I had never used a serum before so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  I love this!  FoxBrim sent usage instructions beforehand - which I appreciated.  I love using this product.  It is refreshing and makes my skin look and feel fabulous.  I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply tinted moisturizer over - but no problems at all.  I now use this every morning and night.</li>
    <li> This is a great combination of hyaluronic acid, peptides, vitamin E &amp; witch hazel. The combination is great for your skin. I use it after I was my face under my moisturizer and make up. I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> Love the non-sticky light texture of this serum and how quickly it&#x27;s absobed into the skin. Love the bottle too!</li>
    <li> This serum is thick and feels great on your face. I can tell a difference in my hydration and look of my skin.</li>
    <li> This has helped with my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> great serum that works well</li>
    <li> The Peptide Complex Serum is really good, after few days of use the fine lines are less visible. The face shows a healthier appearance and feels more hydrated. The skin seems more youthful and feels great. I really recommend this product for the results seen in my face.</li>
    <li> Nice product, goes on nice and I think it makes me look tanner too.</li>
    <li> This serum works well. I use it at night and Vitamin C serum daytime, under moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It as good as any of the other serums on the market without a prescription.  I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle of a 20 year old face on a remarkably nice 62 year old face who most think I&#x27;m 45-50</li>
    <li> This serum feels great on my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks in the future.</li>
    <li> So far this serum has been great. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and my skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 2 weeks now. I like the product. My skin seems firmer. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as described. Makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days but I can already feel a notable difference in my skin. So far I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have not used it long enough to see any visible results.  But it goes on smoothly and no offending odor.  It dries pretty quickly after applying.</li>
    <li> LOve this stuff makes my skin so soft!!!</li>
    <li> Great addition to my facial care regimen. My wife encouraged me to try the serum for dry lines around my eyes and mouth. The serum makes my face feel hydrated and smooth.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after only a few uses. Allow to air dry beforehand puttin on moisterizor. Would recommend and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This Foxbrim serum works very well so far. I love that it has no additives, silicones or parabens. I also like that it works from the inside out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a little while now and do really like it... It keeps my skin feeling tighter, looking a little tighter as well as softer. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin tone, dark marks or anything else like that. I plan to continue to use it and hope it eventually helps with more of the things it says it does. Personally I love trying new facial products so it&#x27;s worth trying!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling clean and soft!</li>
    <li> Thinner than it looks. Spreads readily and does not irritate or redden skin. My skin looks much healthier. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> My face looks brighter and younger already. it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks since I started using it. yay!! very exciting</li>
    <li> Love it! My skin is already smoother and softer. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using this every morning.  It absorbs quickly into my skin. My skin appears more youthful to me.</li>
    <li> I got this Serum product few days ago. This eye serum has done wonders for my dark circles under my eyes as well as the puffiness. The dark circles have decreased little by little. Absorbs well into the skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling. nice product. great buy.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. I use it at night and it soaks into my skin so quickly. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  I am always on the outlook for peptide creams as I find they really work, so when I came upon this cream on Amazon, decided to give it a try and am so happy that I did. I tend to look for products that work well but are not too highly priced and this one fits the bill.  I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it.....Absorbs well...Doesn&#x27;t take much.....</li>
    <li> My initial reaction after using this every day for a week on my (newly forming) &amp;#34;jowls&amp;#34; was &amp;#34;another false claim and worthless product&amp;#34;. I kept using it anyway and I&#x27;m glad I did! WOW! A little backstory for you - I&#x27;m late 50&#x27;s and was starting to notice the saggy jowls about a year ago. Over the past winter deep puckered lines formed in the jowls from my jawline up to the smile lines. Recently those pucker lines had started to &amp;#34;y&amp;#34; to the corners of my mouth. I heard on a Dr. Oz show that this particular facial aging was best corrected with peptides so I bought this product. Now let me tell you the improvement. As of today (I guess it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks - now still using one drop on each jaw, daily) the sagging jowls are barely noticeable along my jaw line, the deep puckered lines are completely gone on the right side. I sleep on my left side so the pucker line on the left isn&#x27;t gone but it&#x27;s not deep or actually &#x27;puckered&#x27; anymore. It&#x27;s just a dent. On both sides that &#x27;y&#x27; that was forming to my mouth is completely gone and I can&#x27;t even tell where they WERE! I&#x27;m so thrilled that I&#x27;ve started using it on other areas that are sagging, like my brow bone skin. This is a real-deal peptide product. Not a phony jazzed up to placate us baby boomers just to take our money. Bravo</li>
    <li> Have only used this a few weeks, so as far as &#x27;anti aging&#x27; effects which is why I bought it, I&#x27;ll wait and see. As for the serum, it is really nice. Easy to use with a dropper. Dark bottle to preserve the serum. Absorbs pretty quickly and has a nice feel when applied</li>
    <li> Have only been using for about a week, too short of a time to notice any differences yet. The serum goes on easily after showering, non greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue which is nice! Doesn&#x27;t burn or sting which is also nice! Will keep using :)</li>
    <li> THIS CLEAR JELL SERUM GOES WELL WITH OTHER FACE MOISTERIZERS TOO..IT GOES ON THIN AND ABSORBS FAST...DOES TIGHTEN AND MAKE SKIN, EVEN OLD LIKE MINE NICE AND FRESH LOOKING...AND BEST OF ALL..IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL NASTY LIKE MOST SERUMS DO....</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I love this serum! My skin has drastically improved in texture and moisture level. Within one week I noticed the change. It works better than serums that cost $100s or more.</li>
    <li> Significant promotional discount on this item was provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often review various skin serums, but I&#x27;d not tried a serum quite like this before so I was excited to try it.  This is a peptide serum, and it is in an aloe base, with vegetable glycerin, witch hazel, peptides, cassia seed extract, jojoba oil and a number of other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one ounce in an amber bottle with an eye dropper for dispersal.  Serums are supposed to be applied to the skin before moisturizer and should quickly absorb into the skin, delivering nutrients to the skin before the moisturizer barrier goes on.  I used this with Clinique Daily Moisturizer and A&#x27;vieu night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clear, and the consistency is much like aloe vera gel. When it is cold, it gets a bit cloudy, which goes away when it becomes warm again. It does have a faint odor, but to me it is not bad at all. It is herbal and I can smell the witch hazel in it.  It feels a lot like aloe vera gel going on - it has a nice thickness to it like a gel, but it is very easily and quickly spread and absorbed.  It is not at all oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tightens my skin a bit and seems especially helpful on forehead wrinkles.  It hasn&#x27;t broken me out and my skin is soft and smooth.  It seems to be working ok.  I haven&#x27;t had years erased, lol, but I do feel it will help me hold my own.  I find it pleasant to use as part of a comprehensive skin care regimen.  I&#x27;ve been using it with an ionic skin device and together they work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;- One ounce is only lasting me about 3 weeks.  My skin just drinks this.&lt;br /&gt;-It has carrageenan gum in it, which I don&#x27;t like.  I&#x27;d rather it just be thinner&lt;br /&gt;-though it says it contains Hyaluronic acid in it, it is not very good after a chemical peel, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has enough in it and left my skin uncomfortable. I have to have a &#x27;straight&#x27; hyaluronic acid for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other positives worth mentioning&lt;br /&gt;-Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;-Cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;-no piling even when combined with several other productsith several other products</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It has definitely softened my skin and seems to tighten. This definitely seems to help helped the fine lines in my skin. I use it at night and really feel it helps.</li>
    <li> Skin is soft but looks not one day younger.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It&#x27;s not runny or thick/sticky like some serums I&#x27;ve tried. It gets absorbed by the skin in seconds. It left my skin smooth and soft. I spilled some accidentally, so I applied it on my hand. I immediately noticed how the skin on my hand was softer, almost illuminated compared to my other hand. I also like that this product has all natural/organic ingredients that are good for my skin. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Looking forward to future results!</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this product, it is a thick- ish gel and a little goes a long way. I have noticed a pretty decent reduction of the lines around my eyes, my neck and upper chest.</li>
    <li> This serum is very nice to put on and it has no scent.  It absorbed quickly.  Hoping to look younger soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile and I really can see a difference in my skin.  This product works well. I was given a discount to give my honest opinion</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I started by using it all over my face and neck area and now just use on neck and decolletage areas. It comes in a glass bottle with dropper but it&#x27;s more of a thick gel (think aloe consistency) than a serum and because of this, it&#x27;s not that easy to use with the dropper. I just wipe the dropper stick with my fingers and apply that way. It absorbs REALLY quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel like you have applied anything at all, which for some, may be exactly what you like. I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and don&#x27;t know that I have seen or felt any results but will continue to use until the bottle is empty and go from there. I do love the bottle and dropper it comes in as it&#x27;s great to re-use once emptied.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with little expectations. I am not sure if it helps with wrinkles. I have only been using for 2 weeks. But my skin feels amazing and deffinetly looks healthier. I started tanning about when I began using this. Even with the tanning. There  has deffinetly been an over all  healthier appearance to my skin. I will purchase this product again. This is my third time. I love it</li>
    <li> Beyond pleasesd! Can see improvement after only a week! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it so far! Feels soft and smooth on the face!</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin feels softer and firmer</li>
    <li> I havent noticed any changes or improvements to my skin yet but its only been a few weeks. The product has a nice feel</li>
    <li> Great product!Keeps your skin so moisturized and hydrated. Works great. I have only been using it a  over a week and i can see a difference. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much of a difference it makes over time.</li>
    <li> The Peptide Complex Serum product was very easy to use, did not cause any skin irritation or dryness. i loved how it felt on my skin but so far after using the product for a few weeks I have not experience any significant changes in my skin, I will however continue using the product for a few more weeks to see if changes  occur.</li>
    <li> Very nice serum for your face. Has peptides, hyaluronic acid, witch hazel and jojoba oil. Wonderful serum for my face. Love the smoothness.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother and she loves it! She said the change is noticeable after the first couple of uses. She is extremely pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This really isn&#x27;t doing anything for me.  It&#x27;s clumpy and sometimes it just sort of sits on top of my skin then peels off.  Yuck.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it --- Looking younger already!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Perfect for nourishing skin that has been neglected.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin so soft and smooth. I love it!</li>
    <li> This Peptide Complex Serum is amazing. I purchased this for my mom and she loves it. She has been using it for a while now and I can see a huge difference in her wrinkles and her over all elasticity of her skin and the texture too. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their skin. It shipped quick and in great shape.</li>
    <li> Great serum, I did notice a little bit of acne here and there so I  decrease the use of it to 3 times per week only. That helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;This Serum is a very good addition to my skin care regimen. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now, and I am very pleased with it. I have very sensitive skin and most things I try on my face make me break out, but I was pleased to find that this serum did not have that effect. My skin does seem to be looking more youthful already.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I immediately could feel a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture. After only a short time I can already see a decrease in the fine lines around my eyes! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Lovely serum. I have sun damaged, dry skin and did notice how old I was looking until I saw myself in recent pictures. This serum has brightened and tightened my skin. I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a week and a half so far.I think it feels like silky water. It dries quickly, does&lt;br /&gt;not leave a sticky feel &amp; it doesn&#x27;t cause me any irritation. I like the eye dropper, I use it to apply the&lt;br /&gt;serum to my lines and then I spread it around from there. My main lines that bother me are three kinda&lt;br /&gt;deep lines going across my forehead horizontally, and i have a small short deep one going vertically&lt;br /&gt;between my brows. I am very facially expressive. I do find this softens the one between my brows for&lt;br /&gt;a little while, but so far nothing much for my forehead. I am hoping by time I am done with the bottle I&lt;br /&gt;will see more &amp; lasting results. I figure it will take a little time to see more improvements. I do have high&lt;br /&gt;hopes for this serum and I can&#x27;t wait to see results when bottle is finished.I bought this product at a&lt;br /&gt;promotional price for review &amp; testing. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my&lt;br /&gt;reviews are honest and based off of mine &amp; my family&#x27;s experiences.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have given it two weeks and there is a very noticeable reduction in facial lines. I have tried another peptide but it made no difference. I follow the directions faithfully twice a day.the cost is extremely reasonable and I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I  can&#x27;t write review in the few words allowed. Yes I have questions.  I use professional products on clients. I need to see results.</li>
    <li> good quality product and excellent customer service. I have been using it in conjunction with the vitamin c serum for about a week and my skin is softer and brighter and I have noticed a reduction in the appearance of the fine lines on my forehead, by my eyes and on my shoulders as well. Also it smells very nice: kind of cucumbery. The serum is a little thick for the eyedropper applicator but it&#x27;s not to detrimental to its functioning.</li>
    <li> This peptide Complex serum I had a chance to review and test is awesome. I love how it is not too thick and sticky unlike some others I have tried.  The minute this is applied to my skin I feel it working. It does not leave a sticky feel and rather leaves a smooth feel. My favorite part though is it contains witch hazel and Vitamin E. They work great together in this product making it a product I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The serum is fairly thick bodied and went on very easy with no overwhelming order. My face felt very silky after the treatment. I love the combination of ingredients and I am hoping with continued use to have better looking skin.</li>
    <li> .. well all i can say about this serum was amazingly fantastic.. it doesnt harm..its ichy free.. its easy to absorb.. i use it every night.. and i love the morning result :) it give my face a natural glow :)</li>
    <li> This is a great peptide serum.  Within a couple of days, I noticed a difference in the firmness of my skin.  I&#x27;ve used other peptide formulas and they have always either irritated my skin causing rosacea or clogged my pores, causing acne.  This blend with witch hazel is AWESOME.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This serum is rich and feels great on the skin. It absorbs quickly, no stickiness. After using this morning and night for one month, I can see a visible difference in the bags under my eyes, which is why I bought it. The skin looks more plump (not hallow like before). I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Is a good serum. I have been using it for a couple of days and my skin looks more vibrant. The consistency is tick and is diesnt have a flower smell just a subtle smell.</li>
    <li> My face is looking so much better. Definitely worth buying til I die. :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother im building her a mothers day spa day gift basket</li>
    <li> Love this product , my skin feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Just received it. Will write about it later.</li>
    <li> I have never been more compelled to write a review on a product. After just one night I saw amazing results, and now after about a week, I am hooked and will never be without this product again. My skin is visibly brighter, and smoother and my pores look smaller too!&lt;br /&gt;I have been recently prone to breakouts so I add a few drops of the rosehip seed oil with the serum and OMG! I am so happy!!</li>
    <li> Nice and moisturizing. plumping skin.</li>
    <li> Great, Just as hoped for!</li>
    <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review.&lt;br /&gt;Opinions are 100% my own. It arrived on time and well packaged. I use this every morning. I can&#x27;t really say whether or not it&#x27;s reversing any signs of aging, but I love the way it makes my face feel! I can definitely tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it. I use it under my moisturizer it goes on easy and absorbs fast. It makes the skin smooth and soft. I will continue to use this product to see all the wonderful improvements it does to my skin over time.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping my skin so far,but does seem to make it oilier than usual!</li>
    <li> I have bought quite a few serums lately. Different brand names and strengths. I really like this one because it is absorbed quickly and leaves my skin feeling amazing. No tackiness or drying out. Use it in the morning and evening. Have a beautiful glow to my skin that I didn&#x27;t have before. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love that I can combine with the vitamin C serum.  It goes on clean and never sticky!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, non-greasy oil. Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have any weird scent. Skin feels soft and supple after use.</li>
    <li> This goes on nice and smooth. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am sad to say that it caused a huge breakout. I had to stop using it. After reading some of the positive reviews I thought I would&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful. ...is a great facial cream for anti-aging.</li>
    <li> The Peptide Complex Serum was delivered in protective packaging and in good condition.  The serum was exactly as described on product page.  We purchased the Peptide Complex in a promotion for testing and review.  We find the Peptide complex seems to replace moisture, especially when used directly after a bath or shower.  Our skin is beginning to exhibit a healthy glow, where it seemed a bit more dull before.  We like that this particular brand is made in the USA in an FDA certified facility.  and the serum is pure with no additives.</li>
    <li> I am using this every morning and I can feel my skin tighten after applying.  My makeup goes on after quite easily and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;My pores also appear smaller.  Overall, I am well satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three days.  I love how easy it is to apply and love even more how it makes my face feel.  I will update after using this for two weeks to report if I see a difference in the texture of my face.</li>
    <li> I have random things that make me break out in hives so I have to be really careful about what I use on my face.  I like the feel of this.  It feels like it&#x27;s tightening things up a little.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge differences but it&#x27;s worth a try for the price.  No bad reactions.  The customer service is amazing.  You get an email before and after checking to make sure you got it and that you like it.  I&#x27;m sure if you had any issues, they&#x27;d be more than happy to help you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about 4 weeks.  The most noticeable improvement has been to the jowl area - there is definite tightening of the area.  I do notice that some wrinkles are diminishing, however the deepest wrinkles have not yet been improved.  I will continue to use the serum, it is so simple to apply and does not leave a sticky feeling.  I use it in the mornings and evenings, followed by moisturizer.  I will be looking for a moisturizer that is specifically designed to work with this serum, that may speed the improvement.  I have had to remind myself that these wrinkles and sagging didn&#x27;t happen overnight, therefore the treatment will not happen overnight.  I do wish that I had taken a couple of &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; photos so that I could actually see the comparison.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my facial skin is more even and smoother than before. I have combination skin, my face seems to be less oily after using it.</li>
    <li> Amazing on dry skin, tightened my skin</li>
    <li> Comparing this blend to other combinations, I think this is the best for a woman of my 60+ age. I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for a few weeks now on my wrinkle areas and then smoothing it across my face. No irritation what so ever!! New smoothness on my face.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with your product,and I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and I&#x27;m already seeing improvements in the texture of my skin.  I&#x27;m a former smoker and although only a very light smoker, I saw changes in my skin.  I wish I had done before pictures.  I will add to this review once the bottle is gone, but so far I&#x27;m beyond satisfied.  Using it in addition to Foxbrim Argan Oil for moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This serum makes my skin look flawless.  I use it in the morning under my moisturizer.  I love the way my skin looks and the pricing is great.</li>
    <li> No difference in any way.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  It is crazy how fast I noticed a change in my skin.  The serum is refreshing and the difference is noticeable.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Our skin really needs care especially our face.As age getting higher skin  starts to sag.Very visible and we cannot hide it. That&#x27;s why we need to apply anti aging serum to prevent aging  or to  solve skin issues like dryness, oiliness, wrinkles, uneven skin tone, discoloration and dark spots. I used this product by applying my entire face and after 2 weeks of using my skin is so wonderful, very smooth, fresh and young..so beautiful. I would suggest to all folks out there to buy and choose this serum.</li>
    <li> i love how my skin has been felling very soft after using the serum i am very happy with this beauty product</li>
    <li> my grandma love this product and ordered more</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with thisw product. Before buying it I read the reviews and what it claims to do. I figured if t offers a money back guarantee I have nothing to lose. Also if it has a money back guarantee they must feel confident their product will deliver. It certainly does. It didnt take long. My skinis dry and it didnt take long For that healthy, natural glow</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve added the this Peptide Complex Serum to my daily regimen.  I really like it, in addition to the vitamin C and coconut oil I am using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of serums recently. I used to pay a ton of money on department store serums but I don&#x27;t think I will be going back to that. Peptide Serum does wonders for my skin and I&#x27;m happy to share the results with others. I am also glad to be saving some money as this seems to be so much cheaper. I hope it stay this way</li>
    <li> Great product! When applying to my face it absorbs quickly. After just a few uses i noticed my skin was softer and my dry patches were gone. Great product and I will continue to use it:)</li>
    <li> This Peptide Complex Serum is wonderful, I didn&#x27;t have much hope even though I got this at a very discounted price, but wow!! I I&#x27;m 54 and I&#x27;ve tried oodles and oodles of serums and moisturizers that didn&#x27;t really work, this serum has been a God send!, it makes my skin so smooth and soft and I can see some dark spots fading already yay! lol Very excited with the results. I definitely will re-order when it&#x27;s finished but you only need a very small amount so it will be a while before I need re-order.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Gentle, soothing, and my pores look really good.</li>
    <li> As a former &amp;#34;nothing but soap and water&amp;#34; person, it might be a bit too soon to say definitively that this stuff is reducing the appearance of fine lines and pores,  but maybe I&#x27;m starting to see a difference. I do like the texture of the serum and the absence of an unacceptable fragrance. I&#x27;ll try another bottle and decide whether to continue with this regimen.</li>
    <li> I like the product. Seems to a nice job over time. Helps skin barrier &amp; overall texture. Non irritating &amp; no fragrance. I&#x27;m an lic esthetician for 15yrs now. I&#x27;m always in the look out for new products-- this one is pretty nice especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I love  Foxbrim peptide complex serum.  I would give it 5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> Made the skin nice but did not smooth out fine wrinkles</li>
    <li> my skin looks better since I use this serum , feel smoother, less wrinkles if &#x27;ve noticed a big change</li>
    <li> When I got this on a deal was not sure about it, but was really excited to see it have a great effect.</li>
    <li> Could not tell a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Great serum, very thick like a serum should be.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Makes my skin glow and OH so soft !  It also soothes my skin and feels refreshing. I use it day and night !</li>
    <li> My skin feels softer and looks brighter and it&#x27;s not even a month yet since I started using this. Having high hopes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  I am using this and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum together, one in the morning and the other at night.  I&#x27;ve noticed a great improvement in my skin... it&#x27;s firm and smooth!</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with this product!! You can feel it working and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I have only been using this for a a few days, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and absorbs well. I will leave more feedback once I have more experience in using it</li>
    <li> I use this every day! It is helping to diminish old scars and keep my skin looking healthy.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product with great results at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Skin appears brighter and smoother!</li>
    <li> Great serum, skin is nice and smooth,  feels healthier, great buy, thank you</li>
    <li> First time ordering from this seller.  Have used for the first time and liked the product.</li>
    <li> Works well. Notice a big difference in just a few days.</li>
    <li> This is one of 4 Foxbrim products that I use.  I am a 25 year old male that has some skin issues, and after just 14 days, I am seeing real results.  My skin feel more full and tight.  With continued use, I can only imagine the results in the months to come!</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s smoothing without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I have loved the entire Foxbrim line of products.  The peptide complex serum has kept my face clear of blemishes and my skin is so soft all the time.  I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of my sun damage has faded as well.  I use this day and night and along with my night time lift cream also by Foxbrim.  I finally am sticking with their entire line of products.  Very affordable and lives up to their promises that the products do what they are supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
    <li> Just got this today and I know I will be addicted!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It makes my skin feel silky and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> This made my face feel baby soft! Love it!</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels great! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Its great to use serums that use various types of ingredients that are great for tour skin, this one contains peptides, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E which are great moisturizing, restoring, and prolonge the aging process. This serum is lightweight, get absorb really fast by the skin and instantly makes your skin feel more alive and healthy. I love my skin to be supple and glowy and in order to achieve it i have to always use serums like this one that will my skin exactly what it needs. Its as if my skin drinks it up wheni apply it. Thumbs up for creating amazing products. This company is amazing and i will continue to support them. These are my honest opinions on trying this product.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my face at all.  I am a 27 year old female who has had sun exposure and acne.  I do not notice a difference after using the entire bottle.  It felt somewhat watered down to me as well. If you do try it I would recommend to use a little at a time because it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> You will only believe how well this works after using it yourself... I did and I do... It&#x27;s like a little bit of the illusive fountain in a bottle...</li>
    <li> I have never posted a review before but was so thrilled with this product that I had to. Great value for price and results were noticeable within the first few days !</li>
    <li> Wonderfully effective prodict.  Fast shipping.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Peptide Complex Serum since December 2014.It does restore elasticity and firmness to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this a few weeks but it makes my skin feel amazing. Like the other reviews it does have a slight smell, it smells like plants to me so I don&#x27;t mind it. It makes my skin very soft and even toned. I love it!</li>
    <li> Made my burn scar feel much better</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I would recommend the Peptide Complex Serum for overall healthier younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, I had chicken pox scars that I got last year and they are now more smooth. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Being positive and really hopes it works.</li>
    <li> I really Love the creamy serum and it goes on so smooth and absorbs quickly so you can follow with moisturizer  (or whatever you do) It great to use daily and I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> Just by chance i came across this product, and decided to take a chance....  my skin so gratefully thanks you!  I&#x27;ve always stayed with&lt;br /&gt;the usual over the counter products.  Not anymore!  The reviews attributes to its many benefits.  Again, thank you so much for coming to my&lt;br /&gt;rescue!</li>
    <li> I recently added Foxbirth&#x27;s Peptide Complex Serum to my daily facial care regimen and I&#x27;m liking the results. My skin looks and feels tighter, soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Finally found something that makes my skin retain moisture and look better every day!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Amazing product. A must buy. Better than any high end serum you can buy.</li>
    <li> I like it. it smells good. after use it, my skin looks good.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a fair evaluation.  I was out of the state when I first ordered the serum and have only been using it about a week since my return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> I would order this product again. I actually think it&#x27;s good stuff and priced well. I can&#x27;t wait to see how fabulous I look after using two bottles!</li>
    <li> My mother did not like this product. Dropper is difficult to use. Unhappy with overall product quality. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> So far so good... ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price and has made my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> Nice serum.  Doesn&#x27;t evaporate into the skin as I had hoped, and is a bit sticky at first, but overall, I like it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this serum. I saw results right away!  Especially on my neck area where my skin is dry. The hydration  felt and made a big difference. I will purchase again !!</li>
    <li> The Peptide Complex is the third Foxbrim product that I&#x27;ve reviewed and I continue to be impressed.  This is another great product at a very reasonable price.  When I first got the product I didn&#x27;t know what it was for so I did some research.  Peptides are aminino acids designed to help increase collagen in the skin and assist with anti-aging.  I use the Peptide Serum at night after I wash my face and put the firming treatment on over the peptide treatment.  When I first started using it there was a slight burning when I applied it to my forehead but no redness.  I do have delicate skin so I tend to be cautious with what I put on my skin.  Since following this skincare regime I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in fine lines and wrinkles, I feel better about myself and how I look.  I highly, highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> just started using, look forward to its results, easy to use</li>
    <li> I have used it daily and I love how my skin feels. Some of the redness has calmed down. I will order more!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference, ive been using it for about a week, my face is a bit smoother and it is easier to use than other serums.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I can see the difference already!</li>
    <li> I am now using this in place of Dior serum and saving hundreds of dollars -- it definitely has an immediate noticeable effect.</li>
    <li> My Wife loves this.  nice smell.</li>
    <li> Loved how it felt the minute I applied this product on my skin, it&#x27;s only been the second day and already notice a difference. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> this product is good.  it makes your face appear to look bright and healthy.  This product has no scent.  I have oily skin and it did not make my skin oily.  My face felt very soft and oil free.</li>
    <li> Review:  I use this in the morning before applying my moisturizer and make-up.  It has a light pleasant sent and absorbs easily and quickly.  It is a great product for keeping the skin looking supple and dewy.  I am getting older and need moisture in my skin or I look more old and tired then usually.  I am a teacher and I am tired especially this time of the year with the long hours and excited kids about Christmas.  Sleep is not easy to come by with so much going on and needing to be done- so this helps keep me looking fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this item in the future.</li>
    <li> Makes me look phenomenal</li>
    <li> Pretty good serum so far. The texture is a bit thick compare to others but I really like that my face feels moist and not dry after i apply it .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum.  I have tried so many different things for the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and been so disappointed.  Not with Foxbrim though!!! It not only works but starts to work quickly and is so easy to apply without the greasy pasty feeling you get with other brands.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and can already feel the difference in my skin.  The fine lines are starting to disappear and the larger lines look smaller already. I will definitely be a buying more of this.</li>
    <li> Peptide is always great for the skin, and although this has a high potency of all the right ingredients, it also contains witch hazel, which can be very beneficial for the skin, and definitely good for more oily skin, but over time causes dryness which can cause sensitivity. I have dry skin naturally, so I only use this serum maybe every other day, but I do really recommend it. You can&#x27;t beat the price, and ingredients!</li>
    <li> FEELS GREAT AND MAKES YOUR SKIN BALANCED</li>
    <li> This serum was gentle on sensitive skin but reduced the appearance of wrinkles and cleared up slight blemishes after using for a month.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing, but not oily. You don&#x27;t need much. Great coverage. I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 weeks now. Don&#x27;t see much of a change but is a good smoother under my concealer. Smells natural. Would probably buy again with a coupon code.</li>
    <li> Great serum. Dispensed with a dropper so you can control the amount. Light scent and pleasant feel. It&#x27;s not tight or sticky when it dries so it wears really well under makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum with essential ingredients to keep the skin healthy and moisturized. It seems to absorb well on my face, and my skin looks healthy and hydrated. I&#x27;m looking forward to keeping this as part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> This serum has a thinker texture and I really enjoy that, it allows the serum to spread easier on face.</li>
    <li> Awesome product - I&#x27;ve been using for a few days and am seeing results.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my face feel, I use it after toner and before a retonal cream.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and can definitely feel and see a difference in the way my skin looks. I&#x27;m not sure if this particular one works better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried on here, the ingredients seem to be the same. But if you aren&#x27;t using some type of hyaluronic acid serum, I highly recommend giving this one a try.</li>
    <li> I applied it to my arms and they feel great</li>
    <li> I have bought this before and absolutely​ LOVE it!</li>
    <li> So i decided to give peptide complex serum a try, I am impressed so far, I&#x27;m a little new to peptide serum but I love how this makes my skin feel being that I have sensitive skin but I must say this works absolutely good,  I have a combination skin it really gets dry and flaky, this worked wonders on my skin, i only used this a 72 hours now and I can feel the difference, I can&#x27;t wait to see the long progression with this Serum I feel confident with this and hope for It to remove the dark spots on my chin, I will keep a updated.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It has a wierd gel like consistency but I put it on as a overnight serum and my skin was moisturized and my dry patches was gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it nightly since I recieved it. I can already tell a difference in the fine lines around my mouth and forehead. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I must say I have tried products that are similar but have not had a product absorb into the skin so easily and quickly. It was a nice touch esp with a serum! I noticed that my skin was much more moisturized and soft to the touch. It has a great effect on dry winter skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have said before I don&#x27;t have many needs for anti-aging products specifically at this point in my life right now, but I benefited from the moister factor and vitamins that this product contains. My skin definitely considers this food and cant get enough of the good ingredients in this serum. My glowy dewy face can stand by that!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit I really like this anti aging serum.  The gel is easy to use and feels wonderful on my skin.  I am usually very sensitive but this gel did not irritate.  Instead my complexion is clearer, lines are less noticeable and my skin has a healthy glow. This product is a good find!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been alternating using this along with Foxbrim&#x27;s hyaluronic acid and I&#x27;m really liking the combo. I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts, but this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and helps it stay moisturized. I apply it after I wash my face when my skin is a little wet; it feels like applying a thick water -- it has a thick, gel-like consistency, isn&#x27;t greasy, and absorbs quickly. Sometimes I will skip a moisturizer because my skin feels so hydrated that I don&#x27;t feel like I need another product. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 20 days and I&#x27;ve seen a slight reduction in a couple of old acne scars with the aforementioned combo, so I will definitely continue to use this. I&#x27;m really liking Foxbrim&#x27;s products and the company stands behinds its products and does not test on animals, which is important to me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for weeks.  It has a light scent, reminds me of cucumbers.  If you use too much, it does leave your skin sticky.  I can&#x27;t say that this has been a better serum than any other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly to my sensitive skin. No feeling of irritatio and the smell is not bad.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel SO plump! I love that I can mix this serum with my hyaluronic acid and that it helps give my skin a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; glow---yet still absorbs quickly! I have never tried FoxBrim products before and this was my first product (along with the hyaluronic acid) and I am completely impressed! I am interested to try more products! Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This peptide serum has been a wonderful addition to my skincare routine. I&#x27;m 33 with sensitive skin, a few hormonal breakouts from time to time and some millia (small white bumps - keratin deposits). This serum has made a difference in the overall smoothness and texture of my skin. It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized without feeling greasy. It only takes a few drops to apply. I use it after washing and applying a toner at night.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product so far. Very hydrating.</li>
    <li> This is a very good serum - my skin feels nourished and soft.  Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great, very happy with the product overall. Goes on smooth, not sticky.</li>
    <li> Great anti-aging serum!</li>
    <li> Lovely product! My skin feels smooth! No odor.  Nice dropper. I hope it works.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My skin began to glow the very first day of use.  Prior to that it had a very dull, dry look and feel.  Not only is my skin glowing, but it looks firmer and feels very soft and supple.  A Great investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well to smooth out fine wrinkles. I used it both morning and night and sometimes pat on a little around my mouth where I have the most fine wrinkles after I apply makeup and it does seem to fill them pretty well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it and will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the expensive moisturizer I was using with peptide complex.  Gets 4 stars because I still have to use a moisturizer with it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get over the texture to actually use it. It&#x27;s first ingredient is aloe vera so it has a slimy consistency. I do love that they use natural ingredients though.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel great! Eliminates wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Love this! I have been using around my eyes, and already the skin seems smoother. Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;Since this product was bought through Amazon the delivery was quick and easy. I got the product in two days as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim is always adorable with their packaging and I am always happy to see that their serums come in a dark bottle! If you do not know keeping a serum in a dark tinted bottle actually helps preserve the strength of the product and makes the product more effective for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;I know the price might seem like a lot for only 1 ounce of product but hear me out. Most other Peptide products you can find right now are twice as much as Foxbrim AND are not as concentrated. Honest to goodness only two drops of this product is all I need in my daily face routine to cover every inch of skin. Needless to say a little goes a long way with this product and I am sure I will not be running out of any for some time soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to do with Peptide serum:&lt;br /&gt;The number one thing people have been told about Peptide serums is how they help with aging but I think that is selling the product short. Yes, this product does help to shrink the appearance of wrinkles but it can also help people in the age bracket of 25-35 with a lot more than that. For one peptide serums help even out skin tone so if you are like me and get irritated red splotches once in a while in the winter months, this product can help.&lt;br /&gt;This product does one other thing that I think everyone will enjoy and that is hydrate the skin. I have been using this product on my extremely dry skin for the past two weeks and there has been a noticeable difference in how my skin looked before using this product and after. No more dry flakes appearing when I put on makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;This is the best product to get if you are truly thinking about trying a peptide serum. For the price alone Foxbrim is a deal and if you think you might not qualify because you are not worried about wrinkles yet think again. The hydrating properties of this serum alone is enough of a reason to get it and everything else it goes can be considered a bonus.ng properties of this serum alone is enough of a reason to get it and everything else it goes can be considered a bonus.</li>
    <li> I just love this serum! It makes my face feel beautiful and smooth. I also have sensitive skin and have noticed ZERO irritation. In fact, it is very soothing. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! My skin feels so soft And looks much healthier since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I will definitely be buying it again!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really satisfied with this product and will be purchasing more in the future</li>
    <li> Unlike other runny  serums on the market, this one is nice and thick, but it has a witch hazel scent which I do not like.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the effects, but so far there has been no break outs, so that&#x27;s nice.  Overall, I like it enough to keep using until I can see whether it delivers what it promises.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom she loves it</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product. I was kind of not sure since there are so many different oils and face cleaners out there so I took a chance on this one on a whim. Anyways, in the past week of using ir, I have noticed my pores have appeared smaller (this is a great thing if you don&#x27;t know) and also, my face is normally oily and this had helped with that also!! I added this to my daily regime now and will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I have used this product only once and I already love it! The serum did not irritate my face nor left me with a tingling sensation. It felt very thick and super hydrating. This is great for the cold winter months that usually leave my face feeling dry and looking dull. I did notice that it made my face appear smoother around my nose area, which is great since I have some fine lines there. I honestly cannot vouch for the long term effectiveness of this product and I do not know for sure if it can erase my fine lines completely. However, I can honestly say that this serum is great for those who want smoother and more hydrated skin and is a must during the harsh winter season. This is a good addition to any beauty regimen since it is easy to use and did not seem to react to other products that I use regularly. I will continue to use this product and will eventually post an updated review.</li>
    <li> love it great product. I will give another review soon.</li>
    <li> A great lightweight serum that not only delivers quick results, it makes your skin feel hydrated. I use this with the Ultra lift treatment. A fabulous combination. Also great alone.</li>
    <li> Perfect item, I had my mother use this item and you can definitely see the difference in her skin</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this Peptide Complex Serum.  After using twice daily for 2 weeks I am noticing my skin looks smoother and feels softer.  I will continue using this product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it! It really nourishes the skin, leaving it dewy and moist. This is now part of my morning and  evening beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I bought for my mom and she.loves it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of serum&#x27;s for my face and this one is the best by far, its light and dries quick, I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time and already have noticed a big difference. I have very sensitive skin that breaks out from most facial products and I haven&#x27;t had one blemish after using this...Im in love!!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good Peptide Serum (for sagging) so I ordered this assuming that it actually has Peptides in it.  After receiving it and reading the ingredients I don&#x27;t see any ingredients that I know to be peptides.  I will keep and use it for the other ingredients like Hyaluronic acid (for wrinkles) but will not order it again.  How can they call it a Peptide serum?  What am I missing?</li>
    <li> wonderful product, very fast absorbing. will buy again!</li>
    <li> Looooove this stuff. I will definitely be purchasing again/as I have very sensitive skin and allergic to everything, this seems to calm my skin very well</li>
    <li> I saw results almost instantly.  I used it twice a day and within n two weeks others were commenting on my complexion</li>
    <li> I can’t imagine not using a peptide serum like this before adding moisturizer to my face—at night and in the morning.  My skin tone has improved, the skin becoming a little more supple and firm.  Wrinkles around my eyes are much less noticeable.  I’ve even noticed that some spider veins on my chin are disappearing slowly.  Now, when my mineral powder makeup goes on, it looks more evenly smoothed than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also include the back of your hands for similar results.  You can use the dropper to distribute the right amount of serum you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In return for my candid assessment expressed in this review, a discounted price was given.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a serum that will moisturize your skin and helps with a little bit dark spots here and there, I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs really fast after application and leaves my skin soft and moisturized without the greasy and oily feeling. I don&#x27;t really have big issues with my skin other than some spots from my breakout recent and this is definitely helping with it. I pair it with my hitachi hada crie to make the absorption better at night.</li>
    <li> I Love this I promise you no one paid me for my post I tried this because I was looking for something that I could use for my skin which is soooo sensitive  I cannot use anything anyway with all the great comments made about this product I just had to try this product well let me tell you  what shape my face was in acne and at my age my face had me so depress and in tears because I couldn&#x27;t do anything about I have tried prescription from my doctor paying $60 for something that really didn&#x27;t work ! But when God gave me this it was heaven sent now I was beginning to see something in about a week but wasn&#x27;t truly sure but the next week my face was clearing up  looking bright and young I promise you I am not kidding anyone and again know one is paying me for this in fact today I told my husband I am going to purchase  another bottle before this one runs out trust me I am not Joking all those acne scars are just about gone I went outside today without make up yeah !  I have never used a peptide serum before but baby its my best product ever I will be looking at the rest of their products thanks so much for helping me with a product that is worth its price because it woks thank you for what you have done for me ....I am so happy people try it for yourself and yes in the beginning I did see a pimple or two but I said let me take it slow and I kept using it and  my face excepted it and I am so glad I did no more problem and its even worth a pimple or two for what it has done I look amazing !</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Rachel h.</li>
    <li> I have used this for almost 2 weeks every night. And every morning, not able to tell much of a difference  for the day, the only noticeable difference is immediately after it is applied, seems to tighten the skin like an egg white would for a lot less money</li>
    <li> My wife loves Peptide Complex Serum</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about a week now and I am already seeing and feeling the difference! My skin looks and feels tighter. It absorbs really fast and goes really well  following with a  moisturizer and makeup. Excellent product. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> WOW, just took a chance on this.  I had never heard of Foxbrim before, or this serum.  I got very lucky!!  Love, love it.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels tight, bright and glowing.  I will order more for sure. ;-))</li>
    <li> This serum is a gel type product, it&#x27;s light &amp; dry&#x27;s quickly. I have been using this serum for a week now and I&#x27;ve noticed the crows feet have lessened, my skin is softer than it&#x27;s been in a long time &amp; dark spots are much lighter. I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions what so ever. My overall experience with this product has been nice &amp; I recommend it to everyone. I look forward to combine this serum with the Vitiman C serum that should be here any day.</li>
    <li> This product feels really good on my face. Goes on really smoothly.  I havent noticed any difference in my skin yet, but I will keep posting if I notice any change in my skin.  But it does feel really good going on.</li>
    <li> This product is good. It made me break out the first week I used it, but after that I have has smooth and clear skin!</li>
    <li> All their products are good.  I have &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin and Foxbrim day, night and the serum I&#x27;m using I feel have helped.  They absorb quickly and your face feels refreshed.  Company itself is very customer-friendly which such a huge plus in today&#x27;s rush rush world.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim’s Peptimde complex serum is unique in that incudes a trio of anti-aging ingredients: Hyaluronic Acid, Peptides and Vitamin E. It offers a natural and organic formula that is thought to fight the signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power of Peptide Complex Serum is believed to be effective in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula created by Foxbrim made my face feel very soft. The Hyaluronic Acid is said to help the skin shed old dead skin cells and keeps moisture in.The Vitamin E is believed to nourish the skin by helping it look soft and youthful. I noticed a difference in about one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has no scent and it is thick. A little goes a long way. I find it works well with my other beauty products.  A beauty 10.</li>
    <li> Nothing but good things to say so far, it has only been three days but am seeing results that I like.  My facial skin was a mess which got me searching for a good product.  I stumbled onto Foxbrim via the reviews while checking out another brand.  I got the Foxbrim trio of toner; serum and moisturizer and am very happy with my choice.  It has helped with the dryness and the slight breakout that I recently experienced.  My face looks brighter, skin is softer and moisturized in such a short time.  I actually was not expecting to see anything happen before two weeks, but three days and I can write this review.</li>
    <li> Oily and not very potent. Not sure if it&#x27;s really working but the texture it leaves behind and smell are not pleasant.</li>
    <li> From the first use,  my skin felt healthier and looked better!  Love this!</li>
    <li> Foxbrim is another one of my favorite skincare companies that have some pretty fantastic products.  They recently sent me their Peptide Complex Serum to review for my blog and it has become one of my favorite products in my skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;This Peptide Complex Serum is full of skin loving ingredients like, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel and Jojoba Oil and they all help heal and repair your skin.  I have been using the serum primarily on my neck, decollete and shoulder area since I was testing out a few other products on my face and have had some great results.  I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles...yet... but I do have those annoying neck lines that most people have and it seems like those have actually faded a little bit, plus the skin in my decollete area looks more toned as well!  The serum is lightweight and absorbs really quickly and is great for all skin types.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin looks great and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Have noticed texture improvement in my skin since using this product.  Very good for aging skin.  Use prior to applying moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Peptides are all the talk.  I use this after cleansing and toning, followed by the Peptide Moisturizer each morning.  Love the product line.  Offer everything you need for great skin care.</li>
    <li> Decent serum that applies evenly without flaking and or a greasy feel. I have seen some benefits with skin but am not really excited about it, yet.I have been using it for about two weeks.</li>
    <li> I guess I should start out by saying that I was worried about this product and its consistency, because I have terrible acne and am generally pretty oily. When I first opened the bottle and saw the consistency I became even more worried. BUT I WAS WRONG! I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over 2 weeks now and WOW! Not only does it do what it claims to do, but I feel that it gives my skin a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish which is something that doesn&#x27;t happen for me. Even when I use powdered make up that claims to give you a matte finish, after about an hour or so I am oily and shiny again. Not with this product. And that wasn&#x27;t even one of their claims. Huge bonus! My acne cleared up dramatically. No sign in wrinkle reduction yet, but I&#x27;m sure that takes more than 2 weeks. One thing I did notice is that the appearance of my acne scars has gone down. I can still see them, but they are virtually invisible now under makeup, whereas before... there was nothing I could do to cover them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip... I found it best to use a toner right before. And after applying the product, waiting about 10 minutes before you start applying your make-up to get the matte-primer effect I was talking about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMbc200820df75222315ebbb1b160dd803&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&amp;lt;/a&gt;</li>
    <li> This serum is loaded with ingredients that are awesome for your skin. I&#x27;m at the age where I&#x27;m trying to prevent and fight off those wrinkles because basically they can grace me with their appearance at anytime. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s. I love anything with peptides in it. Peptides are great for increasing collagen and fighting off those wrinkles. Peptides are vital in anti-aging products. I love the consistency of this serum. It&#x27;s thick and not runny like most serums. It feels good on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized and not sticky like other serums can leave your skin. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the continued benefits of using this serum.</li>
    <li> Awesome product love it will buy again</li>
    <li> I just started using the serum so I was post an updated review with prolonged use but so far, great! I have used high dollar serums that left my skin feeling like there was a film or sticky feeling after, but not with Peptide! In a week&#x27;s time I noticed the redness in my skin was visibly less noticeable. It shows promising results!</li>
    <li> I just start use it. quite nice and  seem works</li>
    <li> Yay.... Smooth as a baby..</li>
    <li> Peptide complex serum is super absorbent and leaves skin feeling fresh and hydrated. My skin needed some extra nourishment and this serum has been excellent.</li>
    <li> Even after the first application, I can feel it working. Looking forward to long term results</li>
    <li> Gave my skin a nice glow!</li>
    <li> &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP35aca550e715f75fbf7da224d5c0ee6d\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  ***I was given this product to review but I only provide a 100% honest opinion of the product.    In my quest to amp up my skincare routine, I have come across a new face serum. In the recent past, I only used face wash, toner, and moisturizer and I rarely used all three morning and night. I am trying to get better and have starting introducing serums into my routine and have been using Foxbrim&#x27;s peptide complex serum for a month.    This product comes packaged in a glass bottle with a rubber dropper applicator. It has a thick clear gel-like consistency. I think this product is fragrance-free but the barely there scent reminds me of a cross between baby wipes and expired foundation. I kind of like my products to have some kind of fragrance to it. I think it makes the application experience a little more enjoyable. But I know a lot of people are sensitive to fragrance so this should be good for you.    The Peptide Complex Serum absorbs very quickly and makes skin soft without feeling greasy. This formula seems to work well for my combination skin but does not seem moisturizing enough for dry skin types by itself. (A lot of nights, I use this product without putting moisturizer on top and it&#x27;s fine enough for me). I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts with this product and I never wake up with red or puffy skin. I will use this for it&#x27;s anti aging effects (which, as a 22 year old, I won&#x27;t see results from anytime soon) but I&#x27;ll still be looking for something that can help diminish my dark spots and brighten my skin.  &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM35aca550e715f75fbf7da224d5c0ee6d\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</li>
    <li> Great product! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Product goes on sticky but once you apply moisturizer on top as suggested that stickiness goes away. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> On my 2 day and already loving it. Skin feels good after putting it on my face. It kinda make my skin smooth/smaller pores? I don&#x27;t know, too early to tell. But it seems working already. I might be getting it again. Gaah! These skin products are draining my wallet! :D</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle and I am pleased with the results.  It feels good one your face and makes your skin soft.  I like Foxbrim products and have been pleased with each one I have purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal!! I&#x27;ve tried some very expensive products to even out the coloring of my face &amp; none have worked nearly as well as this. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this to use in conjunction with the micro needling tool I just received. I read the previous reviews on this peptide complex and it seemed to have a very good rating. I also like that this product is organic and manufactured in the USA.  I have skin that has seen too much sun and I am now starting to pay the price. I have discoloration, acne scars and fine to medium wrinkles. I used this product today as a pretreatment before I tried my micro needling tool. The serum is fairly thick bodied and went on very easy with no overwhelming order. My face felt very silky after the treatment. I love the combination of ingredients and I am hoping with continued use to have better looking skin. It does work very well at keeping my skin hydrated.  ****Update*** July 2016.  I have been using this consistently  for months now. It is one of the very few items I have tried that does not irritate my skin.  My skin has a different texture  now and I can see positive results. I also started using their eye cream and face wash. LOVE their products!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this serum . Felt smith on my face,no fowl odor.  Going to make it past of my routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I really like it. You can feel it tightening your skin! You definitely need to follow with a moisturizer-as the product recommends. The smell is not great, but not awful either. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Firms chin and around eyes.</li>
    <li> When I first put this on I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to feel like it was tightening my face. It felt fabulous! It also made my face feeling smoother. I used the Vitamin C lotion over top this and have had smooth skin that feels fresh and not weighed down since!</li>
    <li> love the serum.  you will feel &amp; see the difference</li>
    <li> Honestly don&#x27;t know if I have noticed a difference</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks now and I am very happy with the results I am getting.  I noticed a difference in my skin within just a few days.  It looks and feels more hydrated.  The serum goes on easily - it does not drip all over since it is thicker and it absorbs quickly.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for that next step in their facial routine.</li>
    <li> It is honestly, the best serum I have tried in a very long time! It goes on really easy, it doesn&#x27;t leave any icky feelings and i absolutely LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Never used a product like this before. It feels good on the face and soaks in nicely. I feel like my face is clearer and brighter.</li>
    <li> Week two and let me tell you, this serum is amazing! I had red dry spots on my face and they are 75% gone. I wish I would&#x27;ve taken pictures.</li>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s working very well so far. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after I use it for a while.</li>
    <li> I really like how soft this serum makes my face feel and I did notice that it does plump up the skin ,however I have only been using it for a few days and it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will have an affect on my fine lines. I like that when I apply it before I go to bed, I wake up with soft,smooth glowing skin. So far so good,but I will be updating my review after a month of use or so. I do recommend it though and shipping was fast and packaging was wonderful.</li>
    <li> Smoth and soft skin!  smell ok! Like it!</li>
    <li> have not really used it long enough to comment, but anything i can do to to combat aging of my face is worth trying!!</li>
    <li> I got it not long ago and It seem work pretty good but I gotta wait and see how it is goes in few weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other Foxbrim serums recently and really liked the quality. They ended up reaching out to me about sending a sample of their Peptide Complex Serum for review which was perfect timing because this was one serum I hadn&#x27;t tried yet. This year I&#x27;m on a collagen and skin rebuilding kick and have been testing any and everything touted for skin regeneration. One I kept coming across over and over again was Peptides/amino acids and their ability to stimulate collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim&#x27;s Peptide Complex Serum is thick, clear and instantly melts into the skin much the same way their other serums do. While it&#x27;s not something that can take the place of a moisturizer, I do find this can be moisturizing enough for under the eyes and it&#x27;s never caused any milia or clogged pores. This has actually been fantastic on oily skin. Now what&#x27;s the difference between this and other Hylauronic Acid &amp;/or Vitamin C serums? Looking at the ingredients labels, most natural serums are very similar to one another including, thankfully, being aloe vera gel based as opposed to Dimethicone. Also many Hylauronic Acid serums contain Peptides and this Peptide Complex Serum actually contains Hylauronic Acid. What Foxbrim&#x27;s Peptide Complex Serum does not include is Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually relatively easy to overload your skin with acids or if it&#x27;s just really sensitive this Peptide serum has been great for giving my skin a rest. I like using it under my eyes to hopefully help with skin thickness and moisture at night. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s especially soothing when chilled in the fridge.</li>
    <li> As with any skin product, you can&#x27;t expect results overnight. However, after using a product for awhile and understanding the science behind what is happening to your skin, from sun damage, aging and just downright abuse, we can help ourselves. With the use of a quality skin products like this Peptide Complex Serum by Foxbrim, we can start the process in reversing time, only up to a point, of course. Peptides applied to our skin, can promote the formation of new collagen, thus giving us a more youthful looking skin. This serum has a great feel and absorbs readily for use under makeup, with no greasy or oiling residue.</li>
    <li> I have only been using a short time but I am seeing results and I like this product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it! We&#x27;ve been using this anti aging serum to smooth lines. It is fragrance free and goes on nice and smooth. It dries nicely with no tackiness and no leftover residue. I am so excited to see how this changes the appearance of my fine lines. I really like how it is made from organic components. I also like that this contains jojoba oil!</li>
    <li> Good product~ So far it makes my face feel hydrated. Keep using and wait to see if it can eliminate my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this serum makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have mild melasma (skin discoloration) on my face. This appears to be helping with lightening it over time! :)</li>
    <li> This product is great as a moisturizer and I love that it has an anti-aging component. After just two days of using I can already see a difference in my skin. It has a neutral smell and is applied easily and smoothly!</li>
    <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
    <li> Love this! My skin is softer, hydrated.</li>
    <li> So far I like this serum, but it is too soon to see any ani-aging effects.  It is nice and light to apply.</li>
    <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review.&lt;br /&gt;Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been experimenting with different facial serums lately. Recently I received a 1oz bottle of Foxbrim’s Peptide Complex Serum to review.  Foxbrim’s Peptide Complex Serum works to effectively create a healthy environment for beautiful skin. Working from the inside out, Peptides signal the body for additional collagen production. Moisturizing agents Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Vitamin E effectively hydrate while maintaining healthy skin balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Serum has a consistency of Aloe, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into the skin. It smells faintly of Witch Hazel and it is not overwhelmingly strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim’s states their products are crafted with the most sensitive of skin types in mind. They use natural moisturizing agents so their serums provide results without the worry of drying or irritation. Perfect for dry and under-nourished skin. For that healthy, natural glow. Their products are crafted in the USA in an FDA certified facility utilizing only premium ingredients in their natural and organic products. NO additives, silicones or parabens. Not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly as directed.  Highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> This serum really does the trick!</li>
    <li> I have grown up with familiar names like Loreal, all of which are readily available at my grocery store or convienance store. Initially unrelated, I have been through a 2 year ordeal with my adult dog with very special diet needs. What I have learned after these years of trial and error, and reading ingredient lists and research is this: Natural and organic remedies with simple and quality ingredients work the best- as they should. I have found that the products that follow this approach are not as easily available- much like facial care products. I have been let down by the familiar name brands in several areas, so I was thrilled to get to try out Foxbrim&#x27;s Complex Serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The list of ingredients is impressive, the packaging as well. The glass bottle with glass &#x27;dropper&#x27; applicator confused me upon first opening, but now makes perfect sense. Glass is much better than plastic- especially at containing natural and organic ingredients, which this product clearly does. The dropper helps with the amount of serum distributed- no more wasted product because of a defective pump!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the aloe gel texture of this product. It is refreshing to apply, and absorbs well into my skin. While I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough at this point to say if I am anti-aging, my skin feels better, and has not broken out (which it has a tendancy to do with the &#x27;other&#x27; serums). It seems like this bottle will last for at least a couple of months too, which also makes me happy.</li>
    <li> I like the Foxbrim Peptide Complex Serum because it makes my skin tighten up. I&#x27;ll keep to use.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice serum.  It is not heavy and absorbs quickly.  Does not leave a film on your skin.  I have used it for several day and am already seeing an improvement in texture and fine lines.  I am looking forward to seeing how it works over a longer period of time.  I have also ordered their Vitamin C.  Nice to find a great product.  It is also very effective for cold weather.</li>
    <li> This peptide serum has really helped soothe and repair my skin. The harsh winter had taken a toll on my skin and this serum has added back some bounce and clarity to it. I recommend anyone to try it, you can return it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, but I think it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, it&#x27;s only been about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m already seeing and feeling a big change. It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.  I would purchase again and continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and I really enjoy the way this serum makes my skin look and feel. It gives me a nice glow and I can see the fine lines diminishing. My skin feels so soft and my fine lines are diminished. I really like using it and will definitely purchase more when this bottle runs out!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I feel my complexion is much smoother.  I wished I would have taken a before and after picture.</li>
    <li> I can feel a softer touch to my softer face already!</li>
    <li> Another awesome product from the Foxbrim family!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum! I also purchased the ultra lift cream, which I love as well. You have gained a new customer and fan. After 4 weeks of use my skin looks firmer and the very fine lines have almost been completely erased. I am 50 and do have crows feet, which I know once there they will never go away. With that said the combination of the 2 products has slightly soften the appearance of them.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad to have found your products!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works Great!</li>
    <li> Giving this as a gift. Hope she likes it!</li>
    <li> Probably a good product but did not work well for me.  Unbelievably good customer service.</li>
    <li> Skin feels soft and skin looks healthier.  So far I have loved every Foxbrim product I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Super excited to try this product! I have heard great things about this brand!</li>
    <li> Omgosh I just received this yesterday and I have already used it twice. I love it.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it makes me skin feel and look.  My husband even noticed&lt;br /&gt;a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this but was not able to use it, I did not realize it had Jojoba Oil in it which I am allergic to. However instead of returning it I passed it along to a friend and she said it worked really good on her fine lines around her eyes.</li>
    <li> Item was received very quickly. I am very happy with the product and will purchase again. My skin definitely feels firm after using the serum. The seller sent a personal email after I ordered which I found very professional and nice. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with This Peptide Complex Serum.  It goes on easy and feels very nice on my face.  My skin is moist now!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good serum. It makes my skin feels softer.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum it aborbs fast and It doesnt seem to bother my sensitive skin. I got this item from a free promotion and I am under no obligation to leave a review in return. I felt its a nice product and been looking for something for my skin without all the added ingredients that I cant pronounce. I love this product. Definitely going to buy another bottle when I get low</li>
    <li> I love that the ingredients are mostly organic. My skin looks and feels great after using this product too.</li>
    <li> I truly see a difference already after a week of use</li>
    <li> love it great product</li>
    <li> received for review, And so far im loving the feeling you get after using this!</li>
    <li> I am super pleased with this product. I just started using it a couple of days ago and I already notice a difference of how soft and smooth and youthful my skin feels and looks. My mother wants me to pick her up a bottle too! I would highly recommend giving this a try if you are looking for a good product to make your skin appear fresher and younger and overall more vibrant.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feels tighter in two weeks of use. I use it all over my face every night before going to bed. I would wake up with smoother skin. I would repurchase after I finish my first bottle</li>
    <li> Great anti aging formula.</li>
    <li> Awesome! This product is Amazon for the skin. As an esthetician, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> still using it,,I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference at this time.</li>
    <li> Love this! Already seeing results in 1 week! Will definitely purchase more ;)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and I can notice the difference already. It makes my skin smooth hydrates my skin, it looks really healthy as well. Everyone in my family asked me if I was using something for my skin, and wanted to get this product. It is amazing how it makes my face feels fresh and so clean. I would highly recommend this product to anyone I know, and would buy from this company again. Hope this review helps. Hope this review helps someone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a bout 2 weeks now and it has been ok. It hasn&#x27;t broken out my face as I&#x27;m allergic to just about everything. My face is a little tighter and My skin tone is a little less red. I hadn&#x27;t noticed anything with a few wrinkles. I&#x27;m going to give it more time. All in all the product has been working but needs more time I think</li>
    <li> I like this one. It makes my skin feel smooth and I have no reaction to it. I am not sure if it really makes me look any younger or not but I think I do so that is all that matters to me. I am older with kids and grandkids and do not need to impress anyone but after using this for a couple of weeks I felt and thought I looked better so I will continue to use it. I decided to try this brand because i got a promotional code that made it really cheap and I am happy so I will continue</li>
    <li> The Peptide Serum goes on smoothly, dries quickly and my skin feels softer ☺</li>
    <li> The peptide complex serum has exceeded my expectations. I have been using it for several weeks and I am more than pleased. I use it with Vit C and also Vit E and the combination has worked wonders on my over 65 yr old skin. It is plumper, less noticeable wrinkles, and feels soft. I will definitely be reordering this product. The seller is incredibly customer conscious and is great with emails and also with super fast handling and shipping. I couldn&#x27;t be happier or more grateful. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and only wish the bottle were bigger. I love this stuff. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Seeing quick results</li>
    <li> I go this free from Tomoson.com for testing purposes and I honestly think this is amazing. It makes my skin so smooth and makes me glow. It is something everyone should try..</li>
    <li> Good sized bottle. Serum is a bit thicker than I expected;  But it only takes 2 or 3 drops for my entire face, neck and chest. Soaks in within minutes. Too soon to see results, but so far I like it a lot and am interested in purchasing more of their products. My face is soft- that&#x27;s the only result I&#x27;ve seen yet.</li>
    <li> I use Peptide Complex Serum after using a toner and I am finding it adds great success to my facial regimen.  My skin feels tighter and wrinkles slowly diminishing and looking better. I have used other serums and they are like water and do not smell as fragrant as Peptide Complex Serum.  A great product. A highly recommended product for your facial routine. It feels thick but not heavy on my face. Light and airy without a residue. A must try</li>
    <li> Having only used this for one week, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change yet but I figure it&#x27;s to soon to tell anyway. However I do like the they way it goes on. A few drops does my whole face and neck and it feels so nice on my skin. I live in FL where it gets humid and a lot of times moisturizing creams feel heavy on my face. This does not have that effect. It&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re not wearing anything. I can&#x27;t wait to see what else this wonderful serum does the longer I use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using daily and can already see results looking forward to seeing more.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer, plumps up those fine lines and makes your skin feel tight!</li>
    <li> Awesome Awesome product!! Must try!! Love the way it makes my skin feel tight yet smooth!!</li>
    <li> Nice texture to it. Unsure it it&#x27;s working. We&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> This is a great serum. I definitely feel and see a difference in my skin--it&#x27;s plumper and firmer. My husband has commented twice in the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is noticeable improvement in the area under my eyes. Like others in their 60s, that tissue has thinned. It has, without a doubt, improved and feels thicker. This serum does not irritate my eyes. I realize it isn&#x27;t sold to target the eye area but...it&#x27;s working extremely well for me. I definitely do not pat it close to the rims of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past week I also have been putting it on the backs of my hands at night and already see some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount of serum goes a long way. After cleansing my skin, I apply the peptide serum. It dries in under a minute and leaves my skin feeling smooth. (The first time I applied it, I used too much and my skin felt tacky.) I then layer on my usual moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this serum to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for couple weeks now. I love it! It seems to be working. I love how my skin feels and looks after using this product.</li>
    <li> After one week i have notice a difference in my skin.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using a very expensive serum from YSL for years and can not afford to purchase it right now.  When I tried this product I was actually amazed that my skin feels and looks as good if not better than it did with the other product.  I will continue to use this product for years to come!! It makes my skin feel moist and refreshed and penetrates quickly so I can apply my makeup in just a few seconds. This is a product I would definitely recommend to my friends.  The value for the money is amazing and I have only been using this product a week, I can not tell that I switched from the expensive brand serum.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. Absorb fast. I would like to request the serum to be in airless bottle because the serum is really thick and a lots of serum sticks to the bottle in the end and cannot get to it so waste a lots of product.</li>
    <li> Just received this serum and love it! I use it every night and it leave my skin so soft and evens out my skin tone. Love this!</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my skin so soft and smooth! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this serum via Giveaway Service. I have used this serum daily for 2 weeks and I absolutely love it. When I apply it to my skin, it sinks in and leaves no residue. I am able to apply the other products I use easily, after allowing the Peptide Serum to dry. Peptides are so very important to ageing skin. I will buy this serum again.</li>
    <li> This has a gel like consistency and it has a slight fragrance. It feels nice and refreshing when you put it on.  And leaves my skin feeling soft. It&#x27;s not greasy and dries on your face almost instantly.</li>
    <li> Love this makes my skin feel great. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> two weeks using this serum,I did not experience any skin irritation. love it</li>
    <li> Not seeing any real results...skin feels softer but that&#x27;s about it,Also the bottle was only about half full,not sure if that&#x27;s the norm...would not buy again</li>
</ol>
