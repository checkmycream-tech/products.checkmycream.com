      <li>I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This creates the perfect ringlets every time in my very straight hair.</li>
      <li>an amazing one for the beginners or professionals.</li>
      <li>It will take her some practice to work it right, but when I helped her, the curls looked great.</li>
      <li>It would work even better if i was ambidextrous...</li>
      <li>Also the top of the iron does not have a finished surface.</li>
      <li>Stray pieces of hair get stuck at the top and when you unroll the iron it pull out those stray hairs.</li>
      <li>I love this curler..</li>
      <li>This curling iron is OK.</li>
      <li>Tje product was just what it said it was,but the curls don&#x27;t start at the top of my head like I would have wanted them to.</li>
      <li>If you have several hours to work on your hair to get those perfect pin curls, then this works.</li>
      <li>Stunning spirals.</li>
      <li>Love this tool &amp; I</li>
      <li>so im glad to have found it here on amazon.</li>
      <li>Great spiral curling iron, reasonably priced, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so I was so excited!</li>
      <li>My hair seems to slip out too easily.</li>
      <li>My hair is wavy and relatively easy to curl (they just don&#x27;t stay) even</li>
      <li>She loved it so much and was so bummed when she lost it, but luckily we were able to find another.</li>
      <li>Its a lovely gift for that &#x27;glamorous look&#x27; on a special evening with ur husband,family or friends..</li>
      <li>Easy to use and came quickly in the mail :)</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>It is just right for spiral curls and with the heat adjustments my very fine hair is protected.  </li>
      <li>We are both huge fans of it.  </li>
      <li>Just used this iron on my daughters hair for the first time and love it.</li>
      <li>The other one even curled (and kept curled) the hair of my best friend with pin straight hair.</li>
      <li>My hair stayed really nice and cute all day, the only things i would suggest is hold your hair on for a while if it is like mine, be sure to follow up w/ hairspray, and I get best curling results on second day hair (i wash my hair every other day-</li>
      <li>I really love how it gives me the spiral look I want, It does really well with what I want</li>
      <li>I got this as a Christmas present from my husband, and I LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>Surprised how quickly I received it:)</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I used a curler for the first time,all by myself</li>
      <li>and it was very easy, gave fantastic results on my thick n straight hair.</li>
      <li>The curler really does create beautiful waves/curls, not too stiff like a regular curling iron.</li>
      <li>had it not broken or if I could find another.</li>
      <li>Heats up fast, curls my hair</li>
      <li>past my shoulders, and doesnt hold curl on its own very well.</li>
      <li>highly rec.</li>
      <li>This Revlon curling iron does not get near as hot as the Conair and does not achieve near the curls as the Conair as the result.</li>
      <li>I had this exact same curling iron before and didn&#x27;t have this problem...</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one, buy Conair Spiral curling iron instead! :)</li>
      <li>Seriously invest in a good flat iron.</li>
      <li>i think it is, the little light that lets you know when it reaches that point that of heat mine never stops.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 12 year old.</li>
      <li>I have stick straight hair and this gives me curls all day long!!</li>

<li> Was a little surprised at the price of the earrings!  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t stay long.</li>
<li> The clamp on the end of the curling iron is loose and won&#x27;t hold my hair in.  </li>
<li> Lastly, forget the little stand that is comes with.</li>
<li> This item came with absolutely no instructions.  </li>
<li> Then I would notice it would cool down while I was using it and realized it was actually cutting off on its on while I was using it.  </li>
<li> but if you have very little time and already have thick hair then you will have to take several passes at the same bunch of hair to get them to stay.</li>
<li> I like the shape of this iron, but my only complaint is that the clasp to hold the hair in place is a little loose.  </li>
<li> a little frustrating but its no big deal</li>
<li> Also it is not easy to wrap it around the spirals.</li>
<li> First off the little holder does hold our hair especially if it is thin</li>
<li> The curls look close to antural, and they seriously have bounce/spring to each curl.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s not too dry.)My hair is thin, about 2 in.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s way too difficult to get the hair wrapped around it,well maybe if one had thick hair it would work well.</li>
<li> SORRY I JUST DON&#x27;T LIKE IT</li>
<li> &quot; this product was difficult for me to work with.</li>
<li> It is difficult to use, the curl ends up all on the tip of your hair.  </li>
<li> This curling iron is difficult to use, makes crappy curls and the ones you get out of it</li>
<li> This product is so useless!</li>
<li> This is the worst purchase I have ever made.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Curing iron works great. Heats up fast, curls my hair and that&#x27;s about all I&#x27;m looking for in a spiral curling iron!!!</li>
    <li> This iron is junk. There is a heat knob that turns to adjust the heat setting but the wiring inside of the iron keeps getting caught on the knob making it almost imposible to turn. The wiring issue is also a possible shock hazzard.</li>
    <li> If you have several hours to work on your hair to get those perfect pin curls, then this works. but if you have very little time and already have thick hair then you will have to take several passes at the same bunch of hair to get them to stay. It would work even better if i was ambidextrous...</li>
    <li> perfect!  I have stick straight hair and this gives me curls all day long!!</li>
    <li> um.. well the only thing i can complain about this spiral iron would be that when i put it on its highest setting 30 i think it is, the little light that lets you know when it reaches that point that of heat mine never stops. a little frustrating but its no big deal</li>
    <li> This curling iron gave me a problem from the start.  The cord would tangle up while I was trying to use it. Then I would notice it would cool down while I was using it and realized it was actually cutting off on its on while I was using it.  Finally, after having it for 2 months and not using it every day either, it has stopped working all together.  It comes on, but will not heat up.  Seemed to be defective from the beginning.</li>
    <li> This product is so useless! The spiral cord is stuck to the rod and does not help hold the hair to be curled.  I would not advice anyone to buy this. I returned it immediately!</li>
    <li> This item came with absolutely no instructions.  If you are not a \\&quot;hair person\\&quot; this product was difficult for me to work with.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old. It will take her some practice to work it right, but when I helped her, the curls looked great. I like that it has a lot of heat settings and instructions for what type of hair uses what heat settings.</li>
    <li> So I was recommended to try this in order to get the Taylor Swift curls and I thought for the price why not try it. Well let me save you a Jackson ($20)....do not get this. First off the little holder does hold our hair especially if it is thin or you have layered hair. Also it is not easy to wrap it around the spirals. It says it is easier to follow and it is not. Also the top of the iron does not have a finished surface. Stray pieces of hair get stuck at the top and when you unroll the iron it pull out those stray hairs. Also it does not curl it well. Lastly, forget the little stand that is comes with. It falls over. This could cause a fire hazard! Seriously invest in a good flat iron. You can curl and straighten your hair.</li>
    <li> I like the shape of this iron, but my only complaint is that the clasp to hold the hair in place is a little loose.  My hair seems to slip out too easily.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it, works wonders for my hair and i definetly recommend it! Easy to use and came quickly in the mail :)</li>
    <li> Great spiral curling iron, reasonably priced, easy to use.  This curling iron has lots of features.  I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I purchased this one when my Conair spiral curling iron broke after 4 years. This Revlon curling iron does not get near as hot as the Conair and does not achieve near the curls as the Conair as the result. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one, buy Conair Spiral curling iron instead! :)</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find this item since borrowing one from a friend, but could not locate it.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  It is just right for spiral curls and with the heat adjustments my very fine hair is protected.  It is a great curling iron!</li>
    <li> This heat tool is awesome. I purchased one about 6yrs ago and held it dear to me. Then a cousin came from overseas and saw the beauty of the curl that it made and packed it away in her suitcase without me knowing. I haven&#x27;t seen it in stores anywhere so im glad to have found it here on amazon. The curler really does create beautiful waves/curls, not too stiff like a regular curling iron. The curl kinda resembles a \\&quot;digital perm\\&quot; look... Love this tool &amp; I highly rec. to everyone!</li>
    <li> Tje product was just what it said it was,but the curls don&#x27;t start at the top of my head like I would have wanted them to.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s way too difficult to get the hair wrapped around it,well maybe if one had thick hair it would work well. I have fine hair but wavy,it also got tangled a lot.</li>
    <li> The clamp on the end of the curling iron is loose and won&#x27;t hold my hair in.  I had this exact same curling iron before and didn&#x27;t have this problem...</li>
    <li> I had Revlon&#x27;s Perfect Heat Ceramic Spiral Iron RV067C for 3 years and it broke. THAT was the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned and I would have never used anything else had it not broken or if I could find another. I bought this thinking it would be similar just updated. It&#x27;s not.    This curling iron is difficult to use, makes crappy curls and the ones you get out of it don&#x27;t stay long. It&#x27;s just not any good. The other one even curled (and kept curled) the hair of my best friend with pin straight hair. My hair is wavy and relatively easy to curl (they just don&#x27;t stay) even and this iron won&#x27;t curl it.</li>
    <li> I really love how it gives me the spiral look I want, It does really well with what I want</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas present from my husband, and I LOVE it!  My curls are gorgeous.  And I even did my sister&#x27;s hair with it and she bought one for herself after the awesome results. We are both huge fans of it.  The curls look close to antural, and they seriously have bounce/spring to each curl.  Stunning spirals.</li>
    <li> This creates the perfect ringlets every time in my very straight hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter had this one and when she lost it couldn&#x27;t find another anywhere. She loved it so much and was so bummed when she lost it, but luckily we were able to find another.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the reviews on this product before purchase.  This is the worst purchase I have ever made.  It does nothing!  It is difficult to use, the curl ends up all on the tip of your hair.  Spare yourself and your money do not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is OK. It only curls one way, but that is how every spiral iron is-the \\&quot;spiral&#x27;s\\&quot; design only goes one way. My hair stayed really nice and cute all day, the only things i would suggest is hold your hair on for a while if it is like mine, be sure to follow up w/ hairspray, and I get best curling results on second day hair (i wash my hair every other day-it&#x27;s not too dry.)My hair is thin, about 2 in. past my shoulders, and doesnt hold curl on its own very well.</li>
    <li> Just used this iron on my daughters hair for the first time and love it. I got it at Ross for 10 bucks. It gave my daughter beautiful spiraly curls.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery! I love this curling iron!!! I would order from them again. I had a curling iron like this for years but it got stepped on recently and broke...Found the same brand on here so I was so excited! Surprised how quickly I received it:)</li>
    <li> I love this curler..an amazing one for the beginners or professionals. I used a curler for the first time,all by myself and it was very easy, gave fantastic results on my thick n straight hair. Its a lovely gift for that &#x27;glamorous look&#x27; on a special evening with ur husband,family or friends..Go for it if u want to get a head-turning look !!</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IN THIS CURLING IRON NOT AT ALL......SORRY I JUST DON&#x27;T LIKE IT AT ALL.....</li>
    <li> The only curling Iron that puts curls in my daughters hair that lasts for a day. She has tried multiple curling irons (more expensive) and none of them have worked as well as this Revlon curling Iron iron.</li>
    <li> I loved all the items.  Was a little surprised at the price of the earrings!  Very cheap price but very good quality.</li>
