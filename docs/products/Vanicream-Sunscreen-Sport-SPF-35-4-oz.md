      <li>My son has very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Because it is so thick it doesn&#x27;t necessarily last as long as some of the thinner lotions, but it works great at keeping the sun off of her.</li>
      <li>For those of you who are sensitive to sunscreens you might try this one.  </li>
      <li>It works well for me,  since I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I think this is the only kind we will buy from now on even though it is more expensive than other kinds.</li>

<li> Every other sunscreen cause my son to get a red itchy rash on his body.</li>
<li> It is the only sunscreen that does not give him little red, itchy bumps.</li>

<li> Does not break his skin out like almost ALL other sunscreens.  </li>
<li> I purchased this sunscreen for my daughter, as an alternative to the typical drug store types that contain endocrine disruptors (Vanicream was recommended by a biochemist colleague who also has a daughter and who indicated it did not).  </li>
<li> Slightly greasy, but is durable in water.  </li>
<li> My little one has eczema and the dermatologist recommended this cream.  </li>
<li> I work in the water in Hawaii everyday...</li>
<li> One of the few sunscreens that I can use.  </li>
<li> Only complaint is that it goes on real thick, but that is typical with Zinc-based sunscreens.  </li>
<li> One of the very few sunscreens my son can use!  </li>
<li> I was disappointed to see that Vanicream does contain 2.8% Octinoxate, which is a known endocrine disruptor (perhaps they changed their formula).  </li>

    <li> My little one has eczema and the dermatologist recommended this cream.  It is nice and thick.  Because it is so thick it doesn&#x27;t necessarily last as long as some of the thinner lotions, but it works great at keeping the sun off of her.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Satisfied.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen for my daughter, as an alternative to the typical drug store types that contain endocrine disruptors (Vanicream was recommended by a biochemist colleague who also has a daughter and who indicated it did not).  Many of the zinc oxide based sunscreens leave out the estrogenic mimics.  I was disappointed to see that Vanicream does contain 2.8% Octinoxate, which is a known endocrine disruptor (perhaps they changed their formula).  For detailed information see&lt;br /&gt;http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/octinoxate/&lt;br /&gt;Note in the product description they state Oxybenzone Free.  I should have been more attentive to see that it contains Octinoxate instead.  I will not purchase this product again. I now buy Blue Lizard.</li>
    <li> My son has very sensitive skin. We have been using Vanicream Sport sunscreen for years. It is the only sunscreen that does not give him little red, itchy bumps. Even water babies sunscreen made him break out. We&#x27;ve even tried other &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; sunscreens and those same red bumps pop up. This sunscreen rocks and is all he can use.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is fabulous! My son suffers from severe eczema--even on his face--and this sunscreen did the job perfectly. I could use it on him everywhere including his eyelids and it did not sting. (Most other sunscreens sting and irritate his skin and leave him in tears.) But VANICREAM is a very soothing formulation and it 100% protected him from the sun&#x27;s harsh rays on a Florida beach vacation. Huge thumbs up!</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen for kids with allergies. Can be a little difficult to put on, a little thick, but have used it for years and the protection is awesome.</li>
    <li> One of the very few sunscreens my son can use!  Does not break his skin out like almost ALL other sunscreens.  Goes on white, but after rubbing it in, it&#x27;s almost unnoticeable.</li>
    <li> Slightly greasy, but is durable in water.  The best sunscreen for highly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for people with super sensitive skin. I am allergic to almost every sunscreen on the market...this is the only one I have found that I can actually use. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> great product recommended by dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Every other sunscreen cause my son to get a red itchy rash on his body. I researched what we could do and found this sunscreen and I love it! No problems with his skin. I can put it over eyelids and it never makes eyes sting or burn. I didn&#x27;t find it any harder to rub in than the Aveeno baby sunscreen we had before. I think this is the only kind we will buy from now on even though it is more expensive than other kinds. After having a potential skin cancer scare I am very diligent about sunscreen and this stuff works better than any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Just started using, no verdict yet but it was highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for sensitive skin. Quick shipping. Great seller. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Have used product with the recommendation of my Dermotoligist.</li>
    <li> This the ONLY sun protection project that doesn&#x27;t sting my face and neck, even those advertised as &amp;#34;non-stinging&amp;#34;. HIGHLY recommended, especially for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used and I have experimented with quite a few.&lt;br /&gt;First - it works just like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Second - it does not feel greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Third - it does not smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;Happy camper.</li>
    <li> I work in the water in Hawaii everyday...this is one of the best sunscreens I have ever used.  I reapply when I get out of the water everytime and have great results!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years!! Great deal, fast service too. Thanks</li>
    <li> It works well for me,  since I have sensitive skin.  It also provides a lot of protection from the sun.  It stays on when i play tennis and sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> My ten year old son has a sunscreen allergy (specifically to oxibenzone).  Our dermatologist suggested this sunscreen. It&#x27;s great! The only down side is that it&#x27;s quite thick, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin tinted white.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen since I&#x27;m allergic to many others. Vanicream works well for me while I&#x27;m out exercising and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> We have used this sunscreen, which is highly rated and safe according to many informational websites, for our kids for many years.  It performs well in the long sunny days.  Only complaint is that it goes on real thick, but that is typical with Zinc-based sunscreens.  You have to balance that factor with the safety of the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. It is a little thick, but it distributes easily across the skin. It keeps your skin moist all day. I don&#x27;t even take it off at night. NEVER breaks me out and I am break out prone. This product is also one of the top suncreens endorsed by the environmental working group as safe and effective.</li>
    <li> Repeat customer &amp; very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen we use on our faces! It doesn&#x27;t run into our eyes and holds up well with water sports. Even the redheaded members of the family can use it on their super sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> good stuff. Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I like the cream itself, but I&#x27;m allergic to the chemical in this sunscreen, octinoxate. Caused a red rash on my face just like other chemical sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this sunscreen!  My daughter has eczema and this is the only sunscreen we&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t cause a flare-up.  She is also a red-head and she has never burned with this sunscreen.  I also use it on my own face/body and like how it soaks in.</li>
    <li> For those of you who are sensitive to sunscreens you might try this one.  I end up itching with all of the others I have tried. My daughter had gotten this from her dermatologist and gave it to me to try.  It works really well for me.  My face is especially sensitive to the sun and to sunscreens but is fine with this product.</li>
    <li> One of the few sunscreens that I can use.  For some strange reason I have become allergic to an ingredient in many lotions.  This one works for me.  It is very mild for my skin, feels good when you put it on, and works great to protect me.</li>
