<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So ideal! It&#x27;s great to have all the polish out in a view that you can easily see colors. The plastic seems to be very sturdy and durable while still lightweight!</li>
    <li> It broke after I loaded all my polish on it</li>
    <li> Liked the product, but it arrived chipped on the bottom right corner, just taped it together but will not purchase from buyer again. Do not recommend</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  Exactly like you would find at a nail salon and not too heavy to hang on the wall.  Love IT!</li>
    <li> Better than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s said to hold 90 but doesn&#x27;t. It holds 103!!! I suggest that you buy this!</li>
    <li> Easy to hang. Looks great when full of polish. The quality is great for the price. Thinking about buying a second one.</li>
    <li> I was initially worried because I saw mixed reviews about this rack and the condition that mine came in, but my rack came in beautiful condition. It was also packaged very well and it is a great way to hold my small collection of nail polish vs the drawer. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs a cute way to store their nail polish:)</li>
    <li> The racks came very quickly were not damaged at all and are significantly less expensive than any other rack I have seen! Works great! I ordered two and will be ordering one more soon.</li>
    <li> Love it! Displays my essential oil collection. Although the larger bottles do not fit, the .5 ones do.</li>
    <li> This rack came nicely packaged with no damages! I was very happy to see that, however when you feel the product itself it seems very unsturdy and cheaply made. But i do love how it looks on my wall with all the nail polish in it:) oh and it does fit more then 90 bottles!</li>
    <li> Super sturdy, great quality. I have quite a few bottles of nail polish and still only fill up 3 and a half rows. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great item shipped fast, but came in with a piece broken on the bottom.</li>
    <li> Perfect, just what I was looking for. We did have to drill bigger holes for the mounting screws because it really needed bigger screws for it to be secure and be sure to hold the weight.  That was a simple fix.</li>
    <li> Large and holds all my polish. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this polish rack. It arrived on time and was packaged well. I hung it up in the salon where I do nails and it looks great. Very professional and clean.</li>
    <li> Good quality nail polish rack. I had plenty of space on the shelves for different sizes of polish bottles. Easy to hang and fast shipment. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> LADIES..This is a really cute nail polish holder! Looks great on the wall and is very sturdy. Would definately recommend this to store your polishes; you wont regret it!! :))</li>
    <li> I ordered this polish rack because it was the closest I could find to the one Rachel Zoe has in her studio, and I thought it would be great alternative to hiding my collection in a plastic container under the sink.  It arrived intact and was well protected in its packaging, and although there were a couple of small imperfections/scratches on the rack, it looked good.  (Imperfections are undetectable now that the rack is hanging against my white wall.)  I was able to hang it easily with two medium screws and it is plenty sturdy enough to stay put under the weight of the polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that all of my polish bottles fit in the rack (OPI, Essie, SpaRitual, etc.) except for the Nicole brand.  I am able to rig those bottles to sit in rack at a slight angle, but because they are not perfectly round, they won&#x27;t sit flat in the rack.  So if you are a big Nicole nail polish fan, this may not be the rack for you, but it&#x27;s awesome for all of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried in it.  It also fits the little square boxes that the peel-and-apply nail polish strips come in very nicely.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these racks.  Overall the racks are sturdier than I thought.  In the beginning I was suspicious that only 2 small screws were used to hang it on the wall, but after hanging it up and filling it with nail polish I see that those two screws are enough to do the job and I am not worried about the rack falling off the wall.  I filled the racks with polish and it looks amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the racks I ordered was perfect!  It was everything that I expected and looks great!  The second rack was not as nice as the first one.  The top shelf was not level.  The left side of the shelf was 1cm lower than the right side of the shelf.  Also, looking closely at the acrylic, I saw fingerprints on the acrylic!  I tried rubbing and rubbing thinking the prints were just oil, but no, they are actually glue.  It seems the person assembling the rack had extra glue on their fingers and touched the acrylic.  The prints are not a big deal since the rack is still functional and the prints won&#x27;t be seen when it is full, but that&#x27;s just something to note if you are picky about that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in the process of contacting the seller to replace my second rack, so I will update this review on how the seller handles this situation.  Overall though, I love this nail rack!  I love it so much that I bought a third one just now!  Hopefully there are no problems with this new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The seller contacted me back and offered me an $8.00 discount.  Since a return and replacement would be a bit of a hassle, I decided to just accept the discount.  Very prompt response from the seller!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I bought it for. It holds all of my polish, plus some gadgets. I like that it is plastic. It&#x27;s a neat display. Perfect for the job. I did throw away the Polish Station sign that came with it because it&#x27;s obviously that and it was awkwardly shaped. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Really cheap material.  The top left hand row had a crack in it when it arrived, with a whole chunk missing.  And when I was installing it on the wall, another piece off the other side broke.  Cheap, thin plastic. I was worried it would fall off the wall or break again, but it&#x27;s been holding up my 90+ nail polishes without a problem.  2 screws hold it up, but that seems to suffice, as long as you don&#x27;t put too much weight on its shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I repurchase?  Absolutely not.  I&#x27;d look for a better quality rack that I know won&#x27;t break so easily.</li>
    <li> Attaches very easily and is sturdy - displays my polishes beautifully.</li>
    <li> fell off the wall and cracked.</li>
    <li> Space saver...Ilove it</li>
    <li> I ordered this organizer for my 15 year old daughter who has LOTS of nail polish.  It arrived on time and was packed well.  It was a little larger than I thought it would be but it is great because it will hold alot of bottles.  It went up super easy with the included screws but there were no instructions included--I guess you don&#x27;t really need any.  There was an extra plastic piece included that said \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot; but I opted to not use it--I think it is just a decorative piece.  This seems like a sturdy, well made organizer.</li>
    <li> The item arrived to me on time and it was packed very well. Thank you. I love this item. I have drilled it onto my wall and have put my entire nail polish collection on it.</li>
    <li> Excellent  (in good condition ).</li>
    <li> Love it! All my nail polishes fit and I can see them very well now! Definitely would recommend buying this because it is sturdy and not too expensive.</li>
    <li> I was SO excited when I got this! It was a little wider than I thought it would be, but it was still the perfect size! I have it hanging in my bedroom next to my vanity and I LOVE IT! I still have more room for more nail polish too! I got it in great condition and it came within 5 days of ordering it (it came from California and I live in Ohio). I find that the 90 bottles per unit is appropriate because I have around 65 bottles on there right now and still have 2 rows left! Great buy! I do think it is a little over priced but it&#x27;s the cheapest one that I could find on amazon and ebay!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! It is sturdy and holds all of my polish.  I love that it is clear and I can see all the colors.  Shipping was fast and it was packed well.  I ordered two and they both fit on the inside of my bathroom closet door.  The first one I used 2 screws to install, the second one I actually tried the double sided stickies that come with the command wall hooks incase I wanted to remove it, but it has held up just as good as the screws and they have been up and full for a month.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i like the product- dont get me wrong, but i was slightly disappointed how it is made. . . it looks cheaply put together. . you can see the glue stains. however, once you place nail polish in the rows it does hide it and make it look better. it still looks nice and was extremely easy to hang just not what i was totally expecting.</li>
    <li> My came on time everything was packaged very secured yet it had a minor crack once I put a little weight on it the crack got way bigger.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to return it but I didn&#x27;t want to wait for a refund or a new one to arrive I&#x27;m just going to super glue the crack and it should be fine (fingers crossed).</li>
    <li> This item is perfect for storing my nail polish collection! It is very sturdy and was easy to hang. The item did not come damaged and was as pictured. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. It does indeed hold over 90 OPI sized bottles and is just like what they use in salons to display the polish.  As a nail tech student, it fits my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> GOOD ITEM MOUNTED ON WALL LOOKS GOOD A LITTLE LIGHTWEIGHT. I DISPALYED CND AND OPI POLISHES ON IT FIT JUST FINE.</li>
    <li> Holds up well, thank you.</li>
    <li> mine is actually full, but it can also hold perfume bottles</li>
    <li> Got this product super quick, before the estimated delivery. It&#x27;s huge and fits all my OPI polishes. LOVEeeeeeee it. The plastic is quite durable and not flimsy at all. I really just couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received it.</li>
    <li> It was a great buy and perfectly holds all of my nail polishes.  It is very sturdy and it is not bulky at all.  It can hold even more then 90 nail polishes too!! I love it and have already filled mine up! I may need to buy another...</li>
    <li> I was cracked, I found the pieces and glued it.</li>
    <li> Very nice wall mount rack.  Turned a problem area into a showpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star knocked off due to scratches on the plastic.  Not that noticeable after hanging, but I sort of felt like I got a &amp;#34;factory second&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it.  I did try and drill an additional hole where I needed it and I cracked it, but this was my fault.  I plan on orderring another one soon.</li>
    <li> Work and looks as expected! Holding 60 bottles currently.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed that the rack arrived broken and cracked to the point cannot be glued.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this polish rack. I wished I would have bought this sooner. I also added a picture (#6) which displays all my various sizes/brands of polish. I originally kept my polish in clear plastic containers which the polish eventually jumbled, and never stayed upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rack was packaged in excellent condition. It included a sign, screws and anchors and the rack. I installed the rack on the lower half of the inside of my bathroom door since I did not want it displayed on a wall easily visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item to keep polish organized and easily visible.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Got here before expected. Thought I had to set it up but it was already built when I took it out of the packaging. Holds my polishes very nicely! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for. Holds all of my polish bottles. Number of bottles per row varies by brand. For me between 16-19 bottles/row.</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack is just what I needed.  I can now organize my polish by colors, and they all fit, and the rack doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> My daughter was interested in organizing her vast collecion of nail polish. I am sure for most, these little bottles were scattered all about. I jumped at the chance to get this in order. This product fit the bill. Since it is clear plastic, you can easily see all the bottles. It can fit some of the wider OPI bottles as well. I was impressed in how well the product was packed for shipping. This is a salon grade product, it is not cheaply made, the plastic used this thick and sturdy. I had none of the issues some other reviewers commented on, regarding gluing. The finish and assembly looked great. The product comes with all you need to hang on the wall. You&#x27;ll be ready to go in less than 5 minutes. Your collection of nail polish will then proudly be on display...the best is, all is in one spot...but then you can see how much you are really spending on your passion...well everyone needs a hobby! Great product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite pricey but it stores and display my more expensive polishes perfectly. I have learned to make polish holders myself and because of the pricing even on my lazy days would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I literally got this this morning, so as far as long wear, I can&#x27;t review that aspect of the rack. But, I received this product two days (!!) after I ordered it, and it had estimated that I would receive next Wednesday. Needless today, I was completely shocked at how quickly it came, and am so pleased with it!! It is well made, comes with screws and anchors, and even comes with a topper sign that says \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot;. It&#x27;s pretty adorable and fits all different polish shapes and sizes. I&#x27;m in love with it and I&#x27;m definitely ordering another one, as this rack probably only holds about 1/3 of my polishes :)</li>
    <li> If you own a lot nail polish then this perfect for you! Mine came well packaged and not broken. All my nail polishes fit perfectly. The bottles that I put in this rack are OPI, Orly, Essie, and Nicole by OPI</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this wall rack for all my nailpolish, exactly as describe and picture. Great seller! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Very convent and sturdy</li>
    <li> i am pretty satisfied with this product.  It came before it was supposed to arrive it is perfect size and it is fairly good quality.  the only 2 things i would change is if it was made of a less clangy loud material and if it had holes at the bottom to attach it to the wall for more support i suggest  this to anyone who has lots of polish</li>
    <li> Instead of nail polish, I used this rack to house my Young Living Essential Oil bottles.  It holds up to 20 bottles a row, and now I can see each label clearly through the plastic front of the row.  It solves a long standing problem of keeping these bottles in order and readily available.  I recommend it to anyone that has a lot of small bottles to organize.  There is a little space on the shelves so if you put it on the back of a door they may rattle, if you move the door quickly and with force.  However, they will not fall.  Good solid product.  Just what I wanted and expected.  The organization factor is worth the price. (Holds approx. 100 bottles.)</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this nail polish rack!  I have been searching for the best way to store all my polishes and over the years I have tried EVERYTHING!  I have used bins and drawers and lazy susans but this one is GREAT!  No more searching to the bottom of the bin for a special color.  Maybe I won&#x27;t buy duplicates this way, either.  The rack was shipped quickly and packed really well.  I opted not to use the Polish Station sign on top.  I&#x27;m grateful it came as a separate piece.  The thickness is perfect for putting on the wall behind my bedroom door.  I was able to fit 95 bottles on it, although several of the bottles are thinner.  I found it could fit 14 OPI bottles on 1 shelf without crowding them.  I just wish it had about 3 more shelves...hmmm...maybe I should buy another?!  I&#x27;m sure I will!  My daughter is 14 and is well on her way to filling the one I got for her too!  If you are addicted to nail polish like I am, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Great nail polish organizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JC</li>
    <li> ive got more than 90 bottle on mine, really sturdy, and i really like it, so much easier than soem older makeup bag i used to have mine in</li>
    <li> I really love this product i think $31.00 is really cheap and well worth every penny &#x3D;)shipped in 3 days</li>
    <li> Came perfectly packaged, as described and was easy to attach to the wall. Holds my whole nail polish collection (70 bottles) easily with a shelf still that is free. Looks great against my blue walls.</li>
    <li> Your lady will love this.</li>
    <li> I love how this looks. Maybe the seller read previous comments because my items arrived on time, with excellent protection and in perfect conditions. Super easy to install. I am not using this for nail polish, it worked great for my office to organize all the products I use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for those who need organization, like myself! I love that I can quickly see all of the colors of polish I have. I feel like I&#x27;m going to my own salon every time I get to choose a new color. Quality is very good and it went up on the wall within seconds. It&#x27;s already full and I can&#x27;t wait to get another one! This one has 6 shelves. One shelf can hold 15 bottles of OPI polish.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this for about a month and I was able to clear a large space on a shelf and put most of my nail polish bottles on this space saving rack.  i do have over 90 bottles on them, but not all bottles are the same shape and size, so it may vary.  it was pretty easy to install as well: just two screws.  my boyfriend, however, used screw anchors to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also collect disney vinylmation and ten 3-inch vinylmation figures comfortably fit across a row.  so i may purchase more for that type of storage/display.</li>
    <li> Very easy to construct and hang.  I love this in my beauty room!</li>
    <li> very useful product for organizing nail polishes. Design and quality look good but this product was easily broken by delivery so I returned first one and got second one. Entire process of service was pretty nice.</li>
    <li> It did it&#x27;s job in organizing my nail polishes, it&#x27;s in my walk in closet and keeps it all neat and confined to the wall.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do and depending on the brand it will hold slightly more than 96 nail polishes. I bought it as a gift and I liked it so much I bought one for myself as well.</li>
    <li> Im def getting aother one of this. I love how the bottles look, how steady is and it holds big bottles of polish :)</li>
    <li> Fits virtually every nail polish bottle and holds a ton. I hung it up in my room and it&#x27;s so fun (and practical) to see all of the colors displayed!</li>
    <li> For my daughter who is 9. She loves it. Almost filled it up and still holding up great. No problems</li>
    <li> Holds a lot of polish and looks great! Perfect way to display the polish.</li>
    <li> Item arrived broken&lt;br /&gt;on bottom shelf corner  even though it had styrofoam padding around it. Still usable and holds polish nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been into polish for awhile and my lovely fiancée thought I needed something to showcase them. I must say it was made better than I had expected it to be. It arrived right on time as well. I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it do the acrylic,  spider webbing as we screwed it into the wall.</li>
    <li> The rack arrived safe and sound, safely packed in between styrofoam and cardboard, and in estimated time.   A great way to display all of my polishes...! It looks great!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish holder! It was worth the $40 bucks! But if you have more then 90 nail polishes then don&#x27;t get it! Cause i still have some sitting in a bin until i figure out what to do with them.</li>
    <li> They work for what I needed them for. Wish I would have looked longer cause I saw some &amp;#34;prettier&amp;#34; ones for less money. But I like what I got.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use as a display and storage case for my tabletop rpg minis. I also thought this could be a great display case for small items at for retail. Unfortunately when the item arrived there were cracks all over it and some pieces had broken off. That could just be an accident and isn&#x27;t the full reason for the low rating, however. The rack is also covered with fine scratches and blobs of dried glue from assembly (you can kind of see these in the photos). It looks so bad, I can not recommend this for any kind of nice-looking or professional display. The plastic is thinner and weaker than expected. I&#x27;m kind of glad it arrived broken so I have a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; excuse not to keep it...because I still would not have wanted to keep it based on the rest of it&#x27;s flaws. It&#x27;s also not a great size for my minis anyway (could have figured that from the product dimensions though, so that&#x27;s my bad.) If I didn&#x27;t care how this thing looked I could glue the broken off parts back together, sure, but I do care. I wanted a nice display case and I&#x27;m sure professional nail artists or anyone with standards feels the same way.</li>
    <li> I almost missed the sign but other than that everything is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s super huge! I&#x27;m so excited! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I loved this. fits all my lipsticks, eye shadows and pigments. I did not use for nail polishes. I used to display my make up.</li>
    <li> I had multiple bottles of nail polish in \\&quot;caboodle\\&quot; cases. Very unorganized and tough to see what was on the bottom. After throwing several pricey bottles of polish away, i figured there had to be better option. I came across this nail display and despite a few negative reviews, i didn&#x27;t see any other options besides storage drawers; which take up floor space. I ordered the display and it came securely packed and ready to hang. I used my own rubber washers on each side of the two holes at the top to prevent overtightening of the mounting screws (i didn&#x27;t want to crack the display, if i tightened it too much). I hung the display inside a hall closet door, taking up NO space. The result is AWESOME. I now can see each polish clearly and it is a pleasure to open the closet door to a rainbow (of course i had to color coordinate the nail colors) of polish neatly lined up. I have a renewed interest in painting my nails now. If you have any doubts, just do it. The quality is great. One of my all time favorite purchases EVER!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Fits all my nail polishes well. Came with screws which were too short to put on my wall. Otherwise not bad!</li>
    <li> This is a good nail polish holder.  There is a full back to it so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the polish falling out of the back if you prop it up against something.  Fits well over 100 polishes.  There are two holes on the top and two holes on the bottom for mounting.  Does not come with mounting screws.  The holder was not protected with plastic or any covering so it did have a few scratches on it.</li>
    <li> Works well but does not hold bottles that are taller.</li>
    <li> It looks great and works with my collection of polishes. It only has holes for screw at the top two corners, so the bottom does hang off the wall. I imagine you could fix that yourself but I left it. This worked for me.</li>
    <li> This unit keeps all of my nailpolishes handy yet in one place without having to go through the guesswork of their colors.  It fits nicely on the wall and is a good size.  It fits many bottles as mentioned.</li>
    <li> Came broken to the point where I can&#x27;t fix it to use it....NOT worth the money ... stay away..,still really want a rack dont know where to get one.. They never even offered to replace it..</li>
    <li> So nice, bought this for my daughter who has soooooo many nail polishes.  Great to have a place to put them up off the bureau.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a completely battered box and the rack itself was cracked in half.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes things so much easier!! And displays polish neat and clear view of every thing without searching threw junk drawers!! Love it !!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the ease and quickness of ordering and receiving my product.  It is well made&lt;br /&gt;and fairly priced.  I recommend this vendor to all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter because she has many bottles of nail polish and her collection is growing. We needed something that would keep the bottles organized and off her shelves. The wall rack was perfect. We easily hung it on the wall and it looks great.</li>
    <li> This nail rack met all my expectations. Sturdy, spacious, easy to wall mount. No scratches in the acrylic when received, either. Highly recommend to any other collectors of nail lacquer!</li>
    <li> love this! Such a great way to see my nail polish since before it was all in a drawer. I&#x27;m working on filling it up then will be purchasing another one. Some reviews said theirs came damaged - I was a bit skeptical ordering. I had no problems with mine. It was packaged very nicely so that would not happen. It was easily hung up in my room with 2 nails. Very simple. Great price.</li>
    <li> I love my nail polish wall rack. It arrived 6 days after I ordered it. very well package. Does not come with screws to hang it up with but holds well over 90 polishes. Makes finding your polish so easy compared to having them all stored in a drawer where you can never seem to find what your looking for. My rack was in good condition, and put together very well. Love it and will be ordering more now that I know what I will be getting.</li>
    <li> It arrived promptly, and well-packaged. My husband had no trouble putting it up on the wallboard with anchors that we provided--it has 4 holes for mounting. It really is a great way to have all my regular and Soak-Off-Gel polishes in one place, on display, and ready to use. The only problem is making decisions!</li>
    <li> This was the best value I found when shopping for a rack.  It is spacious, light weight, easy to wall mount, and looks fantastic.  Do not hesitate to order this product!</li>
    <li> Easy to hang and now i don&#x27;t have a basket of different polishes. I love how organized they are and i don&#x27;t buy mutiples of one color.</li>
    <li> I get compliments from my friends who see my nail polish displayed in this case. I still think it is a little expensive.</li>
    <li> works as it should. sturdy and keeps all my nail polish organized. although its huge i cant fit all my nail polish. so I might get another one.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time hanging this only because I couldn&#x27;t find the stud in my wall, believe its 24 inches instead of 16 but other wise after making 5 holes in the wall it was hung and I was very pleased! I also turned my skinny bottles side ways so now it holds MORE. A Great Buy! A+ A+</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!!!!! It&#x27;s very sturdy and looks great....i just purchased another one!</li>
    <li> Its big enough to hold all of my polish bottles and sturdy enough to support them.</li>
    <li> Screws were missing, so we can&#x27;t hang it on the wall.  But other than that, great item.  We got replacement screws at a local hardware store.</li>
    <li> Love this. Displays my nail polishes perfectly and keeps them nice and organized! Definitely a must have for someone who has a lot of nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Great for nails polish</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack is definitely going to be useful - I am pretty sure that it can fit 102 bottles of Essie nail polish. It looks great far away, but upon closer inspection I can tell that glue is showing (some smudging too) and some of the pieces are not straight. It is pretty negligible for the price and I don&#x27;t think anyone that sees it will be able to point it out, but if you are really picky about that sort of thing, I do not recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast :)</li>
    <li> This was purchased and placed in the daughter&#x27;s bathroom several months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has held up perfectly and adds a great way to store all of those nail polishes. Very easy to install and maintain.</li>
    <li> The polish rack was cracked on the side and the quality of it was cheap. Very thin. The ledge was not tall enough so polish often falls off the rack.</li>
    <li> Easy to hang, and love the look.  Only downside I can think of is that it didnt hold 96 bottles like it said.  I have OPI polished in it and it held more like 78.</li>
    <li> We received the product in a prompt fashion and my daughter loved that it held all of her nail polishes.  Its made of a very sturdy acrylic.  We actually ordered two sets of these.  Only one set had the &amp;#34;nail station&amp;#34; logo piece.  This wasn&#x27;t a problem since it&#x27;s hanging in her closet and she thought it was tacky anyways. One box was also lacking hardware to hang. This can easily be fixed by running to a hardware store however it was an inconvenience.</li>
    <li> The rack was scratched and a little beat up. I still went ahead and put it on the wall.  Scratches are not so obvious.</li>
    <li> Received my order today, discovered the bottom right corner is cracked. There was Styrofoam on the sides and the top, but a very little piece in the middle of the bottom, not on the sides!! Would have given this product 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t cracked. It looks great and seems durable, but gave 3 stars since I received it cracked.</li>
    <li> Love it, now I can see All my colors, instead of digging through duffle bag I had them in..&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize how many polishes I had, space saver too, hung on wall behind door</li>
    <li> Really great, and holds a lot of nail polish. Have 2 of them and I love them.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this rack.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to install. Holds for me over 110 polishes, and looks great in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;If you are an avid polisher this really is a must have.</li>
    <li> We LOVE it for our Young Living Essential oils!! :) They fit perfectly, you can see what your looking for! It just looks nice and crispy clean!! :) Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted. It arrived quickly, with no problems with glue, cracks or anything like that. A great deal and if I should need another I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have ordered many many polish racks before and this one was not well made and does not have a good depth for each row. I can not fit all of my various types of polish bottles in this rack. you can also see the glue that holds the pieces of the rack together. Finally this does not have holes to screw to the wall on the bottom as most do to allow more strength in holding up weight.</li>
    <li> I paid 90$ for another one just like it 3 years ago. Thanks for the GREAT discount. Most Equipment and supplies is so over priced in the Nail Industry. Its Nice to get a Break.</li>
    <li> This rack is so awesome! Way more then I expected and so perfect. It&#x27;s a must have for you nail polish freaks (:</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack is perfect! It came with everything I needed to hang it, too. I love how nice my polishes all look on the wall. It arrived in excellent condition AND earlier than I expected. It fits every brand of polish that I personally own so I had no problems there. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a organized and professional way to store and display their nail polishes.</li>
    <li> practical organizer for people with lots of nail polish bottes</li>
    <li> What more can I ask for? This holds all of my nail polish and I love it! When my friends come over they are wowed!</li>
    <li> I had seen a few reviews of people saying their rack came damaged, but I figured they were rare occurrences...NO! I came home so excited to hang it up and put all my nail polish on, but when I opened it the whole top shelf was broken off! What the heck! I regret buying this thing!</li>
    <li> I have so many nail polishes that I wanted organized and displayed neatly and this item looked perfect. I received the Nail Polish Rack within a few days of ordering, which was great! I opened it up and leaned it up against my wall to see where I wanted to put each polish. The size of this item was perfect, enough rows to store all my polishes, they all fit perfectly! I then followed the instructions and hung it up on the wall, after properly securing it, I started to line up my polishes on the middle row. Unfortunately, about 1/2 way through, the bottom right corner completely broke off from the back of the shelf! Before I could get all the polishes off, it cracked up the side and all the polishes on the bottom two rows fell off. Luckily none of them broke, but this wall rack was a dud!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! This is perfect for my polishes. I got tired of having them in a box so I bought this to display them. It came in perfect condition and super fast! I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Product&#x27;s came broken</li>
    <li> Awesome product... I love it!!! No more clutter. Takes up no space on your dresser at all. Durable. Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> I had made a bottle rack for myself following instructions on a DIY site and it was okay but not adequate.  After finding this online I ordered and it was perfect - every single bottle fit except for my Butter brand polishes, so I just put them in at an angle and voila!  Very good quality product and manufacture.  Comes with mounting hardware, too.</li>
    <li> Loves it! this works way better then taking up soooo much room on my vanity...even came with this sign to put on top saying \\&quot;nail station\\&quot; lol so cute. was shipped in less than a week. thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s daughter. It arrived on time, in perfect condition and she loves it. It is sturdy and so far holds all the shapes and sizes of polish.</li>
    <li> Just like picture. Rated only 3 stars because one of my shelves were cracked.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! looks great holds all polish!! And you can bling it out if you want too. I did mine.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, drilled it to the wall and she loved it. Looks great. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
    <li> This fits all of my polishes nicely on my office wall. It was easy to hang, and now everything is organized and neat. Quick ship &amp; great transaction.</li>
    <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose, easy to install and we will be buying another one when we fill this one up with polish.</li>
    <li> Holds over 96+ bottles. Really depends on size/shape of bottle. It didn&#x27;t come with screws or anchors to hang. That sucked! Hates making a few trips to the home improvement store to find the right stuff! Packaging was good! Well protected and arrived on time but I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with just the top holes holding 90+ nail polish bottles...made two more holes on the bottom and that helps a lot. Kind of bowed a little but it&#x27;s been up for over 2 months with no problems!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Packed well. Just as described.</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered this for her bedroom wall.  it was filled up immediately and I need to order another one.</li>
    <li> this is just what I needed to hold all of my nail polishes. Fits perfectly on the inside of my closet door.</li>
    <li> Great for displaying essential oils</li>
    <li> - Fast shipment, got it within 3 days to California.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;- Great price&lt;br /&gt;- Holds a TON of nail polish (especially if you position the nail polishes, you can hold even more!)&lt;br /&gt;- HIGHLY RECOMMEND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product in August 21 2012 and writing this overdue review March 17 2014. The rack has held well for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top part that says &amp;#34;Nail station&amp;#34; is optional. You can add that if you want. It&#x27;s a separate piece.</li>
    <li> Just as pictured.  Easy to install.  And, it does hold 90 bottles of my nail polish, which are a variety of sizes and brands.</li>
    <li> My daughter has so many polishes and this was the ideal Christmas gift for her.  Will be ordering more in the future.  Great product</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it she hung it in her powder room where it is bright and she can see all the colors at eye level</li>
    <li> The rack is perfect. It fits in a little walls space just behind my door so I don&#x27;t have to look at it all the time, yet it organizes my polishes so I can see and pick colors immediately.  Comes with hardware to hang, super simple: just screw in two screws into the predrilled holes on the unit.  Comes with a \\&quot;nail polish station\\&quot; clear acrylic sign that I really didn&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> I ordered a second one of these, and love them both.  Easy install, holds more than 90, depending upon bottle size.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a great way to store my nail polishes (they can be quite expensive, and I hate just shoving them in a bin.)  I had very high hopes for this rack, and it didn&#x27;t live up to them.  It shipped quickly, but there are some major problems.  Firstly, when I opened the box, I sat the item down and reviewed it.  There were ANTS crawling on it.  YUCK.  Now I&#x27;m paranoid that they&#x27;ll be all over my house.  Next, my rack is covered in scratches, some of which are quite deep.  I gave it a thorough cleaning hoping that they would buff out, but they didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a rather large unit and it will give me plenty of room to grow my nail polish collection, and I&#x27;m hopeful that once it&#x27;s full and against a wall the scratches won&#x27;t be so noticeable.  Am I thrilled?  Not at all.  It could have been so much better.  Am I bothered enough to return it?  No, since I don&#x27;t want to pay to ship it back.  Would I recommend it?  I would recommend that someone get a clear acrylic rack, but I would tell them to search elsewhere.</li>
    <li> If was just what I ordered I loved it I loved it so uh I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another one and btw if you don&#x27;t put all large bottles of polish on the rack it will hold more than 90 bottles of polish And it was easy to hang</li>
    <li> love this product!! fits a lot of bottles of nail polish!! easy to hang!! no worries on buying this! love</li>
    <li> This was a great investment .My nail polish was in a bag and I could not see all of it . I love being able to see all my nail polish . Love it !</li>
    <li> This is now hanging in my bedroom with several bottles of nail polish on display and it looks wonderful!  Sometimes I catch myself just staring at my collection.  I did not like the sign that comes with it that says \\&quot;Nail Polish Station\\&quot; but it&#x27;s separate from the rack itself, so I just tossed that part.  I thought it was weird that there were only 2 holes at the top for screws, instead of 4 holes (1 screw for each corner) but it seems to be holding up pretty well with just 2 screws.  For nail polish addicts like myself, I highly recommend this rack.</li>
    <li> Attractive and sturdy rack.  Looks great and is great quality!  Well made, thick material. Easy to hangs, my daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Works fantastically.&lt;br /&gt;Came a about a week late.&lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t fallen down off my wall.&lt;br /&gt;Bigger than I thought it was. Should&#x27;ve measured it first.&lt;br /&gt;Very appealing</li>
    <li> Bought this for our bathroom to keep polish organized.  Works great!  Hung it behind the door and it it serves its purpose! :-)</li>
    <li> it was deliverd busted poor packageing damaged very mad this is my second remark</li>
    <li> These are wonderful.  They are just as described.  I am going to order two more!</li>
    <li> This is a nice rack that allows one to clearly see all the polishes easily. However I understood it was supposed to come with the mounting hardware and it didn&#x27;t. Even though I like the rack, I thought it was pretty expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> This product may not be unique, I can find these everywhere, but this is the BEST price I&#x27;ve found! I currently own 5 of these to house my 600+ bottles. I love the way these look on my wall and so far, I&#x27;ve only found one brand (Nicka K) that did not fit on this rack. It holds all the big brands like China Glaze, Opi, Essie, Orly, etc as well as drug store brands with ever changing bottles like Sally Hansen. This was a great investment and they&#x27;ve held up beautifully. I&#x27;ve received each rack is great condition, never broken or cracked.</li>
    <li> It holds so many I now need more polish just to fill it up. It got to me late because of some screw up with fed ex, but it&#x27;s already mounted to my wall and all the nail polish bottles, dodads and and thingamijigs for doing your nails is there. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Products received as scheduled &amp; as described. It also works great for essential oil storage. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is great!  I&#x27;ve been storing my nail polish in a shoe box and finally realized I needed to have a better storage solution so I ordered this and mounted it on the wall in my closet, next to my vanity.  It holds a LOT of polishes!  More than I have, and I thought I had too many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need screws to mount this.</li>
    <li> This rack is huge and my daughter is thrilled with her polish rack.  Was easy to hang, although it didn&#x27;t come with any screws or anchors.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom&#x27;s birthday and she liked it. We put it up on the wall and it looks really nice, but it holds nowhere heard 96 regular sized nail polish bottles. It holds more around 60 maybe.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter&#x27;s nail polishes.  It fits all different kinds and its easy to hang</li>
    <li> Perfect. Wish these were cheaper</li>
    <li> These racks are fantastic! I actually got 101 bottles of polish on one rack. They fit very nicely. I love the way they display my polishes and they make it easy to see all the different color polishes. Even my boxes of Sally Hansen nail effects fit in them. I just wish it would have come with the proper scores to hang it up.</li>
    <li> I use this unit to hold my airbrush paints and it works very well for this purpose.  It is nothing fancy, just a Plexiglas backing with Plexiglas shelves.  Four simple holes to screw the unit to the wall.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect wall rack, I am just starting my business and this really makes it official. It is very well constructed and very sturdy. I received it fast and it was well packaged. I am happy!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have that much nail polish, but I really wanted my nail polish on display so I would wear the colors more! And I even filled mine up with makeup lol this acrylic rack is amazing! Oh and it&#x27;s HUGE which is a big plus to me because it takes up a nice amount of wall space , which gives me a lot of room to display things around my vanity area in my room! It was packaged nicely , no cracks or smudges and looks awesome, my friends always ask where I got this as well as my Instagram followers and every time I say Amazon they are shocked! It&#x27;s so spacious I absolutely love this rack and I would recommend it to anyone :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with nail polish and collecting as many colors as possible. This is perfect for me to display all my beautiful nail polishes. The rack is already full and I will be buying another one soon! Hang easily, and very sturdy. Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife seems to have a nail polish addiction.  She had a whole drawer full of nail polish bottles so I bought her this.  It holds 90 bottles and I underestimated how many she has but this hangs in her bathroom wall and holds them well.</li>
    <li> After months of keeping this item on my Amazon wish list I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase this nail polish rack, and I&#x27;m so happy I did! For years and years I had been keeping my polishes in little plastic boxes, never really knowing what I had and often buying dupes. Now I have my polishes organized by color and company so I know exactly what I have and can stop buying the same shades of polish over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriends LOVED seeing my polishes nicely displayed on the wall. They didn&#x27;t even think to ever look for a rack, or they didn&#x27;t know these were available for the public to buy. I&#x27;ll be sending them the links to this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, although it wasn&#x27;t the biggest deal, was the product smelled strongly of glue when I took it out of the box. I let it air out for a little bit and it was fine. Also whoever/whatever put my rack together (is it put together by a person or machine? I&#x27;m not sure) did a sloppy job and in some spots there were clumps of glue that I had to scrape off. Other than that this rack is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> i love this rack. it works amazling. im a 14 year old and i built this myself. one the first row i keep essie 2nd row i keep opi 3rd row i keep sinfulcolors 4th row i keep drugstore and china glaze and zoya 5th row i keep julep and butter london and 6th row i keep top coats base coats matte coats and glitter coats and crackle and my gel nail polish for my gel nail system. i freaking love it. i cant believe it holds so much. i have the alex nine draw for all my makeup and most nail polish art goes in there</li>
    <li> I Love this holder. I Hung it in my closet and now I can see my polishes perfectly! It holds 90 regular sized polishes- love it!</li>
    <li> The craftsmanship was very poor, and several of the parts were not attached/glued correctly.</li>
    <li> I use this for Ejuice and it fits way more bottles then it would nail polish and is great for keeping stuff out of kids reach.</li>
    <li> Great item! Mine did not come with any hardware but luckily we had some to use anyway. It looks just like it does in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing more because my collection is growing . I love the look and the sign (polish station) 😊</li>
    <li> I Love this! It Was exactly what I expected. When this one is full I will definitely purchase another one! Received in less than 5 days!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with my nail polis racks and ordered two for a new salon I just began working in. I was pleasently surprised at how quickly they arrived and although I was alerted that they would come within a certain amount of time, I thought they&#x27;d come at the tail end of the time frame but they came on the first day of the time frame! I am happy and grateful!</li>
    <li> My niece loved this. I got it for her birthday and it was easily assembled/hung on the wall</li>
    <li> Fits all my bottles perfectly and is a great salon size! Was bigger than expected but that is more than okay with me. Easy to hang on wall and very stable.</li>
    <li> This has been great! I at first was bummed to pay for shipping but I bought it at 9 o clock at night and it showed up the next afternoon! Amazing!</li>
    <li> i need another one. i had no idea i owned so many bottles of nail polish, but i love this! i feel like my house is a salon though, since there&#x27;s so much polish on the wall :)</li>
    <li> Room for EVERYTHING....nail polish, nail decals, nail art brushes, etc. It was a little to heavy for my wall so I set it on a tall stand and the anchored it to the wall at the top. Works great!</li>
    <li> Shelves not deep enough. A few bottles fell out in passing and broke on the floor.  Carpet was a mess.</li>
    <li> So fun. I put this up in a spare bedroom that will partly be a spa/vanity area.</li>
    <li> I really like this rack, I have two and all my nail polish fits pretty well. The only brand I noticed doesn&#x27;t actually fit is the Nicole by OPI bottles. Also, the acrylic that the rack is made out of is pretty brittle and if you aren&#x27;t careful it will crack and break. For this reason I have been pretty scared to actually hang it on my wall.</li>
    <li> Could not be happier!  Already bought 1 but excess inventory demanded another. My daughter the nail deva loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought a second one because I filled up my first -- excellent way to store nailpolish in an attractive display -- I have it up on the outside of my closet door.</li>
    <li> i bought this awhile ago so my nail polish has expanded a lot and i havent found a nail polish yet that hasnt fit in it (even if you have to turn different ways) so far i have counted close to 100 nail polishes that fit i put it in my closet i have a shelf that is perfect height to be able to see it</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I had in mind. Really great! Fast shipping as well. Looks great on the wall of my beauty room (im a home makeup artist) love it! Will reccomend this to anyone need polish storage.</li>
    <li> I needed a way to adequately display all of my polish &amp; this was it! It is sturdy &amp; it looks JUST like the racks in the nail stores. All of my friends want one now. The sad thing is, I never knew I had so much polish. I may need to invest in another rack!</li>
    <li> It only takes 2 nails on the top left &amp; right corners to hang on the wall, i thought it would have a hole in all 4 corners. It was wider than i thought it would be but looks like it will hold. Shipped quickly, less than a week.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter who is a polish fanatic. Needless to say, she fell in love with it immediately. Arrived well packaged and with care. Made of sturdy material and even came with an optional &amp;#34;polish station&amp;#34; sign for above the rack. We love it and may need to order another seeing as all 6 shelves have already been filled!</li>
    <li> Great product looks awesome in my bedroom  easy to hang. I love it and everyone that knows me know how much I love polish.</li>
    <li> i originally purchased one then i needed more space so i bought from them again...holds everything i need ...I NEED ANOTHER NOW...LOL.....only thing was it was cracked on the top but no complaints...i superglued...its good as new...so regardless I WILL BE ORDERING ANOTHER ONE ASAP!!! :)</li>
    <li> love it!  wasn&#x27;t sure it would be sturdy enough, but once I screwed it to wall and filled with my nail polish bottle, it proved to be just what I wanted and sturdy. Looks so colorful too. It&#x27;s hanging on a shelf in my walk in closet. First thing you notice.</li>
    <li> Like others my nail polish was just sitting in a basket and it was so hard to see what I had and I kept wasting money buying the same polishes so I decided to get this and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It&#x27;s huge and holds a lot and yet I managed to fill it up in no time so now I am getting a second one. I decided not to hang them and it sits up nicely on a dresser, very sturdy and well made. Very happy with this item and would recommend to anyone who needs a more organized space for your ever growing polish addiction!</li>
    <li> I love this simple little shelf! I just recently got into painting my own nails. I usually always just had my toes painted professionally (just painted no pedicures) and occasionally painted my finger nails but having them done professionally didn&#x27;t last but a couple days because i have 3 kids (two in which are twin babies) so I change a lot of diapers, wash a lot of sippy cups, and bath kids every day haha...I also never use my dish washer and hand wash everything. With that being said it was jsut to costly...But then i discovered painting toes white first then using matte colors and top coat! Beautiful...THEN i ran up on videos of water marble nails! Now I am hooked! They last me a week and sometimes longer! Very little cost (as i purchased polish from amazon in a group bundle) So this was exactly what i needed for all my new polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The holes to screw in to the wall aren&#x27;t very well thought out spacing wise due to the standard stud spacing....I won&#x27;t use the little inserts for dry wall hanging. But my step dad is brilliant when it comes to fixing things..We did use those screw holes to keep it straight but he used his drill and gently drilled a third hole directly in center to screw into a stud on my wall! It&#x27;s perfect now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI the top piece is separate (which i like) that says Polish station (just an accent arch to the shelf)and just a couple small nails would hold it into dry wall since it doesn&#x27;t hold the polish and it is not heavy.</li>
    <li> The construction of this is pretty cheap, but it does the job.  I will say that I do have a larger bottle of nail polish by some lesser known brand (I think I got it from an Ipsy bag) and it doesn&#x27;t fit into this rack, but Zoya, Essie, Spa Rituals... all the others fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> This thing holds 90 bottles, and we filled it up. This thing is a life saver if you are finding random bottles around the house.</li>
    <li> Love it! Easy to set up! Holds my nail polish great! If my nails are wet and I need a different color it&#x27;s easy to grab the nail polish from the rack. Holds many colors.  I ordered one and I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another one!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t come with any hardware, but was pretty easy to hang anyways.</li>
    <li> the idea is awesome and the price is awesome - however the product quality is not so awesome - it came with the shelves half hanging off - glad I didnt put any polish on it - I am going to use some superglue and fix it myself because its not worth the hassle of sending back!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these for years! Came quickly and was not broken. Fit all 96 bottles as promised! Has been up for a month and is doing great!</li>
    <li> this rack is awesome.  easy to assemble and very easy to remove if needed.  Polishes fit well and sturdy. cool!</li>
    <li> I have NOTHING negative to say about this polish station.  It&#x27;s sturdy, stores a lot of polish BUT....LOL  I think I may have to purchase another.  haha!  Since purchasing this I&#x27;ve accumulated more polish!  I have a makeup studio in my home here but this would be perfect for a business as well.  :)</li>
    <li> I own about 100 bottles of nail polish, if not more, and this is my second one of these racks. It&#x27;s great for people who have that many as it makes it easier to pick out your polish of choice when they&#x27;re all sitting on the wall!</li>
    <li> I will definitely be getting another one as my polish collection expands!</li>
    <li> The unit only fit 75 nail polish but other than that the unit perform well.</li>
    <li> I love it! It holds a lot and hangs nicely so I can see all of the colors that I have easily</li>
    <li> Fits on a great little spot in our apartment and helps save us from digging through a bag FULL of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nothing fancy about it - plastic shelves for nail polish</li>
    <li> I ordered two racks.  One had a crack on two of the shelves.  Instead of sending it back I used a clear adhesive to fix and it has worked great.  Racks are completely filled and clients remove and replace polishes without any issues.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what they show and expected from it.  My nail polishes from different labels fit perfectly. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> So I got addicted to nail polish...and was storing them in a bag in my closet...every time I wanted to do my nails it turned into a huge ordeal of nail polish bottles strewn across my floor. Then I saw this rack on a beauty blog and thought why not! I am so thrilled with this purchase!!! I put it up on an unused wall in my master bathroom and organized all my polishes (in rainbow order of course) and every time I see it out makes me happy! It takes no time at all to pick my colors and get to the fun part...the only thing I don&#x27;t like is had encouraged me to buy more nail polish to fill it up so it looks nicer... That&#x27;s just the OCD in me...I would highly recommend this to anyone with a polish addiction or OCD tendencies...</li>
    <li> I already had one of these but needed another for my ever expanding polish collection. They hold up well and are very nice but I think are too expensive and the shipping seemed a little high for plastic shelves. It was a necessity though...</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s big enough to fit my nail polish collection with room to spare. It&#x27;s nice and heavy duty and feels really sturdy.</li>
    <li> Love it. Doesn&#x27;t hold 96 bottles, I have a ton of opi which are larger bottles so that could be the reason, other than that, great case, love it! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my teenager, she loved it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my nail rack! It displays my nail polish and it is so easy to install on a wall!</li>
    <li> thank you very much for the product, remains haunted, I loved it, thanks for the attention and the speed with which they work, 100% recommended, greetings and thanks</li>
    <li> The rack is great.  It&#x27;s a shame that the shipping costs as much as the rack!  I would order it again.</li>
    <li> So let&#x27;s get the cons out of the way first. The joints are all glued together which is the normal way to join two pieces of acrylic. But alot of the joints are very sloppy if you look closely. Stand back a few feet and you&#x27;ll never notice it, but it is there.  Other then that, this was a gift for my girl friend to help organize her huge collection of nail polish and it works great. She loves it and almost has it filled already. From small to large, all the different shaped bottles fit on the rack.</li>
    <li> gets the job done. it&#x27;s ugly though.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my sister, and it has potential to fit MANY more bottles than she owns. She has a nail art hobby, and this makes her look organized and professional. Great quality, but the &amp;#34;Nail Polish Station&amp;#34; sign is super cheesy. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s separate!</li>
    <li> I had no idea my 17 year old daughter  had so many polishes.  I do now.  Works nicely, easy to see exactly what colors you have, and all in one space,</li>
    <li> This is a basic nail polish rack.  I ordered it for my daughter and we hung it on the back door of the bathroom and she loves it....easy to install&lt;br /&gt;and is a very durable piece.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful for my essential oil collection. :) And it fits some nail polish too. I love it and recommend everyone have one at least. :D</li>
    <li> This is excellent. Does what it needs to and doesn&#x27;t look tacky on my wall.</li>
    <li> This is BIGGER than I thought it would be. I used zebra print wrapping paper and covered the back before putting it on the wall in my daughters&#x27; bathroom. It looks awesome!</li>
    <li> Great quality racks!  I bought two of these two years ago and the reason I am writing the review now is because I am catching up with the reviews that I haven&#x27;t posted.  But I have these babies completely loaded with nail polish and I even moved them from one house to another where I had them hung up on the wall in both houses and they are still strong.  If I could give this 10 stars I definitely would!</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. No issues . A definite must have for girly girls .</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Similar to the ones that you see in nail salons.  Made very well and sturdy.  I will definitely repurchase when this one is full.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these before and REALLY liked it!!  I needed another one, so, I went back to my saved order history and placed an order for another one. I figured it would be identical to the first and come from the same supplier.&lt;br /&gt;This time it came from a different supplier.  It is a MUCH CHEAPER quality than the first one...&lt;br /&gt;The glue is visible ... The plastic is not as heavy duty... Shape is different... Size is about a half inch different... It has a sign to be added to the top that says &amp;#34;Nail Station&amp;#34;... (UGLY).. Luckily that sign is not attached!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had planned on putting it next to the first one I bought... Now I can&#x27;t because of the differences...&lt;br /&gt;I guess I can make due, but I will NOT order another one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this nail polish rack so that I could easily see all of the nail polish that I have and organize them by brand and color. However, my item came damaged and I still have yet to hear back from the seller and am stuck with a cracked nail polish rack that I can&#x27;t use. Extremely annoying.</li>
    <li> Worked great for make-up and nail polish. So much easier to find make-up in the morning.  Easily hung and perfect size.</li>
    <li> Ordered and received my racks the next day! Thank you!! I will definitely be purchasing again! I definitely recommend to other nail polish lovers!</li>
    <li> I was tired of digging through a plastic drawer under my bed, pulling out my collection and then choosing a nail polish. I got one of these a few weeks ago and hung it relatively easily. It seems very sturdy. Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t hold all of my polishes so I came back today for another two (one for myself and one for my mom who had a fit when she saw mine). This really does solve a lot of problems, I had fun arranging my polishes by color, and now choosing the perfect shade is a little less stressful. I hung it behind the door of my bathroom. It could easily be hung on the inside of a closet door, though, too. VERY pleased!</li>
    <li> My daughter saw this and wanted it, so we got it for her as a gift.  She loves it and has been using it in her nail area of her home every since. It looks great on her wall and keeps everything neat, organized and easy to get to.</li>
    <li> This rack is amazing!!! Arrived very quickly and in great shape. I thought I would have to put it together but there is no assembly needed (thank goodness). It looks very small but surprisingly fits all my polish bottles easily. Only problem is I didn&#x27;t realize how many bottles of polish I had until I started placing them on the rack. Strongly suggest counting your bottles before ordering lol.</li>
    <li> Good quality acrylic, looks great on my closet wall and fits all of my polishes perfectly. Good buy at a great price!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to display all my nail polishes and make them easier to find. I had the in a bin which made it difficult to find the colors I wanted when I wanted to paint my nails. I&#x27;ve been painting my nails more since I got this rack. Installation was pretty easy. I was able to do it myself with a little maneuvering to hold it up while drilling. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these a few months ago and I love it! It looks like the displays in salons and holds all different brands! Im ordering my second one now because I have ran out of room due to my growing polish collection!</li>
    <li> I love this so much, I have not filled it up yet - but almost.  It is my favorite wall accessory and friends love it when they see it.  I took a picture of me in front of it and all my friends thought I was in a nail salon but I was at home! lol</li>
    <li> Great gift for any young lady that likes to paint her nails.  Keeps all your polishes together so you know colors you have.</li>
    <li> I needed storage and organization for my essential oils and this wall rack works perfectly!  I would highly recommend this product for this purpose!</li>
    <li> This was a very nice product. My mom loved it as her Christmas present. I would recommend this product to people with a lot of nail polish.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my expanding nail polish collection. It fits all of my various brands (OPI, Essie, China Glaze, Zoya, Sally Hansen, Sephora by OPI, ELF, etc) as well as my stamper, striping tape, and stamping plates. I have it hung over my dresser and it looks really nice. I love that that it supports the bottles well while also being clear so I can see everything.</li>
    <li> Holds all my products well. I placed this in my bathroom on the wall behind the door.  That way it can hidden if needed.</li>
    <li> It arrived very fast, love the product holds all my nail polishes. I would recommend it to anyone who has a lot of nail polish</li>
    <li> Wow - this a a big rack and holds sooooo many bottles. My 9 year old daughter (and her 20 year old sister) are so excited and are filling it up. :) Easy to hang, sturdy.</li>
    <li> The item is of poor quality, ESPECIALLY for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Poorly put together. Marks/mars all over (from being manufactured, I&#x27;m sure).</li>
    <li> love these polish racks i have 6!!! i absolutely can recomend them very much!!! well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister for christmas . Looks great in her room . She almost filled it all the way up .</li>
    <li> Perfect for what my girlfriend needed it for. It hold all the different size bottles of polish she has. She hung it up and fell in love with it</li>
    <li> I  love  this  rack.  I  first  started  purchasing  them  from  my  salon.  I  was  worried  about  purchasing  online  because I  thought  it  would  get  broke  during  delivery.  Now I  own  six  of  these  racks.  I  have  them on my  bedroom wall.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my shop but I have it on my wall in my bedroom. It is light, sturdy, and durable. It came ahead of scheduled delivery, and was packaged securely and safely(all corners were wrapped). I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this rack! I was very skeptical about buying a nail polish rack online. Very glad I got this one. It is very durable and holds my polishes perfectly. Very easy set up...</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! It came perfect not even one defect with the screws already to go ....  I would order again if I would need more 😜</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed! The shipping was fast, and it was packaged thoroughly. I had no flaws in the acrylic, it&#x27;s was a perfect to store my collection. I would suggest using anchors to hang this. Other than that, it&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had one of these for years and it works just as you&#x27;d expect. The only real complaint is that the bottles of polish my wife has are 14-15ml China Glaze, OPI, and Essie polishes and you definitely can&#x27;t fit 96 bottles of that size in the rack. But it certainly cleans up an otherwise disordered mess of polishes. We&#x27;re buying a second rack right now.</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s nice and big without being huge, it&#x27;s plain and simple clear plastic, and it comes with hangers. There&#x27;s also a sign that comes with it that says &amp;#34;Polish Station,&amp;#34; but this is just for my ridiculously huge nail polish collection, not for a place of business, so I didn&#x27;t use it. If you need a nice way to organize a lot of bottles of polish, this is it.</li>
    <li> Received on time, quality is perfect!</li>
    <li> I put ecig juice into it, and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> I have so many nail polishes and I&#x27;ve always wanted something like what they had at the nail salons to consolidate them since they were everywhere around the house. This product does just that and it&#x27;s awesome. It can fit Essie and O.P.I. as well seeing as those are the brands I own the most of. It filled up all of the shelves and left the top one without any nail polishes and I was able to put nail polish remover at the top, as well as nail files and buffers, my acrylic sets, etc. It&#x27;s overall, exactly what I needed. Also, this polish rack came sooner than expected and that&#x27;s always good. I would recommend this to anyone with dozens upon dozens of nail polish like me.</li>
    <li> Bought 3, each arrived broken. Didn&#x27;t replace as they still work. I still like them. Just wish they were packaged better.</li>
    <li> It looks great on the wall and I can actually find my colors I want without having to search through the plastic shoe boxes for them. I am going to have to order another one soon, because I have that much polish and more lol. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ocd about painting my nails, and wanted a way to display and organize my polishes. I&#x27;d seen these racks online and thought this one was a fair price. It shipped quickly, and was packaged nicely. It didn&#x27;t come with screws to hang, but I had my own. The only problem is that when I took it out of the box, the styrofoam it was packaged with appeared to stick to it, and in some spots it seemed as if there was styrofoam inside the plastic. I tried cleaning it, but it only made it look dirtier and hold more smudges. With the nailpolish in it, it isn&#x27;t really noticable, but it isn&#x27;t the most pristine piece of acrylic around.</li>
    <li> I have 78 nailpolishes just because I&#x27;m a nailpolish addict... All of them fit perfectly...and I still have more than enough space to put some more...and it holds on to the weight.. So is a great product...I recommend it</li>
    <li> I bought one of these that was slightly different from another seller. This one is much better, because of the simple fact that it actually reached me in one piece! I really like this nail polish rack--it displays all my nail polishes out in one nice line so I can see all the colors Ive got. Plus its mounted on the wall which frees-up other space.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting it to come so fast. What I wanted and what I got. I cant wait to put it on my wall.</li>
    <li> This is great - just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Love this!! I spray painted mine black and it turned out great.</li>
    <li> I just received my nail polish rack and it came just as described (although when I completed my purchase, I expected to get it Tuesday 12/30 with Prime. Tracking email said Wednesday. Oh well..)    It did not come with any hardware, but it is not listed in the description  so I&#x27;m not upset. I did, however, receive the \\&quot;polish station\\&quot; display but will not be using it. It does smell strongly of acrylic and glue. Some of the other reviews suggested I leave it out for a bit to breathe which I will be doing. The smell is why I gave it four out of five stars.    As far as the rack and packaging, there was no evidence of damage; no cracks, no scratches. It was well packaged with foam inserts and boxed within a box.    Overall, I am completely happy with this product and I can&#x27;t wait to hang it. Pictures of packaged product and hanging rack pictures to come.    Update: It DID come with hardware. It was with the polish station piece. I LOVE MY DISPLAY!!! I currently have 90 polishes and kits on the display with room for more. I think I&#x27;ll need another display so I&#x27;ll have space to add to each color coordinated row when I. Are new purchases.</li>
    <li> This item is awesome! It&#x27;s very light weight and easy to install. It easily holds 90 bottles of nail polish.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a beautiful clear wall rack to display my polish collection and this is the only one I loved the look of.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how much I love this product, nothing about this looks \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; as some have said about this rack. It looks very fancy and now I can show off my collection in a way that looks clutter-free and like a new piece of wall art with all the colors from the polishes. I feel as if I own my own personal nail salon in my home now.(I own two of these beautiful racks).&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to install and no one could mess up due to the ease of this product, screw in the rack (with or without the polish station topper, your choice), and then place your favorite polishes inside, and done!:)&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product and you will not be sorry one bit. I know I will buy another rack when my polish has grown into a new one:)&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product!</li>
    <li> opened the package only to find it was broken in many places, don&#x27;t have the time to return and wait on another one, had my husband glue it together to get at least functionable</li>
    <li> just as described- good item. fast shipping</li>
    <li> need to get another one</li>
    <li> Meets the need. Just be aware that it does not come with a mounting kit.</li>
    <li> Perfect size! May fit more or less polishes depending on the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to keep organized &amp; know what you have. This rack is simple and functional. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Looks great on the wall and I can see all my nail polish now.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The acrylic is very clear and holds all of my nail polishes. This is a beautiful way to store nail polish, especially for the price. I&#x27;m very happy with it. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this rack and it came well packed but still broken.  It seemed brittle. It only has 2 screw holes to hang it at the top which seems weak compared to others I have. On the good side the company sent me a new one without asking me to return the broken one so I did not have to pay that extra postage.  I am not sure how it will hold up.  Only time will tell.</li>
    <li> This rack does not hold 90 bottles of nail polish it only holds 72 it was very disipointing it should be better explain</li>
    <li> love this wall rack for polishes.  it was very easy to install and even came with a plastic topper that said nail polishes</li>
    <li> Months ago I made a nail polish rack myself (search youtube if interested) and had the whole thing filled with most of my polishes. A few months later I realized that the polish rack wasn&#x27;t really holding all the weight of the polishes very well so I decided to purchase this one. It works well and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It was smaller than I anticipated but that&#x27;s fine because it still fits the 90 polishes it promises to fit. I will most definitely be purchasing another one of these when I need more room for polishes!</li>
    <li> Love this rack, great price and super sturdy.</li>
    <li> Holds all my polishes with room to spare. Also came with signage to add to the top of the holder. Didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Hangs nicely and came with screws.</li>
    <li> Awesome, the wife loves it</li>
    <li> After reading lots of good reviews I decided to order this rack. I&#x27;m tired to keep all my polishes in the container and I wanted to organize my nail polishes. This rack is a great quality, so sturdy. I would recommend this rack to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I love it. it helped me save space and i would buy it all over again if i had to.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! SO much easier to store. I had my nailpolish in a bin and ruined a few bottles because some of it ended up spilling.  With this rack, I can store them sitting up and can SEE all of them! I had a lot more polish than I thought and will probably end up purchasing another rack.</li>
    <li> This is too cool.  I love it!  It looks exactly like the photo, and now I have an awesome way to store and display my nail polish.  However, there are a few minor cracks in the plastic, but nothing structural.  It looks like it belongs in a salon.  It was also easy to hang.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these and they hold 202 nail polishes.  I put them behind my bedroom door and they are hidden.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and holds a lot of nail polish bottles. Good price, love it.</li>
    <li> Easy to put up and they are beautiful!! A great way to organize my nail polish, and it looks great!</li>
    <li> very nice piece. I would recomend anybody who have a lot of nail polish to get one. love it.&lt;br /&gt;BIG THANKS</li>
    <li> This was exacty what i wanted and have been looking for.  It came earlier than expected as well. I already filled it up and need to order a second.</li>
    <li> It only had 2 holes at the top to fasten it to the wall. Could have used 2 at the bottom as well</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere for a rack and they can range from $40-150. Being a collector of sorts I was determined and this perfect and came in a timely manner. Definately need to repurchase a second rack!</li>
    <li> Thanks the nail polish rack is perfect and is even bigger than my expectations were!!!I am going to buy more nail polishes now!!!</li>
    <li> Just got this nail polish rack in the mail and it was very quick delivery. Also the display is great for holding all my nail polish colors for me to see every time I pass by it in my room. Easy to install on the wall as well although I have to be honest my husband put it up because I am not very handy. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this- I can finally stop buying duplicates of polish because I can see at a glance what I own!&lt;br /&gt;Previously I never remembered what I had so Id get 3 of the same color from different brands...I had nailpolish stashed in 3 different drawers where they would roll around and were hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;This is fantastic and I am very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I used a drill to drill a smaller hole in the wall, put in the anchors, then held up the rack and screwed the screws into the anchor with the drill. I couldnt get the screws into the anchor without a drill (I tried).</li>
    <li> The rack was easy to assemble and perfect for my needs.  I may need to buy another one soon!  Thanks</li>
    <li> I thought the price point was right, so I went ahead and purchased this... Great decision!&lt;br /&gt;Not all my polishes fit, but a decent amount do!&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy, easy to hang, and good size!</li>
    <li> I have a huge personal collection of nail polish, so when I saw this rack I had to have it. It looks exactly as advertised. Great price!</li>
    <li> Love it! Cheapest nail polish rack that holds this many bottles I&#x27;ve found. Easy to hang, a lot bigger than I was expecting. I have around 80 bottles in mine so far, so i&#x27;ll need a new one soon. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this same one.</li>
    <li> I have written a review about my nail polish rack and have since deleted it. All of my concerns were immediately responded to by the company and a new rack was shipped to me. My first rack wasn&#x27;t in a condition to be put upon my wall. I wrote the company via Amazon and always had a response within a day. They replaced my rack as soon as I sent them pictures of the damage. I can&#x27;t say that putting my nail polish on my wall was completely worth almost 50 bucks, but if you feel that it is, definitely go through this company. I have nothing but nice things to say about them. They really were wonderful.</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack is not worth your money. Mine came totally broken and all the acrylic joins look very messy and poorly put together. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> she can&#x27;t wait to fill up another one, 2 screws and 96 bottles of polish on the wall,no more digging through that bag.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish rack. All of my bottles fit with not problem. I have multiple brands. I found it to be spacious. I have am so pleased to be able to see all of my nail polishes before I start my manicures. I found colors I forgot I had. This was really simple to hang. The screws and anchors were included. It shipped quickly, no damage. Packaged well!I could definitely see myself gifting this to all of the other beauty fanatics in my life.  It also came with a nail polish station sign which I chose not to hang, but my daughter loved it. No regrets with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife. It will hold a ton of nail polish bottles. She loves it. As long as she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> The product is good and sturdy. The only problem is there were no screws to hang it up with and the glue was visible where they put the rack together but once you put your polish in, you won&#x27;t notice it at all. Overall, I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to others. It is a great product to house my nail polishes in one place. It is light weight and easy to hang. Love it.</li>
    <li> Holds all our nail polish colors where we can easily see them. We are very pleased. Product arrived quickly and in tact.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will definitely consider buying from this seller again. It came very well packaged and protected and was pretty simple mounting. My nail polish has a very nice way to be displayed and much more organized than before.</li>
    <li> i had enough nail polish to fill all but one rack on this shelf. it is a nice size fits all my name brands to store brands with no problem. I have even put some of my lotion bottles on the top shelf. sits nicely on my dresser out of the way, haven&#x27;t tried to hang it since we live in a apartment, maybe when we get a house. not a scratch was on it when received</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s nail polish collection,  the real came early and as usual Tyger was no damage. This makes the 14 th rack, these will organize and display any polish any bottle shape. They are a breeze to put up and if you need more than one they make an impressive display.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I have a massaive collection of polishes. Looks great, holds great, easy to install. Almost filled up and I will be purchasing another one when I do.</li>
    <li> Just like a nail salon would have.  Easy to hang on the wall.  Has a &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; written in red piece for the top.  This was not described in the product information, but you don&#x27;t have to hang up that piece if you don&#x27;t wish to.</li>
    <li> These things are SO expensive for what they are.  They are just cheap wall racks.  Unfortunately, they ARE universally high-priced.  That being said, these cheesy little racks are exactly what I needed.  I have a LOT of polish and it is all beautifully displayed now.</li>
    <li> I have to say that when first deciding on a wall shelf choosing was difficult.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise this was very sturdy and of great quality and very easy to put up taking only a few minutes.  if in the future I need another, I know I would choose the same.&lt;br /&gt;For delievery, it arrived only a couple days after I ordered it in professional safe packaging.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. It arrived ready to hang on the wall and it has an additional sign that says Nail Polish station in red that you can add to it if you want</li>
    <li> My girls have already filled this one up - I think I might need to purchase a second one!! Very well made and arrived packaged well for safety.</li>
    <li> The quality of the product was as good as I had hoped. It hung easily with included anchors and screws. There are only two holes in the top to hang it from. It came with an acrylic sign that says &amp;#34;polish station&amp;#34; with a little flower on each end of the wording that can be hung above the rack. Cute, but I didn&#x27;t use it. I was able to fit 104 bottles of polish on my rack since it is mostly a mix of large bottles and the mini sizes bottles (two rows of minis, three rows of OPI size bottles, and one row of odd sizes). I could fit 21 mini OPI bottles or 15 regular size OPI (or Orly) bottles in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display really looks pretty cool full of colorful polish bottles. I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ll be able to see what colors I have to choose from the next time I paint my nails without digging around in boxes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of polish bottles I highly recommend ordering this rack. You will not regret it! I will definitely be ordering a second one!</li>
    <li> Holds everything I need it to, will probably buy another. Absolutely love it! It&#x27;s sturdy, well made and easily made personal.</li>
    <li> Perfect for organizing my nail polish. Normally I just have my polishes in a tub but now I can see all my colors.</li>
    <li> This thing is so pimp. Keeps all my bottles organized and out if reach of my 3 year old. Best purchase everrr</li>
    <li> PERFECT STORAGE UNIT FOR INSIDE MY CLOSET DOOR. I  USE IT FOR STORAGE OF NAIL POLISH, COSMETICS, ETC! JUST GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of polish and have always kept it in a basket.  Whenever I go to use it, I have to sort through it.  Now I get all my polish right in front of me to choose from.  It&#x27;s easy to pick one and they&#x27;re organized.  I love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> ive been looking for a good quality walll rack and this is it. fast shipping, did not come damaged and does the job very well. I need 2 more :)</li>
    <li> I own about 5 of these and keep repurchasing. They are very sturdy and perfect for lots of polishes!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my daughter--she has all her nail polish so organized now--it looks great &amp; the quality was superb:)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find a complaint at all, and I really don&#x27;t know what people are complaining about. It came to my front door securely wrapped and it is perfect on my wall. It is already assembled and easy to nail onto the wall. My nail polish collection is now beautifully displayed. This is the perfect cheap nail polish rack. Everybody has been telling me my wall looks straight out of a salon. :) I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these nail racks cuz I figured I would need a second one soon anyway n thought I&#x27;d save a couple bucks on shipping by ordering 2 as opposed to ordering one now n ordering another later n have to pay full shipping for it separately.. Glad I did that :) I was impressed with how quickly I received my package, ordered it on Monday, received it 2 days later on Wednesday early afternoon. I also loved how they label the package as \\&quot;GLASS - please handle w/ care.\\&quot; They packed it well w/ 1\\&quot; styrofoam walls all around the rack.. Front, back, top, n bottom. They even then taped the 2 boxes together so I felt that helped it even more. The racks themselves r pretty straight forward, nothing heavy or heavy duty acrylic, but I would say that&#x27;s a good thing cuz I wouldn&#x27;t wanna have to much weight to the racks themselves, as I will be weighing it down quite a bit w all my glass bottle nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essie -  holds 17 per row&lt;br /&gt;OPI - holds 15 per row w/ an extra 1\\&quot; to spare (1 bottle of Essie fits in this gap perfectly)&lt;br /&gt;Nicole by OPI - holds 14 per row, u have to place these bottles sideways as due to the weird shape of the Nicole bottles, it does not quite fit perfectly face-forward (I do think it looks fine this way tho, n I am a pretty OCD person lol but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that they&#x27;re sideways)&lt;br /&gt;Orly - 15 per row&lt;br /&gt;China Glaze - 14 per row&lt;br /&gt;Deborah Lippmann - 16 per row&lt;br /&gt;Butter London - 13 per row, if face-forward&lt;br /&gt;Butter London - 16 per row, if placed diagonally&lt;br /&gt;Chanel - 17 per row&lt;br /&gt;Marc Jacobs - 9 per row, if face-forward&lt;br /&gt;Marc Jacobs - 13 per row, if placed diagonally&lt;br /&gt;Red Carpet - 17 per row&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear - 19 per row&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen Complete Manicure - 14 per row&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen InstaDry - 14 per row&lt;br /&gt;Revlon - 15 per row&lt;br /&gt;Revlon Colorstay - 17 per row&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal - 18 per row&lt;br /&gt;Pure Ice - 16 per row&lt;br /&gt;Sensational GEL polish - 20 per row&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t put my rack up yet, was saving it for this weekend but will update my review as to how well it holds up n if it&#x27;s stable n seems to support the weight of all my polishes.  I plan on using anchors first, then screws&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE: I&#x27;ve placed the anchors n screwed in/put up the nail polish racks.  I put up one, then I put up the second one directly under the first one.  Racks are strong n steady n stable :)  They seem to hold up all the weight of all my polishes just fine!  Again, I strongly recommend u use anchors, not just screws as the anchors will really assist in holding up the weight of ur polishes along w/ the rack! :) ***br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t put my rack up yet, was saving it for this weekend but will update my review as to how well it holds up n if it&#x27;s stable n seems to support the weight of all my polishes.

    <li> My daughter fit all her bottles on here. now she wants more finger nail polish. Hung this up on her bedroom wall it was very sturdy. The best christmas present ever</li>
    <li> PERFECT!!! Holds tons of polish… Great organization piece~!!!</li>
    <li> Met expectations!  Very nice for organizing and keeping track of the colors you have.  Sturdy.  I did not receive screws with it but I had some already. Well packaged as well.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a surprize and got the clutter out of my way.LOL She  loves it and is better then exspected.</li>
    <li> I loved this! Came well packaged and looks beautiful hanging in my beauty room!</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack is great to see the nail polish collection one has and to see the selection of colors.. Quite sturdy.. it survived my apt moving.. and is still going strong..</li>
    <li> I wanted to have a place to store my polish collection and I wanted it to feel like the nail salon. This purchase was perfect!. My husband mounted it on the wall easily.  It&#x27;s made of a sturdy plastic or acrylic.  My polishes of all sizes fit great!</li>
    <li> I got 2 of these and i absolutely love them. I can only fit 14 bottles of OPI on each rack, not 15 like some people say they can. I have a lot of different brands of nail polish and with both of my racks, I can fit well over 200 bottles. I hung them over top of each other instead of side by side and I think they look awesome! See my photo...</li>
    <li> Love my nail rack ! It&#x27;s so nice &amp; my package arrived very quickly, faster then my smaller packages also !&lt;br /&gt;Its really cute, it&#x27;s completely clear . Looks acrylic and it hangs up nicely ! Great purchase . * purchase nails *</li>
    <li> Nice simple rack at a great price. Absolutely recommend as long as you don&#x27;t mind possibly having to make a minor modification. It only has two screw holes at the top for mounting to the wall. It only took about a dozen bottles of polish before the weight made the screws start to come out of the wall. I very carefully (so as not to crack the plexiglass) drilled two more screws into the bottom corners, and now it holds a hundred bottles no problem.</li>
    <li> Was a  christmas gift for my daughter &amp; she  loves it. She organized it right away &amp; cant wait to add more polish to it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product</li>
    <li> This is perfect for what I was looking for &amp; even better than described for quantity if you use a lot of brands that are the size of Julep polish. You can get 4 of those in each spot that you would have a normal size bottle. So I can fit 360 bottles of Julep into it.Will be buying 4 more for polish &amp; about 6 for some of my cosmetics too!</li>
    <li> When I recieved this,I was really excited, but then really disappointed when you could see the glue from where it was glued together. It&#x27;s not like it was just a little spot either, it was a lot.</li>
    <li> I love it! Fast delivery and great organization for all my nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;Fits all different brands and sizes.  Definitely a must have, especially for all my fellow nail polish junkies!</li>
    <li> Good rack, it is my daughters prized possession. We hung it on her wall with a piece of fancy wrapping paper behind it.</li>
    <li> Item came and was broken ... Also no supplies given for hanging</li>
    <li> I installed this on the interior of my hall closet. It&#x27;s so awesome I bought another one! Great price as well.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! I buy the good stuff and it looks wonderful on my wall. It&#x27;s so nice to see all the colors,, simplifies choosing.</li>
    <li> I love it... I buy 7 of those</li>
    <li> So cute!!! I love it!</li>
    <li> great just as advertised it also holds 90 bottles just like it says it does keeps all the nail polishes organized great product</li>
    <li> It fits my bathroom perfectly I love it</li>
    <li> I use this rack for storing Citadel and Vallejo paints for painting plastic miniatures. Even the larger Vallejo wash bottles fit easily. Takes up minimal room. Out of the box fully assembled with 4 pre drilled holes. Quality construction and very sturdy. A++</li>
    <li> super fast shipping, great packaging, great price and great nail polish rack, very steardy and well made, really holds 90 bottles or more, i love it.</li>
    <li> Great buy! This nail polish rack was just what I needed! It was very easy to install on my wall! Good quality!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. Best gift I ever purchased! It is really well made, hangs easily, and looks amazing. She was thrilled and so was I.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for each of my daughters and they are ecstatic about them!&lt;br /&gt;You can see the glue where it as put together on the edges of the shelves but they are sturdy and once you put your polishes in them all you see is the polishes!  It looks great!</li>
    <li> broken when it arrived.  very poorly made would not recommend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything I wanted. It came cracked at first but then they sent me a new one right away and it&#x27;s hung up and perfect! Great customer service! I&#x27;m ordering another one :)</li>
    <li> Just ordered this on Tuesday and it arrived Saturday.  It&#x27;s super thick sturdy plastic, not frail or flimsy like it looked it could be from the picture!  I&#x27;m very impressed, and definitely buying another!</li>
    <li> Love this rack!!!! I put my polishes, eye shadows, and pigments in it!</li>
    <li> It is not white it is almost yellow plastic and the front line where you put your nail polish is to small I sent it back</li>
    <li> Alright, so this item arrived yesterday. Fast shipping. I ordered this June 28th at night and received my package July 3rd in the am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression is that the rack itself is sturdy. The clear acrylic gives you clean lines. I really like the look of this rack. Some glue seams can be seen where the acrylic pieces are attached, but that is to be expected, it is made out of CLEAR acrylic!!! 2 attachment holes near the top of this rack. I was iffy about how secure this rack would be with all my polish on it, but no worries, the 2 screws at the top are more than enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon closer look, I noticed the top shelf was not set all the way when the glue was wet, so it slid down just a bit. You can&#x27;t really notice it from a front view but you can from the side. &#x3D;( This is why I put 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have various different brands on the rack and was able to fit 109 polishes! The title of this product says holds 90, the box said 96, and I fit 109! It truly does depend on the size of the container/bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps all the nail polish organized! I am loving it! Plan on buying 3 more to help me organize all my polish!!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I needed a solution for my growing nail polish collection and this is such an easy way to store everything and make sure I can see my polishes. The only problem is that I need another one already!</li>
    <li> I love this product and it was a steal! I had read negative reviews of it previously, however, I had no issues...it does what it says...holds nail polish.</li>
    <li> So happy with this nail polish wall rack. Very good quality! Has a nice modern and sleek look to it.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased that I made this purchase. The worst part was the wait!! It arrived in perfect condition and was with out flaw. My only problem is having the inventory to fill it. ;) But I would recommend this to anyone interested in purchasing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading many great reviews. I just received it. It arrived a lot sooner than I expected, and that was wonderful. However, after taking it out of the packaging, there are already several things I would complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to review items, but I base my purchases on reviews and figured I should share my initial thoughts on this product since I based my own purchases on other&#x27;s reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glue that was used is so visible on the connecting pieces, but I have not mounting and loaded the rack yet, so maybe the visible glue will be hidden by the polishes. Also, the acrylic has odd buffer marks and marks that look like fingerprints. I read a review about the appearance of fingerprints. It looks like something that has been buffed into the acrylic? It won&#x27;t come off with any amount of rubbing, windex, oil, ...anything. Again, this may be less apparent after mounting and filling the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a separate piece that says, &#x27;Polish Station&#x27; with little flowers on either side. This just isn&#x27;t my style and I&#x27;m very glad that this is an optional feature. When lining up the holes on the shelving unit and the signage, it appears that they don&#x27;t line up. Maybe they do, I shall find out soon enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be premature on rating this item, but I am just giving an initial judgement. I&#x27;ll probably return with a better evaluation after mounting and loading it with my collection of polish, and I mean, really, it&#x27;s got to be better than my cardboard box my lacquers are currently calling home.</li>
    <li> This rack was just what I wanted... Didn&#x27;t know I had 80 bottles of nail polish!!! But I did, anywho they all fit and still have room for a few more. I will have to order another!!! Installing very very simple, went up in less then 5 minutes!!! Well worth my twenty bucks!!!</li>
    <li> A quarter of an inch doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal until you are trying to get an OPI Kardashian Kolor into your rack. While some fit sideways, some of them do not. It&#x27;s an odd shaped bottle, but pretty common so I imagine more people will be reporting this problem. It&#x27;s SO CLOSE to fitting, but it just doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rack is described as being 2\\&quot; wide, that is just not the case. It is barely 1.75\\&quot; wide. I&#x27;m repeating myself now. I tried to tell them the description was wrong and I&#x27;d like to return the item as it doesn&#x27;t fit my polishes. I received it less then 30 days ago, but they keep closing my return ticket saying technical problem solved. If your polish will fit on a 1.75\\&quot; shelf (a little more like 1.5 for the interior floor of the shelf), then this could work for you. It doesn&#x27;t for me. That&#x27;s a $40 lesson learned the hard way, but they&#x27;ve been such a pain closing my return that I honestly think I&#x27;d keep in instead of returning in exchange for removing my review. It&#x27;s worth $40 to keep someone else from making the same mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, the rack is less smooth curve at the top (as pictured) and more angular. ALSO, there is white where the plastic has been cut/shaved or something in a messy fashion. Both things I could have quietly lived with if the rack had been as wide as described. Argh.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! Wanted to get something to display/organize fingernail polish in my 16 yo daughters bathroom! Perfect!</li>
    <li> SO SO SO SO SO happy with this. Yes the glue shows like people mentioned earlier but the price was right and it&#x27;s a nice addition for my room and it keeps the polishes orderly and neat. LOVE THIS.</li>
    <li> I am a nail polish addict. I have seen many acrylic polish racks and this one is BY FAR the best. I have purchased two of these to hold all of my polish. It comes with screws and anchors and is super easy to install.</li>
    <li> Received shipment early and service was awesome and I would do business with them again in the future! I would reccommend this company to all!</li>
    <li> No complaints here.  This thing is very sturdy and even held up to me accidentally drilling to much without cracking.  Holds all my polishes perfectly, even the odd sized ones.  Loved it so much I bought another one.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail polish rack!! Bought it for my daughter for a gift, she has over 100 bottles and it works great!! It holds more polish then it says guess it depends on how big polish bottles are. Light weight and easy to hang on the wall.  Going to buy another one very soon.</li>
    <li> Nice. Could be cheaper. My was cracked when arrived. Had to return and reorder.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect. Just want to say that this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price.  Received this wall rack quickly and undamaged using my Amazon Prime account for an excellent price.  The plastic is clear and durable, easy to mount on the wall, holds tons of your nail polishes, acetone and nail files.  I&#x27;ve had this case for about 8 months and have zero complaints.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great way to display nail polish</li>
    <li> i first saw these racks on youtube and at the time i didn&#x27;t have much nail polish, and whatever little nail polish i had was in a medium sized make up bag&lt;br /&gt;as the collection grew larger so did the bags and i ended using a tote for my nail polish&lt;br /&gt;even though it was see through it was very hard to see all the colors so i made the decision to finally buy&lt;br /&gt;it was delivered quickly but i did not mount it right away&lt;br /&gt;now that i did mount it i&#x27;m wondering why i didn&#x27;t do it sooner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at first i was suspicious about the two screw that are supposed to hold the weight of the plastic rack and over 90 bottles of polish but they do the job&lt;br /&gt;the rack is a very good quality and very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;it comes in one piece of course and the packaging was great&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely recommend it to anyone with a storage problem and lots of polish</li>
    <li> Works great for holding paint for warhammer.</li>
    <li> This holds and displays my nail polishes perfectly (I have a lot of nail polish) and it was very easy for my boyfriend to put up for me, haha. I am only giving it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really worth what I paid for being somewhat flimsy. It&#x27;s not going to break or anything but still looks cheap. I do recommend getting it because its the best option. I just wish it were maybe $10 less.</li>
    <li> This rack has helped me out a great deal when it comes to organizing my polishes.  I always kept them in a drawer.  It was cumbersome to dig through the drawer to find my polishes.  I would organize the drawer but it would get messed up every time I needed to search for a polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rack is sleek in design.  I didn&#x27;t use the sign it came with since I am using it at home.  It was easy to hang up.  There was a couple small abrasions to the surface of the acrylic but nothing noticeable while hanging on the wall.  I like how this saves room in my makeup storage.  I was able to use that drawer for all my blushes and bronzers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the purchase.  Only thing is, my polish collection is bigger than I thought it was and I will be needing a second shelf sooner than I thought;.</li>
    <li> I simply love this rack so much that I purchased 4 in total at different times. It can hold a lot more than it states depending on the size of the bottle. It is very sturdy and I like the fact that you can either hang it on your wall or have it on your vanity. Great product and do recommend it to others that have a lot of nail polishes or are just simply looking for a storage unit. This also hold MAC prodcuts wonderfly as well.</li>
    <li> This rack is very sturdy and holds all sizes of bottles, even the larger bottles such as OPI.  It literally took me only a few minutes to install it.  I installed my rack on the inside of my bathroom closet door that is a hollow core door.  I just held it up and screwed in the screws that were provided and it was on the door solidly.  I thought I had a lot of nail polish.  But, this rack holds so many bottles that I felt like I needed to go buy more because my rack was only about half full.  Now, my nail polish is organized by color and I can see all of my choices in a glance.</li>
    <li> The nail polish rack is great.  The quality is great-it is sturdy and easy to put up on the wall.  We want another one!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this nail polish rack. It has unfortunately encouraged me to collect even more nail polish though. LOL</li>
    <li> I own many different types of nail polish including OPI, Essie, NCLA, Sally Hansen, Julep, Color Club, Sinful Colors, Spoiled, Orly, China Glaze, Ulta brand, etc. and they all fit perfectly. I actually just ordered a second one because this wall rack is the perfect storage keeping my collection looking clean and organized. Its all great for maintaining the integrity of the polish itself. A must have for any girly girl who loves her nail polish.</li>
    <li> Although I think it was a bit pricy. I searched and searched for something like this, with no luck!! This is a great product and the material seems resistant and classy (not cheap looking) It holds pretty well in place and it has a type of &amp;#34;tittle board&amp;#34; made with the same material titled &amp;#34;polish station&amp;#34; Looks very pretty and girly. However it&#x27;s optional if you want to hang it or not. I did because I put it behind my bathroom door where it won&#x27;t bother me every time when I pass by...Overall great product and shipped fast and packaged well!! Very easy to hang too. I suggest buying in home depot a stronger wall anchor like those that you drill into the wall, not for this particular product, but from experience I&#x27;ve had many things fall with time using the small skinny wall anchor the products bring in the box! Wouldn&#x27;t want to find a mess of broken nail polishes all over the fall! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This holds all the nail polish I have. I didn&#x27;t quite have 90 bottles so I&#x27;m not sure if it will hold exactly 90 but it holds different size bottles and looks sturdy mounted on the wall.</li>
    <li> Durable and strong . love it . price was worth it. Fits every size of nail polish . Easy set up</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to hang on the inside of a linen closet. It is perfect! Note, I did not attach the \\&quot;polish station\\&quot; topper. This is a great way to organize nail polishes...and I also placed other small lotion bottles/items on the shelves as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good buy and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Product came on time, packaged very well and looks great on my wall at work.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I installed it on the back of my bathroom door .  It gives me the capability to see all my nail polish at one time.  I don&#x27;t have to keep moving bottles around to se what color I want to use,  It definitely suits my needs.</li>
    <li> I love having easy access to my nail polish. It does not take up a lot of space and looks good on the wall.</li>
    <li> Great product! Meets my needs! Polish fits perfect! Clear holder blends in well with walls at work! A must buy!</li>
    <li> I have, apparently, way too many nail polishes. This was the best way for me to see them so that I didn&#x27;t end up just using the same 3 or 4 shades each time. I love that I can see them all at once. Most of my nail polishes are Essie or Sally Hansen, with a few OPI and China Mist, and all fit well. I even had some extra space so I could put my few embellishments and tools on one shelf. The hardware is sufficient, and I chose not to use the sticker that came with it.</li>
    <li> This is a cute and efficient way to store polish if you have a lot of it like me. It&#x27;s nice to be able to see all of my colors at once without fumbling through containers.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I haven&#x27;t filled it up, so I don&#x27;t know if it will hold 96 bottles. It comes assembled. You just need to nail it to the wall. I liked it so much that I bought one for my BFF as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 of these wall racks so far. It is a great way to display and organize an assortment of small items. Obviously nail polish fits great, I have OPI, essie, wHet and Gelish on mine now. It also fits Martha Stewart glitter like a glove. I have run out of room for all my glitter so i will be purchasing another wall rack.</li>
    <li> Just love my polish rack definitely a great buy. Holds even more polish depending on size of bottles.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail polish rack. Before buying this, i had all my polishes all over the place and now its so organized. Need to buy another rack though, not all my polishes fit.</li>
    <li> First off, I absolutely love my nail polish rack! What a fantastic way to display and easily find the perfect color for the next pedicure at home. Just hung it and it seems really sturdy, however I do not have it full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only downfall was that when I took it out of the box and inspected it, the bottom shelve was loose on one corner. Since I didn&#x27;t want to deal with sending it back and etc I super glued it. It wasn&#x27;t much to fix, but that shelf definitely was not useable without being glued. (Just hung it and letting bottom corner dry - I put lipgloss on the bottom shelf for now.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did come with the polish station sign, but I chose not to attach it. Not top quality, but for the price I paid I am very happy. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Looks nice and holds all the polish very nice, glad it was easy to hang.</li>
    <li> waited it seem forever to received  my nail polish rack it came  to my home scratched and look very used  so unhappy i payed my hard earned money for this</li>
    <li> I had so many bottles of polish in baskets and when I saw this item, I knew it was what I needed. It looks beautiful on my wall and looks like the wall in the nail shop. Now I know what I have. Great item!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Shipped quickly. You have the option to put the polish station sign up or use it without. I personally like it without the sign. Would purchase from here again. Bought two one for my neice and she loved hers too!</li>
    <li> This rack is great! I&#x27;m not using the top display sign but just the rack. No issue hanging, but I was careful not to overtighten the screws which could possibly risk cracking the case. 2 screws really are enough to hold (using anchors of course). Overall, it&#x27;s a great wall rack.</li>
    <li> So just had to say, this is the best thing I have bought from Amazon. They kinda lied about the 96 bottles, I got 131 in mine;) I just did have enough room for my regular polishes, not for my gels, will be buying one. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Super easy to install, I chose to not hang the &amp;#34;sign&amp;#34;, as they are in my bathroom for my personal use, but they are very good.  One of the racks had a slight crack, but not worth returning for me.  Can&#x27;t even see it with the polish in there.  Freed up a whole shelf in my linen closet and now I can see all the colors I have.  For anyone who collects nail polish, this is a great way to store them.</li>
    <li> I got my polish rack in the mail a couple weeks ago but finally put it up in the back of my closet the other day.  It was so easy to install and holds soo many polishes.  Great purchase! great price!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for anyone who has a large nail polish collection! It keeps them organized and easy to find your color!</li>
    <li> Holds many bottles of polish.  Holds many different sizes.  Great to display your polish and to see all colors without digging through a drawer.</li>
    <li> i love this product i used to keep all of my polish in a pink box that i got from hobby lobby and i didn&#x27;t like it so i had looked for nail racks and I bought this there is no asembilly execpt for mounting it on the wall. i have close to 65 bottles of nail polish and they all fit with two rows left over which i filled up with fake nails acetone...ect.i highly recomend this product</li>
    <li> What a terrific gift for the woman with multitudes of colors...fantastic seller, also! Transparent acrylic goes with any room decor.</li>
    <li> Holds all of my polishes! Great to see them all on display. Shelves won&#x27;t fit circular cuticle oil polish but other than that, its a winner.</li>
    <li> The only reason this rack gets four stars instead of five is because they had a hard time staying flush against the wall. Otherwise, they are perfect! I bought two and may get a third.</li>
    <li> There was no return address.  I wanted to return it,&amp;  there&#x27;s no sheet of paper, nothing that shows where to return this thing</li>
    <li> Great, speedy transaction! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that there was a picture of the nail polish rack on the outside of the box, and it was a Christmas present. My sister unfortunately saw it when it was delivered, and it spoiled the surprise. Other than that, no complaints! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I already owned one wall rack but recently decided to get a second one.  I had been stashing my extras on a shelf in my closet and got tired of never seeing them.  I filled up my second rack as soon as I hung it!  Looks like I will be needing a third one soon.  This is a great way to see all of your polishes and it adds color to the room as well.  Definitely a conversation piece!  If you are debating whether or not to get this or a storage unit for your polishes, I would say hands down get the wall rack! It fits all of my polishes, regardless of their bottle size.  Will buy this again when the time comes!</li>
    <li> Simple, wall mount. Does its job. Can hold many bottles although it did come with a clear sign that said Nail Polish Holder that you can mount on top if you want to, thats optional. It came earlier than expected and in perfect condition. Not broken at all.</li>
    <li> ...every nail polish is there to see / find exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. It holds all the brands of polishes I own. It&#x27;s sturdy, easy to hang. Every woman who loves nail polish should own one.</li>
    <li> It seems to be common for the products shelf to be crooked. I can&#x27;t try to adjust it myself in fear that it&#x27;ll snap. Save yourself disappointment and order it from somewhere you can get a warranty or replacement. It&#x27;s obvious the seller is selling these with knowledge of them being defective.</li>
    <li> It says \\&quot;up to\\&quot; 96, depending on the bottle size, I have about 60, and I filled up the first 3 rows! So it could hold more! :) very happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been searching for something like this for a couple weeks and stumbled on it on the amazon site.  It was exactly what I was looking for. Arrived in a couple days without any damage or delays.  I have it mounted on the inside of the door leading to my linen closet.  It comes pre drilled with two holes on the upper part, I drilled two more on the lower end for it to be a little more secure since I mounted it on a door.  If you prefer more than two screws to mount it, make sure you predrill the holes first or the plastic will crack.  Very happy with this item!</li>
    <li> What I expected however I didn&#x27;t realize I had so much nail polish so I will need to order another one in the soon future.</li>
    <li> Love the racks! I ended ordering 3 in total after the first 2 (I have way too much polish and love it). The racks are nice for the price and sturdy. It took my husband less than 5 minutes to hang them and I&#x27;m sure I could gave done it on my own. I love walking in my closet and seeing all my colors. I&#x27;ve seen different racks on eBay that looked a little more shinier but these were more affordable. I&#x27;d recommend this rack to anyone, just make sure you use the stud finders so your rack won&#x27;t fall!</li>
    <li> Beautifully finished, well made and very well priced!  Love the way clients can see all of the colors at a glance.  Looks very professional.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase for this shelf--not because the first one wasn&#x27;t great...I just have too many nail polishes! Easy to put up, not too expensive, and a great way to organize your polishes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manicurethis.com :)</li>
    <li> This nailpolish rack is amazing it looks like the ones in the nail salon and its huge and fits all my nailpolish! I loveeeeeeeee itttttttt and it only took a few days to arrive :D yayyy! &lt;3</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;ll start by saying, I&#x27;m not going to lie, it is not perfect. It arrived in a timely manner and the packaging was fine. However, the quality of appearance was horrible. A few shelves on the rack had lips (the edge part of the shelf that holds the polishes in place) that were glued on unevenly. So my thicker polish bottles had to be placed somewhere else on my rack (not arranged according to color as I preferred). With that said, my goal was to find an inexpensive rack to store my polishes, and this rack met that criteria. It is very sturdy. It comes with wall mounting materials and it can easily store many bottles of polish. The plus side to the negative initial appearance is that the rack is made of clear acrylic so once the polishes are on it, you can&#x27;t even notice the imperfections. Overall I love it and am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This rack was everything I wanted. It was shipped fast, was easy to mount, good quality and holds a good amount of polishes.</li>
    <li> Just what my daughter and I were looking for to display our polish collection!  No more buying a shade that we already have or wondering where that bottle of just the right color is hiding in the closet!  The price was great too!!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a way to keep all their polish bottles in one place, ready to use!</li>
    <li> I received the nail polish rack today as a birthday present. I bought two of them since I have over a hundred bottles of OPI nail polish. It was packaged well and came to me in good condition. But when I went to put my bottles of nail polish on the rack, I found that each row could only fit 14 bottles of OPI nail polish, not 15, meaning the rack only holds 84 bottles, not 90. I tried it with both racks and on different shelves but could not force the last bottle to fit. I am returning this item because it looks poor with a small space at the end of each row. If you are looking for an item that holds 90 bottles of nail polish this is not the one. I hope the seller updates the listing to be less deceptive.</li>
    <li> This was amazing just what I needed can&#x27;t wait to get another one soon.. I ended up getting 102 bottles of nail polish on this rack</li>
    <li> just what granddaughter needed for her polish.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my essential oils. Perfect all the way around.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Purchased the same one about 2 years ago to organize, store and display my personal nail polish collection. Very sturdy and holds a lot of bottles different shapes and sizes. This Is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased since my collection of nail polish has since grown since I bought the first one. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, but I got it out of the box and the whole rack was shattered. Its made out of a pretty flimsy plastic and is kinda cheap looking in person. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, you&#x27;re better off going without it.</li>
    <li> Came just as discribed and my granddaughter loved it since she has so much nail polish....did have a small blemish on the acrylic but still doesnt affect the product...</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend with anyone with a lot of nail polish who like to see what they have.</li>
    <li> It was a good quality product...This rack was exactly as it was described.. Easy to install.  Very satisfied.  Excellent Product choice.</li>
    <li> I have three of these rack. Two are bigger than this one but this one completely did the same awesome job as my other two. I hate not being able to see what colors or brands I have. But now I can see my colors and brands. I will be ordering another one very soon.</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments about this.  I hung it on the wall with some 3M picture hanging strips instead of putting holes in the wall and it has held up great!</li>
    <li> Perfect, sturdy, exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Got mine within a week. I was super excited to get mine, however when i open the box, i&#x27;ve noticed the last row of the nail rack broke.</li>
    <li> it is really cute and sturdy. all my polishes fit perfectly. might even buy another one. when screwing in the screws might want to put a washer so not to break the plastic</li>
    <li> love it .....  clears up a lot of clutter</li>
    <li> I love how sturdy this shelf is and the sleek professional look it gives. I was able to hang this myself in less than 5 minutes! I will be ordering on for my niece&#x27;s birthday soon!</li>
    <li> Very happy the product is very sturdy I can see all my nail polish I actually need to purchase another one.  I love doing my own nails and having my daughter do my designs,  My granddaughters love it to so I will be giving the Nail Polish Wall Rack as gifts.</li>
    <li> Great organizer for all of your nail polishes, nail files/buffers, etc</li>
    <li> I was able to fit a little more than 96 bottles in mine, since I have polishes in different shapes and sizes. I was concerned about the fact that there are only two screws included for mounting, but it hangs pretty secure on the wall. It smelled a little weird out of the box, but the smell went away within 20 minutes or so. Over all I am extremely happy with my purchase, it is much easier to see all my colors at once now.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and great shipping!</li>
    <li> This rack is well made and the price was right.  However, I don&#x27;t use it to hold nail polish.  I have a boutique/ gift shop in Cold Spring, NY where I sell tons of jewelry and earrings.  I use nail polish racks to hold carded earrings and can fit nearly 100 pairs on a rack this size.  The cards fit perfectly over the edge of the shelves and makes a nice display.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have enough polish to fill up ALL the spaces, but it is very spacious. The top &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34; piece comes separate, and I like that because I preferred not to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue(s):&lt;br /&gt;- Did have what looked like scratch marks. I figured it would get that way anyway and with the lighting against my wall you can&#x27;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;- Only has 2 screws on top and nothing securing it on the bottom. Unless you have a child where they can reach this, it shouldn&#x27;t be a big problem. I just like to have it totally secure.&lt;br /&gt;- Nicole by OPI will not fit front-facing. It has to be sideways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months and it is awesome. Stores my nail polishes gray and my perfume roller balls and my hand sanitizers from Bath and Body Works!</li>
    <li> The nail polish rack is perfect. I see a little glue, but I&#x27;d rather have that because I know its secure. Seems sturdy, and it currently is holding 106 bottles. :)</li>
    <li> So easy to put up on wall 2 screws is all it took. Everything came with rack. looks nice and organized. I&#x27;ve got plenty of room to put new polishes and nail care stuff.  Came well packed and  on time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, it crossed the Nation and was at my door in only 4 days!!!! Opened it, mounted on wall then surprised wife with it. SHE LOVES IT!!!! Plenty of room for her polish collection with extra so I can buy her more..lol. Only complaint is that it arrived in manufactures box with description and picture of item clearly visible on delivery, so if wife had of been home surprise would have been spoiled.</li>
    <li> Came broken,  pre-drilled  holes weren&#x27;t spaced apart right to hit studs.</li>
    <li> it is big, and i didn&#x27;t have the space, but i put it on the vanity, and its ok, it holds all the polish</li>
    <li> I previously bought this item and just purchased 2 more of the same rack. The item looks great on the wall and fits every type of professional nail polish- OPI, Essie, China Glaze, Shellac etc. The only drawback was that it took almost 3 weeks to be delivered to my Salon. Otherwise, this is great for a Salon or home in order to organise/display nail polishes.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the nail polish rack!  I love that the bottles are no longer spread out all over her floor!</li>
    <li> I hung this rack in my makeup room and it gives it a salon feel.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I had so many polishes - I filled the rack with the polish I had a home!  I thought I would be able to buy more, but I have enough.  The bottles look so pretty!  I have them arranged by brand and then by color within the brand, so it really looks sharp!  The plastic is good quality, clear and sturdy.  It is easy to hang and my husband had it up in less than 5 minutes.  Excellent price for a great item.  The item arrived quickly and well before the estimated shipping date.</li>
    <li> Loved this nail polish organizer. I installed it on the inside of my linen closet and it came out great. Easy install!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my new nail rack. Finally I&#x27;m able to get my collection out of the drawer and onto the wall where I can see everything. It came with a &amp;#34;Nail Polish Station&amp;#34; sign that could attach. It looked a little nail shoppy, so I discarded it but if thats the look you&#x27;re going for it could be cute. Its very durable, comes with screws and anchors. 15 minutes and I was putting my polish in. Fits OPI, Essie, Orly and the like just fine. Nicole OPI bottles needs to be turned sideways to fit. All in all, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product. Acrylic is of a  good quality and well made.</li>
    <li> I already installed it in my daughter&#x27;s room. The only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the rack should come with 4 screws for installing the heavier piece. It comes with two for the upper light piece (only needs two good wall stickers), which could have been left to further support the lower heavier rack.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I got it for Mother&#x27;s Day and love it. It&#x27;s so nice to get them out of the box on the counter and to be able to see them all at a glance.</li>
    <li> I have to say this was packaged so damn good. You have a bunch of nail polishes in a bin or basket? then get this, it&#x27;s a great size and you just hang it with two nails on a wall where every you need it. Nail polishes decluttered. Great product. Will def recommend.</li>
    <li> It seems a little pricey to me for a plastic (acrylic) shelf but it&#x27;s perfect for holding nail polish and I love it.  I cannot believe how fast it filled up with bottles.  It&#x27;s perfect and I love it.  The clear plastic makes it easy to find the color I want.</li>
    <li> Wife LOVES these, but keeps filling them up...  She has 9 right now and is basically out of room...  WOW!  There&#x27;s enough nail polish to paint both of my cars - just kidding, but yeah, there&#x27;s a lot of nail polish.  And the racks are nice too.  Not over-the-top as they are see-through.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment,  however it arrived broken in two places.</li>
    <li> This product would have been great, except it was broken. The entire bottom half of mine was broken. I don&#x27;t think it was broken during shipping because there weren&#x27;t any broken pieces in the box, so I think it was broken then put in the package. I was really hoping this would be a great product. I had read other reviews that they had received there item broken as well, but I know that it is always a possibility of ordering something online. I would recommend purchasing a metal nail polish rack, it shouldn&#x27;t get broken during shipping, and is sturdy enough to hold some heavy nail polish.</li>
    <li> I did some research and ordered this rack after reading the reviews on Amazon. The delivery was super fast and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;It did have some minor scratches and I was able to see the glue in some spaces but with all the nail polishes on it looks perfect. Due the the material it is almost impossible not to see any scratches in the sun. It came with wall anchors but I just used the two screws and it is very sturdy and holds my 112 bottles of nail polish and I still have about 3 inches space. It lloks great in my bathroom and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this! Very sturdy and easy to hang on the wall. Happy I decided to buy this one.</li>
    <li> Such a cute way to display and hold all of my nail polishes. Every girl who sees it in my house loves it! The only downside is that it&#x27;s kind of cheap... Mine cracked in several places in the first week of use! But honestly, for the price it&#x27;s great, and even with the cracks in mine, it&#x27;s still functional.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to store my polish and doTERRA Essential Oils. It is a space saver on the wall behind a door .</li>
    <li> Incredibly easy to install and looks great! Holds all my polishes with room to spare. My friends are all jealous and want one for themselves!</li>
    <li> This came in handy, I had about 50 plus bottle of nail polish that was just laying around everywhere. When my husband bought brand new Ashley Furniture for bedroom he said Oooohh noooooo you need to get something for this polish lol. So we found this and it was perfect, I love it on my wall.</li>
    <li> I hung this on my bathroom wall to hold my YL Essential Oils. The bottles fit great in here. A different shelf also hold nail polish :) IT is a great organizer for small spaces.</li>
    <li> like the nail polish rack looks great with all the nail polish colors. it says it does&#x27;nt come with the additional piece that says polish station but mine did. which is cool i dont think id use it though. package came fast which was also great 👍</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite purchases. I use this to store my 5-15ml bottles of essential oils. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This holds like 90 bottles of nail polish. It hangs on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It accomplished both of these tasks admirably.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Well- packaged.</li>
    <li> My daughter has so many polishes they were cluttering up her dresser. It was just what she needed to get organized.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute B-E-S-T way to store reinkers including distress inks, ink pads, glimmer mists etc.  I have two of these that are almost completely full.  Love them.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this rack and spray painted it black and it looks great.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and I had no issues mounting it on the wall.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Check my blog for more picture &amp;#60;3  &amp;#60;3  https://www.facebook.com/Fashionnycb&lt;br /&gt;This post has been a long time coming as I organize all my MAC and Milani ‪#‎makeup‬ and ... well I say all, but I could have done with another nail polish wall display – Yes is for nail polishes but I’m using it for some of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the cutest way to organize your makeup and also to inspire a few of you looking for a good makeup storage solution........</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this.  It holds all her nail polish in one place.  Easy to hang up and very sturdy.</li>
    <li> OMG!  I love this wall rack.  I have seen these in salons and thought how perfect it would be to store my polish.  The box included the screws and drywall anchors for installation.  It was super easy to put up and if I keep buying polish, I will buy another to hang next to it :)</li>
    <li> Everything else fits its just Nicole by opi are shaped a little bulkier so they are kind of on lifted in the back a little they don&#x27;t lie all the way flat but they fit and it works. I have two am considering a third</li>
    <li> I have this filled up with my essie nail polish collection and it looks super cute. The only reason that it didnt get all five stars is because the plastic did have a few little scratches on it, but they were really not even noticeable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the rack for a month now, I think. It hold my collection and it works. I like it because it&#x27;s easy access to my polishes and it displays them.</li>
    <li> Went back and forth on purchasing this for a least six months now, constantly reading the views. Let me say I&#x27;m GLAD I did! My goodness. This is an awesome polish rack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came packaged nicely and upon opening it I saw a lot of Styrofoam and sturdy cardboard. This baby was safe from anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, good quality see through acrylic. Although it only comes with two screws to drill into the wall and mount it is very sturdy for all the weight of polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says 90 bottles in this description, 96 on the box when you receive the package, and I was able to fit 95 :p all depends on what brand! If it helps you to picture shape wise, I have a majority of China Glaze polishes (filled 2 3/4 rows). If you had a majority Sally Hansen X-Treme Wear or something... you could probably fit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am so glad I purchased this and will definitely be buying another.</li>
    <li> Built frame around display case came out great, makes a great gift</li>
    <li> Ordered for daughter&#x27;s collection. Looks great and holds many many bottles. I recommend it and it is easy to install too if you have a handy husband or are handy with tools.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of nail polish and this made it easier to see exactly what I had.  I just wish it held more.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, I absolutely love this rack. I am kind of obsessed with nail polish and have a LOT, I have all but one row filled. This rack is great for the price considering other ones are similar but cost more, and ebay as well, this one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far and I highly recommend it. I did notice a small bit of glue residue that other reviews were talking about it, but it&#x27;s minimal and doesn&#x27;t bother me because this is just put up in my closet, it&#x27;s not out in a salon where everyone can see it. It was delivered super fast too! It also came with a sign that says polish station, although I threw it in my recycling bin because I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s necessary for me. I think it&#x27;s well put together and sturdy and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> The only thing I can say about it is it did not include the nails like other reviewers stated. Thankfully, I had some on hand and was able to hang on wall easily. Nice simple wall rack, that serves its purpose well! May need another soon seeing as they can easily be hung right next to one another.</li>
    <li> Love it! Shipping was fast. Plastic was good and nothing was damaged. One thing everyone should know it does not come with anything to hang it with! Otherwise great purchase</li>
    <li> Love it!! I use to keep my nail polish in a box and I ended up breaking a few of my bottles. I ended up ordering another one of these shelves just because I buy a lot of nail polish. It holds different types of nail polish but the wider the bottles are it will not hold up the 96 like it says. But still very happy with it :)</li>
    <li> It is sturdy and it does come with a top panel that says &amp;#34;polish station&amp;#34; but you do not have to use it. Looks good and fit many bottles of polish. You can use the top rack for taller items.</li>
    <li> Love it! Just as advertised. Well made. Came well packed. Holds all of my polish and I have room left.</li>
    <li> Great item, easy to install, holds lots of polishes....I already need another one!  1 2 3 4 5 6 7</li>
    <li> We purchased this item for our teen daughter&#x27;s new room decor.  She is a nail polish fanatic, and likes to change her polish almost daily to match her outfit.  This was the perfect solution for the &amp;#34;bottles all over the floor&amp;#34; issue!  Now they are color coordinated on the wall, which adds a little flair and helps keep her room tidy - win/win!  Easy to hang and holds a lot of product.</li>
    <li> I might be needing a new one in the near future, as I own a lot of nail polish, but these are great if you prefer having wall racks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reached that point in my life where I have too much makeup to store the traditional way, so I needed this rack to start storing stuff on the walls. I don&#x27;t have nearly enough nail polishes to fill this entire 96-bottle rack, however this is FANTASTIC for storing smaller makeup items such as serums, moisturizers, lip products, and deluxe samples of perfumes, primers, foundations, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mounting is very easy; it comes with screws as well as a nifty (but tacky) sign advertising that it&#x27;s a Nail Polish Station...... in case you couldn&#x27;t figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rack itself is smooth and sturdy. I haven&#x27;t had issues with it falling off the wall or cracking or anything like that. Whether you&#x27;re a professional nail artist or just a cosmetics junkie like me, I think you could get so much out of this rack, and it isn&#x27;t too expensive either! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was so excited as soon as this purchase arrived at the door. The packaging was very professional and every piece arrived safely. It also had very fast arrival time. The only issue I had was that you can see. The glue where the makers have put together the walls of the rack. It looks legit on my wall though. It&#x27;s the perfect tool to store my nail polish with!</li>
    <li> This item is alot nicer then I thought it would be I haven&#x27;t hung it on the wall but look forward to seeing how it looks</li>
    <li> Is as described. Put together Cleanly (no excess glue). Packaged Perfect/No damage.&lt;br /&gt;Capacity: Total is very flexible, it all depends on bottle size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * It Will hold *&lt;br /&gt;ORLY nail polish - 15 per row - 90 Orly Bottles Total&lt;br /&gt;ZOYA nail polish - 17 per row - 102  total&lt;br /&gt;SALLY Hansen Xtreme Wear nail polish - 19 per row - 114 total&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Row Width:&lt;br /&gt;I didnt have any issues with the bottles fitting. The most snug fit was the ORLY polish .6 fl oz and even that had a 1/4 inch left</li>
    <li> I love this it looks amazing on my wall! I&#x27;m soo happy I bought one might buy another one! Amazing for the price! I sooo recommend it!</li>
    <li> I already have four! It is a great tool for a manicure to keep her work area nice and neat!&lt;br /&gt;Also, helps your clients to have a great vision of polish colors.. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great experience</li>
    <li> This is a great find for me.  I love it.  It holds all my polish and then some.  It&#x27;s awesome.  It looks great too.  Easy to hang up, mine came with a little sign that says &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34;.  I love it.  Great price too and it was packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I thought I needed the 90 bottle holder.  My rack looks so bare as I only filled up the top two rows!  The product and the shipment was perfect.  No issues with the rack or the seller.  The item came in a &amp;#34;fragile&amp;#34; labeled box.  Took the product out, hung it on my bathroom wall with two tiny screws and it is holding up well.  Having this to display, store, and organize your nail polishes adds a nice touch to your home.  I mainly have Essie, Sally Hansen, and Chanel polishes and all fit well in this rack.  Would recommend this product and seller.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Received item broken. Can&#x27;t be bothered to return it only because it&#x27;s too much of a hassle.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this item, it is sturdy and holds  a lot of polishes.  I like the clear, so it would look good on any wall.  The only downside to this is that it did not come with anything to hang it on the wall with.  The holes are there, but nothing to screw it into the wall.</li>
    <li> I love it.!! I will be ordering another in the near future.</li>
    <li> Had to return it. Came with a damaged carton and it was cracked in 3 places.</li>
    <li> Received this today and it will be going back on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in the poor quality of the materials and construction. This is not like the acrylic that feels smooth, looks like glass, is clear, and feels strong (like you get with Muji makeup cases). It feels cheap and thin, like it wouldn&#x27;t take much effort to snap. Also, the edges aren&#x27;t rounded or artfully put together--everything is just a straight cut and it&#x27;s very sloppily glued together. I guess I was expecting it to be one molded piece. I could live with how cheap it feels, especially since it&#x27;s just to hold my nail polish, if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it&#x27;s all cloudy and scratched. The unit came well packed in styrofoam, so I don&#x27;t think it got scratched in transit, I think it&#x27;s just poor quality. It&#x27;s hard to capture just how bad it looks in person on a cell phone camera, but I tried. And, yes, it still comes with a cheesy &amp;#34;POLISH STATION&amp;#34; sign, which I guess is for nail salons, but this would look terrible on the wall of a business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that the quality of these units had gone down from when s/he first ordered them. So, they might have been nice at one time. I&#x27;ll keep looking for a decent nail polish rack.</li>
    <li> I love the thinness and quality of this rack I was able to add a few more polishes. I purchased this to place behind my bathroom door and its perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 17 year old who has 60+ bottles of nail polish.  It is the same quality as the ones in the salon.  It was easy to hang on the wall, and it really does hold 90 bottles!</li>
    <li> I love this rack. I used to have my polish in the medicine cabinet stacked 2 deep so I had to move them around to find what I was looking for. This solved the problem. My husband mounted it on the back of a closet door. It is out of sight unless I need it.</li>
    <li> The seller was great! I accidentally had it shipped to my old address and after contacted them they called FedEx and got the address changed to my current place of residence. I still received it on the day they estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The racks are sturdy and made very well however, I would suggest the makers of the shelves add a third whole in the middle jsut so that there is extra support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when hanging make sure you use the anchors as when filled with all your polish it can get extremely heavy and end up damaging your wall or even breaking.</li>
    <li> I bought the Nail Polish Wall Rack for my Niece&#x27;s 30th Birthday and she loved it! I bought it over a month ago and did not open it, She opened on Thursday the 23rd and it was perfect! I thought that it was too big when I bought it. And when the package arrived at my home I was sure it was too big! Well the package was just packed so perfect that it was a lot smaller than I thought. She is putting it behind the bathroom door!</li>
    <li> On my fifth rack and I still need one more. I&#x27;m not ashamed.. Yep, I&#x27;m a polish addict.</li>
    <li> Product was great but arrived broken in 4 places.  Superglue &amp; clear shipping tape fixed it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it to store my beads.</li>
    <li> Love it.. I realized how little I had but it&#x27;s starting to fill up alot..there is enough space for different size bottles I even have acrylic paint bottles on the top and it fits.</li>
    <li> I recieved it within a week. I absolutely loveeeee it!!</li>
    <li> Displays my colors well for easy viewing ad retrieval. It is also sturdy</li>
    <li> Love this wall unit. It&#x27;s perfect and I might get another one!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it.  It looks great on her wall....the only problem is......we need to get another rack!!!!  She has 48 bottles left that she can&#x27;t put on the rack.  So we will be ordering another one!!!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I finally gave in and bought this product. I spent a lot of time searching at those already made as well as DIY nail polish shelves. This was MUCH easier to me. Plus it looks better. It is true to how many it holds. I have a mixture of small and large bottles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a gift thinking it would be a wonderful thing for someone who is coming home with new colors of nail polish every week.  It came with several large scratches and more than you can count small scratches.  I tried to return it which the seller was willing however it would have cost $13 to ship it back.  So I just would like to warn everyone that yes this will hang on the wall and hold tons of polish, but it&#x27;s not going to look great doing it...</li>
    <li> I received my order the next day. I was excited to open it up as soon as I received it because I&#x27;ve been storing my polishes in plastic bins and I couldn&#x27;t see the colors without having to take one out one by one. This way I can see which colors to throw out and which to keep. It came in a well packed cardboard box with foam and marked \\&quot;glass fragile\\&quot;. My stand is currently holding 104 bottles with room to spare for about 5 more. I do have some tiny polishes there so it holds a bit more than advertised. The Milani, Wet n Wild, Sally Hansen fit sideways to accommodate more. The Nicole by OPI does not fit well no matter what direction I move it. See the pics I uploaded. I&#x27;m not planning to mount this anywhere but decided on leaning it against the wall because it&#x27;s so heavy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, does the job and looks good doing it ! I took one star because some of the shelves are a bit tilted downwards which makes nail polish bottles don&#x27;t stand straight !</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> The shelve is exatly what I was looking for. It was big enough to hold all my polishes! I might have to get a second one and if I do I will be purchasing from the same place.</li>
    <li> Really like this rack. Bought it for my daughter to organize her nail polish. It went onto the wall very easily.</li>
    <li> Received order on time, no damages to the rack. However it didn&#x27;t come with screws to attach it to the wall.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of them, one of them was cracked and broken and the other didnt even come with the hardware.</li>
    <li> Perfect and holds all my nail polishes. Came packed up really nice as well.</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast, these are packed well, they look as the do in pick. The rack does come with mounting screws and such if you need. It will stand on its on on a shelf or table provided the table is steady It s not super stable standing on own but I have my on shelf against a wall with not screws and I haven&#x27;t managed to knock them over yet.</li>
    <li> Like others mentioned, when the rack is bare, you will see the glue residue. But that only makes sense since this is acrylic. Once  the rack is hung and you start filling the rack with your nail polish, you won&#x27;t even see the glue.&lt;br /&gt;My rack is FULL and I can tell it holds up steady. I liked it so much I ordered another rack.&lt;br /&gt;I also did my research and wasn&#x27;t able to find one with a better price (including shipping.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always tried to come up with creative ways to store my abundance of nail polish and I always ended up just having all my pretty colors sit on a shelf or in a basket. In August I decided that I should try ordering a wall rack and it was a fabulous decision! The shipping was fast and it came packaged well and in perfect condition. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better! I believe I fit around 80 bottles of polish on the rack so it does indeed hold a lot. The only reason I didn&#x27;t get to 90 was because I had some wide bottles like butter London. Even oddly shaped bottle like Nicole by OPI fit in this rack if you turn them slightly. I&#x27;m ordering a second rack now because I loved it so much and also the fact that it&#x27;s clear is nice because the polishes add the blast of color. It looks great on my grey walls and I&#x27;m excited for my second one !</li>
    <li> I read the mixed reviews but ordered this any way. It works perfect and seems solid. When it is full I&#x27;ll order another one.</li>
    <li> I love this display rack.  Too bad the first time they sent it broken.  It is very sturdy.  I love that it is clear so that my polish color is easy to see.  I love, love, love this item.</li>
    <li> Love it this is my second purchase. Its very sturdy i drilled it to the wall but i used my own screws cuz the one it comes with its kind of small. I drilled it to the beam for support cuz polishes do get heavy.</li>
    <li> This is my first nail polish rack and I love it! Heavy duty and fits all of my polishes (60-something), acrylic paints, brushes and everything else I use on my nails. Previously I had them all in a bag and this is so much more organized, easier and faster. Worth the money for sure!</li>
    <li> The product is great I had two loose shelf and contacted customer service but they needed photos and all kinds of stuff that I don&#x27;t have time for, so instead I&#x27;m just going to order another one and have my uncle look into fixing this one. I stored OPI polish and it only holds 14 per row&#x3D; 84 bottles</li>
    <li> I am pleased that this is bigger than I expected. It is quite wide and a good height as well. My nail polish is feeling right at home in this wall rack. Great value and product for the price.</li>
    <li> Depending on the size bottles that you have, they hold a lot, just got my 4th shelf, very happy so far!</li>
    <li> I love this wall rack so much that I have 2 of them. It holds my polishes pefectly. It&#x27;s not the fanciest, by any means, and you can see the glue in some spots but it&#x27;s simple and sturdy and gets the job done. I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the top shelf of the second one I ordered is glued a bit crooked, I would have normally given less stars for this but it&#x27;s my fault for not contacting the seller to replace (I had already destroyed the packaging when I noticed)</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
</ol>
