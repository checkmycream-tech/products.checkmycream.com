### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>excellent product, Makes my hair moist and managable.</li>
      <li>this is the best product for Keratin treated hair.  </li>
      <li>Plus the smell is wonderful and lasts forever!  </li>
      <li>good luck!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great deal for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure!!</li>
      <li>Even if your hair is not Karatined, this product is a good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved this product ever since I had a Brazilian blowout and was recommended this keratin product as maintenance care.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great and and it&#x27;s sulfite free.</li>
      <li>but it still worked nicely.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love these products!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the products-they were just as promised and arrived in a timely fashion.  </li>
      <li>They ended up being a better value than non-salon quality shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Way better value when you buy the 33.8 oz</li>
      <li>but this one is definitively the best one especially the conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since start of this year and couldn&#x27;t be happier more.</li>
      <li>Use this shampoo and conditioner for a year now, my hair never felt better and look nicer</li>
      <li>Works well the best I have used, a must try try especially if you color your hair.  </li>
      <li>I would not purchase anything more from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried other shampoos for my straightened hair; this one is the best for keeping it feeling great and for staying straight.</li>
      <li>Easy for air drying hair.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a while now and have been happy with it until my most recent bottle.</li>
      <li>So worth the money, I&#x27;ve told all of my friends to buy this product here!</li>
      <li>First time I&#x27;ve bought this size and I love the pump dispenser.  </li>
      <li>so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;ll never do the blowout again (loved the shine, resented the loss of volume!), this keratin product helps keep my thick tangle-prone hair under control.  </li>
      <li>Items arrived quickly and were very well packaged.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>love the product, when I get it from my local store.</li>
      <li>so I made sure it was the same manufacturer but to no avail.</li>
      <li>fast shipping, found exactly what I was looking for</li>
      <li>I do not think this is the real stuff.</li>
      <li>Also, price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real color care.</li>
      <li>this product is twice as much at the salons.</li>
      <li>When I started getting Keratin treatments, my stylist recommended that I get the Coppola products to help length in the life of my treatments, and it really does.</li>
      <li>I love this brand, so being able to find such big sizes for the same price as the smaller size was a huge bonus.</li>
      <li>If your hair are frizzy and needs taming, I would highly recommend you to give it a shot.</li>
      <li>and we both noticed it right away independently.</li>
      <li>There are not sulfites (spelling?), so my naturally curly hair is more tame.  </li>
      <li>I was concerned after reading reviews about what I was getting, but the product I received is exactly the same as what I was purchasing from my stylist.  </li>
      <li>It is the same shampoo and for the size of the bottle (large)</li>
      <li>The bottles had clearly been opened and masking tape was used to seal it.  </li>
      <li>Good products but expensive for what they are.</li>
      <li>I have thick fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have to use twice as much shampoo to get the same results; it is very watered down!</li>
      <li>Keeps your Keratin treatment alive for a long time!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure it is the right product.  </li>

    <li> This is not the real stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using Keratin Complex Color Care for over a year now and the product I received from this company is not a Coppola product!</li>
    <li> fast shipping, found exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Thanks! Love the products-they were just as promised and arrived in a timely fashion.  I&#x27;ll be ordering from you again I&#x27;m sure!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since start of this year and couldn&#x27;t be happier more. If your hair are frizzy and needs taming, I would highly recommend you to give it a shot. My hair are finally coming back to life after long period of time.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for a while now and have been happy with it until my most recent bottle. I have to use twice as much shampoo to get the same results; it is very watered down! Both my husband and I use it and we both noticed it right away independently. I noticed there are 2 different &amp;#34;designs&amp;#34; on the bottle (or a copy) and I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was going to get the same product so I made sure it was the same manufacturer but to no avail. Disappointing and I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the purple shampoo for getting rid of brassy tone.......my mistake. but the shampoo does not foam well so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean</li>
    <li> When I started getting Keratin treatments, my stylist recommended that I get the Coppola products to help length in the life of my treatments, and it really does.</li>
    <li> Keeps your Keratin treatment alive for a long time! Its a must! The treatment is costly and&lt;br /&gt;to et the longest life I recommend using these products. They work of me!</li>
    <li> The bottles had clearly been opened and masking tape was used to seal it.  The product is a watered down version of what I&#x27;ve purchased in the store.  I&#x27;m not sure it is the right product.  The store bought product kept my color and keratin straightening process.  A week in to using the product I noticed my color fading and the benefits of the straightening process ended.  I would not purchase anything more from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product, when I get it from my local store.</li>
    <li> Works well the best I have used, a must try try especially if you color your hair.  Easy for air drying hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and and it&#x27;s sulfite free.</li>
    <li> Caused skin irritation. Took months to narrow it down to this product. Research Keratin additive before purchasing to see if you are at risk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product ever since I had a Brazilian blowout and was recommended this keratin product as maintenance care.  While I&#x27;ll never do the blowout again (loved the shine, resented the loss of volume!), this keratin product helps keep my thick tangle-prone hair under control.  First time I&#x27;ve bought this size and I love the pump dispenser.  Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Tried other types of Shanpoo and Conditioners Sulfate-Free but this one is definitively the best one especially the conditioner. Also, price is reasonable. No doubt i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Way better value when you buy the 33.8 oz, I&#x27;ll never buy the small bottles again. Even if your hair is not Karatined, this product is a good.</li>
    <li> Good products but expensive for what they are.</li>
    <li> Items arrived quickly and were very well packaged. Product does not seen watered down like I read in other reviews. Would definitely buy this product from this company again.</li>
    <li> this is the best product for Keratin treated hair.  It is recommended by hairdressers and it does not leave your hair feeling sticky.  It keeps the keratin treatment longer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I wanted liter sizes of the shampoo and conditioner.  I was concerned after reading reviews about what I was getting, but the product I received is exactly the same as what I was purchasing from my stylist.  It&#x27;s the only product I will use on my keratin treated hair!</li>
    <li> The color of the bottle (blue) was not what I was expecting, I was use to the bottle being white. It is the same shampoo and for the size of the bottle (large) it&#x27;s a great deal for me. Now I won&#x27;t have to drive around town trying to locate some on sale. I will definitely do this again.</li>
    <li> This was not the brand as indicated!  The shipment was destroyed and would not replace the shipment unless I have shown proof; in which, I had to throw away the box due to the mess.  I will not ever buy a product from this company again!</li>
    <li> I do not think this is the real stuff.</li>
    <li> excellent product, Makes my hair moist and managable. I have dry coarse hair, this helps a lot. this product is twice as much at the salons.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real color care.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is very thick and coarse. Use this shampoo and conditioner for a year now, my hair never felt better and look nicer</li>
    <li> I received this product and it look&amp; feels like water. No lather Buyers beware. I wasted my money. It looks as if the shipper has mixed water.</li>
    <li> I have tried other shampoos for my straightened hair; this one is the best for keeping it feeling great and for staying straight.</li>
    <li> sold me this product expired!! but it still worked nicely.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite shampoo.  I have thick fine hair.  This product seemed to be too heavy for it.  It didn&#x27;t work well w/my hair so I gave it to a friend.  She seems to like it.</li>
    <li> These lasted me 5 months. They ended up being a better value than non-salon quality shampoo and conditioner. I love this brand, so being able to find such big sizes for the same price as the smaller size was a huge bonus.</li>
    <li> I chose 1 star because I am expected to submit a review on the product I actually received instead of ordered.  I ordered Coppola, which is the brand pictured and I would give it 5 stars.  I received smoothing therapy and I would give it zero stars if I could.  Just be forwarned that you probably won&#x27;t receive the Coppola product even though that is what is pictured on the order screen.  good luck!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this shampoo and conditioner brand for about a year now. I prefer to use the color care even though my hair isnt colored because I feel like it is gentler.</li>
