<li> Hard to find so</li>
<li> I purchased this conditioner to hopefully help with my dry, itchy, flaky scalp that can be so bad that I get sores on my scalp.  </li>

    <li> I purchased this conditioner to hopefully help with my dry, itchy, flaky scalp that can be so bad that I get sores on my scalp.  The conditioner smells nice and definitely calms my irritated scalp!  It does help a lot with the itching and burning of my scalp and does seem to cut down on the flakes, but unfortunately does not eliminate them completely. However it is a big improvement from other treatments claiming to do the same.  I use this  in conjunction with a scalp brush I also purchased here off of Amazon and the Nioxin Scalp recovery shampoo.  Even though I am not 100% flake free I will continue to use this treatment as it is the best I have found.  Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products for years, from neurtogena to high end products with little results.  Then a friend recommend this.  And it worked immediatley and it has a nice smell to it!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that will relieve my scalp. I find it very soothing, and it helps heal the skin. Completely satisfied with nioxin products.</li>
    <li> great product, works has well as it claims to. Hard to find so if you spot it I would grab it.</li>
    <li> Great for my dandruff and itching!</li>
    <li> I have had dry scalp issues and flakes for years.  This product has taken that all away!!!  Finally!  I have found what works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had scalp issues my whole life - this product makes life better.  I would recommend this to anyone with scalp issues.  I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
    <li> This has helped me with my dandruff problem like no other product has before. I got everyone on board with the Nioxin, truly worth every penny. My hair dresser did tell me that it is a great product but I will never be able to go back to another shampoo after using. That&#x27;s perfectly fine by me cause I don&#x27;t plan too.</li>
    <li> I love this product, quick send on a hard to find item. Anyone with dry scalp should try this product.  Did I tell you I love this product .</li>
    <li> Great product, at a great price. Just an easy worthwhile buy. I&#x27;m done reviewing but the site deems it necessary to write 20 wourd. So I have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, my expectations were met and I don&#x27;t regret this purchase. Happy I bought it. AJW</li>
    <li> This is a phoney.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I bought this for my wife and she is in tears!  I cannot return what I bought because it has already been opened!!</li>
    <li> I really like other Nioxon products, but this seemed to lack that quality and make dry scalp worse, won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Awesome conditioner for dry scalp &amp; dandruff !! Highly recommend this for anyone suffering from either or.  Thanks for the quick shipment!!</li>
    <li> Read my review under the Nioxin Scalp Therapy Shampoo.  This is an amazing product (used with the shampoo)!!  A God-send for my psoriasis!</li>
    <li> Love this product. The minty scent is light and lasts. The product is not harsh on color treated or dry hair. It hydrates my naturally curly hair well and leaves it feeling very soft. I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry scalp or dandruff.</li>
    <li> This item is a little smaller than expected but does the job.</li>
    <li> Dandruff conditioners don&#x27;t always work. You are either having to change it out in a couple of months or toss it in the trash because it will leave build up and cause your head to itch.  This product works great!! It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  It feels clean and smells minty.  Use the matching shampoo. It was recommended by a friend. I recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> I have (dread) locs almost to my butt and I&#x27;m from The Bahamas. It was normal to wash my relaxed hair once a week but now with locs it&#x27;s normal to freshen them up once a month depending on how sweat-active you are. Long story short I wash my locs once a month. I love the shampoo already and I&#x27;ve only used it once. The conditioner is nice to because it has that same tingling affect on my scalp as the shampoo does. I love that it does not stink like other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried and it is effective in dealing with my dermatitis. I will be purchasing more in the future I just home I&#x27;ll be able to find it when I need more.</li>
    <li> I love the nioxin line of hair care products.  I have been using the scalp recovery products for awhile now and have had good results.  Amazon price was amazing for this product!</li>
    <li> like the scent, a little different than the orig. System #x style conditioners but still good.</li>
    <li> CHange the formula when Nioxin was sold.  It doens&#x27;t have the same results.  I&#x27;m hoping they will go back to the old formula!</li>
    <li> I love this product it works great on my damage hair and scalp</li>
    <li> Outstanding product at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Title says it all.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great - the same item at my hair dresser is double the price.</li>
    <li> My scalp was dry from the winter weather as usual and needed something to help my itching head.  For the size of the bottle and the amount needed to wash and condition your scalp, this product seems to be worth the high price to buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my son and has solved his flaky scalp problem.  Would recommend this product to anyone who has dry scalp</li>
    <li> I get excema on my scalp and this conditioner helped clear it up fast.</li>
    <li> I love both the shampoo and this conditioner, this is the only thing that works for my dry, flaky scalp.</li>
