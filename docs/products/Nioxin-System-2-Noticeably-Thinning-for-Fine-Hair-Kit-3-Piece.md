      <li>My Matrix Vavoom did a much better job of adding volume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>I was sure to order the correct &amp;#34;System 2&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>if any one have more information about parabens please answer my concern</li>
      <li>Love Nioxin products been using them for years</li>
      <li>My hair has never been more healthy.</li>
      <li>I really love Nioxin.</li>
      <li>My hair has more volume and shine than ever.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been thinning on top and this product seems to do well by keeping the hair thicker appearing.</li>
      <li>And yes, I&#x27;m sure this did hurt,it tingles on your scalp</li>
      <li>She still uses it every now and then to keep her hair healthy.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love the tingle that both shampoo and conditioner leave.</li>
      <li>It feels great on the scalp and really leaves your hair feeling healthy and clean while waking up your scalp.</li>
      <li>Delivered before expected date and best price for this product!</li>
      <li>I had heard good things about it from friends and really thought this would help</li>
      <li>I received in a good form and fast</li>
      <li>Was delivered very quick.</li>
      <li>Love this product and the quick service.</li>
      <li>Amazing, I would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The conditioner is good, but sometimes I add my own old kind with argon oil in it to the ends of my hair to make it a little more soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of course I don&#x27;t see any new hair growth yet, but I&#x27;m happy with it not falling out as much.  </li>
      <li>Hair fall has been significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>but it feels clean.</li>
      <li>Okay, can&#x27;t really say if it helped or Biotin prescription.</li>
      <li>Feels cool</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price for the three pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S.Paul</li>
      <li>Excellent price and received earlier then expected.</li>
      <li>Only plus is the conditioner smells nice.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it works, but it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
      <li>I am doing it right,</li>
      <li>The product has consistent quality and this pack&#x27;s composite structure is useful for my traveling needs.</li>
      <li>The Vendor quickly corrected the problem and was very helpful and sending the right product.</li>
      <li>My hair has more body and it appears that I have more hair, but the conditioner and leave in treatment do very little to de-tangle and smooth the hair so that I have just as much breakage and fall-out as I did before.</li>
      <li>He had highly recommended this having used it 3 years ago with significant benefits.</li>
      <li>This the first product that has ever done what it advertises to do.</li>
      <li>I saw immediate results after the first time I washed my hair.  </li>
      <li>I now shampoo only twice a week, and my hair looks better than ever.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
      <li>A word of caution, however, don&#x27;t get so excited about the prospect of preventing hair loss, that you use too much product or wash too frequently.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am extremely pleased with the whole experience &amp; look forward to using PWW again in the near future:-)</li>
      <li>Important Suggestion: Take a picture/video of your hair prior to using the product.</li>
      <li>The foam/mousse doesn&#x27;t seem to add much body.</li>
      <li>Thanks Nioxin hair care.</li>
      <li>My hair is still falling out as fast as ever</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about 2 weeks, but haven&#x27;t really noticed too much difference yet.</li>
      <li>, I remember reading one of the reviews that really tickled me.  </li>
      <li>but really don&#x27;t notice a difference.  </li>
      <li>I hope the Nioxin will help in that area too, like some of the other reviewers have stated, but I will be happy if it just slows down the hair loss for now!  </li>
      <li>I believe that  products are not as high quality as I thought that they would be.</li>
      <li>Someone said that it left their hair even more dry and coarse after 1st week of usage and they were damn right!</li>
      <li>Only after another major stress event did my hair loss have a huge spike.  </li>
      <li>It is also priced more than half off of the price I&#x27;ve paid  at the salon!</li>
      <li>eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a real fanatic about good smelling soaps, etc.  </li>
      <li>It smell great, but I not able to tell if it is working until a use it for a few months.  </li>
      <li>After my first use I lost about half as much hair as normal.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this shampoo, conditioner and therapy because of so many negative reviews.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a second round of these products to make sure I was giving every opportunity for the products to work since someone (a stranger) had recommended them to me.</li>
      <li>I have not really noticed much difference.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin on top, and got thinner because of chemo.</li>
      <li>I started using this system as my hair is thinning a lot after postpartum hair loss ,I had a big hope that this product will help but at my second use I am afraid that it will hurt more than help , can paraben really cause harm like cancer or it is just a claim spread by companies trying to promote their organic products ?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not have any noticeable changes. Disappointed. But smells good and clean!</li>
    <li> I received in a good form and fast</li>
    <li> I really love Nioxin. My hair is thin on top, and got thinner because of chemo. I have been using it a bit over a month, and do see some improvement. Hopefully, it will continue to help my hair fill in the bald areas.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell if this is working and at this point I&#x27;m too afraid to stop. I have noticed less breakage, but maybe that&#x27;s just because I have less hair than when I started it &amp;#62;1 ago.</li>
    <li> Package was not sealed and bottles were not sealed.</li>
    <li> Did not see any results and found out that the formula was changed and this is not the Nioxin I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Someone said that it left their hair even more dry and coarse after 1st week of usage and they were damn right! I have had flaking after applying this and scalp felt a little coated and tight after applying the bottle number 3. I am doing it right, i.e shampoo and rinse, followed by conditioner, leave for 3 mins and rinse, then apply the 3rd small bottle with foamy dispense. My brother who suggested this to me, also used it for 2-3 days this time and had the same problem. He had highly recommended this having used it 3 years ago with significant benefits. Same house, same water, diff results this time. Something has changed in their manufacturing or formula in this system 2, it said it was manufactured in Mexico, not sure if thats been the change but I am most unimpressed!</li>
    <li> Great results for my son&#x27;s alopecia!</li>
    <li> Save your money. Go to CVS and buy something off the shelf... Only plus is the conditioner smells nice. They also give you a large bttle of shampoo and a small bottle of conditioner... should be the other way around</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Nioxin it&#x27;s a very good brand . Any time I have hair fallout I turn to this brand.&lt;br /&gt; I will always buy this , time and time again... It&#x27;s worth the price for the three pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S.Paul</li>
    <li> Product was as expected. Excellent price and received earlier then expected. Will buy more when needed.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a long time.The product has consistent quality and this pack&#x27;s composite structure is useful for my traveling needs.</li>
    <li> I gave these products every chance by using nothing but Nioxin for 2 1/2 months. If anything, my hair seems even thinner. The shampoo strips every smidgeon of product and oil from my hair. Then, the conditioner tries to add it back in. The foam/mousse doesn&#x27;t seem to add much body. My Matrix Vavoom did a much better job of adding volume. I ordered a second round of these products to make sure I was giving every opportunity for the products to work since someone (a stranger) had recommended them to me. I was sure to order the correct &amp;#34;System 2&amp;#34; products for noticeably thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo! Great Price!</li>
    <li> Nioxin doesn&#x27;t say it will regrow hair because it can&#x27;t and it&#x27;s not even clinically proven to stop hair loss. A product that can do those things is a shampoo called Triplus. Amazing</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  My hair feels and looks thicker and my thinning areas are less noticeable.  I will continue to use this product probably forever since losing my hair is genetic.</li>
    <li> Amazing, I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received my package when expected. The merchandise was well packaged &amp; I am very happy with the results I am getting from the product itself. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the whole experience &amp; look forward to using PWW again in the near future:-)</li>
    <li> There was a mistake in the product sent to me. The Vendor quickly corrected the problem and was very helpful and sending the right product. I&#x27;m impressed with the product. It smell great, but I not able to tell if it is working until a use it for a few months.  Thank you for your quick response and great customer service.</li>
    <li> My hair has more body and it appears that I have more hair, but the conditioner and leave in treatment do very little to de-tangle and smooth the hair so that I have just as much breakage and fall-out as I did before. The shampoo is a nice clarifying with a pleasant mint scent, but there are many lower priced shampoos that are just as good. I believe that  products are not as high quality as I thought that they would be. I will only buy them it again if the formulas are improved.</li>
    <li> Love Nioxin products been using them for years</li>
    <li> My hair has never been more healthy. Thanks Nioxin hair care. My hair has more volume and shine than ever.</li>
    <li> not even close what I bought at the store :(</li>
    <li> good pricem but never received the email that the product was shipped</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I can already see baby hair growing.  Definitely makes the scalp tingle.</li>
    <li> What to say....? Hair continues to thin in spite of using product.</li>
    <li> Love the tingle that both shampoo and conditioner leave. I&#x27;ve been thinning on top and this product seems to do well by keeping the hair thicker appearing. The after condition treatment foam is greaseless, leaves no residue. Have been buying this product for a year now, and this seller is fast to ship, at a near 50% discount if purchased from my hair cutting place.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the quick service.</li>
    <li> My hair is still falling out as fast as ever but it feels clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using to product for 5 weeks but really don&#x27;t notice a difference.  I&#x27;m still losing the same amount of hair as I had been prior to using Nioxin.  I had heard good things about it from friends and really thought this would help but unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t for me.  I&#x27;ll keep using until I run out of the product....hopefully I will end up seeing some good results in the end.</li>
    <li> Not really sure about the product. I have been using it for about 2 weeks, but haven&#x27;t really noticed too much difference yet.</li>
    <li> excellent products.  You can feel it working.  Has thickened my hair and made the appearance nicer... so shiny...</li>
    <li> These products do not grow hair but help to keep your hair from falling out and give your hair body.  I have been using them for over a year and am happy with them.</li>
    <li> Important Suggestion: Take a picture/video of your hair prior to using the product. Take follow up pictures every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long have I been using the product: 2 years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How often to use: Every other day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long does it take to show effect: 2-3 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What changes do you see:&lt;br /&gt;1. You won&#x27;t get the hair you have already lost.&lt;br /&gt;2. Hair fall has been significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;3. Look wise I saw marginal increase in volume.</li>
    <li> I like it well enough.I don&#x27;t know how well it works, but it&#x27;s worth trying. A word of caution, however, don&#x27;t get so excited about the prospect of preventing hair loss, that you use too much product or wash too frequently. I now shampoo only twice a week, and my hair looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> It was what I was expecting. All things in tact and packaged well. Does it work? I doubt it. I have been using this for years and am still losing hair. I use it in vain I think.</li>
    <li> I have not really noticed much difference.</li>
    <li> This the first product that has ever done what it advertises to do. See results by 2 nd treatment and gets better with each application. Long lasting results</li>
    <li> Not sure it is going to work yet</li>
    <li> very good products..have used for years...</li>
    <li> Works as described, makes your scalp tingle and feels great, cleans and conditions as described and the leave in treatment leaves no greasy residue and I actually use it to style my hair, very happy with the product. It is also priced more than half off of the price I&#x27;ve paid  at the salon! Win win!</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful, it made my hair thicker and longer I love it will suggest to use and keep using you will see a good result</li>
    <li> Good product! Now just waiting to see if it works. It seem to be so far but still have thin looking hair.</li>
    <li> doing a great job- I will continue to use it- not to sure about the conditioner- my hair short and I only use it once in awhile</li>
    <li> The products in this collection are good. I would purchase it again. It was recommended to me by another customer..Feels cool and.pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> My hair has grown longer and thicker in just a few months! Product works Great! Was delivered very quick. Would definitely recommend and buy again!</li>
    <li> great price and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Okay, can&#x27;t really say if it helped or Biotin prescription.</li>
    <li> Delivered before expected date and best price for this product!</li>
    <li> Got rid of all the build up in my hair. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Try this shampoo if you are losing your hair!  I saw immediate results after the first time I washed my hair.  I have been under massive amounts of stress and I have been losing MASSIVE amounts of hair.  I have used just about every hair product out there and this is the only one that worked.  My hair loss in one shower has been about the amount of hair you would have in your brush for a week.  And that&#x27;s NO exaggeration.  After my first use I lost about half as much hair as normal.  The consequent uses proved just as beneficial.  Only after another major stress event did my hair loss have a huge spike.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now.  Of course I don&#x27;t see any new hair growth yet, but I&#x27;m happy with it not falling out as much.  I didn&#x27;t buy this shampoo, conditioner and therapy because of so many negative reviews.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t listened to them and bought it anyway!!!!!  An acquaintance of mine used this several years ago and it helped her immensely, but I didn&#x27;t buy it because of these reviews!  She still uses it every now and then to keep her hair healthy.  On the bottle of the shampoo and conditioner, it states that &amp;#34;hair loss due to breakage&amp;#34; was reduced.  No where on the bottle does it say it regrows hair or even stops hair loss.  This is an added benefit folks.  For those of you who are complaining about it not regrowing hair, etc., please read the bottle.  Nioxin is not making those claims at all.  It HAS helped me though and I will continue to use it for a very long time.  I have years of hair growth ahead of me that is needed.  I hope the Nioxin will help in that area too, like some of the other reviewers have stated, but I will be happy if it just slows down the hair loss for now!  And like I said, it has!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I remember reading one of the reviews that really tickled me.  She wrote that it irritated her eyes.  Well, if ANY shampoo gets in your eyes it&#x27;s going to hurt and turn them red!  And yes, I&#x27;m sure this did hurt,it tingles on your scalp so I&#x27;m sure it didn&#x27;t feel good in her eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a real fanatic about good smelling soaps, etc.  This shampoo has a minty, eucalipty type smell, which isn&#x27;t that great, but I don&#x27;t care because it works.  The conditioner is good, but sometimes I add my own old kind with argon oil in it to the ends of my hair to make it a little more soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment you use after you towel dry your hair is like a watery mousse.  It&#x27;s okay and it probably helps, but it kind of makes my hair look dirty so I don&#x27;t use it all the time.  A hint for those of you that are truly losing your hair:  don&#x27;t ever scrub your head while washing it or drying it with your towel.  It will loosen the hair follicle and you will have more fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re skeptical, try this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I started using this system as my hair is thinning a lot after postpartum hair loss ,I had a big hope that this product will help but at my second use I am afraid that it will hurt more than help , can paraben really cause harm like cancer or it is just a claim spread by companies trying to promote their organic products ?if any one have more information about parabens please answer my concern</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair products.  The price was great! I would definitely order this kit again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Been usingoing it for 6 weeks and there are noticeable results. It feels great on the scalp and really leaves your hair feeling healthy and clean while waking up your scalp. I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time to come.</li>
