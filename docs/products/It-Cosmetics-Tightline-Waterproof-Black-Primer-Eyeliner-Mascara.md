      <li>I have to use it without a mascara on top but its perfect alone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love the waterproof !</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Amazing coverage and definition.  </li>

      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>When you need more volume or drama, just add your favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>that has caused me to try many mascaras</li>
      <li>Then easily go over lashes again.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best mascara I have ever used!!</li>
      <li>I keep this in my car for days I&#x27;m on the run - perfect little hint of a liner</li>
      <li>I am 70 years old, and not looking for glam, just good coverage that stays on.  </li>
      <li>and I was excited to find this product.  </li>
      <li>always had to use Quick tips to get the mascara off my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and would definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it claims to do!</li>
      <li>That applicator is exactly what all mascaras should have, in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>I use it lightly for a natural eyebrow color.  </li>
      <li>I bought this (cheaper) at Ulta and honestly I had high expectations but at the same time I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
      <li>It all came off in just two applications and gentle working the lashes with my fingers</li>
      <li>I removed it gently with Lancome&#x27;s Bi-Facil Eye Make-up Remover.  </li>
      <li>This is not a thick, clump mascara.</li>
      <li>The only drawback for me, as is with all mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, is the bit of little particles, I use another clean eyelash brush to smooth them out.  </li>
      <li>The thin applicator makes for easy and full coverage.  </li>
      <li>I do love the small brush.</li>
      <li>Was very hard to get the tightline look that tutorials made look very easy.</li>
      <li>and it brings them out, it really works as tightline and mascara, be careful with the brush though, seeing as how its small it can break or bend easily.</li>
      <li>You need to press in pretty good at the lash base for this result, and my eyes are too sensitive for that.  </li>

<li> The very thin, fine brush is flexible and does find and coat each lash.</li>
<li> Easy to remove (even the waterproof) with cold cream.  </li>
<li> I was wrong, this product does what it says and more, It coats each lash (no clumps after a few applications in one sitting!)</li>
<li> there are a few tiny gaps.  </li>
<li> Will buy again when the time comes, but a little goes a long way with this product!</li>
<li> It has always worked for me without running down my face.</li>
<li> This is like using mascara watered down with water so upset.</li>
<li> Also, I don&#x27;t care to wear BLACK eye liner</li>
<li> I think of it as a little eye pick-me-up.</li>
<li> I sweat a lot too and in the past</li>
<li> Waterproof mascara will usually hold curls</li>
<li> It is hard to find waterproof products that are not so infused with chemicals that I can&#x27;t wear my glasses for the burning.  </li>
<li> No more!  </li>
<li> I use this as a base for my regular mascara</li>
<li> I put it on and decided to wear it over night (unfair test for any cosmetic).  </li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent multipurpose primer.  The thin applicator makes for easy and full coverage.  I&#x27;m very pleased and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my car for days I&#x27;m on the run - perfect little hint of a liner</li>
    <li> the only problem i have occurred is that the color seems to be a bit smeared at the end of a day, but not badly enough for me to stop using</li>
    <li> I love it.  Work well on me, does not come off.  I am 70 years old, and not looking for glam, just good coverage that stays on.  This truly does the job.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Only mascara I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t clump.  Easy to remove (even the waterproof) with cold cream.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My eyes are irritated by all mascaras but tightline saved me! I have to use it without a mascara on top but its perfect alone.</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday and was so eager to try it.  I put it on and decided to wear it over night (unfair test for any cosmetic).  I have NEVER gotten THIS kind of lash definition with any mascara.  This morning it was in tact.  NO smudges or raccoon eyes, no flaking.  It applies like a dream.  That applicator is exactly what all mascaras should have, in my opinion.  I removed it gently with Lancome&#x27;s Bi-Facil Eye Make-up Remover.  It all came off in just two applications and gentle working the lashes with my fingers (no rubbing it in the eye).  I reapplied the mascara this morning.  Amazing coverage and definition.  This WILL replace Lancome&#x27;s Definicils.  NO contest.  Definicils clumps, flakes and does NOT last the day.  It is hard to find waterproof products that are not so infused with chemicals that I can&#x27;t wear my glasses for the burning.  Definicil didn&#x27;t burn, but it also didn&#x27;t WORK.  This is the one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note:  I did NOT get the &amp;#34;eye liner&amp;#34; effect they claim occurs with this product.  You need to press in pretty good at the lash base for this result, and my eyes are too sensitive for that.  Also, I don&#x27;t care to wear BLACK eye liner so I didn&#x27;t attempt it.</li>
    <li> This is not a thick, clump mascara. Sometimes you just want to bring your lashes to life. The very thin, fine brush is flexible and does find and coat each lash. I think of it as a little eye pick-me-up. When you need more volume or drama, just add your favorite mascara.</li>
    <li> I wear this alone on an every day basis! It is great mascara by itself!</li>
    <li> Was very hard to get the tightline look that tutorials made look very easy. Really only worked as a primer.</li>
    <li> Had my doubts about this one, but it is now a must for my dailey &amp;#34;barn painting&amp;#34;. I use it lightly for a natural eyebrow color.  Will buy again when the time comes, but a little goes a long way with this product!</li>
    <li> Love the waterproof ! It has always worked for me without running down my face. I have always had problems putting mascara on my bottom lashes...always had to use Quick tips to get the mascara off my skin. No more!  The brush is perfect. Can&#x27;t get the eyeliner effect to work, but that could be  my fault because I haven&#x27;t practiced.  Will keep using, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! A great primer with lots of nutrients and tightline in seconds. This is definitely a makeup bag staple.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best mascara I have ever used!! You are able to get to All of your lashes with the wand and because of that you end up with lashes unlike anything you ever had before!! I sweat a lot too and in the past that has caused me to try many mascaras and I don&#x27;t have to worry at all about that with this!! Your eyes will pop like never before!! Its a Must have iny opinion!!</li>
    <li> I use this as a base for my regular mascara</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Ordered another one so I won&#x27;t run out</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Put it on before adding shadow. Then easily go over lashes again. Love it..</li>
    <li> This is like using mascara watered down with water so upset.</li>
    <li> I bought this (cheaper) at Ulta and honestly I had high expectations but at the same time I didn&#x27;t expect much.

    <li> My eyeliner is tattooed on - over time there are a few tiny gaps.  This is an excellent product!  Does exactly what it claims to do!</li>
    <li> This product is great for priming your lashes and lining the tightline, even for a make up novice like myself. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Works great and elongates lashes!</li>
    <li> I curl my lashes before applying mascara.  Waterproof mascara will usually hold curls and I was excited to find this product.  Was hoping it would hold the curl on my lashes and provide a liner effect.  As soon as I applied this mascara, my lashes went flat.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff!</li>
    <li> The only drawback for me, as is with all mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, is the bit of little particles, I use another clean eyelash brush to smooth them out.  I do love the small brush.</li>
