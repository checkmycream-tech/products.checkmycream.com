      <li>It&#x27;s completely worth the money!!!</li>
      <li>I got it from costco where returns are so easy!</li>
      <li>I purchased the Tanda from Amazon&#x27;s flash sale site myhabit.com at a good discount and was so excited when I received the product.</li>
      <li>great product, very happy with it, it does just what it says, it really works with clearing acne and preventing new ones.</li>
      <li>At the beginning, it works ok.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve been on hormone blockers and more topicals than I can even remember.  </li>

      <li>and it still works like magic.  </li>
      <li>really really glad</li>

      <li>Love it, love it.....</li>
      <li>skin has become much more even toned too which I did not expect.</li>
      <li>and it still works like magic.  </li>
      <li>I thought, okay, maybe that&#x27;s the process...draws it up to the surface than kills it?</li>
      <li>and I have many, many scars on my face from acne.</li>
      <li>I am not one to write reviews, but after having this device for about a month now, I am so glad I purchased it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many products over the years</li>

      <li>Ok here&#x27;s the rundown:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>

      <li>I love how easy it is to use and how many treatments you get out of one head.</li>
      <li>It is remarkable and has worked very well.</li>
      <li>best on solid skin surface, so areas like the chin, nose or at angles where it&#x27;s not fully pressed against the face, it doesn&#x27;t work well because the light won&#x27;t activate.</li>
      <li>You would have to be more precise with the Zap to make sure it aligns and does not move off target.</li>
      <li>After about 1.5- 2 weeks of using Tanda twice a day I started noticing my skin becoming smoother. .</li>
      <li>Feels calm and warm on the face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Brand new device has been charging for over 36 hours and still will not work or hold a charge.  I&#x27;m disappointed as this was the issue with my last Tanda device and why I decided to purchase a new one.  Since they have introduced the new treatment heads I have had nothing but charging issues with this device.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> So if you haven&#x27;t used heat/light to clear your acne before you might be better off spending your money elsewhere. I bought this because i would use my laptop power adapter to put against my acne (of course I sterilized it first) so the heat could help those suckers disappear. I definitely notice a similar effect when I use the Tanda instead, but for $100 I wish I just kept on using my charger.</li>
    <li> This product worked well for my daughter.  It helps to reduce the redness and swelling of acne.  Definitely a noticeable improvement and it didn&#x27;t damage her skin the way some of the creams have in the past.</li>
    <li> The Tanda that was shipped out to me would not charge when I removed it from the box. I immediately sent it back to Amazon.com and was quickly refunded. Other people seem to have trouble with this, so I will not be ordering a replacement. It&#x27;s too expensive for such inconsistent quality.</li>
    <li> This WORKS!! I was skeptical too about a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; clearing my skin...but then I have marine aquariums..and in that hobby we run water through what is called a UV Sterilizer-water passes thru a tube that has a UV germicidal bulb in it-the UV light kills all bacteria and parasites-so I know in theory it should work..so after having a couple of bad issues come up, especially after eating junk food...I knew these could get BAD fast, as they so often do..and sure enough, I cut them off at the pass with the Tanda, and they went away without the whole blemish forming...this really is a miracle if you are prone to some serious breakouts..I wonder how it would work on the real bad cystic acne. Since skin is pretty translucent the light must reach down pretty deep through the layers, and so I would imagine it working pretty well on even the worst cases. This is one of those-now that I have it, I can&#x27;t live without it-things...get one-you will be glad you did!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good and I will introduce it to my friends.  I use it 2 times a day. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Since my first review, I&#x27;ve had additional experience with the Tanda Clear+. If you are an individual who can suffer from cold sores or fever blisters, be sure to protect your mouth from the devices emitted light.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only draw back I&#x27;ve experienced. I love this product. It has definitely helped to diminish my breakouts.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love this product, after 15 years of struggling with acne I have finally found something that works great and clears my breakouts fast. the first day I noticed a amazing difference in the size of my pimples and my skin began to clear fast , this is a great product very easy to use and and will save me a lot of money by not going to my expensive spa that charges $100 per treatment, for anyone dealing with breakouts give this a try it  WORKS!!!!!</li>
    <li> ***********UPDATED REVIEW***********&lt;br /&gt;DEFECTIVE PRODUCT DIDNT EVEN LAST 6 MONTHS&lt;br /&gt;I PURCHASED MY TANDA FROM BESTSELLER21,&lt;br /&gt;I HAD SOME PROBLEMS RIGHT AWAY WITH THE HEAD , AND I CONTACTED THE SELLER . THEY OFFERED NO SOLUTION OTHER THEN TO EXCHANGE , SO I DID . NEVER GOT MY REFUND , THE DEFECTIVE ITEM WAS RETURNED TO ME. I WILL BE CONTACTING AMAZON TO TRY AND GET A REFUND THROUGH THEM. THE ITEM STATES IT SHOULD LAST FOR YEARS WITH ONLY NEEDING TO REPLACE THE HEAD ONCE A YEAR. I WOULD CHARGE THE ITEM FOR HOURS AND RECIEVE ONLY RED LIGHT (MEANING IT HAD NO BATTERY LIFE)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it cured my cystic acne , i have never been more satisfied with an acne treatment product , totally worth the investment.... the last time i saw results like this i had to fork over 400+ to see a dermatologist to get prescription medication.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to do when your watching t.v. , having coffee etc.. the large treatment area makes getting out of control acne back in check ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i saw results in 24 hrs , and after 2 weeks my skin doesnt have any pimples. Although it is still healing from the old ones , i notice i have smaller pores now , and the pimples i do see coming i kill immediately and they dont even surface. Thank u so much for this product . i have seen several other kinds for sell on amazon that were cheaper i dont know if they are just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did have a few problems with the head , it seemed not to be that secure and sometimes would shut off for no reason., sometimes it would shut off in the middle of a  treatment and to turn it on i would have to push hard on the head against my skin ,  it overheated as well , i could never get a full 10 treatments , that may be just due to the seller , or maybe the specific one was defective. I am not sure , that is why i only gave it a 4 star.</li>
    <li> First and foremost,  if you expect Tanda Clear to clear all of your acne,look elsewhere.  This device is best to be used in conjuction with other treatments,pills,acne-kits,soaps.  I used Tanda in conjuction with Clearzine,and the results were amazing.  On the first week, I&#x27;ve noticed my breakouts were less inflamated and controlled.  After the second week, I&#x27;ve noticed My acne was disappearing and kept improving.  After two months, my face clear-up and helped me keep my acne under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So why three stars instead of five?  Well, this device doesn&#x27;t really hold a lot of battery charge,consequently, I have to be near the outlet all the time.  And after using the device for a while, it overheats, and you have to wait for couple of minutes until it cools off.!  My personal opinion and experience using Tanda is, use it in conjuntion for best results and use it regularly.  For those that are looking to get rid of your zits,this is one solution to try.</li>
    <li> Love this device!!!!  The whole family uses this as it works great!!!</li>
    <li> Completely happy with this product. Had a mild breakout on my chin and within 3 days all pimples were dried up / gone. I don&#x27;t use every day but pull it out when I notice acne forming. Would encourage anyone who still struggles with breakouts ( I&#x27;m 43 and still am fighting the clear skin war) to order and try :-)</li>
    <li> Already seeing results the first week.</li>
    <li> This works well, just requires some patience if you have multiple areas to treat. I tested this on multiple forms of acne, and in all cases it helped reduce inflammation and went away quicker. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> I wish I would be able to leave a wonderful comment on the great success I had with the unit on my acne but I am unable to.&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of purchasing the item from a buyer without due research, the item not only arrived used, but defective. I was able to use it on just a few areas of my face before the item \\&quot;died\\&quot;... the areas I was able to use it on felt good, no pain. I am sure if the item lasted longer/ was new as advertised I would be able to leave a complete review on how wonderful it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I was not able to fully use the product, I did not want to give it a low rating to discourage others from purchasing the unit.... maybe just from the buyer I bought it from..lol.</li>
    <li> It works somewhat. No where near as good as Zeno. It takes longer. I don&#x27;t know if the light works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to sit for as long as required with the light focused on multiple areas. Maybe if you choose one area it would be easier to see results.</li>
    <li> Assembled all parts correctly, and plugged into working AC outlet.  NOTHING!  Unit would not charge up.  Tried calling customer service.  Just got a recording.  No human to talk to.  No help.  Tried emailing the help address.  Just got an email back the next day asking STUPID questions, like did I put the unit in the charging cradle backwards.  NO, I didn&#x27;t!  Lousy customer service.  Non-working product.  I would give a lower rating, if there was one.  I returned the product.</li>
    <li> With Tanda, my face looks clearer in about 2 days quicker for me.  I like having a weapon to zap my MILD-sometimes moderate breakouts- when they start to come on. Acne, still happens, but this product seems to ease the severity. Using Tanda, is easy-Plug in, place device gently yet securely into charger, check to see if little light on the side of device is on..let it charge 4hrs 1st time or when its power runs out.  Its suppose to last 10-11 treatments B4 its built in battery goes dead.  No batteries to mess with (Love that!!).  Turn it on, light on side of device blinks until you place it on your face then, the BRIGHT BLUE Treatment Light will COME ON when &#x27;applied to the skin&#x27;, then goes off after several minutes of treatment cycle. I give acne site(s) 2 treatments in a row, back to back once or twice day until healed. A breeze to work, I do the tx when watching T.V., on phone ect.  Tanda does seem to help ease my acne, not cure it.  Happy I have it.</li>
    <li> My daughter struggles with whiteheads and breakouts. Topical treatments are often too harsh and leave her skin red and irritated. With diligent use, this blue light has cleared her skin. It does take time and consistency. It&#x27;s a well made product. I recommend for an effective, natural way to treat skin.</li>
    <li> This has been a life saver!! Noticed a difference within 48 hours. It&#x27;s been three weeks, and no new break outs and existing acne is almost gone.  I use it first thing in the morning and right before bed. Heat  and vibration are both gentle. Have to wait a bit in the morning for the  indents it leaves to dissipate before putting on make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please disregard the poor reviews left by those that say it did work on their cystic acne. It says right in the directions that it will not work on severe forms of acne, such as cystic acne.</li>
    <li> Didnt really do anything for me, if anything made my skin worse. But they did honor their guarantee and received a full refund. I would recommend anyone looking at this try out the acne.org regimen first!</li>
    <li> I have used various blue light products over the years. I began using after receiving treatment from dermatologist. I used to further clear my skin up and continued as maintenance. If you are consistent/persistent it will work great for you. This is not an instant cure, but is always available 24/7 when needed. Blue light technology took my skin from bad/uncomfortable to very good/presentable. Tanda is a good product. Go for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the stands Zap and this make more sense with being rechargeable and the the head lasting for 5000 uses. Works really well.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after over the counter products were no longer working. I have been using this 2x a day and I have noticed a difference within 24hrs. Its great but I do wish it covered a bigger area.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my black/white head problem. I used it daily once i received the product. I definitely feel my face less oily during the day, my makeup remained fresh after work. I can&#x27;t comment much on acne control except I didn&#x27;t experience any nasty breakout when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the main reason for 3 stars instead of 4/5, I noticed discoloration on my face after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I used this all over my face except for my forehead. Forehead I only used it one 1 area - middle of my forehead as that is my problematic zone. I noticed one morning after ~ 2 weeks of usage, my cheeks have &amp;#34;dark patches&amp;#34;. Initial thought was my first pigmentation have appeared. However on closer examination, I notice a &amp;#34;inverted triangle dark patch&amp;#34; in the middle of my forehead. I freak out big time, stopped blue light treatment and ply on vitamin C serum. After 1-2weeks, my forehead is back to the normal color, I can&#x27;t say the same for my cheekbones area (which have thinner skin). FYI, i wear SPF 40 everyday and a desk-bound worker so I do not have much sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came back and read all the reviews hoping to find someone experience the same issue as me hoping that this is just a temporary issue but seems like I am the only one. Being a vainpot, all the glowing reviews here make me feel like giving it another try, argh.</li>
    <li> This product has really helped my acne! Everyone around me has noticed a significant difference. It&#x27;s completely worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this in the mail, all the other products at the drug store have just seemed to stop working. I was on my last straw and decided to try the tanda. After the first day of using this, the giant zit that had accumulated on my forehead over the week had decreased in size by 50% and no longer was painful. So I was very happy about that but over the first week of using I am now breaking in places I never do! I don&#x27;t know if its just bringing up everything,like all the old gunk in my face or what&#x27;s going on. Probably will be returning this product. Too expensive with the results.</li>
    <li> The TANDA helped clear some of the smaller acne that I had on my face, but those were the very small ones that were barely noticeable. It didn&#x27;t really help with the larger acne that I had, and I noticed the acne that I DID have a problem with would glow a darker red on my pale skin. No bueno.</li>
    <li> This works! Clears my skin overnight.</li>
    <li> Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Downside is&lt;br /&gt;Charges like for ever&lt;br /&gt;Goggles are tricky to use appropeatly&lt;br /&gt;But at least there available to you you can&#x27;t really see much useing them it feels like &amp;#34;light&#x27;s out &amp;#34; kinda moment but regarding functionality it has reduced the size of my acne greatly it feels great my skin is softer now and it realy helps reduce the painful huge one (zits )</li>
    <li> But......I do see a slight difference in my &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; pimple scars that last the extra week.......I have the red light too, works great for cut healing, the scar I have is 10 times better than it normally would without the light</li>
    <li> It really helps my acne-prone skin! I mean, at first there are lots of red spots on my face, but after one month use, nearly all of them are gone! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-thirties and have suffered from acne since I was a pre-teen. This device works well for hard underground zits. The instructions say to use it twice a day but it is very drying so I only use it once a day. When I use it my zits go away after a couple of days instead of a couple of weeks. Great product, just modify your usage according to your skin reactions.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this at first because it is a bit pricey, but I thought about it as an investment. You see, if you take good care of your skin, no scars (from pimples) will surface on your skin, that way you dont need to get other treatments to treat all the scars. In the long run, this will cost you less. Like they say prevention is better than cure, so I decided to finally give it a try, and Im glad I did! Im really really glad I did!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this package 2 days ago. I was trying to zap my pimples but I just get a steady red light indicator so I decided Ill charge it overnight. The following morning, I used it to zap my zits and one cystic pimple on my cheek. This cystic pimple has a lump that is very hard to go away, sometimes its there for months - same spot, all the time, so I zapped this cystic pimple too! I tried it again in the evening and boy I noticed the cystic pimple/lump went away!! I cant feel the lump on my cheek anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get zits everytime I use makeup, mmmmnnn... I wonder if I can now use makeup and not have zits now that I have this wonderful device!this i dont know yet....we&#x27;ll see..but for now, im so impressed! Even thinking about buying their tanda rejuvenation gizmo over Tria Laser, has anyone tried the tanda rejuvenation set? Does it work for you?</li>
    <li> The orange signal light just blinks on and off now but the actual laser light (blue lights) have stopped working. There is no recourse in terms of a refund or exchange.  It was a very pricey mistake.</li>
    <li> ...and I have had it all of less than 2 months.  GRRR.... At this price point, I find that unacceptable.</li>
    <li> After a week of use, the blue light stoped working.  It only vibrates now; so no good review on this one.</li>
    <li> A few years ago and I neve received the product and it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
    <li> I have suffered for five years with cystic/ nodular adult acne, only on my chin area. I have been on every antibiotic know to man, I&#x27;ve been on hormone blockers and more topicals than I can even remember.  By chance, I came across this product and said WHY NOT! I have spent thousands on medicines and organic cleansers and countless other products!  I have used this as directed for 7 days.  This is the ONLY time I have seen results like this!! I wish I found this sooner!  With the exception of one, my entire problem area is CLEAR. Yea, clear.  If you are at your whits end like I was, purchase this machine, the results are immediate!  My skin got just a little irritated on the first two days, so I cut the treatment times in half and used it once a day until not redness occurred and I now use it twice a day w no problem.  Good Luck!!</li>
    <li> I have bad skin and get those acne breakouts, that take 1 to 2 weeks to turn white, when I eat greasy food or sweets.  So I tried this Tanda Clear Plus device for a few weeks and did not notice any difference in reducing the breakouts or the redness of my acne.  Unfortunately, I realized this after the 30 day trial was over so I got stuck with $100+ product that doesn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s also annoying how the surface area of the Tanda is so small, so you have to spend a lot of time holding it from place to place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I eventually found that works for me is this cream, and it&#x27;s cheap, under $10:&lt;br /&gt;- Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Vanishing Acne Treatment Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reduces my acne within a day and then its gone after about 2/3 days.  I tried so many solutions, which all had little effect, and then my friend recommended Clearasil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to everyone trying to improve their skin and minimize breakouts!</li>
    <li> as expected it helped to clear new pimples and i have not see new ones come out for more than 1 month.. after shaving i used get big bumps .. no any more.</li>
    <li> This product works!  I am geting amazing results, it works on me and is clearing up my 14year old sons acne as well!  I would highly recomend this product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t speed the clearing of acne for me. In fact, it caused a couple of places to remain as red knots under the skin for months.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t drop it! It&#x27;s plastic and not built to withstand any impact. But that&#x27;s a risky proposition, considering all the handling it requires to use it daily. How long can you go before it slips or gets knocked off the bathroom counter?  Not for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this device for the last 3 weeks and have kept my acne at bay. I use it for 3 minutes in the morning and 3 at night. At the age of 48, I finally have clear skin!!</li>
    <li> I use it 3 times a day and don&#x27;t really notice a difference. It says that there will be noticeable effects after 48 hours. Its been 2 weeks and still don&#x27;t see that this works. I&#x27;m still gonna try it and see how it goes. It works nice as a face massager.</li>
    <li> Used my tanda almost everyday for a month and I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference. To do my entire face usually took around 30 min and every other day I had to recharge it. This didn&#x27;t work for me and to me not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This works wonders. At 44 I thought zits were for kids but my face decided to disagree and I started getting those deep zits that hurt and last 10 days but never really pop. This has been going on for a year. I have used the Tanda for 2 weeks and am clear again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter has also had success in eliminating t zone acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again and if it ever dies I&#x27;ll buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with adult acne for a few years and lately it was getting worse and I was getting huge, uncomfortable cystic pimples, mainly on my chin and in my hairline.  I tried a lot of different things - going to the dermatologist, skincare rituals, getting facials, etc.  I decided to give this a go and I&#x27;m happy to report that it worked for me!  It took a few weeks of consistently using the device before my skin completely cleared up, but I started to see a difference after just a few treatments.  It is a little time consuming (takes about 1/2 hour to treat the whole face or to concentrate the treatments on my trouble spots), but I do this while watching tv at night. The device does temporarily leave a few marks on my face for about 1/2 hour after the treatment, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it right before you&#x27;re going out.  Now my face is clearer, I also purchased the attachment for wrinkles and I alternate treatments every other night.</li>
    <li> Today is my fourth day using this product and I must say I am very pleased. I have had acne since my teenage years and now at 37 I think I have found something that works. I&#x27;ve tried many, many products over the years and I must say this one has proved to be a VERY good investment. Ok here&#x27;s the rundown:&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t use it alone meaning that I still use my other skin care products but I have seen a significant reduction in my acne ( I only have one that is thinking about forming, when in the past it was anywhere from 2-7.)&lt;br /&gt;2. It is somewhat time consuming BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT... I mean, what&#x27;s a half hour if it&#x27;ll give you clearer skin???&lt;br /&gt;3. Good for getting the whole face but not for those hard to reach places like the bridge of your nose....I&#x27;m considering the tanda zap :)&lt;br /&gt;4. Convenient charging station. I just set it there for the night and its ready to use in the morning. Toward the end of the treatment I find that it drags a little  but it continues to work so...i don&#x27;t see a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;m considering also the red treatment head which is for skin rejuvenation. I wish I would have bought the tanda clear plus years ago so I feel :( but I have it now so I feel :)</li>
    <li> I am not one to write reviews, but after having this device for about a month now, I am so glad I purchased it.  It is not &amp;#34;supposed to&amp;#34; be able to help with cystic acne, but for me it definitely does.  I have seen a huge improvement overall in the clearness of my skin!  It is a little bit time consuming to use, so I have been using it about 3 times a week, moving to different areas of my face each time.  The blemishes I do get, if any are tiny and heal within a couple of days.  I have tried all kinds of prescriptions, creams, cleansers, nothing has worked as well as this!</li>
    <li> Purchased this device after many months of receiving pricey in-office blue light treatments for my acne. This doesn&#x27;t work as well as a professional treatment but works like a charm on cystic acne caught right away. I have used on my boyfriend as well for and have seen dramatic improvements in his skin. Definitely to be used as preventative treatment as well! I have tried many acne type products and cannot recommend the tanda clear+ enough.</li>
    <li> I give the Tanda two stars because the unboxing experience is great (they definitely took some pointers from Apple) and the product is high quality. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s rechargable and portable. You can comfortably browse the web or look at a magazine while you&#x27;re doing the treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the device doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. I had a great experience with blue LED light therapy for acne at a facialist. I did a series of 6 visits and the post-baby hormonal acne on my chin was much improved. I figured why spend several hundred dollars at the facialist when I could buy an LED treatment device and do it at home? I purchased the Tanda from Amazon&#x27;s flash sale site myhabit.com at a good discount and was so excited when I received the product. I used it as directed, morning and night on the problem areas. But instead of helping, my acne got worse. Like much, much worse. I used it religiously for 2 weeks thinking maybe there was an adjustment period while my face got used to it but the acne persisted. The LED device my facialist uses doesn&#x27;t heat up like the Tanda does so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s anything to do with it. Maybe using it twice a day was just too much for my skin. At any rate, the thing is sitting on my bathroom counter and I haven&#x27;t used it in a month.</li>
    <li> After 3 days of using the product the texture of my skin has improved alot. The bumps benath my skin are almost all gone, and my forehead is almost CLEAR. I have only got 2 new bumps which is great for only 3 days using the product.. So far the product is working better than any other products I have purchased. Hopefully the product will clear up my entire face!! If you have moderate acne give this product a try. Will give another update in a few weeks. The only con about the product is time consuming. There are 3 min cycles which can be very time consuming if you have acne all of your face like me. But hey its working so i dont mind.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this product! I have been using this for a few weeks now and my skin/acne reacts pretty well to this. I try to use at least once a day, and I use all over not just on spots. This is because I want prevention. And it really seems to work. I have had fewer breakouts for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as far as treating spots this is pretty effective without any dryness. Any small zits go away in 2 days or less and large ones within 3-5 days which is pretty good for me. It really helps with the hyper pigmentation I usually get with big zits. It also works on emerging spots to keep them from cropping up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has become much more even toned too which I did not expect. So this is a huge bonus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks are the length of time it takes to treat. 3 minutes on each section takes 20 minutes or so for me. I wish I could use or twice a day but I don&#x27;t have time in the morning for that.</li>
    <li> I have the Tanda LUXE and bought the Clear Plus head for treating an occasional pimple that pops up on my 56 year old face.  I got the head yesterday and had a humdinger of a zit developing on my cheek that had been brewing for about 24 hours.  I used the head twice yesterday and once this morning on it and I&#x27;m amazed at the results.  I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell yet. I mean it says it prevents but I honestly don&#x27;t know yet. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks religiously and I had two pimples go out. Though it speeds the healing process, I did not find it to entirely prevent future breakouts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to completely discount all the favorable reviews I read and I can&#x27;t really say it it doesn&#x27;t work. But I can&#x27;t say it does work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was completely  sure it was working.  After I started using it, I quit picking and squeezing my face all the time and  I had absolutely no more breakouts. However, as an experiment, after a few months I stopped using the Tanda completely - and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts in over a month since then either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I am thinking now is that all I really needed all along was just to stop messing around with my face and leave it alone. I still use a salicylic acid cleanser (Neutrogena)  and Metrogel .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful that the Tanda  seems to have satisfied whatever obsessive need I must have had to fool around with my complexion without messing it up and taught me what it takes for my complexion to stay clear. However I can&#x27;t say it really &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;  since I apparently didn&#x27;t need anything but to keeps my hand off my face in the first place.</li>
    <li> Actually had 2 more (just regular plain old) spots appear while using it. Used 2- 3 times a day now for 3 days. Yep not dried anything up, not made any difference actually. Gave it 2 stars as it is blue light, it does heat up and vibrate and it did arrive fast and all brand new; however, it has not been effective for my issue at all. If I had had no clearing but no new breakouts I would have given it a 3 ... but yeah to get a spot right where I have been treating is a little telling.</li>
    <li> Used this for a week and it significantly helped clear and minimize my acne. Also, I used it on new zits that came up and it zapped them gone!</li>
    <li> My son has been using this, and it has been very effective!  Highly recommend starting with this rather than going directly to the $600 in office similar treatments.</li>
    <li> What a great product! I wish I had had this when I was growing up - my face never stopped breaking out over the years and I have many, many scars on my face from acne. I was a regular at the dermatologist office, and have probably used every medication and product out there. I kept thinking it would stop as I got older, but it never did, until I used the Tanda Clear. It really does work! It says it&#x27;s only for mild to moderate breakouts, but it definitely works on those big ugly cystic pimples, too - cuts the time and pain in half. Now I am only rarely getting a breakout - it&#x27;s probably been at least 6 months now - and the pimples I get are much smaller. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth every penny as far as I&#x27;m concerned! Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you!</li>
    <li> muy buen producto y si se hace 2 veces al dia como en las indicaciones se ve la disminucion del acne... lo uso todos los dias y ya no salen tantos como antes</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife who&#x27;s 44 and still has a problem with her skin. She says it works to reduce when she&#x27;s getting one of those monster pimples and helps them go away much faster.  She has a regular blue light lamp that workes on the entire face but likes this system much better because its portable and does not have to spend 30 minutes under the lamp.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought this product worked because for a week, I didn&#x27;t get any new pimples.  But as soon as my cycle came around, the hormonal breakout showed it&#x27;s ugly face and the device did nothing to alleviate it.  I was so bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to a person who is &#x27;lazy&#x27; in their skin care regimen.  This device requires at least a half hour a day.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it.....&lt;br /&gt;I was diagnosed PCOS, and I have mild hormonal acne, but never more then five pimples. Someone recommended me the Murad acne spot treatment, after using for a week, my acne got bigger more painful and multiple. Then I saw tanda zap, I was gonna get it but a lot of people comments about how bad the battery life. Then I found this clear plus, I have using it for 3 days (morning and evening) Omg!!! My pimples got smaller and smaller, no irritation at all. : ) love it, can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
    <li> I used this religiously on deep guys beneath the skin in the hopes it would help for several months.  Unfortunately no, and its VERY time consuming if you have multiple spots to hit (both sides of chin).  I cannot recommend, save your money and go see a derm.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter after having a coworker brag about the product.  My daughter thinks its ok, nothing special.</li>
    <li> Works great. Wish it didn&#x27;t take so long as it would be good for prevention as well as after breakout.</li>
    <li> So far, this has worked well.  It works best on a blemish or pimple when you first notice it.  I would recommend this, especially if you only have mild/moderate acne.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that gets oily in my T zone and I have had acne since I was 14 and I am 19 now. I got the Tanda Zap on the whim, not really thinking it would work. Started using it and it really helped. My breakouts would go away much faster and the ones I could feel coming on didn&#x27;t surface. The only problem is that the Zap is so small. So I invested in the Tanda Clear, which doesn&#x27;t need batteries so that&#x27;s another plus considering the Zap ate through them. I started using for a half hour in the morning and a half hour at night, which seems like a long time, but if it means my face will be clear of breakouts it is worth it. The surface area of the Clear is so much bigger than the Zap so you get every breakout. I used it every day, twice a day, for 3 weeks and went from having about 40 pimples on my face to 3. So now all I am using it for is prevention. I use Paula&#x27;s Choice Clear Face Wash, which doesn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid of benzoyl peroxide and the aloe serum from the Body Shop and I will using blotting sheets if my skin feels oily through out the day. The problems I had with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide is that they dried and irritated my skin and my skin would get even oilier because of it. Now I don&#x27;t even use it at all and my skin is almost clear and it&#x27;s soft! I honestly will never stop using my Tanda as a way to help my breakouts. If it wasn&#x27;t for the Tanda Clear I would still be breaking out like crazy! I wash my face and I feel how much smoother it is with no bumps. I have gone a couple days without using my Tanda and will get a couple breakouts, so I know for sure the Tanda Clear works! If you feel like it&#x27;s a hoax and don&#x27;t feel like spending over a hundred bucks on it I would suggest you try the Tanda Zap first, because that&#x27;s what sold me on the Clear.</li>
    <li> I think it does actually help, but even with the rechargeable battery it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all! Wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> there is no magic in it. u have to really constantly use it as often as u can then u can see the effect... however the price is really reasonable with such effect....</li>
    <li> I had a major breakout on my chin during Christmas, I had about 10 pimples, and a few of them were really big and painful. I was very desperate to find a solution, so I started google about ointments and other methods to reduce the pimples, and somehow this Tanda Clear Plus device showed up on my search. After reading many positive reviews on Amazon, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the day I received the device, I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for over 2 months now, and I definitely see an improvement on my skin. Somewhere on the manual it says the device can prevent acnes, I don&#x27;t know how true this is, as the pimples still pop up from time to time. But to be fair, I don&#x27;t use it daily, I only use it when I have pimples. When using this device on new pimples, they do heal a LOT faster, and the size are much smaller. I will definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but I was so pleasantly surprised at how well this has been working I felt compelled to.  It has kept my skin clear in the areas I&#x27;ve treated and has hasted the disappearance of any pimples that have popped up.  I only use once a day and noticed a decrease in oiliness and improvement in texture right away.  I&#x27;ve stopped using other topical treatments as a result.  I&#x27;ve been fighting acne for 20+ years and have tried EVERYTHING. So far this works great and doesn&#x27;t cause redness or dryness like other treatments.</li>
    <li> Please be careful with this product! I ordered it through MyHabit because it was a very good deal. I used it the first night and noticed the next morning it had actually \\&quot;drawn up\\&quot; the pimples on my face. I thought, okay, maybe that&#x27;s the process...draws it up to the surface than kills it? Anyway, I used it the next night again and the pimples that surfaced actually started bleeding!!! I washed my face thoroughly and woke up the next morning to find that the pimples/pores that were bleeding had discharge coming out. It was not only gross, but also very painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product didn&#x27;t do anything to improve my skin, in fact, it aggravated the parts that were perfectly normal and left the existing acne untouched/unimproved. I don&#x27;t think bleeding/discharge on the face is what any girl wants, especially since it could leave scars.I would give it zero stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I&#x27;m near that 40-ish mark where your hormones start to make weird things happen with your skin.  To wit: I never had bad acne until about a year ago - just a few spots here or there at that time of the month.  They&#x27;d go away in a few days, no harm, no foul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the \\&quot;change of life\\&quot; - holy smokes, the havoc you wreak on my skin!  Like other ladies on here, I&#x27;m getting deep, painful, red blemishes around my chin that stay for weeks, leave horrible marks (and one scar so far - working on that now with Bio-Oil), just about never come to the surface, and are super embarrassing.  I&#x27;ve never worn makeup, but I actually felt the need to start doing some coverup work due to these nasties (with Bare Minerals - another miracle product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, on to the Tanda.  I got it within 2 days of ordering (thanks Amazon Prime) and already had 3 deep, sore blemishes that never broke the skin and had been hanging around for over 2 weeks with no sign of healing.  I didn&#x27;t wait for it to charge - I promptly read the directions, plugged it in, and used it while watching TV.  It was warm but not hot, and kind of relaxing and buzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly - IT WORKED.  The next morning I woke up and one was totally gone.  The other two had flattened and didn&#x27;t hurt anymore.  I hadn&#x27;t even had my morning coffee yet and I grabbed that Tanda to rezap them.  By lunchtime the second one was just about gone.  The third one, the most stubborn, took 2 more zaps but it&#x27;s also history.  What is great is that NONE of these suckers ever came to a head - so no broken skin, no bleeding, no pain, no scabs or scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s worth every penny to not have the pain, embarrassment, and potential scarring from these horrible \\&quot;change of life\\&quot; blemishes.  I wish I had discovered this a couple of years ago and will be recommending it to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of embarrassing in itself to post this review to the world and talk about my skin trouble - but if the other ladies before me hadn&#x27;t shared their experience, I wouldn&#x27;t have discovered this gem.  So - ladies - try it, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - A MONTH LATER (FEB 19) I am still loving this thing.  It&#x27;s stopped the cycle of blemishes where I used to get them, and it&#x27;s effective on the odd hormonal blemish that pops up.  I would give this 10 stars if I could...what a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Sept 2013 - Still using the Tanda and it still works like magic.  I use it proactively on my chin before \\&quot;that time\\&quot; of the month and I rarely break out.  If I do have a rare under the skin bump or breakout, the Tanda zaps it in one or two treatments.  I am so happy with this product!in trouble - but if the other ladies before me hadn&#x27;t shared their experience, I wouldn&#x27;t have discovered this gem.  So - ladies - try it, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - A MONTH LATER (FEB 19) I am still loving this thing.

    <li> Love this...i am getting desperate as things seem to pop out of hand from time to time.  This seems to do the trick.  Definitely worth the price as one facial alone is this much.  Clear instructions, easy to use.  Charges quickly...overnight for me.</li>
    <li> This product worked as promised.  Very pleased with the results! Used on multiple occasions and the acne cleared up quickly and prevented additional outbreaks.</li>
    <li> I like the design, you can do the treatment when you are moving around. I tried for three weeks, it works 50% of the time, it cleared out some small acne quickly but for big ones not really, there were couple times that it actually made acne worse, so I think it must depends on the type of acne. Another thing I am not a big fan for is that i need to push it a bit hard on my face so that the light can be triggered, but it leaves imprint on my face, although marks fade out within 10 - 15 mins, this limit my use in the morning since I don&#x27;t want to go to work with imprint on my face. So overall, if you have the right type of acne, it should work as it claims.</li>
    <li> Well I was skeptical, especially because of the price. I am 61 and you would think I would not have blemishes...but I do get breakouts. I swear when I use this product it does help the blemishes heal quicker. It is not a miracle but for my it works.</li>
    <li> I have been acne-prone since age 13, and only whipped the problem when I went on Accutane in my 30s.  Although my face has been clear since then, I&#x27;ve never been able to wear moisturizer because it would cause breakouts to reappear.  Now that I am approaching 50, the wrinkles and fine lines have started to set in, and I really wanted to start using face creams for wrinkles.  I tried quite a few including many in fancy department store lines (Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clinique) and some drugstore products (Olay) without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I discovered this blue light, and in the 6 weeks of using it twice a day, I am happy to report that I can use some light-weight wrinkle creams without breaking out.  I benefitted greatly from the book &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me&amp;#34; for advice on lightweight wrinkle products for aging, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to add that my husband, who normally has no trouble with breakouts, did get a zit that would not heal but kept cycling back again and again for nearly a year.  Benzoyl peroxide was no help, and BHA-9 helped to a degree.  This blue light together with BHA-9 was finally the combination we needed to get that zit to go away!  We both are grateful that a light so gentle to skin can be lethal to acne bacteria.</li>
    <li> I had to return my first one because it didn&#x27;t vibrate. The replacement doesn&#x27;t get warm until the second treatment (more than 3 minutes). I don&#x27;t think it is helping to prevent rosacea bumps but it may make them heal faster.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this and try it out. But it actually made my skin worse. Im writing this because if your like me I feel bad for you! I&#x27;m not paid to right this review, my methods are things to make at home. I have really oily skin with breakouts that hurt. And ever since I got pregnant and had a baby I have bad acne.&lt;br /&gt;So if your like me, here&#x27;s what I do that has finally helped the oily part, I do the Oil Cleansing Method (OCM). Look it up online. I use dove soap before using. Then half olive oil, half castor oil, few drops of vitamin E oil and few of tea tree oil. When my face hurts and there&#x27;s lots of red, i do a mask of crushed up aspirin, water and honey. Then I use Clinics acne solutions cream to help fight the acne.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot to do, but it works for me. The OCM has literally been the only miracle to stop the oiliness. I thought it was crazy, but stuck with it. And now my skin is dry! I still need the clinic cream, but at least I&#x27;m not oily anymore.</li>
    <li> I had two bulging pimples that would not come to a head and were ugly and sore, after using this twice in one day they were flat and smooth to the skin the next morning!  They weren&#x27;t gone just deeply improved!</li>
    <li> I love the concept of this product, however this is my second one!  First one stop vibrating, and the second one now stops after about 23 - 30 seconds.  Ugh.  Expensive product for it to quit so easily.</li>
    <li> I bought the Tanda from costco, and it did help A LOT with my acne.  However, after 3 weeks the device started to make strange noises that made me think it was going to stop working shortly, so I returned it and ordered a new unit.  The new unit started over-heating and loosing betterie charge the very first day I used it.  So I returned it again.  No need to say I am very disappointed since it was actually improving my skin, but it&#x27;s so cheaply made that it doesn&#x27;t last.  Good thing I got it from costco where returns are so easy!</li>
    <li> Seems to do well with small pimples - but can produce large ones...</li>
    <li> I was religious about using this day and night. its extremely time consuming. It took about an hour out of my day, but i persisted for two months. The main difference i noticed in my skin was an onslaught of blackheads and whiteheads straight away. I&#x27;d never had this before. I thought i might just be &#x27;purging&#x27; so I had them extracted, but they persisted for about two months until I eventually stopped using the device. Ive extracted them all now, and now that I&#x27;m not using the device, my pores look normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my original problems with ordinary pimples, well that sorta seemed generally unchanged throughout the period I used the tanda. Its hard to say. I was still getting pimples and I didn&#x27;t really fee like they were going away any faster than before. Maybe I was getting less new big red pimples, quantity wise - But my face was ridden with tiny little bumps. It wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Wow is so miracle how this product clean my skin , if you reading this don&#x27;t think about buying this product buy it is the best thing you can do to yourself every penny wort it ... I also got the small size and this one.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about using a device like this and it working.  After about 1.5- 2 weeks of using Tanda twice a day I started noticing my skin becoming smoother. . after about a month, my skin had become clearer, smoother, and my pore size shrank a little!  When I did have a breakout it didn&#x27;t seem to be as bad as I was used to.  To see results I needed to be very consistent with using it at least once a day, but somethings I just didn&#x27;t feel like sitting there holding this device to my face.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this to adults who suffer from some light acne and larger pore size.  The device itself is nice, compact, and travels well.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Feel great on the skin and definitely helps with the redness. Do not strictly rely on this to fix your acne however because it probably won&#x27;t. Go see a dermo!</li>
    <li> Works, but not without lots of effort.&lt;br /&gt;Those reviewers who stated that you have to spend half an hour twice per day putting the light onto your facial areas (unless you have only one area where you have a blemish) were absolutely spot on!  (If you have only a small area to treat, of course it takes less time.)&lt;br /&gt;After using this for more than a month, I can only concur with those earlier reviews.  It does become frustratingly time consuming.  When I use it diligently, I notice a small improvement.  The blemishes clear faster than usual.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try the red light with the blue light as I&#x27;ve read research which shows that this is a little more effective with the inflammation control as well as killing some of the pimple bacteria (where the blue light comes in).</li>
    <li> We have had it for 2 months and can not tell if it makes a difference or not.  I think it makes a bit of a difference and you have to use it exactly as it says.</li>
    <li> I like the Clear+ and have seen a definite improvement in my skin.  Less breakouts and shorter ones when they occur.  My issue is when I first got it, I had to really press the device hard against my face to get it to work.  It doesn&#x27;t say anywhere on the instructions that a decent amount of pressure is needed to start the device.  After a few uses,  moderate pressure has been enough.  So if you think your device is defective, try pressing it really hard to get it started and stay working.</li>
    <li> *I&#x27;ve been documenting my experience with my new Tanda Clear Plus. You can find my video reviews and more information about blue light therapy here: TandaReview{dot}com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy that I discovered the Tanda Clear plus. I didn&#x27;t really know much about blue light therapy until I came across the Tanda website. Its amazing to see so many people have positive results. I love that it&#x27;s non invasive and actually tackles the bacteria under my skin. I suffer from a lot of clogged pores and overly oily skin. This product actually zaps the bacteria out of the clogged pores so that it can decrease in size, heals the inflammation and redness, and promotes an even skin tone. The oil production on my face has been greatly reduced too. I love how easy it is to use and how many treatments you get out of one head. For the price and the results, it&#x27;s really an amazing deal. Every day my skin is getting clearer and softer. Finally! :)</li>
    <li> I am in my late thirties, and I have been battling painful stress and allergy induced acne for a few months.  At one point my face was so inflamed that it was deformed!  I saw this product and reviews and decided to give it a try.  From the first session, I could feel the difference.  It reduces the size of the blemish for immediate relief.  It does not stop new blemishes from forming, but it decreases the size and duration.  The only draw back for me is the over-heating after 6 uses.  Depending on the area you want to cover, you may have to pause to let the unit cool down.  The battery life is good, and being able to use it connected to the outlet is key.</li>
    <li> I have had pretty bad cystic acne for about 4 months and can&#x27;t figure out where it is coming from. I have tried a series of photofacials and microderm but only the Tanda is really helping. It is great that I can do it at home the second a new inflammation shows up I just use the Tanda Clear and it goes away by the next day! I do have a lot of scarring and redness that it is not taking away but I ordered the red light for the unit and hopefully it works for that just like the blue light works for the acne.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece.  I love everything about it so far.  It covers a larger surface than other ones and automatically turns off when you move it and after 3 mins (and beeps every 30 secs).  And it has a nice charger stand.</li>
    <li> My son is 14 years old and very self conscious about his acne and keeps to a daily cleaning regimen.  I bought the regular Tanda 50% off and thought I would give it a try. He loved it and notice a difference within 24 hours. The original tanda used batteries and gave you 2,000 uses. I am ordering the Tanda clear to replace the original.</li>
    <li> I struggle with acne and seriously have tried everything. Mine is hormone induced acne and I am that person that nothing works for. This works! No joke! I even did a test where I did it on my face but did not do it on one particular zit. That zit was there forever while the rest of them disappeared in a few days. I really thought that was BS but it&#x27;s not!</li>
    <li> I was admittedly skeptical but have tried a plethora of products to clear up some mild hormonal break outs to no avail so I gave the Tanda a shot. It has been amazing. I won&#x27;t say that I never get pimples anymore but it definitely helps clear them up quickly.  I had one particularly problematic spot on my chin that has not had the magnitude of issues I was experiencing in months prior.  I purposely waited several months to write a review because I wasn&#x27;t to be sure it was the Tanda and not just a lucky break. I&#x27;m very satisfied and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Tanda Zap is the mini version of the Tanda Clear. The Zap will get rid of a zit in 2-3 days for me. You can really see a difference. This Tanda Clear thing doesn&#x27;t really do anything. I thought it would save time because it has a larger light, but it&#x27;s cycle is 3 minutes, instead of 2 minutes like the Zap. So it doesn&#x27;t really save time and it doesn&#x27;t really kill zits. Overall I think I wasted money on it.</li>
    <li> Have seen zero improvement unfortunately. The blue light used in salons show results the next day but even after several days nothing seems to be happening. I missed my return window by 3 days apparently... Was going to try to return it. There&#x27;s $100 down the drain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this device for ... maybe two years. It&#x27;s effective on what I would call cystic-type acne. The ones that are red, sore, raised and seem to last forever. I get a couple of these every month and without the tanda, they are really bad for about 10 days, then take another 20 days to fully resolve. Tanda says you&#x27;ll see improvement with one 3-minute treatment, but this hasn&#x27;t been my experience. When I first notice the soreness and very small raised area, I treat it 4 or more times daily for 5 or 6 days. It cuts the &#x27;bad&#x27; days down from 10 to about maybe  3 or 4; and full resolution within about 10 - 15 days. So, taken altogether, it cuts the nastiness about in half. I have fairly sensitive skin, but have never had any problems associated with using the tanda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the treatment head becomes ineffective long before the lights go out on it. For me, a new head is effective for about two or 2.5 months. So, at about $50 per head, that&#x27;s around $300 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have two of the devices (one was purchased at a time when it was especially hard to get the replacement heads, and I bought a whole new device for about $65 on e-bay because that was cheaper than I could find a replacement head). Anyway, one of the devices overheats much more quickly than the other one. After maybe 15 minutes, compared to maybe 25 minutes. It&#x27;s not a huge problem but suggests to me there&#x27;s some variability in the manufacturing.</li>
    <li> My new Tanda blue light is doing what years of antibiotics could not accomplish--a clear face!</li>
    <li> I liked the product and used it for about 3 weeks and did notice a difference in my skin and then the unit stopped emitting the blue light and I had to return it.</li>
    <li> It didnt work at all. Waste of money, for me. Hope it works for you though.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 5 months ago. It arrived properly but covered with dust. At the beginning, it works ok. After 4 months, the battery starts not working. Initially it worked only once after charging. After a couple of weeks, it didn&#x27;t work even just after charging. I tried to contact seller. But no response to my email. Be careful when you buy this.</li>
    <li> OK, I am surprised that it works. The science behind it sounds a bit optimistic, but the darn thing worked and shortened the duration of  cyst-like blemishes. I seem to re-live puberty during high stress periods, and this is able to kill them off before they take hold and require weeks to clear. I think it&#x27;s worth spending the extra on the \\&quot;Clear Plus\\&quot; as opposed to the \\&quot;Zap\\&quot;. You can easily align the Clear and do something else while treating. You would have to be more precise with the Zap to make sure it aligns and does not move off target.</li>
    <li> The device works and I did like it however it&#x27;s not going to clear your skin alone if not supported by other actions on your end. That&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars. You will need the right cleanser, facial care, nutriton, and supplements. That being said, let&#x27;s assume you have a few break-outs going on right now. What do you do? Flash the blue light on the affected areas (I did up to 20 minutes each break out twice a day) and in a couple of days you should see the flare down size and eventually vanish. The light pulsing is pleasantly warm and unless you are sensitive to light - test somewhere on your arm before you do on your face - it should not experience any redness. I have very sensitive skin and I looked fine even after long sessions. I did improve but would I buy it again? Not sure. For the price you probably would expect faster and more definite results.</li>
    <li> 4/18/14: As a follow-up to my unhappy post from yesterday, the device finally fully charged and I was able to use it both last night &amp; this morning. Woot! I&#x27;ve upgraded my rating to \\&quot;it&#x27;s OK\\&quot; for now.  Still hoping for an \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; within the next week or two. Will keep y&#x27;all posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/17/14:  I received the system yesterday around 6 pm &amp; immediately began charging the unit. When I checked the unit an hour later, I found that the orange light was off &amp; the unit had quit charging. Thinking that I somehow incorrectly placed the device on the charging base, I rearranged the device &amp; made sure the orange \\&quot;charging\\&quot; light was on before leaving for the gym. When I got home, I expected the light to have turned green &amp; the device to be ready for use.  Instead, neither the orange nor the green light was on. I rearranged the device AGAIN and made sure the orange light was on before turning in for the night. Again, I expected the device to be fully charged when I woke up this morning and ready for use, however, this morning, NEITHER LIGHT WAS ON AND THE UNIT WAS NOT CHARGING. I&#x27;ve had it for less than 24 hours and I&#x27;m already ticked &amp; regretting this $112 purchase.  When I left the house this morning, the device was, again, \\&quot;charging\\&quot;.  Pffft...riiight.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.  Fool me, um, three or four times, return the item whence it came. Hopefully, when, or should I say \\&quot;IF\\&quot; I ever get to actually use this device, my rating will change from \\&quot;I hate it\\&quot; to \\&quot;I love it\\&quot;, because right now, I&#x27;m REALLY hating it.</li>
    <li> I developed cystic acne suddenly at 22 and nothing seemed to help with preventing breakouts, pitted scars or the redness. I also travel internationally a lot and needed something light to carry with my to help with breakouts when I&#x27;m on the go. I never thought anything would work so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being prescribed every drug available for acne, trying Proactiv, and every different drugstore product, I finally found a combination that works for my skin. Between this Tanda, Clenziderm foaming cleanser, occasional salicylic acid 20% peels, and the Kendal diamond microdermabrasion kit, my skin has changed radically. The deep, ice pick scars have faded, there is very little redness, and my breakouts are significantly reduced to the point of occasional pimples. I love it and would recommend it to anyone struggling with acne.</li>
    <li> It appears to be working!  She uses it religiously and I can see the results.  It works best when combined with other supplements as it seems to reduce outbreaks and speed healing.</li>
    <li> First off, it&#x27;s very time-consuming. I&#x27;ve now owned this for about a year now, but I&#x27;ve only used it for maybe 2 out of the 12 months (consecutive). Here&#x27;s a breakdown of my experience with the Tanda device:&lt;br /&gt;–It&#x27;s very time-consuming if you suffer from all-over acne like me. I&#x27;ve got a zit here, a zit there, dispersed just out of reach to overlap. Also, my acne isn&#x27;t constant (it&#x27;s hormonal), and this doesn&#x27;t work as well once you&#x27;ve broken out—more of a preventative measure. So because I can&#x27;t predict where my acne will strike next, I&#x27;ve got to zap/light all the problem areas. It&#x27;s a few minutes here and there, and there—then repeat, because I recommend doing it back to back, which you can. Those minutes add up. I&#x27;d guess around 30–40 minutes a day, every day for best results. Yes, you could watch TV while doing this, but you gotta crank it up pretty loud to get past the humming electric noise buzzing on your face.&lt;br /&gt;–The first one I received was damaged. There was a slight chip at the corner of the top, which caused me to press hard to get it to activate. I was able to exchange it without issue, though.&lt;br /&gt;–Works best on solid skin surface, so areas like the chin, nose or at angles where it&#x27;s not fully pressed against the face, it doesn&#x27;t work well because the light won&#x27;t activate. My acne is exactly in areas like this, so it was a bit tedious and awkward trying to get the light to activate.&lt;br /&gt;–I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, so fortunately it didn&#x27;t irritate it any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth that much work/hassle/cost for &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34; results for my situation. It might be better suited for acne sufferers who have clusters on the cheeks or forehead and is constant (not hormonal).</li>
    <li> My blemishes started clearing up after a week. I use it teice a day morning anc evening! Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing it advertised on The Doctors. It is remarkable and has worked very well. I would highly recommend this device for anyone struggling with acne.</li>
    <li> This device really works.  I&#x27;ve had worsening rosacea and adult acne for several years now and it&#x27;s the only thing that has made a difference...tried topical treatments and oral antibiotics.  I noticed improvement after only two days using the Tanda.  I was developing several new blemishes almost every day, and after about a month of treatments, I now get only 1-2 per week.  Redness from rosacea is also much better; I was concerned that the gentle heat would make it worse, but it hasn&#x27;t.  The only issue with the device is minor.  It has an automatic shut-off feature if it&#x27;s not touching your skin, and sometimes you have to apply a bit of pressure and you end up with the imprint of the treatment surface on your skin, but it goes away in about 15 minutes so it&#x27;s not a major issue.  I am so glad I found this device.</li>
    <li> My son is 15 years old and has had pretty bad acne for about a year now. It&#x27;s not cystic acne, but the superficial kind. We have tried many different creams from the dermatologist as well as many different skin cleaning regimes to little or no avail. I happened to see this on Amazon and decided to buy. Wow! After about 4 days to a week of him using it diligently, his acne is at least 80% better. He no longer feels self conscious. I just bought another one a few minutes ago for my daughter, who has just started little break outs. I&#x27;m so happy there is something so simple to help teenagers! Thank you Tanda!!!</li>
    <li> Since I was 13 (now 24) I have struggled with acne. I tried EVERYTHING and NEVER found anything that even remotely stopped it / let alone controlled it. And believe me, I tried EVERYTHING. I was basically to the point where I wanted to give up, because NOTHING ever worked. BUT! I saw an infomercial about this, and figured, \\&quot;well, what do I have to lose?\\&quot; So I ordered it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This product is AMAZING! It does not stop you from breaking out altogether, but it REALLY helps to control your breakouts. And let me tell you! It is such a great feeling, because now when I wake up and have a huge zit before a big day, I don&#x27;t even fret, I just pull out my Tanda Clear+ and do two treatments in a row, and the zit is almost completely gone! This product takes the power away from the acne, and gives it right back to you! Which is exactly where it belongs! Ladies, you need to try this, because if you&#x27;re anything like me, YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! AND IT WILL WORK WONDERS FOR YOUR FACE!!</li>
    <li> I used it religiously and it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and i will get a break out, especially from waxing some area&#x27;s like my brows or a hair or two that i find on my chin...well, i put this on them, and they seriously go away in a few treatments.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt whatsoever, actually feels good.  directions were very easy to follow and arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Totally cleared up an underground zit before it could become noticable - not as drying as topical treatments and works better.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s helped my skin a little. I think it&#x27;s helped them not become so sever, but not eliminate them. It had also left dark spots on occasion!</li>
    <li> This is a zit miracle worker, love it!</li>
    <li> I waited a while to review this product. First, you have my anecdote that it works. As a mild acne suffered with spot problems, I would say worth every penny. Second, the product hardware I received was flawed in the sense that it only works when plugged into the A/C adapter, it does not charge and thus the charging stand they give you is useless. Hence the minus -1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly though, it didn&#x27;t bother me enough to ask for another product or contact customer service because ultimately it gets the job done. For me personally it works best when used regularly, but it doesn&#x27;t miraculously banish zits after one use, but it does break cycles of blemishes and lets you enjoy clear skin. If you want more info, there are some great PubMed articles on blue light therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I say buy it.</li>
    <li> I got this due to medication induced hormonal cystic-like acne that I get sporadically - or a bit of regular pimples here and there. The one good thing I thiiiink I found it did was even out my oil balance. For instance, my lower face would be dry and flaky often and my lower forehead and creases of my nose would be more oily. Either way I sent it back because It didn&#x27;t really do what it said. It didn&#x27;t prevent future acne, and the ones I did get wouldn&#x27;t disappear very fast at all. It didn&#x27;t make anything worse, to me however, it&#x27;s that you spend about an hour in the morning and about an hour in the evening (give or take) and that&#x27;s way too time consuming. Before work, on vacation, work it around your plans, it&#x27;s dreading to have to do it for so long. They don&#x27;t tell you this - I was under the impression you moved the whole device over your face for the 3 minute span, but you have to hold it in one spot for the whole 3 minutes and then move to a new spot and do it all over again. And they recommend you do this even where you don&#x27;t have acne so none forms. And even suggest on trouble spots that you can do more than once...so that&#x27;s at least 12 - 3 minute sessions minimum, you do the math. Also since it&#x27;s a flat device, when using it on your rounded forehead even if you&#x27;re not pressing hard, but enough to activate it, it leaves a temporary imprint and you&#x27;ll look like a golf ball.&lt;br /&gt;With all of this, I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable improvement, so I feel my money would be better spent somewhere else, so I shipped it back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to people maybe - only if they have very mild acne or excess amounts of time or money to spend.</li>
    <li> The Tanda Clear + is easy to use.  Feels calm and warm on the face. Helps to quickly heal active acne spots and helps prevent new breakouts. Saw an improvement in my skin even after 4 uses. Would recommend this seller and this product.  One note: It is louder than I expected it to be. It makes a somewhat loud buzzing noise as you are using it.  However, in my opinion this is not a reason not to buy this product.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend gets HUGE cystic acne around her cheeks and chin that last for days and days. We had tried everything but nothing would help them go away faster. I saw the TANDA Clear Plus at Ulta for almost $200 and it shows that its a great product. So I found it on Amazon for a lot cheaper and decided to try it out. I was very surprised to find that it actually worked. As long as she uses it daily, her acne began to clear up faster and she wasn&#x27;t developing new pimples.</li>
    <li> I bought this last night wondering if it would help with my cystic acne. I am a 42 woman that has hormonal acne. I used it for a few minutes on my face and today the cystic breakout has been reduced. This definitely works!!</li>
    <li> I had horrible adult acne 4 years ago. I was even on diuretics to lower my hormones. So I was peeing often and it can be embarrassing in certain situations to constantly have to get up to use the restroom. I saw this at Nordstrom&#x27;s with the red light piece together, $375. So expensive but nothing was helping me.&lt;br /&gt;Well this device cleared up my face. I was using it twice in every spot. I would do it while driving (on the highway) and covered the excess light with my hand while holding it, or watching TV. It&#x27;s time consuming. 3 minutes doesn&#x27;t seem that long but it is when you do 2 cycles in each spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. If I felt a pimple growing, in the morning I would use the light on it twice or three times. By the evening, it would either be gone, formed a blackhead, or still slightly under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: takes time and battery stopped holding a charge after 2 years. So I can no longer take it with me unless I have access to an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I keep it plugged in on my bedside and used it in bed. I tend to fall asleep with it and then the beep wakes me up. For some reason it&#x27;s quite soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the blue calms inflammation. I&#x27;ve used it on mosquito and ant bites before to help them heal faster. :)</li>
    <li> Broke before seeing any results. I heard blue and red lights are good but I would buy a different one,</li>
    <li> I bought the system from Sophora  a year or so ago but thought I would buy without having to go to the store...MISTAKe</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a few times a week for a few weeks, the first few times I used it, a zit bump that has been on my nose for years, just dried up and cleared, I did not think I could do anything to get rid of it at all. that made me a believer of the power of light therapy.</li>
    <li> Well, for me at least, this is no miracle cure for my acne like I had hoped. I did notice a reduction in size after a few sessions, and they went away a little faster. But it definitely doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected for the price. Im not super glad that I bought it or completely disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product works as directed.  However, one has to commit the time to using this product.  The area of light is small relative to the surface of your face, and you have to use the Tanda for 3 minutes per area, ideally twice a day.  Realistically, a session could take 30 minutes twice a day for the best results.  Once a day also will work, but again, you have to have the time to do this.  This Tanda is larger which is not conducive to a small curved area such as the nose.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone with problems with acne. If you are consistent using it, it will do all that it promises.</li>
    <li> very fast delivery, took only one week to come from overseas. great product, very happy with it, it does just what it says, it really works with clearing acne and preventing new ones.</li>
    <li> Stopped vibrating just after the 30 day trial period. Called TANDA customer service, and they use a call center--no one with any connection to the product. Left messages several times, emailed, no response. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Nothing happened. I&#x27;be tried for almost a month. Day and night.&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any change happening.&lt;br /&gt;Too disappointing!</li>
    <li> This device has made a huge difference on my cystic acne. I use it right on the onset of a breakout, 2X daily and I&#x27;ve noticed it really prevents breakouts from forming, and speeds up the healing of existing acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you open the box all you have to do is plug it in and charge it for 24 hours. After that using it is as simple as turning it on, pressing it gently against the area you are treating and wait for it to shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice an excessive heat or any thing.</li>
