<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best masque ever!!  It smells great and leaves your skin soft and vibrant.  It softens fine lines around the eyes and reduces pores better than any other masque I have tried for the price.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> My face feels different after i used it</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this product and will have to say I like it. I use it on my face and belly! My skin feels nice and smooth when I wash it off. Use it every morning and night.</li>
    <li> Very good! Makes my skin feel soft. Great price!</li>
    <li> My pores feel clearer since starting to use it and only used it a couple times since I bought it. Waiting to see the results in 30 days.</li>
    <li> Bought for GF who liked it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful face mask.</li>
    <li> I have tried many expensive facial masks, and this mask is my favorite! I use it before a night out &amp; it gives me a very smooth complexion, prior to makeup!    Great price!</li>
    <li> I tried other Queen Helene products and bought this one for my husband as he has dry skin problem. So, one day I decided to give it a try though I have combination skin. First of all, I loved the rose smell and it didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or bad reaction to my skin. After I washed my face, I was almost gonna cry as my face become very smooth. This mud masque even cleared some blackheads. I thought only the Mint Julep masque and the other peel off mask by QH  does that. I am very happy  about this product and now planning to buy the big jar so it can last longer. If I had known about Queen Helen products in my teens,then I would start using them right after I had my very first breakouts. I am confident that within couple months,  my oily and acne prone skin would become clearer and brighter. I am happy that all QH products are very cheap and affordable unlike those organic products out there. So give it a try and you won&#x27;t regret your purchase.</li>
    <li> So as a guy, I never considered using any kind of facial stuff.  Well I was convinced to \\&quot;try\\&quot; a mud masque.  Let me tell you, in just one use, I could definately see an improvement.  If you never used a masque before, its not that bad of a feeling.  But when I was done I could see how my skin was more \\&quot;tight\\&quot;  the effects lasted for about 1 week.  I&#x27;ve done this masque 2 times since then and every time there is a dramatic imrpovement.  I&#x27;d recomend this product over the Green one.  [[ASIN:B00008CMOQ Queen Helene Masque, Mint Julep - 8 oz]]</li>
    <li> I love clay masks. This one is affordable and contains bentonite, which in this day in age is important for one reason: radiation. We clever humans are bombarded on a daily basis by radiation by computers and cell phones, and hey, now we have the nuclear situation in Japan, which whether you like it or not affects the health of the world, let&#x27;s not kid ourselves. The good news is there are various ways to protect ourselves, do a little research. One is bentonite clay. You can and should take it in pill form, but smearing it on your face acts as a form of detox and cleans your pores in the process. The only issue I see with this particular brand is the Propylene Glycol that is in it. It is unhealthy and has a drying affect, which my combination skin does not like at all. I also have sensitive skin. For that reason, I will be looking for a more soothing, more natural brand. My skin looks better for about a day after using this, which is why I only use it before events (weddings, etc)otherwise I get blemishes later. I think it is because the crud gets sucked out of my pores and ends up either getting partially stuck on the way out or just reeks havoc upon leaving my skin. Also, it makes my nose pores ooze oil for a bit. I find that annoying. This formula irritates me a little, like a mild burning sensation, which I am sure they could find a way to make that problem disappear by just removing the harsh glycol. I am thinking of messing with it, adding an ingredient to fix it somehow.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the makers read my review and did something. I can dream, can&#x27;t I?</li>
    <li> Great masque... I use it once a week together with my husband. We both love it. It is just great, strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> This mask works really well &amp; is a great value. Has a light rose fragrance to it. It seems to be unavailable through this site, but you can try the regular drugstore if you&#x27;re looking for it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this once or twice for my facial and love it! It&#x27;s recommend if  you need some pamper and don&#x27;t judge it&#x27;s prices. It&#x27;s smell nice and turn harden as I leave it on for awhile then wash it out, result in smooth, simple nice smell on my skin. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love this mask! I use it once or twice a week, depending on how much time I have. My skin feels great, fresh, and clean! I&#x27;m only 25 so I don&#x27;t have sagging skin- but it does feel tighter after i use it! And I love it! I&#x27;d also recommend the Mint Jute face mask!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, I don&#x27;t put a thick layer on my face and it still has the same effect. It feels funny on my skin at first but after rinsing it I can really feel it making my face tight, I feel very refreshed after using it! After a hard days work, use this and you will feel very refreshed right away!</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing! When I use it, I feel exactly as refreshed as if I had a salon facial! :) I recommend it very happily.</li>
    <li> I love this mud mask. For me it&#x27;s really refreshing. My skin becomes softer after applying this mask. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> really like this product</li>
    <li> Queen helene products are very good! they have been around for at least 30 years and these days with so much competition and consumers trying to get the most for their money it shows how good of a product this is .... skin care fads come and go just like everything else but the really great ones stick around...this  is a great product !!! if you are tired of wasting your money! give it a try ! if you like mint there is a mint julep also!!!</li>
    <li> this mudd masks works really well and dosent cost that much.  i purchased it from walmart.  it leaves your skin smooth , clean, and it dosent over dry.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this! I&#x27;ve used the Mint Julep Mask from Queen Helene and thought that worked great, but the mud mask makes my face feel even smoother.  I&#x27;m very dependent on wearing makeup, but this mud mask makes me feel confident enough to wear light to no makeup. I have some wrinkle lines between my eyes from squinting, and concentrating on my computer screen.  I feel like with a few uses this has made the skin look firmer.  The only down-side about it is that I don&#x27;t care for scents, and this has a scent of rose petals. It gave me a bit of a headache the first time I wore it.  Please note, however, that I am VERY sensitive to smells.</li>
    <li> Been around a long time and with good reason, it works! Read an interview in a magazine with Tyra Banks and other super models who swear by this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, works good, inexpensive ~  try it!</li>
    <li> I love queen helene masks. I have tried the hydrating mask with olive oil and the mint julep and this. This one leaves the skin so soft and glowing. My husband could tell the difference without knowing that i had applied a mask..</li>
    <li> this product is great but the application is a bit hard. The rosy smell doesnt bother me that much because like any other mask,there will be at least scents of the sulfur. Overall, great product and does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely general mild mud masque!  It cleans, and makes pores and skin smoother, yet it is gentle enough to use twice a week!  I have combo skin, so the areas where I am dry, after shaving I deep moisturize with Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream, and put the masque on that area 10 minutes, before I put it on the rest of my face.  I then, do the rest of the face for ten minutes, use a wash cloth to remove, and rinse.  It smoothes the pores, and takes all the shaving irritations away!</li>
    <li> Came early, and is amazing !</li>
    <li> This clay masque does wonderful things for my skin. It helps close the pores temporarily, and takes off a bit of dead skin off the top like an exfoliator. My skin will glow for most of the day. My skin feels fresh and super clean, but not dried out, after using this masque. It lasts a long time. It&#x27;s supposed to help with firming, but I must say that I don&#x27;t notice that. Maybe it does help with that, but I don&#x27;t notice it, if it does.</li>
    <li> So far so good, but I didn&#x27;t find too much of a difference between this and the mint masque--and the mint masque smells better! I would recommend either this or the mint.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! I use it once a week and it makes my face feel refreshed, clean, and soft. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it tightens very much, but it&#x27;s nice to use as a way to deep clean your face once a while. It tends to dry your face if you overuse it, so I don&#x27;t recommend using it in dry climates or winter. But otherwise I love it, and I look forward to using it at the end of each week!</li>
    <li> Made my skin red blotchy and break out in a rash :( I have oily skin and applied this after i cleansed my face like it said and my face was still slightly wet so not bone dry but this stuff literally dried my face out immediately i washed it off in about 4 min instead of about 10 bc my skin was burning n hurting and i saw a red mess!!!! I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s worked for other people but this was definitely not for me and it&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> amazing product with low price!</li>
    <li> I truly feel this product working when I ever I use it. My face feels refreshed and relaxed whenever I use it.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive mask.</li>
    <li> When I have the time, I usually like to use a dry clay mask that I mix with water or vinegar. If I&#x27;m pressed for time, I reach for Queen Helene Masque Mud Pack, and it really is good as a fast fix to get out the impurities caused by cosmetics, excess facial oils and the general crud that floats around in the air. If you don&#x27;t currently use a clay mask, this is a great one to start with. You will instantly see a difference when you apply fresh make-up. Very good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked all over for this product in town with no luck. All I wanted was plain old fashioned clay. Well I found it on Amazon. Thanks!  Products works as advertised</li>
    <li> I like the item. But i def LOVE the Mint Julep Masque (by the same company) wayyyy better. This is a good masque but nothing special compare to other mud masque i used. Prob will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only mud mask that i&#x27;ve tried that after you use it, you can actually see an imporovement on your skin! It&#x27;s hard to squirt but that&#x27;s the least of my concerns (its mud after all) oh and it came with vitamin E that you can reorder! Plus Queen Helene is cruelty free :)</li>
    <li> Okay, I am not sure why but there was no seal on my product and some of the mud pack was actually squeezed out of its container and left dry when I first opened it. It almost felt like somebody already used it and then shipped it to me. I am NOT happy with this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice mask for in between , to give your skin a clean feel .  I use it on my husband after a long day of work he loves how his skin feels after .</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 25 years. My daughter now uses this also. Leaves your skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mud mask! Never used this before but took a chance on account of the positive reviews.I tried it on myself first and tonight my Hubby has agreed to let me try it on him. I figure a hot candle lit bath+ massage + a relaxing facial will equal me getting a night out with the girls;)</li>
    <li> Queen Helene has been a favorite product of mine for a coupe of decades. It is very economical and produces great results. I have extremely sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin. The product was extremely cost-effective, well packaged and arrived when promised. I highly recommend the product and seller.</li>
    <li> I like this mask and it lasts awhile, which is really nice. I wish it didn&#x27;t have fragrance in it though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I use it twice a week and I love it!  My son has very oliy skin around his hairline (he&#x27;s 18) He kept getting these BAD outbreaks of pimples around his hairline and on his chin/mouth.  They are gone and the blackheads on my nose were gone after the 2nd use. For best results, throw handfulls of cold water on your face after you wipe the mudpack off. This will close your pores tight and THEN use a light moisturizer.  Simple, cheap and really effective!!</li>
    <li> This product has a rose scent, and gave me a headache.  I had to throw it out for that reason.  Had it been fragrance-free, I&#x27;d have been very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean, beautiful, &amp; fresh! For those of u talking about it drying your face-- I use &amp;#34;clearpores&amp;#34; lotion afterwards. So maybe try some type of face lotion?</li>
    <li> This masque feels nice on your skin, but beyond that it had little benefit for me. It certainly didn&#x27;t help clear my pores, in fact you could see the clay visibly clogging them even after I rinsed the masque off. If your skin is as oily as mine this will not take care of the oil much at all. I felt refreshed right after using it but within a few hours I was back to my normal level of oiliness. Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed. There are several other masques around this price point that work much better than this one for my skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully invigorating, tightening, and softening mask.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years all over my face.  It does wonders to brighten and firm your skin, along with reducing pore size and and puffiness.  Great mask for your neck and decolletage as well, and I often use it before heading out to a special event.  You will feel a warming and tingling upon application and as it starts to dry.  The natural clay stimulates the circulation just below your skin leaving you with a healthy, youthful glow and firmed up, fresh-looking skin.  I do use this product in the shower, however, as will stain clothing, bathroom rugs, and wash cloths.  Otherwise, fantastic mask!</li>
    <li> Right price and good product</li>
    <li> I love this mask. I have been using the expensive masks since I was early 20s. But this one is much better than the ones cost me over $80. My friends told me that I look younger than my younger sister now. hehe... I&#x27;m using it once a week, my skin tone is more even now and skin feels tighter too. I have been using the rose water as toner, they are great combination. Maybe the rose water is doing a good job too, I love them both.</li>
    <li> Great product - feels like I have been at a spa!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Queen Helene products for decades for one big reason...they WORK! This masque is no exception. There is no reason to spend oodles of cash on high end deep pore cleansing masques when this one does the job and then some. After each use my skin feels totally firm and totally sebum-free. I usually add a drop of lavender or peppermint essential oil to the masque which turns it into my own private spa treatment. The lavender calms while the peppermint refreshes. Tea tree oil is great too for more problem skin. A little goes a long way so this tube should last you quite a while.</li>
    <li> Excellent mud mask. I&#x27;ve used a lot  of other brands- expensive and cheap- but this one is really good and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product.  When I was much younger I was a model (both print and runway).  One of the \\&quot;tricks of the trade\\&quot; used to keep skin fresh looking and healthy - for both men and women - in my profession was Queen Helene.  We had info. and access to the best products available, but always came back to this one.      Don&#x27;t waste your money on overpriced masques; this is the real deal!  Great for all types of skin.  Queen Helene products have stood the test of time and will make you look wonderful.  Great prices, too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have very sensitive skin and am careful about what I use. I just live this!! It makes my whole face tighten up and it looks like I have foundation On when I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s terrific!</li>
    <li> love the mud mask!! all the comment are accurate, the price is amazing for the quality of the product.  just let it dry and then wash away nasty face stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright product. It smells a little funny, Mostly like soap but not in a good way.  The mask more like a Clay mask rather than Mud. It&#x27;s a light tan color which was surprising. Also it says it makes your face softer and tighter but I didn&#x27;t feel like it did that for me. Honestly It was a nice product to leave on your face and have fun for a girls night but there was no benefit from it. If you want something that works and smells good I&#x27;d tell you getting the mint version it was way better this this version.</li>
    <li> A good drawing mud mask.</li>
    <li> When I first received the package from the seller I was disappointed to see that I had received the Mint Julep mask instead of the Mud mask. I emailed them about the problem and they sent out the right item right away without any extra charge. I used the mask as soon as I got it and was very impressed. I had been using the AHAVA Dead Sea mud mask and it never made my face look as clean and clear as this one did after one use. I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love queen helene products. Never too harsh for my sensitive skin and always works extremely well. Will continue to buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this works wonders on me. Takes away greasy face and leaves an awesome texture on skin! Loved it! I&#x27;ll probably re-purchase this a like, a lot! I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a week for 6 months and it isn&#x27;t even finished yet.</li>
    <li> I am the first time to use this product. It&#x27;s help lots to cool down my face and smooth after using. It&#x27;s a great product. I will buy more for my sisters.</li>
    <li> Despite the cheap price this is one of the best mud masks I have tried. It&#x27;s a product that actually leaves your skin feeling much tighter. I wouldn&#x27;t apply this product liberally, just doing a nice thin layering and letting it dry. I find that ocassionally it will make my skin feel tingy. I would only use this product once or twice a week thought because it is very drying to the skin.</li>
    <li> I got this mask for Christmas. When I put it on it seemed to sting a little, but this went away soon. As soon as I took it off, it seemed like my pores were smaller! It smells pretty nice too. :)  I&#x27;ve read some reviews saying that this mask dries out your skin, so I went ahead and put some moisturizer on as well. I would get this again, and I would also recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love all queen helen products since i was younger and since they are no longer in drug stores i was so happy to see they are available on amazon, This product is great for once a week usage and it really does make your skin glow and feel tighter. I was very happy that they shipped on time as well.  I would deff repurchase.</li>
    <li> This works very well to brighten the complexion of my skin. Also I notice my skin gets smoother every time I use it. Definitely try this one!!!!</li>
    <li> This makes my face dry and itchy...</li>
    <li> I love this mud mask. It&#x27;s incredible awesome!</li>
    <li> Great seller. Great product. Reasonably price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> this mask i tryed realy helped me with my breakouts  i use it maybie once or twice a week i like it</li>
    <li> awesome product  it tightens my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent customer service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i appreciate  all theyve done for me when i lost my package&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MUST BUY</li>
    <li> Great mask! Tightens my skin and helps my acne. I dont like the smell: cheap rose scent..and its a light brown color..but it works so i give it 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I bought it because of the reviews. I usually don&#x27;t believe in magic masks and I tell you upfront this is not a magic mask but it is really good. I don&#x27;t really have a lot of problems with my face but I like to keep it clean and this mask helps a lot. I bough this one and the mint one for my mom too and she loves them (she says it keeps her face clean and less greasy, don&#x27;t know about the making your sking more tight fact yet). I would def recommend this mask.</li>
    <li> It really works great! I&#x27;m so skeptical about things, but it&#x27;s a wonderful mask. Use it the day of or the night before a big event or party or whatever, and your skin will feel good and look clear. It&#x27;s super cheap too. This will be a beauty staple for me from now on!</li>
    <li> I love the facial masks of Queen Helene. Great quality for a great price. This time I doubted between this one and their other famous facial mask, the Mint mask. After having read the reviews, I decided to buy this one, especially since so many wrote about helping with fine lines, sagging skin, etc. I like this mask, it gives my skin a nice glow, but I wish I had bought the Mint mask, I have bought that one before and the Mint mask really CLEANS my skin, it feel and look so fresh and healthy, which is great for my oily skin.</li>
    <li> I like to switch up my beauty routine and usually mix fruit-based facials for myself, but I like mud as an alternative as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good, cheap, basic product to use once a week. It will leave your skin feeling tighter and will give you a glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually exfoliate my face and neck, then apply this for 30 minutes (yes, a little longer than recommended) and after washing it off, I use my night cream (Olay). That combination leaves my skin looking perfect for 3 days+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for once a week use for normal to oily skin. If you have dry skin, this may make you feel a little too dry. I have used it on my body (dry skin), and I wouldn&#x27;t use it there again.</li>
    <li> This is a good product especially for oily/combination skin. I&#x27;ve been using QH mint julep masque off and on since I was a teen and loved it. Recently while shopping online for the mint julep I ran across this product and decided to give it a try. It works just as well as the mint however as previous reviews stated, it does have a rose scent which may be too much for some. If you don&#x27;t care for rosey scents I would suggest buying the mint julep instead, which I personally prefer for that reason. Still this product is good, leaving skin refreshed and helps give a glowing an even complexion.</li>
    <li> This is a nice face masque, however, I think I like the Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque better.  Maybe it&#x27;s just the Mint Julep scent, because both do a lovely temporary job of refining facial skin.</li>
    <li> Love this mud pack!  Quality product and a great price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mud mask. It doesn&#x27;t sting, dries fast, is easy to wash off, and leaves my face feeling cleaner. The amount in the tube is generous for the price and lasts a long time with normal use.</li>
    <li> definitely not my first time ordering.  this stuff is really good for oily and combination skin.  really takes the oil out of your skin and leaves it supple and refreshed.  highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is a great skin refresher, I will probably always have a bottle. I use when I had a late night, and need to look refreshed, it gives the face a fresh, glowing look, on the average I use about once a week maby 4-5 times a month. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.</li>
    <li> This was just okay. It was very drying on my skin but it did clean my pores.</li>
    <li> This is a great mask.  It does tighten and my skin looked fresher.  It&#x27;s great the night before an event.  The smell is quite rosy, but it is definitely tolerable.  I recommend this mask.  Not only is the price great, but I feel pampered after using it.  I use it about once per week with my other facial treatments.</li>
    <li> I like Queen Helene masks -- I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; one, that smells natural and earthy.  This one works well in terms of making my skin feel clean and clear, but they&#x27;ve loaded it with some kind of perfumey smell. Maybe the clay in its natural state is TOO earthy.. That&#x27;s my only issue with the product.</li>
    <li> This mask is great for relaxing your skin muscles. It gives you the whole spa experience. Very soothing and your skin feels great afterwards. Recommended. Also, there&#x27;s enough in this to last you a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I started using this almost 10 years ago.  It&#x27;s a really no frills product with no weird chemicals in it. It tingles a little when it&#x27;s on.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin at all.  It decreases redness and inflammation in my skin.  After using it, my skin is soft, appears tones and my pores are clean and smaller.</li>
    <li> Must have mask for women and men.  Highly effective and takes minutes, easy to apply and remove.  Also try green one by the same manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 2x since I&#x60;ve got it (once a week) and the only thing I&#x60;ve noticed is a softer face for about 24 hours. I will edit this review in the weeks to come.</li>
    <li> I lOve this butt I hate the smell ...you can see your face glow very good product I will deff buy this again :)</li>
    <li> If you want a clay mask that does the job, low price, then this is what it takes! Queen Helene products are always cheap and effective, don&#x27;t waste time elsewhere!</li>
    <li> I love the mint julep face mask from this brand, and I love how cheap these are. However, if you are looking for a mask that purifies and tightens skin, I find it ironic that the mint julep does a better job in these two categories that this one is especially for.&lt;br /&gt;When you put the mask on it is super flaky and the dry pieces get everywhere. Make sure to leave it on 5-10 minutes longer than it suggests. My skin felt softer and more moisturized, and I think this would be the better of the two for sensitive skin, but don&#x27;t buy it to tighten.</li>
    <li> Ok I have had quite a problem with my skin not being smooth and having moderate acne, but this product is truly amazing for me. I put it on every night and leave it on for about 20 to 15 minutes, and after I wash it off the result is immediate. My skin feels amazingly smooth and feels really clean. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but do not be fooled this is an amazing product! I could not be happier, and I will be a returning customer to the Queen Helene products, im so pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> This is a magical product.  I use it once a week and it improves my skin tone and tighten my pores.  I look and feel younger.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Definitely removes oil and impurities from the skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mud mask for a long time! I had one that I don&#x27;t remember the name and was excellent. This product is good enough to refresh my skin and keep it soft. Also smell good. Good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this twice since i&#x27;ve recieved it and it really is amazing. It&#x27;s simple, effective, and makes my skin super soft afterwards! I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a face mask that is clay/mud substance and i love it! Definitely worth $5.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Love it!</li>
    <li> this ws okay i personally like the mint masks the queen helene makes alot better than this one.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my cousin. And she likes it a lot. It is really good to use and makes your face comfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several mud masks over the years.  I have acne prone skin and using these once a week tends to minimize the breakouts.  I&#x27;ve used this mask twice so far and my breakouts have increased.  Also, it smells like something my grandmother would use.  I&#x27;m 32 and it just doesn&#x27;t appeal to me.  I&#x27;ll give it another shot and update my review based on those results.  If it still doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll be switching back to my old products I purchased at Target.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable after use, and the skin feels soft, moisturized. I feel this one is better than the one for dry skin, and easy to clean up away. Definitely will purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Good, fresh feeling, wonderful....</li>
    <li> Like all Queen Helene products this mask is great, it smells so good and leaves skin so smooth. I would buy it again for sure</li>
    <li> I live in Colorado, which is very dry, so I often have trouble finding beauty products that are up to the Colorado environment. this masque smells quite pleasant, with a lovely rose scent, and seemed to help clear up some small spots on my face. It dried out my face, though, so while it&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s not necessarily outstanding either.</li>
    <li> It seems they may have changed the formula a bit.  The mud used to be extra thick now it&#x27;s almost soupy.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and rejuvenated.A little goes a long way with the product so use a small amount for full coverage. :)</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin with smaller pores, remove the oil of my skin and is like a lifting sensation. Love this mask</li>
