### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The product is excellent with affordable prices.  </li>
      <li>This is very nice and has no fragrance.</li>
      <li>But while alternating treatments, this is a very nice treatment to add into the mix and have handy.</li>
      <li>But by itself, this cream has felt good to me and that, I think, has made me feel better about how I look.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Sure adds moisture day and night.  </li>
      <li>i love the filing  </li>
      <li>Everything I wanted and more.</li>
      <li>I love this product-</li>
      <li>s glad I found I MAX products line and decided to try it</li>
      <li>Very quickly (within days), I notice a difference.</li>
      <li>One great thing I like about it, is that the formula includes all essential ingredients.</li>
      <li>I like how smooth my skin is feeling.</li>
      <li>Since I am still in the first month of use, I am looking forward to further good results!</li>
      <li>nice and soft smooth //??/////</li>
      <li>It was no smell either, it&#x27;s super rich and not greasy..  </li>
      <li>It is a good topical moisturizer however.</li>
      <li>look it up great price compared to other egf creams</li>
      <li>no regrets only beautiful skin ,,, too a while to find something that show at fist try effect ,,</li>
      <li>The cost is well worth it.</li>
      <li>Seemed to work right away.</li>
      <li>Really nothing special.  </li>
      <li>Without the added Vitamin E, it sinks into skin quickly and leaves a nice result.</li>
      <li>and the results were astounding and very noticeable after about 2 months of daily use.</li>
      <li>I have used other wrinkle away product&#x27;s and most either don&#x27;t have noticeable effect or are very expensive and can cost hundreds of dollars this had a great price and great results.</li>

      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Some people say this wrinkle cream brings immediate results while some else no results.&lt;br /&gt;After I kept using 3 creams for 6 months consistently, I can say this cream clearly works.</li>
      <li>This is the best cream I have used even that over very expensive creams.</li>
      <li>I bought the Wrinkle cream and EGF serum since it was recommended to use both for a better effect and it would be a little faster.</li>
      <li>I notice my skin firmed and lifted with less fine lines.</li>
      <li>I bought it from a spa at much higher prices but found it out only at $38.00 from Amazon.</li>
      <li>The fine lines around my mouth are already less visible.</li>
      <li>I simply apply the AHA serum first, then the moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It’s simplified my routine considerably.</li>
      <li>I cannot give it 5 stars, because I do not see any LIFTING action after weeks of use.</li>
      <li>My skin became smoother and the deep wrinkles and lines were markedly diminished.</li>
      <li>This is thick, rich, and creamy--and I wake up looking refreshed.</li>

    <li> Sure adds moisture day and night.  Only been using it for a few days but i like it.</li>
    <li> The cost is well worth it. It takes a few weeks for the full effect to show, but if used consistently, the results are pretty significant. One great thing I like about it, is that the formula includes all essential ingredients. Typically I’d have to buy each separately (like retinol or peptides) and then I’d have this long prep session at night. With this one cream, everything is in one spot. It’s simplified my routine considerably.</li>
    <li> I cannot give it 5 stars, because I do not see any LIFTING action after weeks of use. It is a good topical moisturizer however.</li>
    <li> Seemed to work right away.</li>
    <li> s glad I found I MAX products line and decided to try it no regrets only beautiful skin ,,, too a while to find something that show at fist try effect ,,</li>
    <li> Very oily, I sincerely do not  recommend this product  for ethnic women at all.</li>
    <li> Some people say this wrinkle cream brings immediate results while some else no results.&lt;br /&gt;After I kept using 3 creams for 6 months consistently, I can say this cream clearly works. I notice my skin firmed and lifted with less fine lines. I was seeing the difference 2-3 months after I started using. I bought it from a spa at much higher prices but found it out only at $38.00 from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product- I saw immedate results, I had such dry skin   It was no smell either, it&#x27;s super rich and not greasy..  Never buying another moisturizer can&#x27;t wait to use the other products!</li>
    <li> This is very nice and has no fragrance. There are times when your skin just begs for moisture, and this has delivered without irritating my skin. My skin was oily prior to menopause but it has been slowly drying.  Lately, I have taken to putting on Vitamin E capsules and then adding this cream or a hyalauronic serum (I alternate stuff) to smear everything around so I am experimenting further. But by itself, this cream has felt good to me and that, I think, has made me feel better about how I look.  It is hard to say what I have been doing lately including this product that has done the most or everything for my skin.  But while alternating treatments, this is a very nice treatment to add into the mix and have handy. Without the added Vitamin E, it sinks into skin quickly and leaves a nice result.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have used even that over very expensive creams.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because a friend advised me to try a product with EGF peptides.  My current creams just weren’t working. These special ingredients are the secret to good, youthful skin. But since I can’t afford a professional aesthetician or expensive product, I did some Googling and found this IMAX line on Amazon. The product is excellent with affordable prices.  I wanted to reduce my wrinkles and look younger. So, after washing and drying my face in the morning, I apply antioxidant serum with this cream. In the evening, I apply the Vitamin C 21% serum and this cream. Very quickly (within days), I notice a difference. My skin became smoother and the deep wrinkles and lines were markedly diminished. This is a smart and economical way to rejuvenate the skin.</li>
    <li> I started using this a few weeks ago in the evenings. I simply apply the AHA serum first, then the moisturizer. This is thick, rich, and creamy--and I wake up looking refreshed. The fine lines around my mouth are already less visible.</li>
    <li> I bought the Wrinkle cream and EGF serum since it was recommended to use both for a better effect and it would be a little faster. I followed the instructions and used it in the AM and then once again in the PM and the results were astounding and very noticeable after about 2 months of daily use. I have used other wrinkle away product&#x27;s and most either don&#x27;t have noticeable effect or are very expensive and can cost hundreds of dollars this had a great price and great results. Would recommend it anyone.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Since I am still in the first month of use, I am looking forward to further good results!</li>
    <li> Really nothing special.  Saw no difference.</li>
    <li> I like, use with serum and another one of their products. A little goes a long way. I like how smooth my skin is feeling. I will keep using.</li>
    <li> Love it. Everything I wanted and more.</li>
    <li> Sory to Tell you am sad ..I order worth175$ but cant use IT for IM allergy My Face neck eyelids so red and itchy</li>
    <li> me encanta  i love the filing  nice and soft smooth //??/////</li>
    <li> works with my other skin care to add muh needed EGF look it up great price compared to other egf creams</li>
