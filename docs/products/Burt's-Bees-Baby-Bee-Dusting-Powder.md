<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have always used this powder. It&#x27;s great. And I give it to every new expecting mom at showers.</li>
    <li> Works great with no fragrance. I use it as an adult.</li>
    <li> Is this good for women to use? I have sensitive skin.. I&#x27;m trying to find an all natural body powder for me to use</li>
    <li> This powder is silky smooth and does the job. I like that the ingredients are non GMO. The two biggest drawbacks (1) It&#x27;s very expensive and (2) It smells terrible. I must be in the minority here based on the other reviews, but it smells sickly sweet. I&#x27;m giving my bottle away. I would love to see this product with a neutral subtle vanilla or lavender scent.</li>
    <li> Best natural diaper rash preventer in the baby-making business. This powder is awesome.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, works great and safe to use, all you need for your kids</li>
    <li> Security and peace of mind</li>
    <li> I received the baby balm by Burt&#x27;s Bees as a gift and used it for about a week on my growing belly bump.. Until I couldn&#x27;t take the smell any more. Chalking it up to my ultra-sensitive pregnancy nose, and not realizing that the whole product line smelled the same, I purchased the talc free powder. The stink is unreal! It got tossed almost immediately and the smell was so bad I washed the baby.</li>
    <li> So gentle and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Nice stuff, if you want natural you&#x27;ll like this.....NO Talc which is bad for you.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my kids when they were babies. I was disappointed when I didn&#x27;t see them on shelves anymore. I&#x27;m so glad its being sold online though. Great product! Sprinkle a small amount inside a diaper while changing and it keeps baby&#x27;s bottom dry and smells great! I like the fact that it&#x27;s \\&quot;Talc Free\\&quot; too, but works just as well as regular baby powder. Purchased this as a baby shower gift.</li>
    <li> Wanted a talc free powder but not very happy with product.  It has almost no smell at all and I was expecting a soft pleasant fragrance.  I think it is also expensive for the amount and quality.  I bought for personal use, not for a baby.  Have to try another brand............</li>
    <li> Everybody said it didn&#x27;t smell like baby powder and alas it does. smell. like. baby. powder.  That sense of diaper in the vicinity however bland has to even be a turnoff for babies!  I am still looking for a good cornstarch powder with virtually no scent.</li>
    <li> Yet another excellent product from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  The scent is different from regular baby powder, more of a sweet smell, and it goes on smoothly.  This new size is the best value if you need the powder, especially since a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite baby powder ever. It smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Always.  The best~ and wonderful fragrance.  I am not a fan of baby powder scent, this is so nice.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because I love these products.  I use this powder in my daughters shoes and it absorbs beautifuly and smells great.  I originally bought this to use on my son&#x27;s hiney, but his skin is to sensitive for it(darn it!) but since it is kind of spendy I wanted to make sure I could use it.  My daughter likes how her shoes and feet smell now!</li>
    <li> Received on time, powder nice as ever.</li>
    <li> I like this product for the naturalness of it and I would recommend to anyone. I was not really crazy about the smell, but good otherwise. smells like honey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years instead of traditional baby powder (since I heard the talc can cause breathing problems for little ones).  This is such a great product, and smells soooooo wonderfully good.  Keeps baby&#x27;s bum dry and soft.</li>
    <li> I like this powder much better than regular baby powder. It keeps my daughter dry and prevents her from getting rashes, so I&#x27;m happy! :)</li>
    <li> This is talc-free.  Studies have shown that talc can cause ovarian cancer.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Love the scent</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees, you really can&#x27;t go wrong here. Pleasant smell, very fine, love this stuff.</li>
    <li> So glad to have found this after using baby powder on my body for years and worrying about the health effects.  This is wonderfully lighted scented</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!! Best baby powder I&#x27;ve smelled. Is a little bit gritty. No silky soft. Does the job well.</li>
    <li> gets rid of my babys heat rashes/pimples in a day... pleasant smell</li>
    <li> A superb dusting powder, without talcum powder. A healthier alternative. I love it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Burts Bees products,particularly the dusting powder. It does not contain talc and does not cause clogged pores,and therefore skin rashes.It is the only powder that I use and will continue to use as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> The best daily powder.</li>
    <li> Got this when traveling to India. Works great in hot humid climates. Can be used for dusting all over the body &amp; diaper areas. Helped keep diaper rash &amp; sweat at bay! It has a subtle scent just like the body wash, so it&#x27;s fresh without being over powering. And not too baby smelling either. One bottle keeps for a long time. Great product!!</li>
    <li> The texture of this product is good, but the smell is really really terrible to me. After I tried it, I had to take a shower.</li>
    <li> This powder has a unique honey type smell. Its subtle but enough. The powder itself lasts throughout my whole shift at work! I like to use it as a dry shampoo and a deodorant. So over all... the powder does wonders and it&#x27;s not grainy at all. Really smooth and it makes your skin feel like silk.</li>
    <li> too sweet &amp; too fragrant for my tastes, other than that it works fine</li>
    <li> I wanted all natural products for my granddaughter, 100% confidence and trust in Burt&#x27;s Bees. Made a believer of my daughter</li>
    <li> Good!The child is very much like, smell smells really good.. I am also very loving, transport speed is very fast.</li>
    <li> I use it in my hair between shampoos to absorb excess oil. Smells beautiful and natural, fresh and sweet, unlike regular baby powder.</li>
    <li> I read another review about using this as a dry shampoo because it smells so great.  It&#x27;s true! I love this stuff.  I not only use this for my baby but use it on days I don&#x27;t feel like washing my hair and need the oil out.  Love the smell!</li>
    <li> Meh. You can get just as good quality cheaper with talc. Just avoid silica or over using and creating dust. Also had trouble getting it shipped because it was a powder? No idea why that was a problem. Save your money and buy Johnson&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, I wanted to stop using Johnson and Johnson baby powder and find something more natural, this stuff leaves my baby bottom soft, I use it an every diaper change.</li>
    <li> I use many of the Burt&#x27;s Bee products.  The baby powder has a wonderful scent.  Not a baby scent but a soft clean scent that even adults could use it.</li>
    <li> Love the burts bees line, particularly for babies. This is no exception,  smell nice, keeps my twins booty dry and smelling lovely.  Sometimes I use it too.</li>
    <li> it is very good product. we love it.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Thanks</li>
    <li> A great healthy alternative to talc powder. This stuff works well and smells great (mild).</li>
    <li> Burts and bees products are the only products that I will use on my baby&#x27;s skin. This powder smells so beautiful the only problem I have with it is that it feels a little grainy.</li>
    <li> I ended up using this for myself and my husband after I read you shouldn&#x27;t use on babies anymore!  Works great and I like the smell!!  Doesn&#x27;t clump up!</li>
    <li> I love this dusting powder.  Better than other brands for sure!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS POWDER!!!  I USE IT UNDER MY BREASTS TO KEEP WETNESS AWAY.  IT&#x27;S THE BEST!!!!  I&#x27;VE TRIED MANY POWDERS BUT THEY DO NOT WORK AS WELL AS \\&quot;BABY BEE\\&quot; !!!!&lt;br /&gt;NICE,VERY LIGHT SCENT TOO !!!  [[ASIN:B000WZCHV8 Baby Bee Dusting Powder - 4.5 oz - Powder]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MARY ANN 55 YEARS OLD</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees makes excellent quality products.  I have actually tried their powder before, in the past and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Baby Bee Dusting Powder is the best! I&#x27;m rather zaftig and this powder has kept me from developing any chafing or sores in skin fold areas. The best part is the nice, subtle fragrance of fresh honey. I depend on it to get through the day feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> My baby unfortunately has very sensitive skin and had an allergic reaction to this product. I&#x27;m not sure what he reacted to in the powder, but it has a very strong fragrance that also didn&#x27;t work with my baby. He first broke out into a diaper rash that then very quickly spread into a full body rash. As soon as I stopped using the product, his rash died down and disappeared within a day. For reference, my baby&#x27;s skin also didn&#x27;t work well with Aveeno baby products. If you&#x27;re baby falls into this level of sensitivity to body products, then you might want to rethink using this baby powder.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, however the cost is very high compared to grocery store prices.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical! And it smells so good. I use it for baby and me both. Tmi alert: nursing bras are pretty sad support-wise if you&#x27;re well-endowed and do not &amp;#34;lift and separate.&amp;#34; This leads to unfortunate sticky cleavage when it&#x27;s warm out. This powder works well for that since it&#x27;s baby safe...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been moving towards &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hygiene products. I use powder on my undercarriage.  I&#x27;ve read some bad things on TALC and so have moved towards this product. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am a die hard fan of Burt&#x27;s Bee, so I love this powder. It smells great and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this for my Nephew because I am a big fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees product range and wanted something for him that was natural and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother / sister in law apply it on him immediately after a shower (after drying) and have found that he smells better and it helps him sleep at night. He has not had any undesirable health affects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend has since bough it to use on a daily basis and the feedback that I have received from her has been of a very positive nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it myself and found that it made my skin softer and helped me sleep better. It did not irritate my lungs like other cheaper talcs have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: An essential bathroom product for all ages groups</li>
    <li> It tastes too strong.</li>
    <li> I have used it just once.  It seemed just like talcom powder, maybe a little coarser.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again based on my one experience.</li>
    <li> I love this powder! It smells amazing and makes my baby&#x27;s skin feel so soft!  I use it at night to help with the wetness for over night cloth diapers and minor chafing he gets with his large thighs.</li>
    <li> Seller was good and product arrived earlier than mentioned date. applied on new born and it caused rashes on baby&#x27;s skin. Stopped using it on my baby. As there is no return for this product my money got wasted</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s baby powder. I like it because it is talc free and smells nice and light. I could not find it at any drugstore. I was lucky Amazon had it.</li>
    <li> I use this as dry shampoo in between hair washings.  It smells great and absorbs oil.  It is a lot of product for a good price.</li>
    <li> This powder advertises that it is free from talc.  Not sure why that is better, but it is really nice powder.  I suppose it is gentler on baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend that claims it is the only body powder that helps keep her skin dry and comfortable in folds and other places that need to stay dry.  Talcum powder is something she can not use for allergy reasons.</li>
    <li> I love this body powder, it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it and&lt;br /&gt;I can feel safe using it on my body.&lt;br /&gt;I love Burts Bees!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really awesome. Works great to keep my skin feeling soft and silky and smells really nice too. Perfect for sensitive skin. I find myself using this more than I have used others I have tried.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to have a baby to buy this. It smells very light NOT like baby powder. I use powder after a shower, and when the temperature gets high. It works nicely in keeping me dry. The other thing I liked was that in powdering myself (with a big powder-puff) I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m breathing in something that&#x27;s trying to stop me from breathing.</li>
    <li> Smelled so great my daughter flung it all over her toys! haha no seriously she did, and it really does smell better then baby powder</li>
    <li> Both my children 3 month old and my 2 year old reacted horribly to this powder with screaming and turning extremely fire red before the next diaper change. Check your kids on a small patch of skin first before potentially putting them through this pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service also will put you through hoops if you want to get a refund and they won&#x27;t give you back sales tax. Pretty upset with this experience and losing trust and respect for this brand. Maybe it hasn&#x27;t happened to a lot of people but I&#x27;ve talked to others with similar experiences: Lip balms that chap and fray your lips, baby cream and powder that irritate baby&#x27;s skin. So disappointed when you pay a premium price for this stuff. Guess the marketing worked on me.</li>
    <li> This is a great powder that has prevented my little one from getting a rash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Dusting Powder for a couple years now. It keeps me feeling fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> This powder smells so sweet and I just love how it makes me feel!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff &amp; it&#x27;s 100% natural</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time for my 2 year old toddler. It certainly smells very different from what we have been using. Part from the time required to get used to its smell, I highly recommend this powder. Very fine and soft, it&#x27;s ideal for a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and I like that it is mostly natural and is not full of chemicals.</li>
    <li> I adore this powder.  So light and fresh smelling.  Perfect during warm weather and right before working out!</li>
    <li> Great product I recommend .</li>
    <li> I love this powder, it&#x27;s soft and keeps my baby nice and dry.</li>
