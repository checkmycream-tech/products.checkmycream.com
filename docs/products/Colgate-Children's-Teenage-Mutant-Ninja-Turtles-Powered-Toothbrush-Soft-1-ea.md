      <li>The excitement will probably wear off soon &amp; he&#x27;ll go back to twice a day, but I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s excited about brushing his teeth now.&lt;br /&gt;His</li>

      <li>He likes it so much, that he wants to brush his teeth before bedtime which he wasn&#x27;t doing regularly.</li>
      <li>This is a good toothbrush although the bristles are a little less durable than one might want.  </li>
      <li>I got this for my 4 year old, but my two year old loves it too.</li>
      <li>Has worked well so far, 2 months.  </li>
      <li>I got this electric toothbrush for my almost 2 year old.</li>
      <li>We ended up buying Sonic Care kids toothbrushes; obviously much more expensive, but should last for a long time and the rechargeable battery is a huge benefit.</li>

    <li> Cute toothbrush, but burns through batteries like crazy.  I had to replace them after just a couple of weeks.  We ended up buying Sonic Care kids toothbrushes; obviously much more expensive, but should last for a long time and the rechargeable battery is a huge benefit.</li>
    <li> Has worked well so far, 2 months.  My son loves it!</li>
    <li> My son loved the product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s is a good choice . . it has good size, and it make the brush time much more fun for my little boy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 5 year old son to add a little excitement in his daily chores as he loves it.He likes it so much, that he wants to brush his teeth before bedtime which he wasn&#x27;t doing regularly.</li>
    <li> This is a good toothbrush although the bristles are a little less durable than one might want.  My toddler loves this thing because he can brush his teeth like mom and dad do.</li>
    <li> Dogs have to brush too!  I have a greyhound and have to brush daily. Started off with a manual and it just wasn&#x27;t cleaning well enough. I thought if an electric toothbrush is good enough for me then it is good enough for the dog.</li>
    <li> works well, bought for my grandson</li>
    <li> A few months ago, I started using the [[ASIN:B00NL2AON2 Philips Sonicare Hx3631/07 Powerup Battery Toothbrush]] and I really like it. My teeth feel very clean when I&#x27;m finished brushing with it. So I decided to buy a battery toothbrush for my grandchildren.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this one locally for less than $4...maybe it was on sale I don&#x27;t know.  Anyway, my grandson loves it &amp; told his parents that his teeth felt clean when he was finished. He likes it so much, that he wants to brush his teeth after every meal. The excitement will probably wear off soon &amp; he&#x27;ll go back to twice a day, but I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s excited about brushing his teeth now.&lt;br /&gt;His parents supervised the first couple times &amp; we told him not to turn the brush on, until it was in his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 AAA batteries are included.  The batteries are replaceable, but the brush head isn&#x27;t. When it wears out, you&#x27;ll have to purchase a new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Fun for toddler.&lt;br /&gt;My son loves brushing his teeth and loves TMNT....so this is a big hit:)</li>
    <li> I got this for my 4 year old, but my two year old loves it too. I generally try to discard less stuff so not having a replaceable head makes me a little sad, but having young kids excited about brushing their teeth is such a relief.</li>
    <li> Kids really liked them!</li>

    <li> I got this electric toothbrush for my almost 2 year old. He loves the teenage mutant ninja turtles and loves this toothbrush. He asks to brush his teeth all the time because he thinks it&#x27;s so fun. It&#x27;s easy to turn on and off and does a really nice job cleaning.</li>
    <li> My son loved his new toothbrush.  Definitely helped in his teeth brushing twice per day.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Broke in less than 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Does not spin!!! It claims to oscillate but it really only vibrates. Considering that it was only $4 I&#x27;ll keep it and make due with it. My son actually likes it but I was looking for a spinning toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Four year-old son loves it.</li>
    <li> fun product, grandson loves it.  Good seller.</li>
    <li> The head is a little to big for my three year old.</li>
