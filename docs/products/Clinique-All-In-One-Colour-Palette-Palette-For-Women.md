    <li> very nice for travel in your purse</li>
    <li> A while back, I was manic and obsessed with finding the perfect all-in-one makeup kit.  This is the best one, HOWEVER, I only gave it 4 stars because of the lipstick.  It&#x27;s a lipgloss that you apply with your finger and if you&#x27;re like me, and unfortunately you just may be, you lick it off right away.  The colors are very nice.  I think it has a mirror for application.  For a weekend bag, or all day outing it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
    <li> very happy with this product. purchased multiple times for myself and as gifts.</li>
    <li> IT IS AN EXCELLENT VERY GOOD PRODUCT RECOMMEND YOU WARM</li>
    <li> Pricey, Small.  Perfect</li>
    <li> Very nice, good colours.</li>
    <li> I bought this for traveling purposes. It&#x27;s not bad. The colors are neutral and I think are good for many skin tones. It&#x27;s small and the makeup is pretty well protected from being broken. The mirror is a good size. It has a sponge for powder, brush for blush, lipstick brush and two-sided (sponge and brush) eyeshadow applicator. I liked that it had the brushes and a mascara in the compact. I do not like the mascara at all. It is neither lengthening nor thickening. You have to layer and layer it on to get any noticeable effect. I did take an extra eyeshadow brush and brush for powder on my trip in addition to what was in the compact.  Overall, the compact freed space in my luggage but I think this is overpriced.</li>
    <li> I have auburn and the pallet is excellent for me. I love the face powder, mascara right in  oine place. Love Clinique, always. No cons.</li>
    <li> Good product very handy to carry everywhere</li>
    <li> Very handy to keep in bag or for travel. Nice subtle colors, very compact.</li>
    <li> I love and use everything in this kit! The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that I wish you could buy inserts to refill it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling,or keeping in your handbag. The colors are good for all skin shades. I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Having difficulty trying to open the bottom section!  What do I do?  Nora Gardner</li>
    <li> It has everything in such a small box. You can take it with you on trip. And it&#x27;s also a good choice for someone who just starts to learn how to make up. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> First bought this kit on a cruise ship shop.  Best kit out there.  If you can find it.  Thank goodness Amazon has it.</li>
    <li> It fits my purpose for a valentine gift. Both practical and delightful. Colours matches my wife&#x27;s colour and good to bring along for trip.</li>
    <li> Colors are nice, I can actually use the lipstick colors.  Yay!!  Perfect to tuck into a travel bag or suitcase... about the size of a small paperback book.</li>
    <li> I love these all in one kits especially from name brand cosmetic manufacturers.  It is so nice to travel with or put in a larger purse.  Everything is in one place so you don&#x27;t lose things in the bottom of your purse</li>
    <li> Love all the Great colors</li>
    <li> Great colors, but do not have blue eyes with brown/red hair.  All auburn heads stay away!!!! You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
