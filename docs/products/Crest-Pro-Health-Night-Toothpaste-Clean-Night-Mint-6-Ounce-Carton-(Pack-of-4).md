      <li>Great product, Speedy Shipping!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best</li>
      <li>The best toothpaste for evening ever!</li>
      <li>Good stuff!</li>
      <li>The price was great too</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is great.  </li>
      <li>This is a great night time toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Taste is great.</li>
      <li>This is a great toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I have loved and used Crest Nighttime toothpaste for years.  </li>
      <li>Positively good.</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to be able to buy it here.  </li>
      <li>That would make this toothpaste much better.  </li>
      <li>Result is that toothpaste dribbles out -- the cap won&#x27;t close even if you wash it off to make sure the leaking paste is not preventing the cap from closing.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste, it&#x27;s a paste not a gel.</li>
      <li>love the way they package this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be able to return to six-month checkups.</li>
      <li>Crest Pro-Health NIGHT toothpaste my favorite.</li>
      <li>We love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This is simply the best toothpaste ever.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I can not find this toothpaste in the store any more - no idea why.  </li>
      <li>FAvorite toothpaste...</li>
      <li>It also tastes great and makes my mouth feel satisfying fresh and clean after brushing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not minty fresh after a night&#x27;s sleep, but it&#x27;s better than most toothpaste!</li>
      <li>I like the clean refreshing feeling it leaves in your mouth</li>
      <li>and I got it very quickly.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste at night before bedtime, my teeth have been tartar free.</li>
      <li>Can depend on it for clean breath and cleaner feeling.</li>
      <li>Recommend brushing every day of course, and I felt as though my teeth were extremely clean after using this.</li>
      <li>It makes my mouth feel clean and the minty taste lasts for a while.</li>
      <li>Clean mouth after sleeping</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried special toothpastes to alleviate that</li>
      <li>your mouth will still feel clean and fresh after sleeping all night.</li>
      <li>for some reason this is no longer sold in stores,so glad i was able to find it on-ljne,should last me awhile;)</li>
      <li>It was worth it...</li>
      <li>I have tried many non-fluoride natural toothpastes (xylitol and calcium glycerophosphate ones, etc.)</li>
      <li>; it&#x27;s not advertised for help with dry mouth, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and will rebuy.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think Stannous Fluoride is more effective than regular fluoride.  </li>
      <li>and even though they always taste much better and are much more gentle on mouth tissues, they do not seem to protect against cavities as well as regular old fluoride toothpastes.</li>
      <li>First tried this toothpaste after buying it at Walgreens.</li>
      <li>Mildly gritty for a fresh clean brushing.</li>
      <li>I found it helped a lot if I brushed my teeth right after dinner so as to let saliva redistribute naturally in my mouth before I went to bed (also eliminated evening snacking :).&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then I switched to sprays which did help (Oasis is my favorite), but I didn&#x27;t want dry mouth to wake me at all.  </li>
      <li>This is the only toothpaste that I HAVE FOUND that leaves your mouth super minty fresh each night.  </li>
      <li>I still try to brush my teeth well before retiring, but haven&#x27;t had the problem nearly so much and am very grateful.  </li>
      <li>It arrived very soon after I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why it isn&#x27;t sold everywhere.  </li>
      <li>It really does help.  </li>
      <li>Since I liked it a lot I decided to order another few from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much after trying the special dry mouth products, but</li>
      <li>There are some granules which also help for stain removal, and the mint is not sweet like some toothpastes, but more of a mint burst in your mouth.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I have awoken the next morning to be surprised that I can taste the clean taste of the \\&quot;night\\&quot; version still.</li>
      <li>Got my favorite toothpaste fast, but the expiration date is March 2014 (not sure what that means for toothpaste).  </li>
      <li>but I am 94 years old and haven&#x27;t the energy to return them.</li>
      <li>You can actually brush your teeth before bed and wake up with a decent taste in your mouth.  </li>
      <li>absolutely love this toothpaste but starting to have a hard time finding it.  </li>
      <li>but I was unable to get all the way into the comments section to add my own experience.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know what is in the toothpaste that would go bad in a few months.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Crest has chosen to discontinue producing this line of toothpast.</li>
<li> The tartar buildup on my bottom four front teeth (23-26 lingual) was so bad I had to see the dental hygienist every four months.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews where folks say they&#x27;ve expereinced problems with their teeth being stained but I have not experienced this myself. In fact, I have awoken the next morning to be surprised that I can taste the clean taste of the \\&quot;night\\&quot; version still. I think this a solid toothpaste to be using every evening.</li>
    <li> First tried this toothpaste after buying it at Walgreens. Since I liked it a lot I decided to order another few from Amazon.  It makes my mouth feel clean and the minty taste lasts for a while.</li>
    <li> Yes, like so many other reviewers advise, this product does make the skin inside your mouth peel which is really disgusting and can be embarrassing.  However, if you have tooth pain issues, this toothpaste is somewhat of a godsent.  It contains Stannous Fluoride which is anti-bacterial.  This toothpaste is ADA approved.  The flavor always reminds me of a big brand name cola that starts with a P :)  I wish the formula would be improved to not include whatever chemical it is that makes your mouth peel.  That would make this toothpaste much better.  Also, as usual with common brand name toothpastes....WAY too many nasty chemicals.  There is no natural brand toothpaste that has Stannous Fluoride in it though.  Overall, I think Stannous Fluoride is more effective than regular fluoride.  The box states it may cause tooth staining but I have not experience any of that and have been using this for over a year now.  I think the key is brushing 2-3 times a day, flossing EVERY night, and using a mouthwash occasionally.  I have tried many non-fluoride natural toothpastes (xylitol and calcium glycerophosphate ones, etc.) and even though they always taste much better and are much more gentle on mouth tissues, they do not seem to protect against cavities as well as regular old fluoride toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Positively good. I like the clean refreshing feeling it leaves in your mouth</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste that I HAVE FOUND that leaves your mouth super minty fresh each night.  There are some granules which also help for stain removal, and the mint is not sweet like some toothpastes, but more of a mint burst in your mouth.  Recommend brushing every day of course, and I felt as though my teeth were extremely clean after using this.</li>
    <li> Taste is great. Mildly gritty for a fresh clean brushing. Can not find this in the stores. Crest Pro-Health NIGHT toothpaste my favorite.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the one I bought in the store....it does work well though.  It was worth it...</li>
    <li> This is simply the best toothpaste ever. Clean mouth after sleeping -wonderful! This toothpaste also doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums like some whitening toothpastes I have tried.</li>
    <li> FAvorite toothpaste...Great product, Speedy Shipping!</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste for evening ever! I only wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued. Can depend on it for clean breath and cleaner feeling.</li>
    <li> This product is no longer on the market so I was thrilled to be able to buy it here.  It arrived very soon after I ordered it.  No complaints, only my compliments.</li>
    <li> I have loved and used Crest Nighttime toothpaste for years.  When every store but Wall Mart stopped stocking it, I got worried.  I would buy 6 tubes at s time.  Then the time came an&lt;br /&gt;d they stopped.  Hooray for these folks who bought up the rest.  I hope they have a lot.  I&#x27;m still buying in bulk.</li>
    <li> This is a great night time toothpaste.  It keeps my mouth from getting too dry when I use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea.  The price was great too and I got it very quickly.</li>
    <li> I can not find this toothpaste in the store any more - no idea why.  We love this stuff.  You can actually brush your teeth before bed and wake up with a decent taste in your mouth.  It&#x27;s not minty fresh after a night&#x27;s sleep, but it&#x27;s better than most toothpaste!</li>
    <li> My mouth gets so dry during the night sometimes that it actually wakes me up.  I&#x27;ve tried special toothpastes to alleviate that, none of which helped at all.  Biotene actually made it worse.  Then I switched to sprays which did help (Oasis is my favorite), but I didn&#x27;t want dry mouth to wake me at all.  I found it helped a lot if I brushed my teeth right after dinner so as to let saliva redistribute naturally in my mouth before I went to bed (also eliminated evening snacking :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone recommended this toothpaste, so I tried it. I didn&#x27;t expect much after trying the special dry mouth products, but voila! It really does help.  I still try to brush my teeth well before retiring, but haven&#x27;t had the problem nearly so much and am very grateful.  Don&#x27;t know why this seems to help; it&#x27;s not advertised for help with dry mouth, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and will rebuy.</li>
    <li> This does keep your breath, if not necessarily fresh ager a night&#x27;s slumber, at least prevents it from being turning foul. It also tastes great and makes my mouth feel satisfying fresh and clean after brushing. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste tube -- CAP WILL NOT CLOSE. Result is that toothpaste dribbles out -- the cap won&#x27;t close even if you wash it off to make sure the leaking paste is not preventing the cap from closing. I viewed the Crest website and saw several other recent comments on this problem but I was unable to get all the way into the comments section to add my own experience. Question: Have all the other Crest tubes been changed to this type cap -- I can&#x27;t tell from the packaging but I don&#x27;t want to purchase another tube with this design. LIZA</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste, it&#x27;s a paste not a gel. And it&#x27;s got some grit to it. Combined with the Crest Clinical mouth wash. It&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that all 4 Crests would all expire within a few months. I don&#x27;t know what is in the toothpaste that would go bad in a few months. I know that I will not use them up in a few months but I am 94 years old and haven&#x27;t the energy to return them. That is the reason I gave it a middling rating;.</li>
    <li> Got my favorite toothpaste fast, but the expiration date is March 2014 (not sure what that means for toothpaste).  I assume that Crest has just quit making it and the inventory is almost gone. - Jim D</li>
    <li> I think it tasted a little stronger than other crest toothpaste. love the way they package this product. will buy it again.</li>
    <li> for some reason this is no longer sold in stores,so glad i was able to find it on-ljne,should last me awhile;)</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste at night before bedtime, my teeth have been tartar free. The tartar buildup on my bottom four front teeth (23-26 lingual) was so bad I had to see the dental hygienist every four months. It&#x27;s been almost four months since my last dental appointment and my teeth look like they&#x27;ve just been cleaned. I&#x27;ll be able to return to six-month checkups. This is a great toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great.  It lives up to its name.  Unfortunately, Crest has chosen to discontinue producing this line of toothpast.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this toothpaste but starting to have a hard time finding it.  I really don&#x27;t understand why it isn&#x27;t sold everywhere.  This is the best toothpaste I have ever used at night.  I have never woke up with morning breath using this toothpaste.  your mouth will still feel clean and fresh after sleeping all night.</li>
