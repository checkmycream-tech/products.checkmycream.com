      <li>It is a beautiful bottle, and the price was right</li>
      <li>I will order more</li>
      <li>I like the perfume spray alot better</li>
      <li>I ordered two bottles of Sirene which I love and have used for years.</li>
      <li>I just love this perfume.</li>
      <li>I love Vicky Tiel Perfume.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pleased with this.</li>
      <li>The person I purchase this for just love it</li>
      <li>It did not smell the way I thought it would, was way too strong and</li>
      <li>Smells like a cheap drugstore fragrance.</li>
      <li>I liked the old bottle better, but i am still a fan of this product.</li>
      <li>This is NOT like the original.</li>
      <li>Really worth the price!  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is truly extraordinary.</li>
      <li>Worth every drop.</li>
      <li>The first time I smelled this perfume</li>
      <li>People fall in love from near and far.</li>
      <li>I was very unsure of the scent.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and get frequent compliments on it as well as several others</li>
      <li>I originally ordered this for myself, after reading reviews on various perfume websites.</li>
      <li>A pretty floral soft fragrance.  </li>
      <li>And the bottle is not the same as the photo or the original (instead of a vintage frosted glass, it is clear -- with a purple liquid inside reminiscent of KoolAid).  </li>
      <li>The product in the new, clear glass (not frosted) bottle is watered-down and is not as strong-scented as the product in the frosted bottle.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe she really cares about the color, but she does complain it does not have the same staying power.</li>
      <li>And--fair warning--if you&#x27;re around someone who&#x27;s chemically sensitive, they will NOT react favorably to this potion.</li>
      <li>The price is right and it last a long time.</li>
      <li>The Vicky Tiel Sirene product displayed in the ad was golden in color yet when I received the bottle it was pink and the ingredients had red 33 which I don&#x27;t want in my purfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as some of my favorite perfumes are but for a less expensive perfume, it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy alcohol smell when first sprayed.  </li>
      <li>When it arrived, I sprayed a little on my wrist and knew right away this was not for me.</li>
      <li>I sprayed the pink on one arm and the old bottle of golden color Siren and the pink bottle seemed to be watered down and not have as much smell.</li>
      <li>and they both loved it, also it wasn&#x27;t expensive!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is floral and powdery but still fresh, not overwhelming or too retro (old-lady smell).  </li>

<li> Lasts about half the day.</li>
<li> Lasts all day, goes unnoticed every time it&#x27;s sprayed.</li>
<li> but I wear this everyday.</li>
<li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t awful, but you won&#x27;t be getting many compliments.</li>
<li> I am quite disappointed in Amazon for using a sub contractor who sent an out of date product.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product was shipped on time. The packaging was good. I had no problems with the product. I like it. I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it</li>
    <li> The Vicky Tiel Sirene product displayed in the ad was golden in color yet when I received the bottle it was pink and the ingredients had red 33 which I don&#x27;t want in my purfume. I sprayed the pink on one arm and the old bottle of golden color Siren and the pink bottle seemed to be watered down and not have as much smell. I tried to return the bottle but couldn&#x27;t because it is classified as a hazardous/flammable material and can&#x27;t be returned. Not sure how a product is OK to ship to me but not OK for me to ship it back to them. There should have been a notice on the product description that it couldn&#x27;t be returned and the product advertisement should have showed a pink bottle if that is what they were selling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After writing this review, I contacted customer service about this issue and they immediately took care of the issue and I was very satisfied with the resolution. I will definately buy from Amazon again because they do have good customer service when there is a problem.</li>
    <li> I love the fragance and the price is excellent</li>
    <li> I love Vicky Tiel Perfume.  They just smell wonderful.  And I love love the bottles they are just beautiful.  I will order more</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles of Sirene which I love and have used for years. Unfortunately while one bottle was pink in color and good, the other was a yellow gray and had turned to nearly pure alcohol with hardly any fragrance.  I am quite disappointed in Amazon for using a sub contractor who sent an out of date product.</li>
    <li> Nice floral smell. Lasts about half the day.</li>
    <li> Mu girl loves this scent and so do i</li>
    <li> The first time I smelled this perfume I was very unsure of the scent. After trying it again I have come to the conclusion it was just an off day for my nose. I love the scent and get frequent compliments on it as well as several others I know have purchased it for their own use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Wife and Mother for Mother&#x27;s Day and they both loved it, also it wasn&#x27;t expensive!</li>
    <li> This is NOT like the original. Smells like a cheap drugstore fragrance. And the bottle is not the same as the photo or the original (instead of a vintage frosted glass, it is clear -- with a purple liquid inside reminiscent of KoolAid).  Will not buy another.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t awful, but you won&#x27;t be getting many compliments. And--fair warning--if you&#x27;re around someone who&#x27;s chemically sensitive, they will NOT react favorably to this potion.</li>
    <li> the fragance is good.</li>
    <li> The person I purchase this for just love it</li>
    <li> This fragrance is truly extraordinary. Lasts all day, goes unnoticed every time it&#x27;s sprayed. People fall in love from near and far. Worth every drop.</li>
    <li> I JUST LOVE MY VICKEY TIEL!!! I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS!! I CANT GO WITHOUT IT AND IT ARRIVED ON TIME!!</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting but good for the price. I like the perfume spray alot better but I wear this everyday. Its my flavor.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this I get a compliment. Two sprays and it lasts all day.  A pretty floral soft fragrance.  A must buy</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this for myself, after reading reviews on various perfume websites. It is a beautiful bottle, and the price was right so I decided to purchase it. When it arrived, I sprayed a little on my wrist and knew right away this was not for me. It did not smell the way I thought it would, was way too strong and I considering selling it when a family member tried it on. She loved it, so now it&#x27;s hers.</li>
    <li> Love This perfume!!!!</li>
    <li> The product in the new, clear glass (not frosted) bottle is watered-down and is not as strong-scented as the product in the frosted bottle. I will NOT order this product again. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> no words to say is wonderful</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume. The price is right and it last a long time. I liked the old bottle better, but i am still a fan of this product.</li>
    <li> I like it, is very good</li>
    <li> Really worth the price!  I can&#x27;t quite describe the smell.  It&#x27;s not as strong as some of my favorite perfumes are but for a less expensive perfume, it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy alcohol smell when first sprayed.  The fragrance is floral and powdery but still fresh, not overwhelming or too retro (old-lady smell).  I have smelt the frosted bottle and must agree with some reviewers that the frosted bottle does smell different but I&#x27;m pleased with this.</li>
    <li> According to my mom, color and staying power changed. I don&#x27;t believe she really cares about the color, but she does complain it does not have the same staying power.</li>
