      <li>Most tanning lotions are packed full of fragrances and chemicals.</li>
      <li>Smell and feel is light, so tolerable.</li>
      <li>Overall the product is great</li>
      <li>Anyways, I chose to get one of there free bottle&#x27;s of lotion</li>
      <li>It goes on so smooth</li>
      <li>and I always feel clean when I have this lotion on.</li>
      <li>just make sure your getting what you really ordered.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells fantastic, my breakouts were almost 100% eliminated, it did not cause ANY irritation to my sensitive skin whatsoever and it promoted a nice deep, even, long-lasting, beautiful tan all over my entire body.</li>
      <li>alright as an intensifier not as strong as I would have hoped for but still works really well.</li>
      <li>I usually turn reddish-orange and this lotion gave me a beautiful bronzey olive color.  </li>
      <li>It works so well, and it is mostly made from natural and organic materials...</li>
      <li>By far my favorite tanning product whether you&#x27;re in level 1 or not.</li>
      <li>I have only used this lotion 3 times, but so far, it seems to be doing a good job.  </li>
      <li>Buy any package and get one equal value for free, or get a free lotion.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>So I came across this tanning lotion when I decided for the first time in my life that I wanted to try and get a real tan.</li>

      <li>I think other products boost your tan better</li>
      <li>This still has a nice scent to it without being harsh, I like it!</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
      <li>; i felt the need to notify this because the seller is clearly trying to hind the fact there is nuts in this lotion and that could be very harmful to someone who is allergic thank god</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you don&#x27;t have celiac&#x27;s disease, gluten intolerance, or sensitive skin  for that reason.  </li>
      <li>It has an unexpected grape scent to it.</li>
      <li>It came right on time, and was sealed in plastic unlike other lotions I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing too and won&#x27;t leave you with that weird after-tan smell.</li>

<li> I was breaking out on my chest, back &amp; shoulders with several other tanning lotions &amp; my skin has always been extremely sensitive to scented body lotions/oils of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> but I prefer paint it black for darkness and boosting color.</li>
<li> I still found myself breaking out slightly.</li>
<li> It does leave my face feeling a little greasy, but after an hour it absorbs and won&#x27;t bother you anymore.</li>
<li> The smell at first wasn&#x27;t what I expected from a Tanning Lotion, but it didn&#x27;t smell bad either!</li>
<li> glad it does not leave that nasty after tan smell!</li>
<li> i notice a sticker on the back which i thought was weird</li>
<li> i got bored</li>

    <li> Great smell, alright as an intensifier not as strong as I would have hoped for but still works really well.</li>
    <li> It was alright, didnt feel like it did much for my tan though.</li>
    <li> Great value, item was as described. Never opened and way cheaper than the tanning salons.</li>
    <li> I was breaking out on my chest, back &amp; shoulders with several other tanning lotions &amp; my skin has always been extremely sensitive to scented body lotions/oils of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;It smells fantastic, my breakouts were almost 100% eliminated, it did not cause ANY irritation to my sensitive skin whatsoever and it promoted a nice deep, even, long-lasting, beautiful tan all over my entire body.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Very smooth application, and conditioning to the skin. Works great and I never have problems with streaking. Bonus: It doesn&#x27;t reek when you step out of the tanning bed! I also love the lotion that goes along with Free Thyme. The scent is divine.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Came sooner than expected as well!</li>
    <li> Everytime I tan with this lotion I get nice compliments on my tan. I love it. It has no odor to it and I always feel clean when I have this lotion on.</li>
    <li> I have only used this lotion 3 times, but so far, it seems to be doing a good job.  It has an unexpected grape scent to it. It wasn&#x27;t expected since it is Thyme lotion. If it continues to work this well, it deserves the 5 stars</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It works so well, and it is mostly made from natural and organic materials... I get some good color from this stuff!</li>
    <li> I still found myself breaking out slightly. Smell and feel is light, so tolerable.</li>
    <li> Product works great, smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.  It has a bronzer but not sunless tanner so it doesn&#x27;t leave you orange.  I think other products boost your tan better but this is a great product for people with sensitive skin.  My husband would itch after applying different lotions,(he didn&#x27;t try any with a tingle, most just irritated his skin).  This was great for him and all he uses. I also tried it and like it but I prefer paint it black for darkness and boosting color.</li>
    <li> I have skin allergies and this stuff doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out!  Most tanning lotions are packed full of fragrances and chemicals. This still has a nice scent to it without being harsh, I like it!</li>
    <li> This product was great quality.  I have celiacs disease and am very careful about the products I apply to my skin.  Tanning lotions with gluten break me out in hives on a regular basis, but this product didn&#x27;t cause a reaction at all.  The bottle was much smaller than regular tanning lotions, however.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you don&#x27;t have celiac&#x27;s disease, gluten intolerance, or sensitive skin  for that reason.  You can pay the same price and get a much bigger bottle of lotion.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again.  It does a good job and keeping me moisturized, however doesn&#x27;t have as good of bronzing as others.</li>
    <li> It works, smells great!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the title turn you away this product is great and i love it but today i was waiting to tan and I was holding the lotion in my hand i got bored so i started reading the back of the bottle i notice a sticker on the back which i thought was weird so i pulled it off and it revealed something. Everything on the sticker match what was on the bottle (under the sticker) except one thing the sticker read &amp;#34;this product does not contain nuts&amp;#34; and the bottle read &amp;#34;Contains: Nuts, and so on&amp;#34; i felt the need to notify this because the seller is clearly trying to hind the fact there is nuts in this lotion and that could be very harmful to someone who is allergic thank god I&#x27;m not!! Overall the product is great just make sure your getting what you really ordered.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! This is a great product for those with sensitive skin. Very light smell before tanning, cannot smell it after, glad it does not leave that nasty after tan smell!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Really like this for in door tanning. I would recommend this product to others. Great smell and natural.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect lotion, being an on and off tanner I never know what works best for me.  I finally tried this Free Thyme lotion and it seriously gave me the best color ive ever recieved ON A LEVEL ONE BED for only 10 minutes!  I usually turn reddish-orange and this lotion gave me a beautiful bronzey olive color.  It smells amazing too and won&#x27;t leave you with that weird after-tan smell. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this lotion! So I came across this tanning lotion when I decided for the first time in my life that I wanted to try and get a real tan. Not just a tan that I buy in a bottle and put on only to wake up with streaks and stains on my clothes. So I walked into Chilli Peppers with money in my hand. They were having a Buy One Get One sale. Buy any package and get one equal value for free, or get a free lotion. I chose the Level 3 bed. Let me say that I am a VERY white and pale girl. People call me &amp;#34;Ghost&amp;#34; and everything else you can think of. I really didn&#x27;t expect to get much of a tan. Anyways, I chose to get one of there free bottle&#x27;s of lotion and I told them I didn&#x27;t want anything with bronzer or tinglers in it. She turns around for a second and then grabs this bottle off the shelf. The smell at first wasn&#x27;t what I expected from a Tanning Lotion, but it didn&#x27;t smell bad either! She told me the bottle was 80 dollars! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Even though I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it, I couldn&#x27;t imagine what would make a bottle of lotion cost 80 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway&#x27;s long story short, I have a tan!!! My white skin actually got a TAN. And I feel this lotion helped greatly. It goes on so smooth it feels like velvet on your skin. And a little goes a long way. I notice it doesn&#x27;t break out my skin either. It does leave my face feeling a little greasy, but after an hour it absorbs and won&#x27;t bother you anymore. Like I said, this lotion was 80 dollars at the salon, so buy this stuff here instead!!!</li>
    <li> Smells so clean and refreshing! Color is good, goes on smooth. Fragrance is very nice and takes away the burnt smell.</li>
    <li> It came right on time, and was sealed in plastic unlike other lotions I&#x27;ve ordered. By far my favorite tanning product whether you&#x27;re in level 1 or not. It creates really good color, and smells really natural and nice and leaves a good feeling on your skin.</li>
