### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!!!</li>
      <li>And the product is great.</li>
      <li>&quot; I imagine it would take a great deal of rolling to achieve any visible result, if at all.</li>
      <li>great feel -</li>
      <li>Very nice quality.</li>
      <li>Truly remarkable experience with seller.</li>
      <li>it feels really good.</li>
      <li>I cannot tell yet how good is it.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m told I look good.</li>
      <li>It feels good when I use it on my face and around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>The Jade Massager is a good product.   </li>
      <li>And yes, it does arrive in a decorative box, so it also makes a good gift.</li>
      <li>The cool jade stones are perfect for my puffy eyes.</li>
      <li>Very nice easily handled light weight</li>
      <li>However, I have found it useful and pleasant for mini-massages on the neck and shoulders.  </li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied with it.   </li>
      <li>I just love this jade massager.</li>
      <li>Love the product use it every morning , I can see the difference, also help with my sinuses</li>
      <li>I love my replacement.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>lovely rolling over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Wonder of wonders...</li>
      <li>Amazon, it arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>I use this about 4-5 times a week all over my face and neck applying pressure and it still going strong.</li>
      <li>It definitely rolls away your wrinkles and can give you a beautiful flush to your skin.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re fabulous.</li>
      <li>However, the seller went out of their way to contact me, explain that it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be that way, and send me a free replacement that works like a dream.</li>
      <li>The jade is smooth and cool to the touch --</li>
      <li>Right away I ordered it!  </li>
      <li>Works better than any wrinkle creams and is very soothing.  </li>
      <li>Even if the product came a little broke, what the roller jade can do, it&#x27;s really impressive, we put a little tape on it, and it works good.</li>
      <li>I bought this to try to get rid of those crows feet and laugh lines.  </li>
      <li>I would spend a little more and shop somewhere else for better quality.</li>
      <li>Overall the product works fine.</li>
      <li>My family was dubious when they saw this little roller; but it does feel so nice.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
      <li>After ordering this item, I received notification that it was no longer available, but that i could get an upgraded one for the same cost if I wanted.</li>
      <li>I gave it a 4 star because it really isn&#x27;t a permanent fix.  </li>
      <li>but it is very cooling and</li>
      <li>It makes an unusual gift for friends.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe the product is real jade, but they claim it is.  </li>
      <li>I would absolutely order from this seller again.</li>
      <li>I really like how it makes my face feel</li>
      <li>I use light strokes and my face has a very glowing apprearance afterwards and all day long.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t know jade had the property of keeping a cool temperature for so long.  </li>
      <li>I did buy it on ebay though since I found the exact same thing for under $4 including shipping.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s too early to see the difference.  </li>
      <li>When I received it though, it only had the large roller, not the smaller one for the eye.</li>
      <li>It did no appeared to be new and the big roller jade stone is patched with a ceramic ...</li>
      <li>At $17, this little treasure is definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I just love this jade massager. I&#x27;ve using it for 2 weeks. I really like how it makes my face feel and I feel like my 11 fades a little. I would recommend this to all woman, it relaxing and it seem to work well! I love it. I will be giving this to my friends this holidays. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> The Jade Massager is a good product.   I am completely satisfied with it.   It makes an unusual gift for friends.</li>
    <li> I received the jade roller/facial massager within the shipping time frame.  I started using the product within a few weeks of purchasing.  Unfortunately, the smaller jade roller piece fell apart after 3 gentle uses. The larger jade piece squeaked quite a bit when turning as well.  This product is definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> After ordering this item, I received notification that it was no longer available, but that i could get an upgraded one for the same cost if I wanted. I said yes. When I received it though, it only had the large roller, not the smaller one for the eye. It wasn&#x27;t an upgrade, but rather a downgrade. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The item was chipped. I contacted the company and made arrangements to returned it to the company for refund. I did not want to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s so-called wrinkle-reducing capability.  Indeed, I can&#x27;t imagine sitting in front of a tv (or anywhere else, for that matter) and repeatedly running this little jade roller up and down my face, ad nauseum, as is suggested by the included \\&quot;instructions.\\&quot; I imagine it would take a great deal of rolling to achieve any visible result, if at all. But who knows? That contention won&#x27;t be proven by me, I&#x27;m afraid.  However, I have found it useful and pleasant for mini-massages on the neck and shoulders.  My family was dubious when they saw this little roller; but it does feel so nice. The jade is smooth and cool to the touch -- just the thing on a hot day when one&#x27;s neck and shoulders are tense from stress. For this purpose, I can recommend it -- with one caveat: it does squeak slightly when in use and that can be annoying.</li>
    <li> At $17, this little treasure is definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the Jade is a very pale shade of green but it is very cooling and&lt;br /&gt;feels lovely rolling over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Wonder of wonders...I think it works!&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing one for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;Through Amazon, it arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> I read about the Jade roller in Yahoo news.  Right away I ordered it!  I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and I will try any anti aging device/tool to help my skin at this point.  It definitely rolls away your wrinkles and can give you a beautiful flush to your skin.  Is this a permanent solution....no!  But it definitely helps and takes only a couple of minutes each morning.  People have commented on my skin tone recently so maybe it is working.  I gave it a 4 star because it really isn&#x27;t a permanent fix.  But it does work!!</li>
    <li> Truly remarkable experience with seller. The rollers were sticking on the product, but I figured that&#x27;s maybe how it was supposed to be. However, the seller went out of their way to contact me, explain that it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be that way, and send me a free replacement that works like a dream. I would absolutely order from this seller again. They&#x27;re fabulous. And the product is great. I love my replacement. And yes, it does arrive in a decorative box, so it also makes a good gift.</li>
    <li> Works better than any wrinkle creams and is very soothing.  The cool jade stones are perfect for my puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to get rid of those crows feet and laugh lines.  I use this every morning and evening after cleansing and applying my daily face cream.  I use light strokes and my face has a very glowing apprearance afterwards and all day long.</li>
    <li> Love the product use it every morning , I can see the difference, also help with my sinuses</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to play with this tool on my facial clients but can&#x27;t wait...</li>
    <li> Very nice quality. Larger than expected. I am ordering another one!</li>
    <li> I find this different and do use it now and then, I&#x27;m not sure if it is working or not but I&#x27;m told I look good.</li>
    <li> When I am using the product it makes unnoying sounds and the metal part changed color. I kept it but I don&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
    <li> just got it and it&#x27;s too early to see the difference.  I will give it a month and will update my review</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe the product is real jade, but they claim it is.  I would spend a little more and shop somewhere else for better quality.</li>
    <li> Overall the product works fine. It actually came with the little ball detached, so I had to stick it back on. Hopefully it won&#x27;t fall out with continued use. The metallic part of the roller has a very strong unpleasant metallic smell. I had to wash it with soap a few times before using, and still do between uses.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a plastic bubble wrap. It did no appeared to be new and the big roller jade stone is patched with a ceramic ... Bad bad product from Luos cultural goods</li>
    <li> Even if the product came a little broke, what the roller jade can do, it&#x27;s really impressive, we put a little tape on it, and it works good.</li>
    <li> I use this about 4-5 times a week all over my face and neck applying pressure and it still going strong. I suggest drying it immediately upon washing it to avoid the metal from rusting inside the tube, which I suspect, can weaken the metal and cause breakage. Just tap it a bit to get water out or you can also use a blow dryer to shoot some air through the holes quickly to dry the insides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;one of the metal arms on the longer side broke after about 8 months. I went ahead and bought another one a few months ago as it is quite addictive the feeling you get on your face and neck after using this. Your muscles just get a workout and relax at the same time. your skin will be so grateful as well. it feels really good. I did buy it on ebay though since I found the exact same thing for under $4 including shipping.</li>
    <li> Very nice easily handled light weight great feel - it&#x27;s used to help penetrate serums into the skin of my clients</li>
    <li> I bought this out of my curiosity to see if it does what they say.  I cannot tell yet how good is it. I&#x27;ve had it for one month or so. I use it everyday. Being 70+ one cannot expect miracles in a short period of time, I guess. It feels good when I use it on my face and around my eyes.  Didn&#x27;t know jade had the property of keeping a cool temperature for so long.  I&#x27;ll keep on using it and let you know.</li>
