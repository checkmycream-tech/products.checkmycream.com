      <li>It&#x27;s the best!</li>
      <li>so so happy I found it here!</li>
      <li>This scent probably best suited for summer.</li>
      <li>This product is great when you just want to touch up your hair.</li>
      <li>and as he was talking to me, he stopped mid-sentence and said my hair smelled great...</li>
      <li>smells great.</li>
      <li>Then I rub my scalp a bit with my fingers to work it all through and then brush it - looks great every time.</li>
      <li>You spray it on, let it sit for a couple of minutes, then comb it through - looks amazing!  </li>
      <li>The powder look goes away for the most part and leaves the awesome effects.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant, but probably could be improved.    </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
      <li>but it is my favorite for the price!</li>
      <li>Works fabulously and for a great price point.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>and I believe isn&#x27;t as effective at soaking up the oils.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s nice to save some time on those days, as well, since I don&#x27;t have to spend time drying my hair.      </li>
      <li>is the best one out there by a mile!kes original, fresh, blush, diva, boho, brit and this one by far has the best fragrance and even the ones for darker hair do not compare.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>and you get more of the powdery look.  </li>
      <li>I have tried others in a similar price ranges, and this one does the best job.</li>
      <li>and my hair looks even better than before.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s an even better deal.</li>
      <li>I have tried almost every brand of dry shampoo and none have done as good a job for me as Batiste and the price is great.  </li>
      <li>The smells are nice and while strong at first, they fade away nicely.</li>
      <li>But it is the best dry shampoo I have found - and I have looked at a LOT of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced, has a pleasant scent and does give my hair the body it needs on the days I can&#x27;t shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo brand.</li>
      <li>But I love this product for me and my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Then I style as normal and my hair is clean, smells great and has more volume than I would when I wash it.  </li>
      <li>I have used every fragrance Batiste makes original, fresh, blush, diva, boho, brit and this one by far has the best fragrance and even the ones for darker hair do not compare.  </li>
      <li>unlike some others, your hair is still easy to brush after using the spray, and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that grimy feeling.  </li>
      <li>I was it, and it tends to break easily since it is color treated.  </li>
      <li>Having listed those details, I will say that I use this product quite regularly and am quite happy with it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s best for your hair to not be washed daily, it needs it natural oils to keep it healthy.  </li>
      <li>It goes on light and smoothly.</li>
      <li>My hair genuinely seems clean when I use it without being grainy, gunky, or giving me a straw texture.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this isnt my favorite dry shampoo (my favorite is $20 at Sephora but who can afford to keep buying that)</li>
      <li>people have no idea that my hair was not just freshly washed!</li>
      <li>I used to buy the original and blush variety from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and they work well</li>
      <li>I have tried the &#x27;original&#x27; Batiste and this &#x27;Tropical&#x27; -</li>
      <li>Here is my new trick - this stuff seems to give my fine/flat hair a nice &#x27;lift&#x27;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good to let your hair rest from all that harsh shampooing, and this is a nice product to let you do that.</li>
      <li>A friend turned me on to batiste and so far it&#x27;s been the best by a long shot.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is light and fresh so it won&#x27;t overpower your perfume, but it will mask an oily hair smell if you get one</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard complaints that it looks like powder when you spray it on - well, duh, that&#x27;s what makes it the best!  </li>
      <li>I began to use this after I gave up on Tigi Rockoholic dry shampoo, it is way cheaper and works just as good.  </li>
      <li>If you try it for a few weeks you will be so glad and have more time to sleep in etc on days you do not wash!  </li>
      <li>This product however has a very light summery scent that not only doesn&#x27;t smell overpowering, it actually smells good.  </li>
      <li>Using this stuff on the roots perks it up immediately, plus keeps it from looking fresh longer.</li>
      <li>My hair feels fresh, airy, and almost freshly washed (almost.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that gets oily the same day</li>
      <li>After I dry my washed hair, I spray a bit on my roots and it gives a nice lift</li>
      <li>It really does work if you need a quick refresh.</li>
      <li>Batiste leaves no white residue in my hair like others and seems to get it cleaner and leaves it looking better.</li>
      <li>The listing when I bought the last time said bottles were 5ozs like most brands</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m saddened that my local Sally beauty supply stopped carrying this product but grateful to be able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that also is a bit oily - so this combination used to mean that the only way my hair looked good was to wash it EVERY DAY.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I have not found another dry shampoo in this price range that is better.</li>
      <li>My favorite dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have fine blonde, colored hair, so cannot shampoo every day</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have to do much fussing to get it to blend in.</li>
      <li>For the price I really like this one.</li>
      <li>My wife absolutely loves this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I did try the Batiste for brunettes and do not like it nearly as much.</li>
      <li>so I really like the tropical scent.</li>
      <li>My problem is that my hair gets oily REALLY fast (plus I sleep with a CPAP mask on - for sleep apnea and that makes my hair VERY oily being trapped under the headstraps), so I use this spray and it works so amazingly -</li>
      <li>no product can achieve that but real shampoo).</li>
      <li>I will sometimes buy a cheaper brand at the drug store, but those are really inferior.</li>
      <li>The fragrance doesnt really matter, it really doesnt stick</li>
      <li>My hair actually looks better when I don&#x27;t wash it and use this dry shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I spray lightly in the front , crown and lift layers in the back in short bursts while shaking it vigorously.  </li>
      <li>A quick blow dry with my fingers in the morning</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them all (bumble &amp; bumble, Oribe, old fashion baby powder, you name</li>
      <li>The blush smells like overpowering old lady perfume and does not fade as the day goes on.  </li>
      <li>I am an avid dry shampoo user and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY, recommend this to anyone, especially if you have fine/thin hair.</li>
      <li>It is messy (it kind of leaves an overspray film if you are not careful when spraying, but that may just be the nature of this type of product), and it might not work well for people with dark hair, since it is a white powdery spray.  </li>
      <li>Then I let it dry and massage it in, cover with a shower cap and shower as I normally would.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care that much for the tropical smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it and it is better than having dirty, greasy hair!  </li>
      <li>It might take a lot of brushing to really work into dark hair.  </li>
      <li>She can spray a little on after a workout, or just whenever really, and it gives her hair a sort of just washed look and smell.  </li>

<li> I definitely recommend this dry shampoo.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried various brands of dry shampoos.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few dry shampoos -- high end lines to drugstore brands.</li>
<li> I think this would also work well for brunettes as long as you brush it through well.  </li>
<li> That being said, the person who turned me onto the brand has black hair and she just combs it in well and hasn&#x27;t had major issues with it.</li>
<li> use some others as in-between helpers, but only due to the cost of this one - I would use it all the time</li>
<li> I only wash my hair every other day -</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wash it every day or it gets all dry and brittle.</li>
<li> I have tried almost EVERY dry shampoo on the market</li>
<li> I get almost 20 applications from a single bottle.</li>
<li> I decided to try dry shampoo to stave off breakage and I was amazed when I tried this product!  </li>
<li> Yes, it will leave your hair and scalp white, but less than baby powder residue.</li>
<li> So every other day, I use the Batiste Dry Shampoo.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works fabulously and for a great price point. This scent probably best suited for summer.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo.  It is sprayed into the roots of the hair and brushed after a minute or two to help absorb oils and give some body to your hair.  I have fine blonde, colored hair, so cannot shampoo every day (well, if I do, my hairdresser yells at me for drying out my hair..ha!).  So every other day, I use the Batiste Dry Shampoo.  It is reasonably priced, has a pleasant scent and does give my hair the body it needs on the days I can&#x27;t shampoo.  And it&#x27;s nice to save some time on those days, as well, since I don&#x27;t have to spend time drying my hair.      There were a few reasons I did not give this 5 stars. It is messy (it kind of leaves an overspray film if you are not careful when spraying, but that may just be the nature of this type of product), and it might not work well for people with dark hair, since it is a white powdery spray.  It might take a lot of brushing to really work into dark hair.  The scent is pleasant, but probably could be improved.    Having listed those details, I will say that I use this product quite regularly and am quite happy with it.  I have not found another dry shampoo in this price range that is better.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t reviewed anything on Amazon before but feel like I should for this. I am an avid dry shampoo user and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried them all. A friend turned me on to batiste and so far it&#x27;s been the best by a long shot. The smells are nice and while strong at first, they fade away nicely. My hair genuinely seems clean when I use it without being grainy, gunky, or giving me a straw texture. I have blonde hair so it&#x27;s easier for me- I don&#x27;t really have to do much fussing to get it to blend in. That being said, the person who turned me onto the brand has black hair and she just combs it in well and hasn&#x27;t had major issues with it. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this stuff.  She can spray a little on after a workout, or just whenever really, and it gives her hair a sort of just washed look and smell.  I  have to buy it by the case for her lol!!</li>

    <li> legit.  unlike some others, your hair is still easy to brush after using the spray, and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that grimy feeling.  solid product.</li>
    <li> smells great. works well.</li>
    <li> For the price I really like this one. And it doesn&#x27;t smell like baby powder so I really like the tropical scent. Also since I&#x27;m blonde it doesn&#x27;t look powdery but I guess if you were brunette it would be differet. But I love this product for me and my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that also is a bit oily - so this combination used to mean that the only way my hair looked good was to wash it EVERY DAY.  Not anymore.  This stuff is amazing.  I now wash my hair probably every other day, sometimes every 3 days and my hair looks even better than before.  I went 3 days with only using Batiste Dry shampoo and was asked if I had just \\&quot;gotten my hair done because it looked so good?\\&quot;.  I recommend to spray it on at roots all over and then just leave it for 5 minutes to &#x27;soak up&#x27; any grease/dirt.  Then I rub my scalp a bit with my fingers to work it all through and then brush it - looks great every time. Here is my new trick - this stuff seems to give my fine/flat hair a nice &#x27;lift&#x27; so I now also use it on the days that I do wash my hair!  After I dry my washed hair, I spray a bit on my roots and it gives a nice lift and I find that my hair isn&#x27;t as oily at the end of the day.  So, I basically am using this stuff everyday.  I now buy it in the 6-pack which lasts me about 6 weeks - so a can a week, but I use a lot of it.   I also am blonde so I like the added benefit that it seems to give in &#x27;brightening&#x27; my hair.  I think this would also work well for brunettes as long as you brush it through well.  I have tried the &#x27;original&#x27; Batiste and this &#x27;Tropical&#x27; - I like both.  The tropical smells a little like that coconut suntan lotion scent. I have tried almost every brand of dry shampoo and none have done as good a job for me as Batiste and the price is great.  I HIGHLY, recommend this to anyone, especially if you have fine/thin hair.</li>
    <li> The best. Hands Down. The end.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them all (bumble &amp; bumble, Oribe, old fashion baby powder, you name it)&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light and fresh so it won&#x27;t overpower your perfume, but it will mask an oily hair smell if you get one</li>
    <li> This product is great when you just want to touch up your hair. Having a oily scalp and thin hair means at the end of the day, my hair is oily looking, so I spray a little of this on and the problem is gone, and I can go out and not worry about having that oily/unclean hair look.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo brand. Only one I use and have tried dozens! Hard to find in stores so so happy I found it here!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so hard to find and often ridiculously expensive.  But it is the best dry shampoo I have found - and I have looked at a LOT of them.&lt;br /&gt;I have kinda thin, very long hair and it lacks body almost immediately after washing. Using this stuff on the roots perks it up immediately, plus keeps it from looking fresh longer. I can&#x27;t wash it every day or it gets all dry and brittle. This stuff saves me every day.&lt;br /&gt;I use some others as in-between helpers, but only due to the cost of this one - I would use it all the time if I could.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard complaints that it looks like powder when you spray it on - well, duh, that&#x27;s what makes it the best!  You spray it on, let it sit for a couple of minutes, then comb it through - looks amazing!  The powder look goes away for the most part and leaves the awesome effects.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried almost EVERY dry shampoo on the market and I was very disappointed until I found this product in a Copenhagen drug store.  I used to buy the original and blush variety from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and they work well however I do not like the smell because they actually gave me a headache.  The blush smells like overpowering old lady perfume and does not fade as the day goes on.  This product however has a very light summery scent that not only doesn&#x27;t smell overpowering, it actually smells good.  A man came up behind me while I was at work and as he was talking to me, he stopped mid-sentence and said my hair smelled great...A MAN!  I have very fine hair that gets oily the same day I was it, and it tends to break easily since it is color treated.  I decided to try dry shampoo to stave off breakage and I was amazed when I tried this product!  My hair actually looks better when I don&#x27;t wash it and use this dry shampoo.  I spray lightly in the front , crown and lift layers in the back in short bursts while shaking it vigorously.  If you don&#x27;t shake the bottle it doesn&#x27;t work and you get more of the powdery look.  Then I let it dry and massage it in, cover with a shower cap and shower as I normally would.  Then when I get out I brush the product out in several different directions, flip my head over etc to ensure I brush it out well.  Then I style as normal and my hair is clean, smells great and has more volume than I would when I wash it.  People who do not use it correctly do not like it and some people have a hard time getting used to showering without washing your hair.  If you try it for a few weeks you will be so glad and have more time to sleep in etc on days you do not wash!  After having used this product and not washing as often my scalp has adjusted and is less oily than ever, so much so that some days I can not wash and not even need dry shampoo and I can even put out washing my hair for three days sometimes.  I have used every fragrance Batiste makes original, fresh, blush, diva, boho, brit and this one by far has the best fragrance and even the ones for darker hair do not compare.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on the expensive products-tropical is the best one out there by a mile!kes original, fresh, blush, diva, boho, brit and this one by far has the best fragrance and even the ones for darker hair do not compare.

    <li> My favorite dry shampoo. I will sometimes buy a cheaper brand at the drug store, but those are really inferior. Batiste leaves no white residue in my hair like others and seems to get it cleaner and leaves it looking better. Plus you just can&#x27;t beat the tropical scent, it smells like vacation! :)  The listing when I bought the last time said bottles were 5ozs like most brands but they&#x27;re actually 6.73ozs, so it&#x27;s an even better deal. One bottle lasts me about a month and I use it 4-5 days per week.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this isnt my favorite dry shampoo (my favorite is $20 at Sephora but who can afford to keep buying that) but it is my favorite for the price! I have tried others in a similar price ranges, and this one does the best job. The fragrance doesnt really matter, it really doesnt stick so get whatever.</li>
    <li> I began to use this after I gave up on Tigi Rockoholic dry shampoo, it is way cheaper and works just as good.  I don&#x27;t really care that much for the tropical smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it and it is better than having dirty, greasy hair!  Use this daily and you will only have to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; your hair once or twice a week.  I am sad they are discontinuing it, now I will have to find another brand of dry shampoo that is reasonably priced.  Also, a case of 6 lasted me a year or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various brands of dry shampoos. I prefer this one over all others, including some that are three times the price of this one. I&#x27;m saddened that my local Sally beauty supply stopped carrying this product but grateful to be able to find it on Amazon. Please don&#x27;t stop carrying it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few dry shampoos -- high end lines to drugstore brands. A friend gave me Batiste to try and I haven&#x27;t looked back. I get almost 20 applications from a single bottle. It goes on light and smoothly. Yes, it will leave your hair and scalp white, but less than baby powder residue. I apply at night to a) soak up the oil that accumulates at night before my hair gets too greasy but b) to allow time for the white residue to fade away. A quick blow dry with my fingers in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go.  My hair feels fresh, airy, and almost freshly washed (almost. no product can achieve that but real shampoo). I did try the Batiste for brunettes and do not like it nearly as much. It leaves a stiff residue and I believe isn&#x27;t as effective at soaking up the oils. I&#x27;m sticking to this from here on.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this dry shampoo. The scent is so festive and subtle. It really does work if you need a quick refresh. It&#x27;s good to let your hair rest from all that harsh shampooing, and this is a nice product to let you do that.</li>
