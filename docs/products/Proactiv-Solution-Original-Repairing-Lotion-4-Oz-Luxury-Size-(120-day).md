      <li>Proactiv is the best!</li>
      <li>Anyway, what I found was that I didn&#x27;t need the wash or toner, but the repairing lotion is very good.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and the price was very good.  </li>
      <li>Its great.  </li>
      <li>great product</li>
      <li>br /&gt;it works over night and we were happy with it</li>
      <li>And doesn&#x27;t expire until 12/13 , I am extremely happy with the product itself, the seller (paulsbestbargains) and the price I paid.</li>
      <li>But even without the cleanser and toner, this lotion is very effective.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and found it to be a very effective way to keep skin</li>
      <li>Another excellent product that I&#x27;ve used for many years.</li>
      <li>love it :D</li>
      <li>Good luck.&lt;br</li>
      <li>GOOD.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t need a lot to get good results.</li>
      <li>Packaging was good.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure this rate must greatly among individuals.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with product.  </li>
      <li>I am 100% satisfied and will purchase again!</li>
      <li>Great product, very quick absorption, not greasy, works well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years- even though my skin looks amazing now, I still use it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not irritating and works great for blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;best product ever!</li>
      <li>I love proactiv and this is a good deal.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice to just buy what you need.</li>
      <li>and I am very happy I came across Proactive because nothing else has ever been even nearly as helpful</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very important.</li>
      <li>This has been safe to use.</li>
      <li>Wash your shower towel more often.</li>
      <li>I have been using Proactive for 6 months and my skin and face color look so much better.  </li>
      <li>I tend to work in the lotion more in the effected areas for longer periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t feel a sting, it&#x27;s still working :-)</li>
      <li>They love how it repairs immediately.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this moisturizer for 7 years now, and I love it.</li>
      <li>20 seconds is the time it takes to get most germs off of your hands.</li>
      <li>love love love it.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>My skin tone also is better- shinier, healthier</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Out of all the proactive steps this is the one my daughter uses the most of</li>
      <li>Make sure to shower every day.</li>
      <li>am amazed at how much better Proactiv works than anything else we have tried.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant, gentle scent to it too, nothing overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve repurchased as needed, didn&#x27;t expect this HUGE size (my own fault) but non the less great product!  </li>
      <li>I do recommend the cleanser the most, one of the most effective yet gentle cleansers out there.  </li>
      <li>IT TRY IT AND FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR SKIN ACNE FREE</li>
      <li>Easy to use.....</li>
      <li>I also need to mention that Diane 35 (birth control pills) makes a huge difference in this battle with acne  </li>
      <li>This is the same great proactive product you would buy at the mall, but easier because it comes delivered in 2 days with amazon prime.  </li>
      <li>and I still get the same great results..</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find the luxury size at such a good price.</li>
      <li>is definitively better if you use it right when you feel the blemish coming.</li>
      <li>The grease and germs/bacteria you pick up from your hands transfers very nicely into tiny pores.</li>
      <li>It came with the original seal on it.</li>
      <li>Stop touching your face so much!</li>
      <li>100% true in my case.  </li>
      <li>This product is not exactly what i thought I was ordering, but the bottle was sealed and in great condition.</li>
      <li>it was actually everything it said it was and works great , arrived fast and well packaged.</li>
      <li>However, I do like the repairing lotion as a quick fix for blemishes to wear under your moisturizer until you can get to a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly, but it expires in June 2014.</li>
      <li>The seller was quick with the shipment.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok and totally normal.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin (red-haired) and find that many products I buy</li>
      <li>It really did a fantastic job of clearing and controlling acne breakouts.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth because it works.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, Salicylic Acid products work better for sensitive skin than those that have Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While in the shower you can really get your face clean.</li>
      <li>If you pick it you will just introduce more bacteria and infect the wound further.</li>
      <li>First time users</li>
      <li>Proactive has always worked pretty well for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also manages to be pretty moisturizing (for what it is) and gentle!  </li>
      <li>and, I should say, even irritated skin, though I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to do that in the first place).&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered this exact product (the 4oz luxury size) just this month (Feb 2014).</li>
      <li>I love the big bottle also!</li>
      <li>For a good week you will keep rubbing off large amounts of dead skin every morning.</li>
      <li>The lotion ended up working just fine with the cleanser and toner I bought from my local department store.</li>
      <li>so finding a good moisturizer for my skin is hard to find without causing breakouts.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t use The Repair Lotion twice a day as it is recommended - it dries out my skin to much.  </li>
      <li>The combination of the drying ingredients of the face wash and the acids in the toner and moisturizer is too much out in the sun.  </li>
      <li>I also have very oily skin</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the whole line of Proactiv products so</li>
      <li>It really works when you use it correctly.</li>
      <li>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY WONFERFUL  </li>
      <li>So now that your face is fully saturated with moisture, gently run over the effected areas.</li>
      <li>Start by using a gentle soap, like Dove.</li>
      <li>I used to be on their auto-delivery program, but stopped last year because I thought I could get good results with other products.</li>
      <li>I really like this product in particular</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that you can&#x27;t get rid of hormonal acne, you only can control it.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my skin clear, and this large size is very convenient.</li>
      <li>I started using Proactiv in my mid 30&#x27;s and the pimples are rarely seen (and if seen, they go away really fast), and my blackheads are gone.  </li>
      <li>My husband and now our high school grandson uses it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is a 120 day supply, and that it true as long as you use it generously.</li>
      <li>Eventually your skin will start to return to normal with the help of the lotion.</li>
      <li>If you have very sensitive skin (like I do), I would stay away from the Proactiv line.</li>
      <li>Both have oily skin and very sensitive and</li>
      <li>Also, the toner is helpful too, but I think toner is a 50-50 for some people, when I lived in NY, I didn&#x27;t need it, now I live in GA and with the heat, it has become another necessity to keep my face clear.  </li>
      <li>I love the option to buy the bigger bottles because then I don&#x27;t feel like I am having to buy new face products every few weeks.  </li>
      <li>I tiny bit goes a long way andm after a month, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference.</li>
      <li>From the time I started using the product to the time pimples began to clear, it was about 5-7 days.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love proactiv and this is a good deal. This is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
    <li> I never had bad acne, but I&#x27;ve always had at least one pimple a month, as well as blackheads on my nose.  I started using Proactiv in my mid 30&#x27;s and the pimples are rarely seen (and if seen, they go away really fast), and my blackheads are gone.  It&#x27;s an expensive program, but use the cleanser, toner and &#x27;lotion&#x27; (which is not moisturizing) and you&#x27;ll be amazed.  My skin tone also is better- shinier, healthier (I think it&#x27;s due to the exfoliation).  It&#x27;s not harsh or drying, either.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that helped my teenager and I tried everything including several dermatologists that prescribed creams antibiotics. Nothing seemed to work on my sons sensitive skin until Proactive. No hype ! It really did a fantastic job of clearing and controlling acne breakouts. Wished I had found it sooner !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the entire proactive line but I&#x27;ve used this lotion for over 6 months. My face was HORRIBLE and I am 34 years old so it wasn&#x27;t to be expected. I wash my face once a day after I workout with glycerin soap and a little baking soda, then I apply the lotion. I only wash and apply the lotion once a day and my complexion is clear now. I love the big bottle also!</li>
    <li> My daughter has mild acne and has been given prescriptions for other medications, but we keep going back to Proactiv because it actually works.  I tried to save money by buying an over the counter toner to go with the Reparing Lotion, but am having to puchase the Proactiv toner because it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed at how much better Proactiv works than anything else we have tried.  It really works when you use it correctly.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily and acne has been a problem for me since my teens (I&#x27;m in my 40s).  No product worked to minimize and prevent my breakouts until Proactiv came along.  I used to buy the whole kit, but it got too expensive when the economy tanked so I wound up just buying the repairing lotion by itself and using a cheaper cleanser and toner.  The lotion ended up working just fine with the cleanser and toner I bought from my local department store.</li>
    <li> If you have acne and have not tried this product you must!  I do recommend the cleanser the most, one of the most effective yet gentle cleansers out there.  Also, the toner is helpful too, but I think toner is a 50-50 for some people, when I lived in NY, I didn&#x27;t need it, now I live in GA and with the heat, it has become another necessity to keep my face clear.  But even without the cleanser and toner, this lotion is very effective. Does cause some dryness but I take that as a given.</li>
    <li> If you have very sensitive skin (like I do), I would stay away from the Proactiv line. The cleanser is too harsh and the toner did nothing for my skin. However, I do like the repairing lotion as a quick fix for blemishes to wear under your moisturizer until you can get to a dermatologist. Other than that, it is way too expensive to keep re-purchasing. In my opinion, Salicylic Acid products work better for sensitive skin than those that have Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, as long as you use it consistently. My son uses it every day, and his acne has improved dramatically.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve repurchased as needed, didn&#x27;t expect this HUGE size (my own fault) but non the less great product!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY WONFERFUL  5STARSI RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WTH ACNE PROBLEMS IT WORKS THATS IT TRY IT AND FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR SKIN ACNE FREE</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 11 years now and I still get the same great results.. Plus, I am not allergic to it as I am with other face cleaning products.</li>
    <li> This product met all my expectations. I was very pleased with product.  Will purchase this product again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been the only thing that I have found that helps my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried every last thing off the shelf but this is what keeps me clear.  When going out into the sun I use old fashioned Noxema face wash and no Proactive products that day because you will bake your skin if you do.  The combination of the drying ingredients of the face wash and the acids in the toner and moisturizer is too much out in the sun.  You&#x27;ll look like leather.  Or use a sunscreen but sunscreen makes me break out.</li>
    <li> Great product, very quick absorption, not greasy, works well. Minimal fragrance.  My son uses it and has not had any excessive dryness.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for 7 years now, and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too oily or too dry and I have combination skin so finding a good moisturizer for my skin is hard to find without causing breakouts. It is a 120 day supply, and that it true as long as you use it generously. I usually like to pair it with the Green Tea Moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> works like the refining mask ...only faster. put it on your pimple tonight...wake up pimple free...basically would recommend to every one</li>
    <li> This solution actually helps dry my oily skin without drying it out altogether or causing it to peel. I tiny bit goes a long way andm after a month, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference. I would have been using this product for years had I known about it. I have very sensitive skin (red-haired) and find that many products I buy I end up having to throw away because they cause some sort of reaction. This has been safe to use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using this since I was a teen. I still have a couple pimples, but thats probably due to my diet and such. This helps keep it at bay, if I stop using it for a while its noticeably worse. The seller was quick with the shipment.</li>
    <li> Start by using a gentle soap, like Dove. Wash your hands for 20 seconds. 20 seconds is the time it takes to get most germs off of your hands. Next wet your face and wash that for 20 seconds. Same rule applies. I generally try to wash my effected area for 20 seconds and wash the rest a bit faster. After that, dry your face and apply a button sized amount to your face. I tend to work in the lotion more in the effected areas for longer periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in the shower you can really get your face clean. Go about your shower and save your face for last after wetting it periodically. One of the reasons people get acne is from dead skin getting in pores. So now that your face is fully saturated with moisture, gently run over the effected areas. You will start to feel the dead skin rub off. Keep rubbing and washing away. Don&#x27;t rub too hard. Moving in circular motions works well. For a good week you will keep rubbing off large amounts of dead skin every morning. Eventually your skin will start to return to normal with the help of the lotion. It took me about a week and a half to get 90% of my acne off of my forehead using this technique. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Make sure to shower every day. Wash your face twice a day. Stop touching your face so much! You know the areas you touch, stop that! The grease and germs/bacteria you pick up from your hands transfers very nicely into tiny pores. You cant not touch your face so try to keep your hands cleaner. Wash your shower towel more often. Bacteria from that can transfer to your face as well. Do not pick. I&#x27;m terrible at this but it&#x27;s very important. It itches because it&#x27;s healing. If you pick it you will just introduce more bacteria and infect the wound further. Let it heal and your skin will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> GOOD. I can use this big product for 4 months. Yeah.</li>
    <li> I really like this product in particular</li>
    <li> recieved on time..great product</li>
    <li> My 15 year old swear by this product... is definitively better if you use it right when you feel the blemish coming.</li>
    <li> I tried weaning myself from using all 3 steps of Proactive once my skin was clear of pimples.  However after I stopped and went to a regular face-washing regimen (twice a day), small pimples appeared again 2-3 months later. This time, I bought only the Lotion (active ingredient &#x3D; Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%), and use a regular wash, and my pimples have been well controlled unless I eat something extremely greasy.  From the time I started using the product to the time pimples began to clear, it was about 5-7 days.  But I&#x27;m sure this rate must greatly among individuals.</li>
    <li> Cheeper than Pro Active. Nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;Everything showed upon time.&lt;br /&gt;It was what I wanted and it was packed well and didn&#x27;t explode.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40 and started breaking out bad on my jawline.  I thought it was hormones and started using my Retin A on them to clear it up faster. I purchased this as a last result and it has cleared my skin dramatically</li>
    <li> This stuff cleared my skin up within a week.</li>
    <li> Another excellent product that I&#x27;ve used for many years. Nothing else comes close to the quality of Proactiv. First time users: You may feel a small stinging sensation when initially using this product. It&#x27;s ok and totally normal. That means it&#x27;s working! If you don&#x27;t feel a sting, it&#x27;s still working :-)</li>
    <li> This is a 120 day supply and when I checked it the expiry date was only one month away!</li>
    <li> My husband and now our high school grandson uses it. They love how it repairs immediately.&lt;br /&gt;you can actually see results the next day. Both have oily skin and very sensitive and this always&lt;br /&gt;replenishes their face to be clear of any blemishes. love love love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and found it to be a very effective way to keep skin&lt;br /&gt;smooth and clear. Easy to use.....you don&#x27;t need a lot to get good results.</li>
    <li> Works! Works! Works! Works! Works!  Leaves my sensitive skin a little red, but I moisturize!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It is not irritating and works great for blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;best product ever!</li>
    <li> Arrived as specified.</li>
    <li> Out of all the proactive steps this is the one my daughter uses the most of so it&#x27;s nice to just buy what you need.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It is not greasy and my face does not feel oily after I apply it. I will never use anything else on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using proactiv off and on for about 10 years. I used to be on their auto-delivery program, but stopped last year because I thought I could get good results with other products. Anyway, what I found was that I didn&#x27;t need the wash or toner, but the repairing lotion is very good. I ordered this exact product (the 4oz luxury size) just this month (Feb 2014). The product arrived quickly, but it expires in June 2014. WTF? That&#x27;s not even six months away, and with such a large bottle, I will surely not be through with it before June. That is not the worst part though. The worst part is the bottle itself. Talk about inconvenient to use. It&#x27;s very large, which I expected for a 4 oz bottle, but the dispensing mechanism is frustrating. The bottle is very hard, so not easy to squeeze out the product, and it has an overly large spout at the top with a tiny opening. I am practically wrestling with the thing just to get enough product out to use. The lid is very large and unnecessary too. Unlike the smaller bottles where its a small flip lid, this is just big and bulky. I took it off and through it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take my advice and order the smaller bottles.</li>
    <li> It works!!!  Proactiv Repairing Lotion is the ONLY remedy that really does its job and kills the acne causing bacteria. I have hormonal acne and I am very happy I came across Proactive because nothing else has ever been even nearly as helpful (I have tried lots of other brands) as this lotion.  I have been using Proactive for 6 months and my skin and face color look so much better.  It&#x27;s true that you can&#x27;t get rid of hormonal acne, you only can control it.  100% true in my case.  I am 32 y/o white female and for the last 20 years was suffering from acne on my face/back/chest. Not anymore.  I also have very oily skin and my pores tend to clog a lot no matter what. My skin is still oily (Proactive oil control helps though) but my pores don&#x27;t get clogged as bad as it used to be and I have almost zero break outs.  I also need to mention that Diane 35 (birth control pills) makes a huge difference in this battle with acne  (50% - Proactive, 40% -Diane 35, 10% - skin care regiment).  I probably would have had no breakouts at all even before my periods but I can&#x27;t use The Repair Lotion twice a day as it is recommended - it dries out my skin to much.  There are few downsides using this product - you will have to apply a sunblock, moisturize your skin - but it is a small price to pay for a healthy looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, the bottle will go a long way and last for long enough as you won&#x27;t need a lot. Not very cheap but it&#x27;s worth because it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these leave in repairing lotions (namely the drug store knock offs of proactiv) and I still keep going back to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts forever (on me, and I put a thin layer on my entire face), far longer than 120 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also manages to be pretty moisturizing (for what it is) and gentle!  I have relatively sensitive skin and this is the only one that hasn&#x27;t managed to irritate me at all, even when put on sensitive skin areas (and, I should say, even irritated skin, though I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to do that in the first place).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant, gentle scent to it too, nothing overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it :D</li>
    <li> Proactiv is the best! It keeps my skin clear, and this large size is very convenient.</li>
    <li> product was perfect and shiooing was prompt</li>
    <li> This was for my kids&lt;br /&gt;it works over night and we were happy with it&lt;br /&gt;they use this one and of and seems to work well</li>
    <li> Works everytime! Sometimes even overnight! Will keep buying again and again! Its the only product thats ever helped!</li>
    <li> what I gotta say that when I bought this product and got it home it was already reading that it will expire in March who can use 4 ounces of product the dinner Barry short. Of time not me. However I still had the bottle where it reads expired in March 2014 which I still had a quarter of the product left so I&#x27;m not sure if I got it bad bottle or whatever but expected a little bit better</li>
    <li> Second time I have purchased said product; sent right out, never lets me down! Will buy product again, extremely happy!</li>
    <li> This product is not exactly what i thought I was ordering, but the bottle was sealed and in great condition. I use this everyday and it does work, but the description was a little off.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped to me within 3 days. It came with the original seal on it. And doesn&#x27;t expire until 12/13 , I am extremely happy with the product itself, the seller (paulsbestbargains) and the price I paid. This product on the proactiv website is upwards of 50$. I am 100% satisfied and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the price was very good.  I have used this product for several years.  Even though I am over 50 I was bothered with facial acne.  The Repairing Lotion took care of it.  Its great.  Received in a timely manner.  Packaging was good.</li>
    <li> Proactive has always worked pretty well for me. I was very excited to find the luxury size at such a good price.</li>
    <li> If I had the means to, I&#x27;d give Proactiv to everyone I see with blemished skin. The 3-step system is life changing! I&#x27;ve been using it for years- even though my skin looks amazing now, I still use it.</li>
    <li> it was actually everything it said it was and works great , arrived fast and well packaged. I will order again</li>
    <li> All I use out of the proactiv products is this repairing lotion and it keeps my face clear without drying it out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the whole line of Proactiv products so the ones I do use I buy individually.  I love the option to buy the bigger bottles because then I don&#x27;t feel like I am having to buy new face products every few weeks.  This is the same great proactive product you would buy at the mall, but easier because it comes delivered in 2 days with amazon prime.  I have been purchasing this product on amazon for years and I will continue to do so as long as this big size is offered.</li>
