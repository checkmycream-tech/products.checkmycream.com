      <li>I love the jar it comes in</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I feel it&#x27;s worth a try!!</li>

      <li>But after using this product, I&#x27;m going to try to make time to enjoy this spa-like treatment often.  </li>
      <li>And, with the proper moisturizer afterwards, my face feels great.</li>
      <li>found my pores look smaller and my skin feels and looks great.  </li>
      <li>in this case, I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as &amp;#34;hurts&amp;#34; but I can&#x27;t argue that there were good results that came with the discomfort.</li>
      <li>After receiving this product at a GREATLY reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion I have taken my time, used the product in place of my normal product(s) and have giving it the time and attention required to say I really liked this Dead Seas Mud Mask.</li>
      <li>Very nice facial mask.  </li>
      <li>This was one of the most pleasant one to work with because it has absolutely no scent.</li>
      <li>It feels cool, creamy, and refreshing when first applied to the skin.  </li>
      <li>After drying and rinsing, the skin feels renewed:  moist, supple, clean, and firmed, and neither oily nor</li>
      <li>I would recommend following the mask up with a good moisturizer, They say that beauty hurts...</li>
      <li>This is a good mask--makes skin soft and smooth afterwards and for the next day.</li>
      <li>In the future, I think a light layer would suffice much better.</li>
      <li>I love natural and organic skin care that helps my combination skin.</li>
      <li>I look forward to continued use and positive results!</li>
      <li>This spreads nicely and seems to dry evenly.</li>
      <li>thank you very much</li>
      <li>You need to prep your face first.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;To get the most out of it you need to following the instruction and not take shortcuts.</li>
      <li>Your skin will be soft and smooth.    </li>
      <li>I Love facial masks!</li>
      <li>I remove it by apply a hot towel with a circular motion.</li>
      <li>At first I was upset because I broke out when I used this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While the redness issue knocks my rating down a star, I think it is well worth considering if you&#x27;re looking for a rich mask that performs well and is easy to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked how it made my face feel soft, almost like I was just pampered at the local spa.</li>
      <li>This mask does what it says it will do: it does a great job as a facial deep cleaner, and leaves your skin soft.  </li>
      <li>After I spread it with my fingers they did not feel greasy, the mask came off easily, and I could see cleaner pores instantly.</li>
      <li>I waited about 20 minutes before taking it off (10 more minutes than the recommended time) and it still wasn&#x27;t completely dry.</li>
      <li>Looking forward to having nice even skin with tight pores.</li>
      <li>Some masks I have tried have been a real bear to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It left my skin smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To begin, I really like that this product was unscented.</li>
      <li>I really think it&#x27;s going to work out</li>
      <li>I can really feel a difference in my skin when I use it.</li>
      <li>My skin looked and felt very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>However, whenbits drying it really makes my face itch.</li>
      <li>I had a completely pleasant experience with it from the first time opening the jar, to the final few drops.</li>
      <li>Be sure to clean your face well; put a hot wet wash cloth on your face for a couple minutes to open the pores;  pat your face dry with a CLEAN towel...</li>
      <li>It left my face feeling dewy and clean, and looking soothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>received a complimentary sample of Olely Dead Sea Mud facial mask in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>I liked that there was no overwhelming scent</li>
      <li>I have a pretty sensitive skin but had I had no bad reaction to the mud the next day - no break outs or redness.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, very light skinned people may find their face somewhat red (like a medium sunburn) for a short period after removing the mask.  </li>
      <li>First, open your pores by laying a very warm wet washcloth on your face for a couple of minutes, then dry your face</li>
      <li>/&gt;Olely Dead Sea Mud mask is almost completely fragrance free (I expected more mud scent!), and contains organic shea butter, aloe vera, sunflower oil, jojoba oil and eucalyptus oil.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you dry your face or the mud will not stick properly.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is that it effectively brings facial bacteria to the surface because I struggle with adult acne and any blemishes that may be forming become immediate whiteheads the next day.</li>
      <li>Wash thoroughly and then put a hot washcloth on your face for about 2 minutes to open up the pores.  </li>
      <li>applied a layer of it on my clean face after leaving a hot, moist washcloth on it for a few minutes to open the pores.  </li>
      <li>My face never felt so soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I have been using it with a me skin line I found developed by a chemist.  </li>
      <li>I used it twice so far and each time noticed that my face felt softer and smoother.  </li>
      <li>It has almost no odor and can be used even by people with sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I probably had a reaction to something in it.</li>
      <li>My husband is still raving about how soft my skin was after using the mask.</li>
      <li>remember there is bacteria on your old ones</li>
      <li>Like most masks, it dried over the course of the ten minutes</li>
      <li>Keep it on for at exactly 10 minutes, or you can dry your skin.  </li>
      <li>facial mask is such a special treat after relaxing in a hot tub with the  [[ASIN:B00IRBY2R6 lavender Dead Sea mineral and milk bath soak]].  </li>
      <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask has a beautiful deep grey color from the mineral-rich Dead Sea mud, which is blended with a few choice organic ingredients to condition and protect the skin:  shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera juice, calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.  </li>
      <li>The mud is smooth and has very little scent (sort of an earthy smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very careful with what I put on my face, so when I was offered a test sample of this product, the first thing I wanted to know was the ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Helped so much with dry flaky skin!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used too many facial masks, as I am usually too busy to wait for it to dry.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t speak on the quality of it, but she was really excited to get it and has used it at least once since I gave it to her</li>
      <li>Apply the mask, and it should take about 10 minutes for the dark grey mask to dry to a light gray.  </li>
      <li>Does not dry out my skin but helps balance it out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my mask had mold in it! ewwww!</li>
    <li> this is great stuff I really think it&#x27;s going to work out perfect I&#x27;ll probably be returning customer thank you very much</li>
    <li> Very nice facial mask.  With having natural ingredients and being unscented worked great for my combination skin.  After using it my pores were tighter and skin felt smoother.  I just followed the instructions that came with it and it worked wonderful.  Looking forward to having nice even skin with tight pores.</li>
    <li> Nice product for pulling our impuritiesin oily zone.</li>
    <li> When you open the jar, the mask looks like a really thick mud, but it applies very thinly. Since the directions call for a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; layer of the mask, don&#x27;t be afraid to apply liberally. I used more than I originally thought would be needed, but can&#x27;t argue with the results. My husband is still raving about how soft my skin was after using the mask. I noticed a healthy glow to it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five stars was because I found the mask to be slightly uncomfortable. Like most masks, it dried over the course of the ten minutes I kept it on. Towards the end, I found the drying process to be extremely itchy. I didn&#x27;t have a rash, but the itchiness continued for several hours afterwards. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I probably had a reaction to something in it. Additionally, my skin felt very tight afterwards. I would recommend following the mask up with a good moisturizer, They say that beauty hurts...in this case, I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as &amp;#34;hurts&amp;#34; but I can&#x27;t argue that there were good results that came with the discomfort.</li>
    <li> Have only used this once but could already see a difference in the feel/look of my skin!  Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> I Love facial masks! I&#x27;ve heard crazy things about dead sea mud. When I saw the oppurtunity to get one, I jumped on it. My face never felt so soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This product was provided to me in exchange for my opinion.  I like it!  I used it twice so far and each time noticed that my face felt softer and smoother.  My daughter noticed the same.  It has no scent, which is nice!  It&#x27;s smooth and silky, easy to apply.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite colors--charcoal.  It has organic ingredients and mud from the Dead Sea.  I&#x27;m thinking that means lots of minerals!</li>
    <li> After receiving this product at a GREATLY reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion I have taken my time, used the product in place of my normal product(s) and have giving it the time and attention required to say I really liked this Dead Seas Mud Mask. I liked how it made my face feel soft, almost like I was just pampered at the local spa. I had a completely pleasant experience with it from the first time opening the jar, to the final few drops. If you are a Mud Mask fan, then this is one product you might want to give a try.</li>
    <li> A great refreshing clean. Helped so much with dry flaky skin!</li>
    <li> My skin always is prone to acne so I tried this to help on my face- which is always the worst part. It&#x27;s been working great in helping me control the acne. I liked that there was no overwhelming scent and it wasn&#x27;t drying or harsh on my skin. I don&#x27;t need to use tons (I apply a thin layer), so I think this container will last me a long time- even using it once a week.</li>
    <li> This is a good mask--makes skin soft and smooth afterwards and for the next day. The only problem is that it effectively brings facial bacteria to the surface because I struggle with adult acne and any blemishes that may be forming become immediate whiteheads the next day.</li>
    <li> Yuck.  Mine came with mold in it.  Returning.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1N3HP8YR9B2K3]]I have used a number of facial masks in the past. This was one of the most pleasant one to work with because it has absolutely no scent. After I spread it with my fingers they did not feel greasy, the mask came off easily, and I could see cleaner pores instantly. I like claying my car when I detail it, this felt just like that - claying my face to remove little bumps and dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I apply the mud I put a hot cloth on my face for a few minutes, then spread the mud with my fingers. I usaully leave on for about 10-15 minutes. I remove it by apply a hot towel with a circular motion. I have a pretty sensitive skin but had I had no bad reaction to the mud the next day - no break outs or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Mud&lt;br /&gt;Organic Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe Vera Juice&lt;br /&gt;Organic Sunflower Oil&lt;br /&gt;Organic Vegetable Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;Organic Jajoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;Hickory Bark Extract&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus Oil&lt;br /&gt;Organic Calendula Oil&lt;br /&gt;Filtered Water&lt;br /&gt;Xanthan Gum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks better because when I remove the mud it clears the pores. The manufacturers estimate is that one tub will last 20 uses and based on using several times before writing this review this estimates feels on target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Mask provided by Olely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never done a mud mask before, know this....it is mud.  With some added oils, minerals and salts.  Don&#x27;t let the size of the jar fool you, it does not take a lot and you&#x27;ll probably get at least 15-20 facials from this jar.    You need to prep your face first.  Wash thoroughly and then put a hot washcloth on your face for about 2 minutes to open up the pores.  Make sure you dry your face or the mud will not stick properly.  After applying the mud mask, sit back and relax for about 10 minutes.  After than, simply rinse the mud away.  Your skin will be soft and smooth.    I have experienced a recent outbreak of stress induced chin acne.  I have been doing this mask twice a week for the past two weeks and have noticed the pimples heal must faster.    Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a mud mask.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I love natural and organic skin care that helps my combination skin. Does not dry out my skin but helps balance it out.</li>
    <li> I like this product quite a bit. I can really feel a difference in my skin when I use it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used too many facial masks, as I am usually too busy to wait for it to dry.  I&#x27;m happy if I just get my face washed and some serum put on it at night.  But after using this product, I&#x27;m going to try to make time to enjoy this spa-like treatment often.  It&#x27;s a smooth, creamy gray paste that spreads easily, and rinses fully.  It comes with an elastic headband to keep hair off the face, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied a layer of it on my clean face after leaving a hot, moist washcloth on it for a few minutes to open the pores.  It&#x27;s humid here so it took about 15 minutes under the ceiling fan for the mask to dry and feel tight.  I washed it off with a washcloth, and loved the way my skin felt when I was done.  It left my face feeling dewy and clean, and looking soothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olely Dead Sea Mud mask is almost completely fragrance free (I expected more mud scent!), and contains organic shea butter, aloe vera, sunflower oil, jojoba oil and eucalyptus oil.  The Dead Sea salt in the mud acts as a purifier, drawing out dirt and oil in the pores, and tightening the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Olely Dead Sea Mud facial mask in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This is truly a spa-quality mud mask.  It feels cool, creamy, and refreshing when first applied to the skin.  After drying and rinsing, the skin feels renewed:  moist, supple, clean, and firmed, and neither oily nor dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask has a beautiful deep grey color from the mineral-rich Dead Sea mud, which is blended with a few choice organic ingredients to condition and protect the skin:  shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera juice, calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.  It has almost no odor and can be used even by people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very nice and a reusable stretch headband is included, so it would make a very appreciated gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial mask is such a special treat after relaxing in a hot tub with the  [[ASIN:B00IRBY2R6 lavender Dead Sea mineral and milk bath soak]].  It makes me feel so spoiled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A review sample was provided by Olely for testing and evaluation.</li>
    <li> Arrived when it was suppose to, haven&#x27;t used it as I am giving it as a gift for Christmas. Will post after I find out how she likes it. I love the jar it comes in and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
    <li> I love it my face feel really good when I take it off ...</li>
    <li> Nice mud mask! I love that it is unscented (too many products focus on perfumes). This spreads nicely and seems to dry evenly. My skin felt refreshed after I washed it off. I look forward to continued use and positive results!</li>
    <li> At first I was upset because I broke out when I used this. But, they were small red blotches that cleared up by the next day so I kept trying. My face must have just gotten used to this because I have stopped breaking out. I do like the feeling I get when it starts tightening as it dries. And, with the proper moisturizer afterwards, my face feels great. (Added bonus, I put it on mosquito bites and it keeps them from swelling up and itching.)</li>
    <li> This face mud worked great. I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to it.</li>
    <li> I like the product! However, whenbits drying it really makes my face itch.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my mother in law as a gift so I can&#x27;t speak on the quality of it, but she was really excited to get it and has used it at least once since I gave it to her and she seems to be enjoying it! Hopefully it works well. No complaints!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but It lasts a long time</li>
    <li> This mask works very nicely. It left my skin smooth. I didn&#x27;t like how tight it felt though as it dried.</li>
    <li> This mask does what it says it will do: it does a great job as a facial deep cleaner, and leaves your skin soft.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I can&#x27;t fault the performance (other than some irritation, as noted below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the most out of it you need to following the instruction and not take shortcuts. First, open your pores by laying a very warm wet washcloth on your face for a couple of minutes, then dry your face (if you don&#x27;t dry your face, it will take much longer for the mask to dry after you apply it.)  Apply the mask, and it should take about 10 minutes for the dark grey mask to dry to a light gray.  At this point wash it off. The mud is smooth and has very little scent (sort of an earthy smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Dead Sea Mud&lt;br /&gt;Organic Shea butter&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe Vera juice&lt;br /&gt;Organic sunflower oil&lt;br /&gt;Organic vegetable glycerin&lt;br /&gt;Organic jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;Hickory bark extract&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus oil&lt;br /&gt;Organic calendula oil&lt;br /&gt;Filtered water&lt;br /&gt;Xantham gum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in glass jar, but there is no taper-resistant seal around the jar lid or over the mask material itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience some tingling and itching as I waited for the mask to dry, but have had this happen with other masks. I&#x27;ll note it in case you want to avoid any facial product that, even temporarily, irritates your skin.  Also, very light skinned people may find their face somewhat red (like a medium sunburn) for a short period after removing the mask.  For me, this faded in about an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product includes a small strip of textured cloth. I initially thought it was there to be used to remove the mask after it has dried, but later found out that it is a headband so you can keep your hair away from the mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the redness issue knocks my rating down a star, I think it is well worth considering if you&#x27;re looking for a rich mask that performs well and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]for review]</li>
    <li> I am very careful with what I put on my face, so when I was offered a test sample of this product, the first thing I wanted to know was the ingredients.  Well, they were all organic (perfect!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product contains:&lt;br /&gt;  -  Pure Dead Sea Mud&lt;br /&gt;  -  Organic Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;  -  Organic Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;  -  Organic Aloe Vera Juice&lt;br /&gt;  -  Organic Calendula Oil&lt;br /&gt;  -  Hickory Bark Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are very good.  Be sure to follow them to see the best results. Be sure to clean your face well; put a hot wet wash cloth on your face for a couple minutes to open the pores;  pat your face dry with a CLEAN towel...remember there is bacteria on your old ones and you don&#x27;t want that in there!  Then, apply a medium layer rod mask on your face and neck.  Avoid the eye area and lips.  Now you just relax, and enjoy your mask.  Keep it on for at exactly 10 minutes, or you can dry your skin.  Then wash it off.  What is great is this mask comes off so easily.  Some masks I have tried have been a real bear to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found my pores look smaller and my skin feels and looks great.  I have been using it with a me skin line I found developed by a chemist.  My results are just excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The product is suppose to remove toxins, help resolve blemishes, remove dead skin cells and lots more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this mask! My skin loves this mask. Instant gratification and perfect when I need a little break to take care of myself.</li>
    <li> There was mold in the container when I received it, product was returned.</li>
    <li> I really like the Dead Sea Facial Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin, I really like that this product was unscented. For me this means that there were no perfumey smells that would trigger my allergies. A big plus for the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the mud was that of a thick, gel-like past if that makes any sense. The directions read to apply it in medium layers. I feel that their definition of &amp;#34;medium layer&amp;#34; and my definition of &amp;#34;medium layer&amp;#34; are different. I attempted to apply it so that I could see a layer on my skin. Big mistake - I waited about 20 minutes before taking it off (10 more minutes than the recommended time) and it still wasn&#x27;t completely dry. In the future, I think a light layer would suffice much better. I believe that not only will it dry in the recommended time frame but it will have the same intended effects.  As the mask dried on my face I felt a tightening of my skin in those spots. It felt good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking the mask off with a damp washcloth I noticed a difference in my skin. The few acne spots I had drastically decreased in color. A few small dry patches of skin were no longer there. My skin looked and felt very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my face was fully dry it did feel a lot softer. However, it did feel slightly greasy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did see enough benefits to the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask to try it again in another week. There is enough in the jar for multiple uses - I feel it&#x27;s worth a try!!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my stepmom. She loves how it makes her face feel.</li>
