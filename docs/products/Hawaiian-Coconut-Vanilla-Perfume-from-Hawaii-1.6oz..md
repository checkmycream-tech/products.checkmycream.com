      <li>So many scents can be offensive or overpowering.  </li>

      <li>Exotic Coconut Pleasures Collection Splash</li>

      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It is in no way a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; smelling perfume, it is a true coconut scent with a warm vanilla overlay.  </li>
      <li>The seller was super fast and packaged good.  </li>
      <li>now, but the first couple days I used it, it had a very strong overriding smell to it -</li>
      <li>Its a quality fragrance and does not smell cheap in ANY way.....</li>
      <li>I own about 40 high end fragrances</li>
      <li>Great price, quick shipping and delivery, and it smells terrific.</li>
      <li>I decided to order it online and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>When I lived in Hawaii, I used to purchase the &amp;#34;Wicked Wahine&amp;#34; fragrance by the same company and always loved it.  </li>
      <li>true coconut with a hint of vanilla.  </li>
      <li>Im actually a very thrifty person, but if I LOVE something...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just not what a grown woman would or should be wearing.</li>
      <li>She used to live in Hawaii and it brought back so many memories for her.she loved it.</li>
      <li>The scent is exactly as described!</li>
      <li>I thought this would smell better but pink sugar smells much better will not order again</li>
      <li>It does seem to fade pretty quickly, although people still notice it in the afternoon</li>
      <li>Lastly, the shippers were quick in sending this product (3-4 days), and even included a sweet hand-written note!  </li>
      <li>The scent does not last more than an hour.</li>
      <li>Absolutely DIVINE!</li>
      <li>Will most definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>It literally smells exactly like a car air freshener.</li>
      <li>But at such an affordable price, it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>First of all.</li>
      <li>The scent is definitely coconutty :)</li>
      <li>Very Customer Service friendy.</li>
      <li>Plus it really reminds me of the beach.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am also REALLY picky with purses.</li>
      <li>haha...</li>
      <li>The smell really isnt what i was looking for but it is as described...</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and item arrived well packaged.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely the smell of coconut</li>
      <li>After a few days the strong overriding smell was gone and it was exactly what I was looking for - coconutty and beachy.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for my holy grail coconut fragrance and thus had high hopes for this.  </li>
      <li>(well, high end for me is $60-$100</li>
      <li>I just spend a little more $$ and ordered my Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanille Coco.</li>
      <li>but anyways....to me, it just smells kind of bad...at least to wear on your body....</li>
      <li>I spray soo many times because I know personally how long the stuff lasts...</li>
      <li>It smells very dry, not that I like sweet fragrances.  </li>
      <li>The full-strength scent arrived in a matter days carefully packaged with a handwritten note full of Aloha thanking me for my purchase.</li>
      <li>As far as style goes...</li>
      <li>I might give it to my 19 year old sister who lives with my mom.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my 10 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>and it is still half full...</li>
      <li>the price is a major selling point in my book!</li>
      <li>First the perfume arrived alot sooner than expected!!</li>
      <li>they was litterally only half an inch inside the large bottle...</li>
      <li>I am afraid to tell everyone how much I love this perfume because I do not want anyone else to wear it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The seller was super fast and packaged good.  The smell really isnt what i was looking for but it is as described...Im looking for a specific scent and this isnt it. Not the sellers fault. It does smell good just not what im looking for.</li>
    <li> I have received numerous compliments when wearing this perfume.  It smells like the beach (coconut) mixed with a subtle vanilla scent.  So many scents can be offensive or overpowering.  This is definitely not.  I love it.  I wish it lasted a bit longer on me, hence 4 stars instead of 5.  It seems gone after a couple hours, so I respray a lot.  But at such an affordable price, it&#x27;s ok.  And like I said, the scent is uplifting and heavenly.  Also, the ingredients are all ok...not harmful to the body.  This is VERY important to me.  Will I reorder?  Probably, but I&#x27;ll keep looking for one that lasts longer.  Lastly, the shippers were quick in sending this product (3-4 days), and even included a sweet hand-written note!  The bottle is attractive as is the packaging!  This is a good buy!</li>
    <li> It literally smells exactly like a car air freshener. It&#x27;s awful!!!!!</li>
    <li> I feel REALLY bad leaving this review but I feel like I have to considering my personal opinion and that no one else left any negative reviews. First of all. I mean ~ for some people...perfume is perfume. It could be $1 from the dollar store and if it smells to them and thats all that matters. Some perfumes cost more...at the price of maybe $6-$12...and actually now that I&#x27;m thinking about it...I guess this product is priced SOMEWHAT accordingly...for a low end perfume and the size of the bottle (which to me feels like a small/medium size...) but anyways....to me, it just smells kind of bad...at least to wear on your body....It smells like its possibly a car fragrance or for the bathroom. I sprayed it once on me the day I got it...and have not squirted any on me since. I might give it to my 19 year old sister who lives with my mom. They would probably like it because they are not too picky with perfumes...for instance my sister likes the britney spears perfumes...this one would be similar quality wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also REALLY picky with purses. As far as style goes...I mean...you could pay $400 for an UGLY purse....! Whereas someone else could pick up a considerably cute one for $28 dollars...so It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m coming from a wealthy standpoint...AT ALL &#x3D;) Im actually a very thrifty person, but if I LOVE something...I gotta have it...(which Is why I dont go shopping these days, lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would personally recommend this perfume:&lt;br /&gt;Bath &amp; Body Works Exotic Coconut Pleasures Collection Splash 8 fl oz Its under $20 and smells like an exotic tropical heaven...my mom got it at bath and body works and once I smelled it...I stole the bottle, lol....HOWEVER...they was litterally only half an inch inside the large bottle...I took it so I would remember to buy more and share with my mom as well. They have a pool so I&#x27;ll keep it at their house and spritz some on top of my body oil when I tan &#x3D;) Its a quality fragrance and does not smell cheap in ANY way.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfume I got at Sephora that is delicious and coconutty is: *runs to my bedroom to get the brand* is called \\&quot;LAVANILLA Laboraories\\&quot; the scen is Vanilla Coconut... imagine eating he creamiet tastiest french vanilla ice cream...the best flavor in your mouth and on your tongue....mmm the taste...well this stuff is so good you just taste it...and then theres the hint of coconut. I think for 1.7 FL OZ bottle I paid something around $40 but it has lasted me about 2 years and it is still half full...and whenever I spray perfume...I spray soo many times because I know personally how long the stuff lasts...haha...I own about 40 high end fragrances (well, high end for me is $60-$100, I know they have some that are around $150+, crazy!) and I&#x27;ve never ran out of a bottle of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I hope you enjoyed my review! Best of luck to you. For me perfume makes me feel happy and wonderful about myself. Even on a bad bad day...if I spritz some perfume...ahh I feel glorious! &#x3D;) XO</li>
    <li> Im a coconut lover an this smells amazing. Just like vanilla and coconut. And its a big bottle so an awesome price for the amount you get. :) will be buying again!! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> First the perfume arrived alot sooner than expected!! And was packed securely with a nice hand written note to me thanking me for my purchase. I love the smell. true coconut with a hint of vanilla.  I am coconut obsessed and when I find things that are worthy I rave about them. If you truly love the essence of coconuts get this fragrance!</li>
    <li> When I lived in Hawaii, I used to purchase the &amp;#34;Wicked Wahine&amp;#34; fragrance by the same company and always loved it.  That one is a musky, tropical floral.  As I also love coconut, I decided to blind purchase this to remind me of my island days.  I am always looking for my holy grail coconut fragrance and thus had high hopes for this.  Unfortunately, I was not fond of it at all.  The fragrance lacks depth and lasts all of 30 seconds.  It smells very dry, not that I like sweet fragrances.  But I&#x27;d say that this is missing a little &amp;#34;somethin&#x27; somethin&#x27;&amp;#34; to take it from zero to hero.  It smells like a coconut scratch and sniff sticker to me.  Shipping was fast and item arrived well packaged.  Just did not care for the scent.</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance. Will most definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Not the scent I was hoping for at all. It&#x27;s *very* strong. I didn&#x27;t get a coconut or vanilla smell, just an almond cherry scent. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just not what a grown woman would or should be wearing. I gave it to my 10 year old daughter.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume ....now, but the first couple days I used it, it had a very strong overriding smell to it - it wasn&#x27;t bad, just not coconutty or vanilla, maybe some type of flower. Since it wasn&#x27;t a bad smell, I decided to keep using it. After a few days the strong overriding smell was gone and it was exactly what I was looking for - coconutty and beachy. I constantly get compliments on it. It does seem to fade pretty quickly, although people still notice it in the afternoon so maybe I just get used to the smell. I&#x27;m definitely ordering it again! For those who are put off by the smell the first time you use it, I would say try it for a few days!</li>
    <li> Absolutely DIVINE! The scent is exactly as described! Ahhh it reminds me of growing up in the islands! I love it. And my package arrived quickly in perfect condition with a handwritten note as well! I felt so welcome! I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the smell of coconut and it reminds me of the tropical islands. The company was fast for delivery, awesome with communication and the product was everything I hoped for.....</li>
    <li> I thought this would smell better but pink sugar smells much better will not order again will not order again</li>
    <li> I am afraid to tell everyone how much I love this perfume because I do not want anyone else to wear it! I want to be the only one! I found it in Maui years ago and I get so many compliments on it. I just received a compliment today! Plus it really reminds me of the beach. I have bought over 30 bottles in the last couple of years for myself and for gifts. If you wear it every day the bottle lasts 3 - 4 months. The seller Island Bath &amp; Body has excellent service. I received my order within 4 days and a hand written note from the owner. Very Customer Service friendy. To save costs on shipping go in with some freinds to buy bulk. This is a must have in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but it&#x27;s still not as nice as the Lavanilia Coconut I purchase at $58, so the price is a major selling point in my book!</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy with this purchase! :)  It is in no way a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; smelling perfume, it is a true coconut scent with a warm vanilla overlay.  I absolutely love it, and it is the perfect size.</li>
    <li> Was so sad when I ran out of the scent I had purchased on the island of Maui. Found it on Amazon.com and ordered for myself. Very happy when I received the perfume as described. Even better than the cologne. Will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I could not keep this perfume. My daughter just had to have it. She used to live in Hawaii and it brought back so many memories for her.she loved it.</li>
    <li> Great price, quick shipping and delivery, and it smells terrific.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because i thought the combination would smell nice. Its just awful. worst than  a car scent. Don&#x27;t waste your $$ on this. I just spend a little more $$ and ordered my Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanille Coco. that scent is just heaven.</li>
    <li> The scent is definitely coconutty :) But the sprayer on the bottle quit working after just 2 pumps and now it squirts out instead of misting. The scent does not last more than an hour. I will use it for sure but probably would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this scent while on vacation in Oahu in 2010 and have never found anything like it on the mainland. I decided to order it online and was not disappointed. The full-strength scent arrived in a matter days carefully packaged with a handwritten note full of Aloha thanking me for my purchase. Will definitely purchase again. Mahalo!</li>
