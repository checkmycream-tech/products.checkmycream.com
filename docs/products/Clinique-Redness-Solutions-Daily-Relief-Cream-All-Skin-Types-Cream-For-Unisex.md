      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>Still love it</li>
      <li>case it decides to do more.</li>
      <li>just try it, you would love it.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many many products for rosacea but this is what I&#x27;m going with now</li>
      <li>and she thought it might be better for the summer.</li>
      <li>It is a good moisturizer but for redness, not so hot.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to help with redness.</li>
      <li>(the argan oil is important too)</li>
      <li>but we can&#x27;t have it all, right!</li>
      <li>It is an OK moisturizer, but I have used better ones from Clinique, such as Moisture Surge.</li>
      <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and almost anything, including many moisturizers, can cause it to redden and burn.</li>
      <li>I am 55+ with thinning skin that is more sensitive to irritation and it used to be.</li>
      <li>It made a noticeable difference right away, but never went beyond that.  </li>
      <li>I have high blood pressure and my face has redlines it helps smooth that.</li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>and this product has really helped me!  </li>
      <li>It says no fragrance, but I&#x27;m pretty certain there are a lot of masking fragrances going on here.</li>
      <li>This is the first product I have found that really gets rid of them.  </li>
      <li>However the texture of my skin is amazing, and it helps keep irritation down.</li>
      <li>they are super soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll be enough for winter, but it&#x27;s great in D.C.&#x27;s hot humid summers.</li>
      <li>I tried &amp;#34;even better&amp;#34; from Clinique and thought it was helping a bit, but when I switched to this my skin really healed up.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>My cheeks were more rough and with this combo</li>
      <li>I also love the fresh, herbal fragrance -- not the heavy floral of so many other brands.</li>
      <li>The cream does what is suppose to do; of course, with realistic expectations in mind.</li>
      <li>The whole Redness Solutions line keeps me looking young.</li>
      <li>If you have dry skin or eczema, or any kind of sensitivity to fragrance, be careful.</li>
      <li>I found this inferior to other products available.</li>
      <li>but it did nothing to my very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A moisturizer I can use (for overly sensitive, dermatitis-prone skin)!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re one of those people who&#x27;s constantly scanning ingredient labels to make sure skin care products don&#x27;t have any alcohol, retinol, acids or sunscreens (other than zinc oxide or titanium dioxide) in them, give this moisturizer a try.</li>
      <li>I used it for old acne scars and they faded a bit.</li>
      <li>but I know after 10 years of trying different things that this really works.  </li>
      <li>It seems like it took about 3 months to completely work</li>
      <li>(I use the foundation too but mix it 1/2 and 1/2 with the yellow lotion because it&#x27;s a bit too thick for me and now I don&#x27;t need as much coverage because my skin is so much better.</li>
      <li>(I love the Clinique green tinted primer w SPF 15 to cover major red areas).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not irritate at all.  I have been using it for quite some time.</li>
    <li> I have type 1 and type 2 rosacea on my cheeks, chin, and nose- and this product has really helped me!  I tried &amp;#34;even better&amp;#34; from Clinique and thought it was helping a bit, but when I switched to this my skin really healed up.  It seems like it took about 3 months to completely work but I know after 10 years of trying different things that this really works.  (I use the foundation too but mix it 1/2 and 1/2 with the yellow lotion because it&#x27;s a bit too thick for me and now I don&#x27;t need as much coverage because my skin is so much better. Also- less acne.  This is good stuff.) Wish it was in a pump but we can&#x27;t have it all, right!</li>
    <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t have to go to the Mall during the Christmas rush for my moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice a day from the day I got it and the redness has not changed at all.  The product is not worth the money I paid for it and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It made a noticeable difference right away, but never went beyond that.  I continue to use it daily just in case it decides to do more.</li>
    <li> A moisturizer I can use (for overly sensitive, dermatitis-prone skin)!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It goes on easily and isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to help with redness.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a month. It&#x27;s an ok face lotion but it did nothing to my very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;No results + expensive product&#x3D; do not buy!</li>
    <li> I am a physician myself, this product is amazing ! just try it, you would love it. My rosacea has improved a lot</li>
    <li> solved my rosatia along with their wash. this is a wonder product!!!</li>
    <li> In addition to rosacea I have very sensitive skin and almost anything, including many moisturizers, can cause it to redden and burn. I had been using Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar for Dry Skin (not the regular formula) for several years because it never bothered my skin. Last week at Nordstrom&#x27;s the saleswoman suggested I try this Clinique product because it doesn&#x27;t have the oil that the Philosophy product does and she thought it might be better for the summer. I said if it doesn&#x27;t have any oil how is it going to moisturize, and she said it had other humectants in it. Okay. I was doubtful but gave it a try and am very pleased. It moisturizes without creating a lot of shine and my skin doesn&#x27;t react to it. It actually does feel as though it&#x27;s \\&quot;calming\\&quot; my face a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had rosacea for 30 years and my standards are different from the other reviewers. No matter what it claims, I don&#x27;t expect anything other than laser treatments or IPL to actually reduce my rosacea. I&#x27;m thrilled to find products that don&#x27;t exacerbate it. I can reduce (hide) the appearance of the redness with green- or yellow-based tints and powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re one of those people who&#x27;s constantly scanning ingredient labels to make sure skin care products don&#x27;t have any alcohol, retinol, acids or sunscreens (other than zinc oxide or titanium dioxide) in them, give this moisturizer a try. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll be enough for winter, but it&#x27;s great in D.C.&#x27;s hot humid summers.</li>
    <li> This has always been an awesome cream for any kind of face redness I&#x27;ve experienced.  Still love it...works great.</li>
    <li> Good for combating roseacea. Makes my skin glow, while soothing and calming my tone. I use it daily as part of my skincare routine. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> It was everything I get from Macy&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t have to fight the traffic. I have high blood pressure and my face has redlines it helps smooth that.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for weeks now. I don&#x27;t see any improvement on my redness whatsoever. Actually I see my skin breaking out where I put the cream. I&#x27;m very disappointed since I use predominantly Clinique products.</li>
    <li> Great product-- really helps with rosacea redness and sensitivity. Works well alone or under makeup</li>
    <li> working outside in all types of weather my face turns red as a tomato. tried this clinique.it cools your skin a little but seen no improvement with the redness. just have to try and stay inside out of the weather i guess.</li>
    <li> The whole Redness Solutions line keeps me looking young. I use the facial wash, daily relief cream, sunscreen and foundation daily. I am 55+ with thinning skin that is more sensitive to irritation and it used to be. These products are soothing and effective at keeping redness at bay. If I skip one day and use another brand, I notice an immediate difference. I also love the fresh, herbal fragrance -- not the heavy floral of so many other brands.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I find it to be calming and dilutes the redness associated with cold weather, dryness, and minor topical issues. It does not improve the rosacea I suffer from. It does help with my breakouts though. It&#x27;s difficult to find a face cream that doesn&#x27;t burn or cause breakouts and this does neither of the two.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my rosacea-related redness.  It is an OK moisturizer, but I have used better ones from Clinique, such as Moisture Surge.</li>
    <li> Use it every morning!</li>
    <li> I am 60 so I get some really dry red spots on my face.  This is the first product I have found that really gets rid of them.  I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very red cheeks  . I found that this product is very good and keeps the redness under control.&lt;br /&gt;I tried other products but they did not work for me.</li>
    <li> The cream does what is suppose to do; of course, with realistic expectations in mind. It will diminish redness or red spots with time. I used it for old acne scars and they faded a bit. I have not used any other product for that, so I am assuming it was not my regular moisturizer that I use now. Now my boyfriend uses my tube, because he would get rosecea outbreaks once in a while and this cream is actually recommended for that. Just the idea that it is a non-irritant and neutral is already comforting to him, and is enough for us to keep buying.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I use it during the day under city block and at night with a few drops of argan oil. A topical product will not actually reduce rosacea related redness, those capillaries are there, only a laser will remove those, or green makeup hide them (I love the Clinique green tinted primer w SPF 15 to cover major red areas). However the texture of my skin is amazing, and it helps keep irritation down. My cheeks were more rough and with this combo (the argan oil is important too) they are super soft. I&#x27;ve used many many products for rosacea but this is what I&#x27;m going with now and it works. [[ASIN:B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml)]]</li>
    <li> I found this inferior to other products available. Did not seem to affect my redness at all. It is a good moisturizer but for redness, not so hot.</li>
    <li> Really works! For my skin at least</li>
    <li> I was told by the lady at the Clinique counter at Macy&#x27;s that this would solve all my dry skin problems. Nope. Made everything worse. I tried using it for several days and by the third day I was peeling and flaking all over my face. I&#x27;m still recovering a week later. If you have dry skin or eczema, or any kind of sensitivity to fragrance, be careful. It says no fragrance, but I&#x27;m pretty certain there are a lot of masking fragrances going on here.</li>
    <li> No sign that I use it. I have some redness, not much, and this cream didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> Product arrived when expected. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have rosacia and i will say it does help a bit with the redness.  I like the feel of it and it&#x27;s not oily or really thick.</li>
