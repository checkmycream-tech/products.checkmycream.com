### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best antiperspirant I have found.</li>
      <li>I was very happy with this  order because it is a good brand,</li>
      <li>and I smell great.</li>
      <li>Great price and delivery</li>
      <li>The product is OK but not everything on the internet is the best price.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, does not interfere with perfume/body lotion.</li>
      <li>that I know, it was a good price</li>
      <li>This is a good price and a good product</li>
      <li>If I were you, do not get these earbuds and buy a good brand at the store</li>
      <li>SURE!</li>
      <li>Nice spray.</li>
      <li>I liked the SURE</li>
      <li>At first the earbuds were great, they gave every thing that I wanted them to do  except the mic didnt work.</li>
      <li>Sure I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
      <li>deodorants\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using Sure for almost 20 years.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t anything like the Sure deodorant you can buy in Britain, as a heads-up for any ex-pats that want this.</li>
      <li>Sure is considered a \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; deodorant.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product, but maybe your experience will be better.</li>
      <li>Now I have to buy some more SURE.</li>
      <li>Smells more like a product for women.</li>
      <li>Target stopped selling the SURE aerosol deodorant, so I was trying to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Sure at Walmart, I looked for it on the WEB.  </li>
      <li>I was in the airport and all the airline officials wanted my SURE.</li>
      <li>so I spray some more.</li>
      <li>They look fine until Ive washed my clothes</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, some \\&quot;genius&#x27; at Sure thought all their customers would love a pretty purple lid and redesigned can.</li>
      <li>this works just fine</li>
      <li>When I first read these reviews I was very excited to try it out.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best deodorant, which I have been using for years - it&#x27;s new packaging...</li>
      <li>As a guy with a very low tolerance for the strong \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; of most \\&quot;men&#x27;s</li>
      <li>It was also soooo convenient to order it at home and have it delivered right to my door.</li>
      <li>It either sells out right away</li>
      <li>Price was right.  </li>
      <li>The smell is a bit strong, which is why Im only giving it three stars---the scent reminds me of the &#x27;80s.</li>
      <li>but I was really hoping this would help, and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>One of the wonders of the internet, that I can find this when it&#x27;s no longer available from local stores.</li>
      <li>They are very active in sports and work, I DESPERATELY NEEDED SOMETHING FOR FOOT ODOR, I used so many powders and this works perfectly!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve met a whole new crowd at the gym after pulling this girly new can out of my bag in the locker room.</li>
      <li>There were rumors they would not make this anymore, so the new packaging is a delight to see.  </li>
      <li>Not as effective as regular stick deodorant, if you&#x27;re arthritic and  have trouble raising your arms</li>
      <li>Stupid redesign aside, luckly the deodorant inside is still the same great, low \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; highly effective</li>
      <li>happy!The smell is much stronger even though it says regular scent.</li>
      <li>or they have an over-stock of the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; version which (oddly) has a much stronger scent than the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; scent version.</li>
      <li>The first few times i was pleased,but now it came in a different can,and i am not</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice spray. I prefer it over roll-on.</li>
    <li> When I could no longer purchase Sure at Walmart, I looked for it on the WEB.  I purchased several cans at a little over $6.00 per can after shipping and tax.  I later checked the price at the local Krogers store and it cost $3.49 a can.  The product is OK but not everything on the internet is the best price.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as regular stick deodorant, if you&#x27;re arthritic and  have trouble raising your arms this works just fine</li>
    <li> I intended to order the unscented variety, but was in a rush and didn&#x27;t pay enough attention and ordered the regular scent. The problem here is, my wife is allergic to fragrances, so I can&#x27;t use this without giving her an actual migraine.</li>
    <li> I bought five of these for the 3 men in my life. They are very active in sports and work, I DESPERATELY NEEDED SOMETHING FOR FOOT ODOR, I used so many powders and this works perfectly! NO MORE SMELLY FEET!! it&#x27;s less expensive then anything I ever purchased but it works wonders for their feet 😆</li>
    <li> Target stopped selling the SURE aerosol deodorant, so I was trying to find it on Amazon.  I liked the SURE I was buying before, because it was relatively odorless and I think the aerosol is just let messy, doesn&#x27;t end up getting on your clothes like sticks do sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this one is advertised as unisex, but I&#x27;m not sure I buy that.  It smells different than the one I used to buy in the men&#x27;s dept. at Target.  Smells more like a product for women.</li>
    <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate skin.</li>
    <li> When I first read these reviews I was very excited to try it out. Once I got it I tried it out immediately and I hated it. The smell is really unpleasant. I first tried it out in a black shirt, later on in the day I realized white stains on my shirt and armpit area, it was so hard to get off. Also the product didn&#x27;t help at all, I was sweating all day, badly. I have a tendency to sweat a lot but I was really hoping this would help, and it didn&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product, but maybe your experience will be better.</li>
    <li> KEEPS YOU DRY OF EVEN THEHOTTEST DAYS</li>
    <li> Spray nozzle broke on two after it arrived.</li>
    <li> At first the earbuds were great, they gave every thing that I wanted them to do  except the mic didnt work. I didnt care about that because I wasnt using it. What bothered me was after 2 weeks of receiving the earbuds, they stopped workin g completly. If I were you, do not get these earbuds and buy a good brand at the store</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best deodorant, which I have been using for years - it&#x27;s new packaging... There were rumors they would not make this anymore, so the new packaging is a delight to see.  It&#x27;s harder to find in stores, these days so I buy in bulk for months to rely on it...  This is a good price and a good product</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this  order because it is a good brand, that I know, it was a good price and it was shipped on time. It was also soooo convenient to order it at home and have it delivered right to my door.</li>
    <li> Great price and delivery</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> As someone who doesn&#x27;t like underarm odors, this is the only product that I have found after 25 years of searching that works.</li>
    <li> I wake up and I am stinky. Then I spray this one and I smell great. After 24 hours it wears off so I spray some more. If you still smell bad just keep spraying, it will eventually work. I was in the airport and all the airline officials wanted my SURE. They took it right out of my bad, said it could be a bomb. Now I have to buy some more SURE.</li>
    <li> Keep me dry for all day long.</li>
    <li> Sure is considered a \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; deodorant. As a guy with a very low tolerance for the strong \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; of most \\&quot;men&#x27;s deodorants\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using Sure for almost 20 years. It&#x27;s one of the hardest items to find consistently at local stores. It either sells out right away or they have an over-stock of the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; version which (oddly) has a much stronger scent than the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; scent version. So finding these on Amazon is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, some \\&quot;genius&#x27; at Sure thought all their customers would love a pretty purple lid and redesigned can. I have to say - THANK YOU SURE! I&#x27;ve met a whole new crowd at the gym after pulling this girly new can out of my bag in the locker room. Stupid redesign aside, luckly the deodorant inside is still the same great, low \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; highly effective Sure I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant/antiperspirant for years. One of the wonders of the internet, that I can find this when it&#x27;s no longer available from local stores. It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, does not interfere with perfume/body lotion.</li>
    <li> After years of fighting with invisible deodorant Ive given up.  Ive reached a point where I cant get it out of my clothing.  They look fine until Ive washed my clothes but then there is this thick, white residue on the arpits of all of my clothing.  I hoped this would be different and it is.  I spray it on after I get out of the shower. It needs to be dry when you get dressed or you will end up with residue on your clothing.  The smell is a bit strong, which is why Im only giving it three stars---the scent reminds me of the &#x27;80s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Price was right.  Delivered on time</li>
    <li> Best antiperspirant I have found. Husband works construction but I don&#x27;t need to worry him coming home with odors.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t anything like the Sure deodorant you can buy in Britain, as a heads-up for any ex-pats that want this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this before and it was to my liking then.The first few times i was pleased,but now it came in a different can,and i am not happy!The smell is much stronger even though it says regular scent.I would like to know what&#x27;s going on.I am going to have to contact the manufacturer or company to see why it has now changed into an unattractive can and why does it now smell stronger.</li>
