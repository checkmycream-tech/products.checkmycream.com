      <li>It was recommend by many people but just not for me</li>
      <li>100% satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love how this makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>the brush is definitely the awesome part of this product.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; feel like fine sand and if you rub it into your skin with circular motions you&#x27;re basically giving yourself microdermabrasion.  </li>
      <li>The brush makes my face feel so clean.</li>
      <li>I use this wash when my skin is relatively clean, because it can be somewhat harsh/painful feeling on pimples when I&#x27;m breaking out.</li>
      <li>he said Overall its a good product.</li>
      <li>My skin felt smooth, soft, and clean.  </li>
      <li>First time buying this product and it AMAZED me.</li>
      <li>If you have open sores on your face LET THEM HEAL FIRST!!!</li>
      <li>but everytime I wash my face with this, my face is literally soooo soft and it feels clean.</li>
      <li>My skin is combination but more on the dry side</li>
      <li>The very first time i used it, it immediately made my skin so soft and it removed the blackheads that were on my nose</li>
      <li>It really foams &amp; lathers.  </li>
      <li>Guess nothing can really take oil away.</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t really use it at all, but by me asking my boyfriend</li>
      <li>I really expected more from this product.</li>
      <li>I am 57 years old,so I absolutely use a moisturizer afterward.</li>
      <li>, it was fast shipping</li>
      <li>my skin looks better than when I pay $60-90 for a professional facial.</li>
      <li>I plan on going back for more and giving my Mom one, who is a big Garnier skincare fan.</li>
      <li>This really helps keep my face clear!</li>
      <li>This product really gives you a deep down clean feel and love the rubber brush head, left my skin feeling really refreshed and soft.</li>
      <li>but my curious boyfriend thought the wash was looked cool and wanted it and took it from me.</li>
      <li>The brush attachment is pretty lame, but the product, Garnier exfoliating cleanser, does a nice job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve definitely noticed clearer skin and less breakouts! :)</li>
      <li>I bought the light green bottle as well, but only opened this one thus far.</li>

<li> The brush bristles are long, flexible, and rubbery.  </li>
<li> The brush hurt my skin, not soft at all.</li>
<li> and it also took off my scaly dry skin from tanning.</li>
<li> It came sooner then expected.</li>
<li> The brusher is flexible and soft, not hard and when you scrub it against your face it doesn&#x27;t feel hard or irritating.</li>
<li> So far no good for ma skin</li>
<li> I was expecting the brush to be hard and stiff and to aggravate my already sensitive skin.</li>
<li> This product contains microbeads which are destroying our waterways.</li>
<li> and i feel refreshed after using it this morning and a few minutes ago.</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is that when the wash in the bottle starts to get low its very difficult to squeeze it out, and I have to throw it out before it&#x27;s fully empty.</li>
<li> Both products are unbelievable.  </li>
<li> But, I was shocked that it gave my face a really deep down scrubbing</li>
<li> This is such a dangerous product, it should be taken off the shelves immediately.</li>
<li> See the following news report:  [...]</li>
<li> The brush is awkward to apply the cleanser to your face, and I didn&#x27;t care for the texture of either the brush or the cleanser.</li>
<li> I bought this for me because I feel like my face is dirty and greasy.</li>

    <li> This product really gives you a deep down clean feel and love the rubber brush head, left my skin feeling really refreshed and soft.

The only complaint I have is that when the wash in the bottle starts to get low its very difficult to squeeze it out, and I have to throw it out before it&#x27;s fully empty.</li>

    <li> While taking on my latest habit, which is using coupons and saving money.. I realized that I had several $2.00 off Garnier coupons and the packages of these at Target also have a store coupon attached. Target allows both to be used on the same product, so I got this for $.99 instead of $4.99. This is an excellent product. I was expecting the brush to be hard and stiff and to aggravate my already sensitive skin. But, I was shocked that it gave my face a really deep down scrubbing and it also took off my scaly dry skin from tanning. I bought the light green bottle as well, but only opened this one thus far. I plan on going back for more and giving my Mom one, who is a big Garnier skincare fan. Great job Garnier!</li>
    <li> This product worked well for my  acne prone skin. I will be using it in future. Good seller. I still have acne, but noticed that they are smaller and are fading with the use of this product. My skin is combination but more on the dry side</li>
    <li> The brush is awkward to apply the cleanser to your face, and I didn&#x27;t care for the texture of either the brush or the cleanser.</li>

    <li> microbeads pollute the waters do not buy this product.  Fish eat the microbeads and it harms their health.  See the following news report:  [...]</li>
    <li> Awesome face wash! Works as good as the $70 face washes out there! I have combination skin and am prone to breakouts. This really helps keep my face clear!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to get your face wonderfully clean and invigorated.I am 57 years old,so I absolutely use a moisturizer afterward.I recommend this,especially for younger folks who have break out problems.</li>
    <li> The fish eat the tiny beads before you eat the fish.  Let&#x27;s get Garnier to change their abrasives to something organic.</li>
    <li> The brush hurt my skin, not soft at all. Did not even get rid of acne.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my skin feel.  I noticed a difference in my skin after a couple of times of using it.</li>
    <li> This product contains microbeads which are destroying our waterways. This is such a dangerous product, it should be taken off the shelves immediately.</li>
    <li> I bought this for me because I feel like my face is dirty and greasy. but my curious boyfriend thought the wash was looked cool and wanted it and took it from me. so I wouldn&#x27;t really use it at all, but by me asking my boyfriend How the wash is working for him he said Overall its a good product.</li>
    <li> A PRODUCT THAT EASIER CLEANING MY FACE WITH QUALITY AND without hurting her.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using very good results TAKING THIS PRODUCT RECOMMEND TO MEN IN SPITE OF BEING A PRODUCT OF WOMEN</li>
    <li> i loved it :) works very good and cleans the very smooth. smells amazing as well and its incredible amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Garnier products, but it was on sale for $5 at my local cvs so I gave it a shot.  I love it!!!  It really foams &amp; lathers.  The brush bristles are long, flexible, and rubbery.  It massages your face and feels nice. But if you want to exfoliate use your fingers!  The \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; feel like fine sand and if you rub it into your skin with circular motions you&#x27;re basically giving yourself microdermabrasion.  My skin felt smooth, soft, and clean.  I followed the face wash with a product I also hadn&#x27;t tried before: Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque ($5 at Walgreens). It claims to shrink enlarged pores and it delivered! Noticeable results after only one use.  Both products are unbelievable.  For only $10 my skin looks better than when I pay $60-90 for a professional facial.</li>
    <li> So, i&#x27;m 16 and I stuck to my routine morning burst and exfoliating brush but then for this price I was like, i&#x27;ll try it, so I did and my face was instantly visibly smoother and cleaner!! I just received it in the mail today, it was fast shipping and i feel refreshed after using it this morning and a few minutes ago. If you have open sores on your face LET THEM HEAL FIRST!!! Then use this stuff. :) Try using Aveeno as a moisturizer and drink LOTS of water and your problem is solved :) I will put up before and after pics in two weeks so you can see the progress :D!</li>
    <li> Love this product! The brush makes my face feel so clean. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed clearer skin and less breakouts! :)</li>
    <li> I got this stuff for my girl friend and she loves it she has told every one she knows about this stuff</li>
    <li> Still trying it out... So far no good for ma skin I really expected more from this product. It was recommend by many people but just not for me</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, especially having the scrubby connected is great! I don&#x27;t understand why Garnier stopped selling it because I love it!</li>
    <li> I have senstive skin so I was worried trying this product on me but everytime I wash my face with this, my face is literally soooo soft and it feels clean. The brusher is flexible and soft, not hard and when you scrub it against your face it doesn&#x27;t feel hard or irritating.</li>
    <li> My gf says that after using the product there is no oil. But about an hour later, the oil is back. Guess nothing can really take oil away.</li>
    <li> First time buying this product and it AMAZED me. The very first time i used it, it immediately made my skin so soft and it removed the blackheads that were on my nose and now I do not have any blackheads. 100% satisfied. It came sooner then expected.</li>
    <li> great product wish they would not have discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I can&#x27;t figure out why the stores stopped carrying it! The brush is amazing and you can see all your make up being removed and cleaned off your face!</li>
    <li> The brush attachment is pretty lame, but the product, Garnier exfoliating cleanser, does a nice job.</li>
