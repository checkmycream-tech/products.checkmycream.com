    <li> Wife loves the smell!!!!</li>
    <li> Fresh and clean scent!  Fast delivery! Very happy! Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and citrusy...wish Bath and Body would go pirime</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for a dear one, who loves this scent. Item came as described, on time, and packaged with care. A very soft and clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> This smells absolutely AMAZING! It&#x27;s a very light refreshing scent that&#x27;s perfect for summertime.  The bottle is huge and will last forever!  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments since I started wearing this.  It seems to last a long time so you don&#x27;t need to reapply throughout that day.  I will definitely re-order when I run out</li>
    <li> This is something that I&#x27;ve wanted for a while.  I found it, it was ordered and I got it quickly.</li>
    <li> My friend was wearing this, I just had to get it fir myself.  She smelled so fresh &amp; clean.  I HATE perfumes, why can&#x27;t they take a smell of soap, or shampoo instead of what they put out.  Yuck.  This has a very light citrus smell, very light.  I spay it as you should, walk into the mist, never spray it on myself.</li>
    <li> Wonderful item. It was delivered promptly, no issues and smells great.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition.  Love the scent.  Have the hand soap and because of the scent, decided to have this&lt;br /&gt;nice fragrance around to wear when the mood strikes.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the spray - it never made it.  Took a while to get a refund.</li>
    <li> thought it would be more lemony and fresh. Put it up and ordered L&#x27;Occitanr&#x27;s Verbena L&#x27;eau de Toilette instead...Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  Very happy</li>
    <li> Clean and fresh scent.  This seems to be the same stuff I got a couple of years ago, only the bottle is different.  I keep this in my bathroom and use it often after i wash my hands so they don&#x27;t smell like soap.  It is very light - I spray it on my hand and then pat them together (sounds weird, but it transfers just a little scent that way, not strong like a cologne).  Great price too!</li>
    <li> I love this! It smells so fresh and happoness, I always get compliments when I wear this! This is size is great for body use, I have already used one year and still leave some</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize she could have the spray as well.  Took the spray and the whole set back to college with her.</li>
    <li> love the fragrant. Reminds me of when I first met my wife. Getting harder to find in the mall for that price</li>
    <li> This product was literally exactly what  asked for. money well spent. the packaging was amazingly sealed to the point where I had to go buy new scissors, overall I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume! It smells so delightful, I wear it often. It also came TO MY DOOR! I will absolutely order again.</li>
    <li> If you want a fragrance for a summer night, this is the perfect scent.  It is light, but nice and was a great deal for the price.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> WORN FOR YEARS STILL A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> It is fantastic stuff and is light with just right amount of sweetness...not too much or overwhelming and mixes well with the White Citrus body butter ! very pleased !</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and needed.  I loved Dove&#x27;s body mist in citrus but they discontinued it.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a substitute ever since and this fills the bill perfectly!  The scent is not too heavy and not too light – perfect for when you need just a little something or need a break from you regular perfume.  I will be ordering more and I&#x27;m also going to try the bath gel/soap. Tip: because of the light citrus scent this also works well as an emergency air freshener!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent. Clean and fresh. I get many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a great summer scent. Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> The best mist ever. Very fresh fragrance. I am so in love with it that I am using it twice a day, even though it is unnecessary. I am not sure if there are any sweet accent at all, - nothing for me, what makes it even better. It is very good for summer season but I love it so much, that I am going to use it any time of the year. Aroma reminds me early spring time, when the snow is still outside but sun already started melting it. It brings me good memories of my country.</li>
