<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best color ever, and it doesn&#x27;t cake up on your lips.</li>
    <li> Please never discontinue this color! Everything I seem to like has been discontinued. I&#x27;m starting to get a complex about my taste in things.</li>
    <li> Love this! Wear every day regardless of color of wardrobe. Goes with everything.</li>
    <li> Your lips but better. Perfect color especially if you&#x27;re sporting a tan... Gorgeous rose / wood with a slight opalescent sheen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this color for as long as I can remember. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colour Riche Lipcolour in Mica for at least 15 years.  I am scared witless that they might discontinue it some day.  Not only does the lipstick keep my lips very soft and moist but the color is perfect for me as I am an ivory skinned natural blond.  Many times I have been approached by strangers to tell me how much they like my lipstick and wanting to know what kind/color it is.  Some years ago I was told by my boss that I had \\&quot;the most lucious lips\\&quot; he&#x27;d ever seen (but that&#x27;s a whole different story and he had been drinking at a company party at the time - ha ha ha).</li>
    <li> Nice lipstick, good price.  Mica is a little lighter than my usual shade, but looks right for Spring and Summer.  Better prices than local stores, and I can keep a fistful of favs on hand so I&#x27;m in no danger of a naked smoocher.  Now who needs a kiss?</li>
    <li> This color is great for the price, wears as nice as a high end lip color for half the price.</li>
    <li> Been wearing and using this color for over 15 years.  I finally saw that Amazon offers a reoccurring shipment and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about being without.  And the product lasts a long time and moistures your lips.</li>
    <li> Product is as expected.</li>
    <li> My go-to lipstick. It has a beautiful pink color with a hint of lavender, it shimmers but not too much, and is very moisturizing. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve changed it in over a decade. It&#x27;s a beautiful color and I love it, I always have a few tubes around. It tends to work with almost every outfit. I even get compliments on this lipstick. Great if you&#x27;re wearing anything in the purple/pink family.</li>
    <li> Great product and wish I could find it in the store, this is great I found it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for just the right color of lipstick, and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Mica #620 is the perfect shade of pinky-plummy-mauve. And L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s \\&quot;Colour Riche\\&quot; formulation smells nice, feels creamy, and doesn&#x27;t dry out, bleed or crack.</li>
    <li> Good serviceable lipstick, have used it for years. Colors met my expectation on arrival.</li>
    <li> Love L&#x27;Oreal lipstick and I have finally found a lip color that I love.  I wear it with everything, it is complementary to my complexion and feels good!</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal lip colour because of the flavor.  I think it might be the grapeseed oil.  It doesn&#x27;t taste like your mother&#x27;s lipstick. Mica is a perfect color, it seems natural.</li>
    <li> I really like everything about this lipstick - its texture and its color.  It stays on a long time, without feathering.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best color lipstick out there if you don&#x27;t want to wear a dark color.  It looks good on different skin tones, my girlfriends who have blond red and dark hair all look good in this lipstick .. I found this in 1886!!  and then forgot about it in later years and found it here and got so excited, it is just as great as I remembered almost 20 years later.  A nice pick purple brown.  A kind of marbleized color, not too dramatic, just nice.  It really does look good on young and older woman.  ♡♡ Love this color!!</li>
    <li> Lovce my L&#x27;oreal Lipstick. No regrets</li>
    <li> This is the only lipstick I wear, and the only color.  It suits me and I have worn it for several years.  It doesn&#x27;t come off on my teeth. It doesn&#x27;t smear or fade.</li>
    <li> I purchased the color Mica and I love it. The lipstick feels great going on and is very moisturizing. It&#x27;s a reasonable price too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this color for decades. It seems a tiny bit darker than it used to, but I think it fades over time. Great price, great product, and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s reputation for quality remains unchanged.</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer of this lovely, almost silver-mauve neutral lippie. The texture is great, just moist enough, but does not run. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
