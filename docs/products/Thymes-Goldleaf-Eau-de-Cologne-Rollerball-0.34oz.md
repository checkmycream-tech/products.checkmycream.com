    <li> excellant condition and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Came today and the glass container was broken and liquid was gone.  It was well packed, but felt like the glass froze.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a delicate scent.  Perfect for a summer&#x27;s day or evening.  I could recommend this as a wonderful gift for a woman young or older.  It&#x27;s timeless.</li>
    <li> I love the Goldleaf aroma.  However, I am finding the rollerball doesn&#x27;t work well.  Next time, I&#x27;ll get it in another format.</li>
    <li> Excellent to carry in purse. Would definitely recommend for all ages. Clean smell like you just got out of shower.</li>
    <li> I could smell it before I opened the package. The smell was great but the bottle was half empty. It leaked out before it got to me.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this scent reminded me of something my grandmother wears. Too heavy and too common a scent.</li>
    <li> Perfect fragrance for me. Wear everyday</li>
    <li> I was leary about shopping on line and my daughter said just give it a try.  I&#x27;m very&lt;br /&gt;satisfied.  Will purchase more items on line in the future.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like the lotion... instead kinda cheap and stinky.  VERY disappointed.  I bought this based on the scent of the lotion on skin.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I use the body lotion but saw this rollerball advertised in BHG and then found that YOU had it.  It&#x27;s perfect for traveling!  Thanks...I&#x27;ll be ordering more......Loie</li>
    <li> I have been in love with this scent for 15 years since I discovered it at a resort gift shop. So glad I can now get Goldleaf and Hydrangea on Amazon, this little bottle will last a LONG time. It&#x27;s a flowery/musky scent. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Most women at some point in their lives select a signature scent that becomes their personal fragrance.  I chose this because it reminds me of good times in childhood.  It is sweet, but not cloying.  It is subtle and not overpowering.  It is an elegant, yet affordable perfume.</li>
    <li> I read the description of this parfum, the reviews, and I was excited to receive it.  It was shipped incredibly quickly (thumbs up for that!) but the scent was not even close to what I imagined.  I love jasmine, rose and a bit of musk but I cannot detect the jasmine or rose, I just smell the musk and maybe the oak.  The scent is strong and it reminds me of something my mom or grandmother would wear (68 and 90).  It doesn&#x27;t smell BAD, it just isn&#x27;t a scent that smells young and it had waaaaaay too much musk for me.  You might like it, but I am not a fan.  I tried to return it but Amazon won&#x27;t let me (evidently it is a hazardous or flammable liquid…how did they send it to me then??).  I&#x27;ve sent a query to see if there is another route to return or get my money back.  I will update if I can.  Right now I&#x27;m not happy that I spent money on this that I can&#x27;t get back.  Sad, old smelling, lady right now.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and soft woody scent</li>
    <li> It was a gift.. She loves it.It is very hard to find in our town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she was surprised that I found a source for her favorite  perfume.</li>
    <li> Lasting beautiful fragrance which just smells fresh and clean.  Doesn&#x27;t leak.  Have had it in my purse for over a year; doesn&#x27;t evaporate or &amp;#34;turn&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is so elegant!  You will love it.  If you like soft elegant not floral fragrance this one is for you.</li>
    <li> Have used this fragrance for years. This is the only one that I ever use.</li>
    <li> love the scent and it is packaged well for traveling!</li>
    <li> Dreadful - I wish the Thymes hadn&#x27;t changed its packaging for this.  I received this with a quarter of the cnotents missing.  I traveled with it - once - and when I took it out of its little protective cardboard tube, it was more than half empty!  Once i returned home, it was basically empty.  So, I basically got one use for my money.  The old smaller bottle made of heavy glass was virtually bullet proof and I never had a problem with one of them in many years of very frequent travel.  Bottom line - don&#x27;t buy this unless you like to waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not the scent I remembered so I was disappointed.</li>
