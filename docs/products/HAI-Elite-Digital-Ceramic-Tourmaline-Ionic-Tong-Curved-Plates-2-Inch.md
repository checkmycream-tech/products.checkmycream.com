      <li>This product is so nice for my new haircut.  </li>
      <li>Still, a very good product and worth the money for my hair not to smell burnt or have horrid dead ends.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly but you have to set the temperature you want every time you turn it on.</li>
      <li>I have super course hair and</li>
      <li>I loved this device and for the money I spent on it</li>
      <li>Nice long cord, fast warm up, and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out like my old one.</li>
      <li>It straightens or makes nice big curls depending on how you use it, very versatile.  </li>
      <li>i use this product in my job i am a hair stylist it gives a lovely flip in long hair nice tuck on sides of short hair</li>
      <li>These are the first hair tongs I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Love it, with the curved plates, it gives your hair a bit of a curl, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I loved this product and would have given it 5 stars until a few days ago.  </li>
      <li>It was worth paying the extra money to get a smooth finish with body.  </li>
      <li>I use it almost daily and love it because at the standard setting of 356 degrees, it does not burn my hair or leave that aweful heat smell on my hair, not to mention my curls look great everyday...  </li>
      <li>I purchased this Tong about a year and a half ago, It was great until recently and now sometimes it heats and sometimes not.</li>
      <li>It gets very frizzy</li>
      <li>, were light enough to hold over my head for extended periods, would recommend to anyone wanting to buy this type of hair tong.</li>
      <li>It is much easier though to curl with the Hai elite Tong than a \\&quot;flat\\&quot; iron (since there is a curve in the iron, you don&#x27;t have to use your wrist as much.)</li>
      <li>and I came out of the salon looking like I had straight hair with a end curl (from very curly hair).    </li>
      <li>so it straightens very well.</li>
      <li>it clasps my hair really well.  </li>
      <li>So much so that it looks like straw to use a straight iron.  </li>
      <li>A great flat iron that gives a little shape to the end of my straightened hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t create actual curls but it helps to create a rounded shape that is just right when straightening your hair.</li>
      <li>It has a digital heat thermometer that allows you to see how hot it is and then adjust it in increments of 5 degrees.</li>
      <li>Buying the same exact thing.  </li>
      <li>but I was willing to spend the money for the only curved plate iron I could find.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m quite surprised</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how gentle this is on my hair or the quality of this product.</li>
      <li>Other than that, once you find the right heat setting for your hair, this works well.</li>
      <li>No other problems.</li>
      <li>but I thought I would give it a try since I really wasn&#x27;t liking my current flat iron.  </li>
      <li>You can completely straighten your hair or curl it, you just need practice with the iron just like a traditional \\&quot;flat\\&quot; iron.</li>
      <li>made very well and extremely durable.  </li>
      <li>The round curling iron would not leave as smooth of a finish as a straight iron does, at least not for my texture of hair.</li>
      <li>The reason i only gave it 4 stars is because if you like to crimp, curl, or straighten your hair so it it is straight all the way down, then you DO NOT want this.</li>
      <li>Does not flat iron my hair or curl as it says</li>

<li> I received my HAI Elite Digital curved plate flat iron and used it the very next day.  </li>
<li> Back to the flat tongs.  </li>
<li> I straight iron with a curve is hard to find in a store if not impossible, at least I couldn&#x27;t find one.  </li>

<li> Expensive, but worth it.  </li>

<li> The extra plastic casing around the plates and heating elements can sometimes make it cumbersome to maneuver, but I have small hands.</li>
<li> Although it&#x27;s a little expensive, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
<li> I still cannot figure out how to keep it from flipping slightly inward at the bottom (due to the curved plates).</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t straighten your hair without a little curl at the end</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
<li> Does take a little getting used to though.</li>
<li> I have very thick hair and usually only need it on 355 degrees.  </li>
<li> and since I have thin hair I hate to have to turn temp up anymore since already at pretty high setting.  </li>
<li> It stopped working in less than 2 months!!</li>
<li> Returned immediately because it was too hard to use.</li>
<li> Curved plate flat irons are almost impossible to find so</li>

    <li> If you are looking for a straightener that will straighten your hair without damage, than this is the straightener for you. It has a digital heat thermometer that allows you to see how hot it is and then adjust it in increments of 5 degrees. I have very thick hair and usually only need it on 355 degrees.  The reason i only gave it 4 stars is because if you like to crimp, curl, or straighten your hair so it it is straight all the way down, then you DO NOT want this. I still cannot figure out how to keep it from flipping slightly inward at the bottom (due to the curved plates). And crimping, curling, any thing besides straightening is impossible with this.   Still, a very good product and worth the money for my hair not to smell burnt or have horrid dead ends.</li>
    <li> This product is so nice for my new haircut.  Was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like it, but this makes the curve just right!</li>
    <li> I have had mine for about 3 years. You can completely straighten your hair or curl it, you just need practice with the iron just like a traditional \\&quot;flat\\&quot; iron. It is much easier though to curl with the Hai elite Tong than a \\&quot;flat\\&quot; iron (since there is a curve in the iron, you don&#x27;t have to use your wrist as much.) Like any salon grade tool, you just need to know how to use it. I would suggest taking your purchase to your hair stylist and asking them to do a demo.</li>
    <li> These are the first hair tongs I have ever used.  My hairdresser used these on my hair and I came out of the salon looking like I had straight hair with a end curl (from very curly hair).    I bought the tongs attempting to DIY.  The tongs did their bit however me, the user, needs a lot more hours of tonging experience!    Apart from user issues, the tongs worked well, they heated up super-quick, were light enough to hold over my head for extended periods, would recommend to anyone wanting to buy this type of hair tong.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Tong about a year and a half ago, It was great until recently and now sometimes it heats and sometimes not. Or it will heat and turn off with in seconds.   I loved this device and for the money I spent on it I would expect them to work longer then the cheap brands. Of course warranty is only 1 year.  I was not a daily user of the product so I&#x27;m quite surprised it&#x27;s broke.</li>
    <li> I tried this from a friend, before I bought it.  Absolutely love it!!  Best Price I could find, too.</li>
    <li> It is a great flatiron</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. If you have a bob or shoulder length hair and are wanting to straighten and turn under just a bit. Really does a nice job!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive, but worth it.  Nice long cord, fast warm up, and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out like my old one.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this.  my hair never looked so good.  it&#x27;s design is ergonomically correct for my hands.  it clasps my hair really well.  made very well and extremely durable.  I have super course hair and this iron can handle it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in good condition, but it does not work. Tried in multiple outlets. Power button does not turn on. Digital screen never turns on. Waiting on return/exchange.</li>
    <li> I chose to rate this because it is the best hair straightener I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  It straightens or makes nice big curls depending on how you use it, very versatile.  It has a digital temperature control so works for a variety of styles and hair.  I have shorter hair, great for my color enhanced hair and fabulous for my daughters very long rather frizzy hair, transforming it from friz to fabulous!</li>
    <li> Does not flat iron my hair or curl as it says</li>
    <li> Great product, heats up quickly but still cool to the touch.  I love the smooth finish it gives my hair.</li>
    <li> My Hair Dresser uses this on my hair... and with this, I was FINALLY able to do my hair just as good...</li>
    <li> Returned immediately because it was too hard to use. You can&#x27;t straighten your hair without a little curl at the end so it&#x27;s not a versatile straightener. I&#x27;m sticking to the regular HAI straightener.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist was using this on me and it worked so well.  Of course she is much better at it than I am but I thought I would give it a try since I really wasn&#x27;t liking my current flat iron.  I have to say, I love it.  My stylist still might be better but I am getting pretty good myself.  It has curved plates which are nice.  Good product.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received my HAI Elite Digital curved plate flat iron and used it the very next day.  For years, I used a curved plate flat iron by Conair and wore that one out and needed a replacement.  Curved plate flat irons are almost impossible to find so when I came across this one I decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but I was willing to spend the money for the only curved plate iron I could find.  I am very pleased with this product.  The on/off switch and other controls are on the inside of the paddle - excellent design.  This keeps me from accidentally turning off the appliance while using it.  The rubber grips on the bottom help to grip the iron for easy handling.  It heated quickly and did a great job of straightening - plus, with the curvature of the plates, I didn&#x27;t have to use a separate curling iron.  I think I&#x27;ll buy a back-up one so when I wear this one out several years from now, I&#x27;ll have an instant replacement.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> I loved this product and would have given it 5 stars until a few days ago.  I have it for over a year and suddenly the on/off switch stopped working.  It was not dropped or damaged in any way - it just stopped working.  I thought I purchased a good quality product but unfortunately, was wrong and just not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this HAI product over a year ago and it is used every day. I can&#x27;t say enough about how gentle this is on my hair or the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the Curved Tong by HAI.  I had one years ago and when it didn&#x27;t work anymore I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in any of the beauty supply stores.  I decided to check with Amazon and was happy to see they had one.</li>
    <li> The plates do not meet as well as a flat tonged version.  Took to my hairdresser for advice to better use and she could not help me.  Back to the flat tongs.  Save your maney just a gimmick that I fell for.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! It stopped working in less than 2 months!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent curling iron if you like wearing your hair in a bob with a nice curve at the end. Although it&#x27;s a little expensive, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice curved iron.  Heats up quickly but you have to set the temperature you want every time you turn it on. No other problems. It doesn&#x27;t grab your hair at all!</li>
    <li> I have never used a flat iron before.  I bought this because it had curved plates and you could set the temperature.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this item a month ago I absolutely love it. This is the second on i have bought im Amazon</li>
    <li> I am just replacing my 1st Hai Elite after having it for 8+years.  Buying the same exact thing.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Was so excited to get this and debated whether to get it since I already had a fully functioning solia iron.  But was sucked into the shape of this.  When set at same temp as Solia it doesn&#x27;t curl or iron as well and since I have thin hair I hate to have to turn temp up anymore since already at pretty high setting.  It works but nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it...  I was 1st introduced to it via my Stylist and had to have one...  When looking to purchased it retail I found pricing around $160-$189, then went on Amazon and found it for $105...  I use it almost daily and love it because at the standard setting of 356 degrees, it does not burn my hair or leave that aweful heat smell on my hair, not to mention my curls look great everyday...  GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I straight iron with a curve is hard to find in a store if not impossible, at least I couldn&#x27;t find one.  I have used one for about 8 years. My hair is described as thin, but LOTS of it making it thick. It gets very frizzy so it straightens very well. So much so that it looks like straw to use a straight iron.  I LOVE THE CURVE.  It was worth paying the extra money to get a smooth finish with body.  The round curling iron would not leave as smooth of a finish as a straight iron does, at least not for my texture of hair.</li>
    <li> A great flat iron that gives a little shape to the end of my straightened hair. I purchased this iron after my hairdresser started using it on my hair. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom an she lived it came fast and works wonderful heats up fast and the grip is great</li>
    <li> Works great! Gets hot enough and has the perfect shape. Does take a little getting used to though.</li>
    <li> Love it, with the curved plates, it gives your hair a bit of a curl, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I liked it until it died for no reason.  I didn&#x27;t even use it that often.</li>
    <li> The extra plastic casing around the plates and heating elements can sometimes make it cumbersome to maneuver, but I have small hands. Other than that, once you find the right heat setting for your hair, this works well. It doesn&#x27;t create actual curls but it helps to create a rounded shape that is just right when straightening your hair.</li>
    <li> i use this product in my job i am a hair stylist it gives a lovely flip in long hair nice tuck on sides of short hair</li>
    <li> Need to take these back &amp; redo the temp control and make it so you can touch the outside-it wouldbegreat then.</li>
