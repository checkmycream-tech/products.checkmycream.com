<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product, shipped super fast! Excellent quality</li>
    <li> Everything excellent.</li>
    <li> I am new to using raw plant butters &amp; love all the information I have read about all their wonderful uses. I purchased this shea butter to mix with carrier oils and essential oils. I was given some shea butter to try and it was hard as a rock initially and that&#x27;s what I expected from this product, but was happy to find it was smoother and easier to use than expected. It does seem to have a gritty quality for the first few seconds of rubbing it in my hands but that disappears almost immediately and it melts into a wonderful silky smooth oil that goes on beautifully.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this. I will be putting in my third order. It&#x27;s made a big difference the way my skin feels. I mix it with coconut oil. It gets real creamy and make it easier to put on, and good for hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered my product on a Friday. I received it that Sunday. First time I ever got a Sunday delivery. It is the best Shea Butter I have ever purchase. It&#x27;s smooth, not grainy at all. It has a slight nutty smoky smell. I made a batch of whipped shea butter today.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality Shea butter. One of the best brands that I have tried so far. The texture is awesome as well. Packed full of great nutrients and its great on my skin and hair. The shipping was excellent and I received my Shea butter in no time. I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Yes, it feels great on my skin, but it smells like an ashtray! I had to add heavy amounts of essential oils to my lotions to mark the scent. Will not buy from them again!</li>
    <li> Greaaaaat stuff!!!!!!! Makes skin soooo soft!</li>
    <li> My mom and I have issues with dry skin and we really liked this butter! The only thing is the scent is not that great and I would have loved it 100% if it will be different. Overall the item works well and is worth the price</li>
    <li> Got product on time, is exactly what they said it would be. Working well for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. I like the added touch of the wooded knife that comes with it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I use it in my hair and on my skin.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter is soft and creamy, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  It looks like good quality, so I&#x27;m excited to see how it does in my products.</li>
    <li> absolutely one of the best suppliers of Shea butter I have found.  I make natural soaps &amp; lotions so product quality &amp; consistency is very important to me.  RA has a quality product - highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> What a great value for pure shea butter rather than paying big money for cosmetic products with only partial shea butter.I have been using it for 4 days now on my terribly cracked and dry fingers from a lifetime of gardening and handy work (I actually no longer have fingerprints on my right hand!). I will slather the shea butter on my fingertips and hands then put on work or dish gloves doing this a few times through out the day, my fingers are noticeably softer with the cracks receding. I am also applying to my heels nightly. Remember that this is &amp;#34;unrefined&amp;#34; and raw so it is not emulsified, the butter crumbles in your hand sometimes making a bit of a mess until the warmth of your skin melts it and it smooths along the skin, it reminds me of the old cocoa butter we used to use at the beach in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> Very nutty earthy odor. Pretty happy about my purchase.</li>
    <li> Product is just what I expected. Texture and color are what I wanted. Will definitely purchase more products from this.</li>
    <li> Really good quality shea butter. And I love that it&#x27;s ethically sourced. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using this type of product so I have nothing to compare it to. I used it with coconut oil and lavender to make a whipped body butter. REALLY like how it turned out. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I Love Love This Shea Butter!!!! I ordered it twice an this will be my Staple Product from now on, The texture an smell are Both Amazing!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves skin smooth and silky. Will experiment with scenting product as the &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; smell is not offensive but not invisible.</li>
    <li> I go through a lot of Shea Butter... In fact, I use it everyday, so I&#x27;ve had my share of experiences from different sellers. By far, this is the best Shea Butter I&#x27;ve ever ordered or used. It&#x27;s super creamy, smooth and rubs on easily when used by itself from the package, and it mixes really well with my DIY body butter. I&#x27;d definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> Great product! The purest shea I have worn in months.  Nicely packaged and clean scent.  The authenticity is exceptional.  Shea is my go to product for hair, skin, lips, you name it!  Definitely would buy it again because I share it with my family.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> This. Is. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this the best shea butter I&#x27;ve over used, but this may be my favorite body product EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to make my own lotions by whipping it with coconut oil and essential oils or when I&#x27;m feeling lazy, I just use it plain. No store bought lotion has ever left my skin feeling so soft and glowing. And no store bought shea butter has ever been so decadently creamy. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  Used it to make body butter and it turned out great.  Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Best Shea butter I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Best Shea butter I have used so far. I love making hair creams and body butter with this. It blends so well with other oils and the texture is amazing. My skin and hair love​ this. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best shea butter for making cosmetics!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using shea butter as a hair moisturizer.  I have very dry frizzy hair and this product is very magical.  The moisture it leaves in your hair is amazing and a little goes a long way.  You can use as a hot oil treatment and add some scent and anything else that will mix well with the butter.  Once you leave on your hair for at least 20 minutes you will need to wash out as it is a heavy moisturizer.  You will see a difference within the first use of this amazing product.  When your hair is dry you may also rub a small amount in your hands and then work through your hair.  The product will not take away from your style, but do be careful as if you use to much it may weight down your even more beautiful curls....Love, love, love this butter.  One of the best products ever used for my dry curly hair.  Thankyou soooo much....</li>
    <li> Love this. I use it on my hair and skin it&#x27;s so moisturizing and easy to spread my skin.</li>
    <li> Great shea is all I have to say!</li>
    <li> It is green when I opened it.</li>
    <li> This raw shea butter is amazing &amp; mixes very well</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. The wooden knife was very helpful.</li>
    <li> Great product, great quality!</li>
    <li> perfect for my lotion and lip gloss projects</li>
    <li> Best Shea butter ... So soft and easy to whip or mix ... Great packaging .. Will definitely continue to buy this product... Recommend 100%...</li>
    <li> very good quality! I&#x27;m using it to make my own lotions and creams by mixing it with sesame oil or almond oil and coconut oil! I will buy from this company again!</li>
    <li> Got it on time, and it&#x27;s just what I wanted. Will order again</li>
    <li> A really great product, will make another purchase soon!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to make a whipped Shea butter mix that I use both on my hair and skin. This product is so creamy and smooth. I mixed with  several oils and my hair has been supper soft and moisturized. I learned about this great product from Fran of Hey Fran.com. I &#x27;m glad I made the purchase. I have curly long hair.</li>
    <li> Great for Aging Hands, Been applying on my hands, on a regular basis.  I can see the difference: brighter, shiny, smoother, and silky.</li>
    <li> Needed this for my natural home-made hair and facial products.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Order was due to arrive 11/21/2014, but showed up 11/20/2014. It&#x27;s natural so it has the normal unscented shea butter smell, however it&#x27;s easy to whip and turn into your own body, hair, etc butter. Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never worked with raw shea butter before so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s supposed to smell the way it does.  The product itself works great though and melts down perfectly for making lotion bars and body butters.</li>
    <li> Yes - decadent came to mind as I carefully opened the package and enjoyed just looking at it and then open the bag and appreciating the smooth texture. I only ever had in in a jar, probably processed somehow. This butter is rich and pure, a creamy consistency, perfect to spoil yourself using it straight from the bag - I used it on my skin, especially some stubborn places (elbows) and am happy to see results.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I get over this horrible cold, I&#x27;ll be experimenting more.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the feeling I had is akin to what you might feel when you hold something very beautiful in your hands, like a beautiful crystal or a piece of art - I love the simple, yet practical packaging and am looking forward to making some creams with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> It was wonderful. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> straightforward. raw shea butter. good quality</li>
    <li> The best shea I&#x27;ve purchased online. Truly raw shea butter in smell and texture.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, and I definitely plan to order MORE!!!!</li>
    <li> I am in love. This shea butter smells, feels - IS Amazing. Just the basic shea butter and nothing more. I bought two, they both have the nutty shea butter smell to it, and it melts on skin for wonderful absorption. I use it on everything; skin, lips, hair. I use so little at a time and it really goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love the purity of this raw shea butter ordering more to make my body butters and hair cream.</li>
    <li> The shea butter arrived quickly, the packaging is great.  This is allot of shea butter and excellent quality .....</li>
    <li> easy to use not as hard as I was expecting it to be and feels good on the skin</li>
    <li> Perfect for making hand salve and lip gloss. handy container.</li>
    <li> I will never buy cheap beauty store shea butter again! I love this stuff! It&#x27;s so smooth and not grainy. This is definitely high quality butter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve order 2x from them. The first batch was awesome! The 2nd order not so much.  It was grainy and not smooth like the first order. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll chance it and order again.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is amazing!  It&#x27;s very soft, clean and has a nice scent.  It&#x27;s easy to cut and separate to make smaller batches of shea butter.  I followed the shea butter hair conditioner recipe on the Raw Apothecary website and found it to be so easy to make!  My entire family really enjoyed this butter.  I will make the body butter next.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> So glad I found this product.  I have eczema and on top of that sensitive skin.  Since I have that winning skin combo I don&#x27;t often like trying new skin products.  I recently had a bad eczema break out and nothing would help not even my prescribed creams. I&#x27;ve heard in the past that Shea Butter is great for the skin.  So I decided to so some research and pinterst search and saw all the benefits Shea butter can provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  When it came in the mail I ripped open the package and put the Shea butter directly on my eczema break outs.  The itching stopped and I finally felt like my skin was getting moisture to it.  The next morning I could see a dramatic change to the skin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase and can&#x27;t wait to use this product in different ways.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and arrived just as described!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, raw, unrefined shea butter. Delivered quickly and as described. I highly recommend this product and will look at other items from Raw Apothecary!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shea butters in amazon.  The packaging was perfect and the product was greet.</li>
    <li> Love this - very high quality - used this to&lt;br /&gt;Make lavender lotion bars for teachers gifts and they are a hit! Will be ordering more asap!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, used it to make body mousse to give as gifts.... found your product after reading the reviews. Purchased it because of great reviews and was not disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality product. Works great to sooth dry and  wind burnt skin. Will deffentally be getting again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for making homemade lotions and lip balm</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it with other natural oils and it really helps in these winter months.  Softens the skin and my heels are back to being soft and smooth. Recently moved to Chicago and the water along with this weather has really taken its toll on my skin. This product was a life saver. I am planning to whip it with other natural oils to make my own skin cream. It&#x27;s really evened out my skin tone as well. Great price - will be buying more. I hope I will be able to forever - so very often you find a great product and and then they go off the market. I hope this doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> My first time using shea butter.  I didn&#x27;t realize the smell was so strong (nutty).  It does heat well (not gritty).  I think it makes a really great cream for the heals of the feet (mixed it with hemp oil) and I also made eye cream with it (adding essential oils).</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!! It was just as described.  My hair and my children&#x27;s hair and skin have greatly benefited from this product.  My hair/body butter feels and looks great!  I will be ordering again from this company.</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;m Joanna. I ordered this shea butter to make lip balm with. I loved the product! It was well packaged and the quality was phenomenal. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Super creamy, and worked perfectly for my homemade moisturizer</li>
    <li> Mmm!!! This shea butter is very creamy, smooth and the smell isn&#x27;t strong at all. A little goes a long way! Excited that you can use on your hair as well. Great product!</li>
    <li> Super creamy, mild odor, feels great on the skin. This stuff will be super useful.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I had been looking for a nice quality shea butter, and I finally found it! I made a whipped shea butter mix and I love it. It has a nice nutty smell to it, and its amazing on my skin and in my hair. Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I use it on my feet where I used to get cracks on my skin, then I put socks on. After one month, my feet are not as dry as before, and there are less cracks.</li>
    <li> This was my second order and I have been very pleased with the Shea Butter.  It is as described and has worked well with the lotions I have been making.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever for hair!!!!!! My whole life I have had thick, long, VERY curly hair. 2 years ago I was admitted to the hospital for several months, during that time my hair became extremely matted. Since then I have spent 100&#x27;s of $$$ on hair products, countless amounts of hours crying in pain, no hair stylist wanted anything to do with it, and severe anxiety over the whole situation. As a 30 year old mother of 3 I just couldn&#x27;t fathom. I got offered this item at a reduced price for an honest review and thought &amp;#34;Why not? What have I got to loose at this point? At the worst it just won&#x27;t work like the rest?&amp;#34;. IT WORKED!!!! I rubbed this in my hands until it melted down, added a couple drops of extra virgin olive oil, lathered into into my hair, wrapped it in plastic wrap and heated it up with a blow dryer, let it sit for about 30 minutes.....then I started taking the mats out with a wide tooth comb! Within 8 hours my hair was out! AND super super soft and healthy looking again!!!! Now I not only use it on my hair to prevent and remove tangles but I use it on my 2 girls hair also. I will continue to purchase this product and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to others with thick curly hair!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this shea butter.  It worked well in a homemade body butter.  Packaged well, easy to open, and very nice shea butter.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great for making homemade lotion. Come with a wooden knife to cut it up.</li>
    <li> the product came nicely and simply packaged with a helpful wooden spatula; the shea butter itself is the best quality i&#x27;ve bought off amazon by far--it&#x27;s soft and has an almost whipped quality to it which i love because it is easier to spread and melt into the skin. a repeat buy for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and so does my skin! So glad I purchased this, and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> First, I love how the shea butter is packaged, sealed in plastic wrap around a 1lb block of shea butter.  Then, placed in a thick lined paper bag with the top sealed off so that no air can enter the package.  When the bag is opened there is a wooden spatula to cut the block into usable pieces.  The butter is soft and creamy, and smells very nutty.  I will be purchasing more shea butter from Raw Apothcary in the future.  This order is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love this for my body butters! I helps me stay moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> Very nice product!  I use it to make my own beauty products. And will use it again.</li>
    <li> Great butter!  It is very smooth and melts on your skin nicely.  Will be using it to make some whipped body butter for friends.  Very pleasing smell!</li>
    <li> I bought this to start making my own sunscreen and lotions! I love this product</li>
    <li> I love this raw Shea butter. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday on my eczema and dry cracked heels. It has made a huge improvement on both! My heels are nice and soft now!! Give it a try. There are so many things you can use it on.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I LOVE the Raw Apothecary Organic Shea Butter I ordered!  It was delivered in a timely manner and is very high quality Shea butter.  It is very smooth and creamy and feels great on my skin.  I recommend everyone that uses Shea butter, try this from Raw Apothecary.  You&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best shea butters I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is absolutely fantastic. It&#x27;s really great for your skin as well as your hair. It&#x27;s not grainy and it doesn&#x27;t have the overpowering  scent that a lot of other shea butter&#x27;s have. I love it and i will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Love the product...my hair love it too! :)</li>
    <li> A wonderful product.  It has a fresh nutty smell and is very smooth.  My wife and I mixed up a batch of shea butter cream -  melted down the butter in a double boiler added some extra virgin olive oil and mixed in a blender.  The cream came up light and smooth.  I tend to get itchy at night and this stuff seems to really help.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Good quality, great packaging, fast delivery time. It&#x27;s a little grainy to start but once warmed on the skin it becomes the lovely expected consistency. This is my go to Shea butter now.</li>
    <li> I liked the butter, but it was too crumbly.</li>
    <li> My wife applies this to her super dried heels and then wears socks over night! And also she said it is really good for her hands! She loves it and said it beats all the hand creams (she really tries every hand creams)!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> My girlfriends daughter has eczema and this took away the itch instantly</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best Shea butter that I have used, it&#x27;s creamy and melts right into my skin. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> The butter seems to have quite the pungent smell to it, but it feels great on your skin.  Used it to make some lotion bars, and love the way they feel!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this shea butter.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> BEST SHEA BUTTER EVER! MUST BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised.  Clean smooth spreadable. Low odor. Fast shipping. Great product. Definitely will order again.</li>
    <li> Its great and works well on eczema</li>
    <li> like the product...don&#x27;t like the smell...</li>
    <li> I really like this product and its purity.  It is great for your skin and goes on nice and smooth.  I am thinking of adding some essential oils to small parts of it as it really has no smell except that of Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s great especially in the winter with cracked heels. It also keeps my entire body moisturized and soft.</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product. My kids and I both suffer from excema and I can tell a difference in my skin already! We have used this product for about a week and a half. I absolutely love it! My good friend across the street had ordered this product and suggested that we try it. She gave me a sample of hers and I had to order my own! Thanks Brenda!</li>
    <li> Great quality product and loved the packaging.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand of shea butter due to it having so many positive reviews, but the product I received is crumbly and grainy, not buttery and smooth like it should be. It also has a gray-ish tone. The little wooden knife is cute, but completely unnecessary since the product just breaks apart into crumbs. It melted OK into my homemade lotion and deodorant, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one, but did not melt well when rubbed directly into my palm (noting the very grainy feel, like sawdust that eventually rubbed in), and I would not purchase this brand again. I&#x27;ve since purchased &amp;#34;Perfect Body Harmony&amp;#34; raw shea butter, which is USDA certified organic (a plus in my book), and the quality and texture is completely different--smooth, hard, and the color of butter. It&#x27;s a few dollars more, but definitely worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Great price! I&#x27;m excited to use it in the body butter I&#x27;m going to make!</li>
    <li> wonderful shea butter, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good product and a reliable seller!</li>
    <li> Great product, I bought the product during a promotion and I am very please with the product.</li>
    <li> OH WOW!!!! I have used many types of shea butter, but nevervhadvi experience such an amazing product it us rich and amazingly creamy not stiff at like some shea it compliments my essential oils and carrier wonderfully. Thank you Apothecary for such an amazing product. I will be buying always.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging! nervous at first that the Shea butter was going to feel too thick and heavy....NOT AT ALL! 😁</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Shea butter and I must admit this is by far the best yet. Perfect texture and richness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had the hardest time finding raw shea butter (because of where I live) so when I heard about this brand I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I love it! It&#x27;s great for whipping up my hair and body butters! My order was processed and shipped quickly, which is always a plus. I will definitely be reordering!</li>
    <li> This is the most pure Shea butter I have ever bought. It is truly rich, creamy and free of coloring or perfumes. It is easy to use and store afterwards. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Best price on quality item. I shopped around a lot and this was definitely well bought.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  This shea butter is absolutely wonderful....top quality!  Definitely will continue buying Raw Apothecary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently purchased a second order of this product.  It smells fresh and has a smooth consistency making it easy to use (alone or blended with other oils/butters).  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Seems like great quality, good addition to my homemade lotions.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter is very soft and easy to manage. Use on hair for sealing and styling.</li>
    <li> High quality smooth texture</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own whipped body cream. I have super dry skin and eczema so regular body lotion, even vaseline intensive care lotion does not work for me. The only thing that works for me is vaseline and shea butter. Vaseline doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin well and stains my clothes so I prefer shea butter. I used to get the shea butter out of beauty supply stores but it has chemicals in it. I bought this shea butter and cut the block of it in half. I used a mixer to blend the half piece with olive oil until it became soft and &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; (about 10 min). I put that in a container and use it daily as my body lotion. It absorbs very well and keeps me moisturized the whole day. I am 100% happy. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I could not say enough about the quality of this raw product. I love the way it feels. It mixes well to make my own bath and body products. I love the way it comes packaged</li>
    <li> Very thick - almost clay-like - but melts fairly quickly as you warm it in our hands. This particular product is a bit difficult to use for making hand creams because it is so thick, but it also provides a more immediate, longer lasting moisture for dry skin. It does have a mild smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after it&#x27;s applied to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this shea butter with essential oils and vitamin E to make an eczema cream for my husband. One application lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Very neatly and consciously packaged as possible. Love the wooden knife as opposed to a plastic one! Very smooth, certainly a high grade of shea butter. Will certainly order again! :) I can&#x27;t wait to whip this with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Really excellent shea butter! melts nicely and leave my hair feeling moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely a higher quality than most shea butters I&#x27;ve used. Great for hair AND skin :)</li>
    <li> Love it. I feels nice on my hair and skin, keeping it soft and moist. The packaging was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast! This stuff is amazing! I used it for a couple recipes and it was wonderful! I highly recommend and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love it. Nice and soft enough to break off and cuts like butter.</li>
    <li> Referred to this product by Hey Fran Hey website and absoloutely loved it. Packaging was as seen in photo and included handy utensil. Love the quality and will be ordering again!!</li>
    <li> perfect colour and it melt at body temperature. good moisturiaing for hair and skin</li>
    <li> I plan on using this to make my own sunscreen and lotion for the spring and summer. I was very excited to get the opportunity to purchase this at such a great price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter! It&#x27;s so smooth. I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I received this item on time, and exactly as described on the product info. Everything looks great. Love the convenient knife that comes with the butter and the packaging is also great. As stated in previous reviews, shea butter has a pungent smell. Honestly though, after reading so many people complain about it, I was expecting the smell to be worse. To me, it&#x27;s NOT bad enough to prevent me from using it, just more of a smoky/burnt smell which is normal due to the process of extracting the butter. I also feel comfortable knowing that this is a good sign that it&#x27;s natural and hasn&#x27;t been processed. The butter itself is smooth and moisturizing, and contains for many vitamins that are great for your skin. I&#x27;m excited to start mixing this butter with various essential oils for added benefits and perhaps masking of the smell. Thanks for an overall good experience, Raw Apothecary :)</li>
    <li> Just as described. Great quality!</li>
    <li> Very pleased , I have purchased organic from another supplier and I was not impressed with the smell it was on the offensive side. I will plan on ordering from you again.</li>
    <li> Its a good shea butter. I think what sets this shea butter apart from other companies is the packaging which included a knife.  I would definitely repurchase.  I use the shea butter for my skin mixed with cocoa butter, coconut oil, olive oil and other natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter, mixes well with coconut oil to make a great lotion. It is a great Product.Great Communication from company before and after the sale. Fast Shipping, and great price!</li>
    <li> Wow such a luxurious product! I use it as a nightly face moisturizer and it does not clog pores! It is so worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is pure heaven. from the brown paper bag it comes in, to the little knife, and the thick block of smooth soft Shea butter, every part of butter is magical. I am a huge fan of Shea butters. I usually order from butters n bars, and they have awesome butters, and sometimes I buy from African festivals, but this one takes the cake. I&#x27;ve been using Shea butters for almost 4 years now and I whip  them with my own very special blend of oils, and use them in my natural hair. I attribute my healthy hair to Shea butter and its magical moisturizing wonders. this is the smoothest Shea butter I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I can&#x27;t bring myself to whip it just yet. I put a small amount in a small container and I use it every night on my face, and I rub it on my girlfriends skin. she has dry skin and she&#x27;s usually not a huge consumer of natural and raw products, but she loves being rubbed down with this, she even loves the light faint nutty smell. im not a huge fan of lotions, never have been. I have normal skin on my body and my face is lightly oily. I use this butter on my face and the rest of my body and I feel like im in heaven using the best products made from the earth. last night I twisted my hair with this Shea butter alone. a little goes a long way. I use less than a pea size any time im rubbing it somewhere on my body or in my hair. it melts and spreads fast and nicely. I love this Shea butter and I hope they never stop selling it.</li>
    <li> I bought it to make homemade body butter. It melted down like a dream.</li>
    <li> I love shea butter in place of lotion that you would buy at the store. With this stuff, you know exactly what you&#x27;re using on your body and it actually hydrates. Since this is actually hydrates my skin, I don&#x27;t have to use it as often. When I was using lotion I bought from the store, I was having to put it on everyday but never actually felt hydrated. My skin always felt dry (cause they typically use mineral oils), but with this raw shea butter my skin feels so much better! Its great! I can even mix it with some essential oils like lavender to give it a scent without taking away from the moisturizing aspect.</li>
    <li> SOOOO many uses for this pure shea butter and this butter is such great quality.  WIll buy again soon.  I&#x27;ve been able to complete so many products with this.  Thanks for making a pure and great product!</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter did just what it promised! Nice and creamy texture! If anyone is indecisive to purchase this product; try it you will like it! My body butters are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great product and great price! Shipping was fast also!</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter, second time buying it. And I plan on ordering more</li>
    <li> I have used this product to make my own body cream and hair butter. I like the texture and it&#x27;s easy to blend with oils too.</li>
    <li> This Raw Shea Butter is great! It is well packaged and has a good smell and is smooth and easy to spread all over your body. I also put it on my hair instead of hairspray. It makes my skin soft and supple. I love that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  We have been using it as is for a cure all! Got it with a great promo code,  and now it&#x27;s my go to for severe diaper rash,  and it worked awesomely on a really bad shave with a new razor too.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea Butter!! It&#x27;s easy to work with and I love that it comes in a brick. I use Shea butter as one of the ingredients in my body lotion that I make and this product has made a good body lotion into a great body lotion!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use this product. I love it. It moistures my skin and hair especially in winter time. I don&#x27;t feel dry anymore.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Not gritty at all, in fact it is very soft and leaves my skin feeling wonderful.</li>
    <li> absolutely my favorite shea butter to work with.  Easy to measure, creamy consistency, and awesome packaging keeps it fresh.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great. True 1lb pkg. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Super soft! Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Beautiful product. Very smooth and easy to cut. Top shelf shea butter for sure! Although mine did not come with a wooden knife. I was still quite pleased!</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin and the hair. Super soft results. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Really great product. I will be repurchasing this again soon</li>
    <li> Great product! Building my own skincare products with fabulous all natural products. Love this Raw Shea Butter as an ingredient.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It arrived sooner than the expected delivery date. The quality is superb for my DIY skin and hair recipes. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that this product has little to no smell to it.  The scent of many moisturizers and lotions really gets to me after awhile, but I didn&#x27;t notice anything with this.  The feel of the shea butter is a little strange, but does a great job moisturizing.  Can&#x27;t wait to try mixing it with some coconut oil to see what happens to the texture.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used raw shea butter and I have to say I was completely blown away!! It does exactly everything it says it does. My daughter has severe eczema on her inner elbows and knees. I have tried many products with no luck until now. I love the way this butter feels so soft and just melts into an oil by the warmth of your skin. It immediately relieved my daughters itching. She is able to sleep through the night without having to wake up and scratch. Her skin visibly improved with the first use. I apply it to her skin a few times throughout the day. Her skin is healing and she is doing much better. I will be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> This is the best raw Shea Butter I have ever used! The quality is top notch and the price is wonderful!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!!</li>
    <li> So happy I brought this has definitely improvement my skin plus I use it in my hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to cut and makes my skin so soft. I use this in my homemade lotion bars and it is wonderful, just not too crazy about the smell; I use extra EO to cover the natural shea butter scent.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! My skin is so soft whenever I use it!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Good product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great quality! I really love this butter. I will buy again</li>
    <li> Oh this is very nice Shea butter. It&#x27;s so soft and creamy! The smell is wonderful and it makes my home made products especially luscious!</li>
    <li> I loved the product raw Shea butter. It was so smooth and I could feel the richness of the butter. Thank you so much for providing consumers with such pure ingredients!!!! I will buy more when I am through using this order.</li>
    <li> Its wonderful.It is everthing that I knew it would be</li>
    <li> The packaging is superb! Totally in love with the bag and the little knife, but most importantly the Shea is AMAZING! So soft!  So much better than another brand I tried! I will continue to use this product and tell others about it! TOP NOTCH!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Shea butter! I use it on my natural hair and my skin! Great moisturizer and used as a sealant, it helps my 4c texture hair stay moisturized for days! Love love</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.  I have not used the product yet, but I opened it and everything seemed as it should.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter will rock your socks. I love it. I use in all of my homemade creams. My skin is so much healthier looking when I&#x27;m using this stuff than regular drug store lotion. I make sure I never run out. It&#x27;s creamier, smoother and softer than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Finally i found the best moisturizer. I will be buying this again. Even buying some as gifts.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! I use it in a few different recipes. Makes my skin feel really soft and smooth. I will continue to order from this company in the near future.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and hair.  I mixed this product with a little Blackseed Oil and applied it to my wet hair and skin.  Hours later my hair and skin are still soft.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging, and the Shea is really smooth love it And I&#x27;m so excited to try it</li>
    <li> The shea butter was great quality. Soft and malleable, not dried out. Shipped quickly and came with a knife to cut it. Exactly as advertised. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love love love! The texture is smooth. The wooden knife and packaging was a nice little touch. I can&#x27;t stop using this Shea butter from creating my own body butter to hair butter. Definitely a good purchase much different from any other Shea butter I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Best shea butter ever purchsed, last for quite some time. My whole family loves it. We use it for a hair and skin moisturiser.</li>
    <li> Love this Shea Butter!! Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely fashion.  I use Shea butter to make my own body butter.  I like the way this product feels on my skin as does my daughter.  I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Great texture product. Mixed will with oils and hold up well with the oils.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! So many different things you can use it for!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time ,very very moisturizing -especially for hair, leaves hair soft ,silky,and healthy</li>
    <li> very nice package clean I&#x27;ve  only just started  using the butter i brought. i like it was clean and easy to use, I mixed coconut oil and olive with a small amount of argan oil to get a nice cream.  This the my first try at it is little more oilyier then I like but  my hair just suck it in.</li>
    <li> Loved, loved, loved this product! It smells &amp; feels lovely. My skin loves it too.</li>
    <li> affordable and high quality Shea butter with a great back story. the handy knife included in the package makes a huge difference when getting the butter out of the bag at room temp. Will purchase again unless I find a better price.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with this product. melted quickly and not grains like some have had</li>
    <li> Excellent And arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN PLAGUED WITH VERY DRY SKIN ALL OF MY LIFE, IT SEEMS I&#x27;VE  TRIED EVERYTHING TO NO AVAIL. THEN I SAW THE SHEA BUTTER (RAW, UNREFINED), DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY AND LO AND BEHOLD IT WORKS. I STILL CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT........... NO MORE SCALY DRY LEGS, ARMS ETC. I HONESTLY LOVE IT AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT. I F YOU HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM OR SOMEONE YOU KOW, TRY IT.........I PROMISE YOU, YOU&#x27;LL NEVER LOOK BACK</li>
    <li> This Shea butter was exactly what I expected. Great product and packaged well.</li>
    <li> This is really nice shea butter.  It comes packaged in a shrink wrap, you need to transfer into a container.  It is not gritty, and it has a nice pleasant aroma.  Much better than any other shea butter I have bought in the past, will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is lovely!  It arrived very well packaged and was very fresh.  The shea was tightly wrapped in plastic and was sealed in a pouch, as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;It has that familiar smoky, nutty scent and is easy to work with.  The scent is mild and disappears in about ten minutes, after you&#x27;ve applied it.  I&#x27;ve been using this shea by itself and mixed with coconut oil and camellia oil and it&#x27;s just as shea butter should be; healing, soothing and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll find all sorts of shea butters on Amazon; some good and some bad.  This is one of the good ones, kids.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is super soft and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to mix up my own hair/skin body butters. Can&#x27;t wait to use it. :-)</li>
    <li> It was good.  I was expect it to be a little more product than I received.  It was shipped in a timely mamner</li>
    <li> Love it! Smooth and easy to apply. My hair loves it.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this shea butter on a whim, and I love it! First of all I&#x27;ve had some butters in the past that haven&#x27;t smelled so great, but this one in particular smells amazing. Secondly, the little knife they added into the package is brilliant. Thirdly, the way the shea butter is wrapped is lovely. Love the inner plastic bag keeping things fresh. I whipped this butter with some oils and it turned out fluffy and gorgeous. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use and makes great creams and lip balms.  The only thing I will mention is there is a smell to this product, not a bad smell, but a little stronger than I thought it would be.  it doesn&#x27;t seem to over power the things I make with it, some even are enhanced by it.  I will be buying this again and often, very happy with this product!  I would also like to let other buyers know that this is a soft brick which makes it super easy to &amp;#34;scoop&amp;#34; the amount you want with the wooden spoon provided.  It is slightly oily, but I wanted something like that, so for me this worked great!</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging. Wonderful smell, texture, and consistency. I appreciated the wooden knife that came with it. Excellent product that I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST Shea Butter!  I have tried a few over the years, but this is by far the best!  It makes my skin feel so smooth and silky!  It goes on  easily and absorbs quickly (which I really love).  I am hooked on this and I will be using this Shea Butter for years to come!</li>
    <li> Great product and Great service!</li>
    <li> I had this for over 2 weeks so far so good. It came in like 2 days from the time I ordered it. It came packaged very well. I ordered the 1lb size just to try it. It had the shea butter scent. It was the color that is advertised and it was kind of soft. I mixed this to make a hair butter with oils. I also made a skin butter and mixed it with different oils as well. It didn&#x27;t have any foreign particles in it. I whipped mine so that got rid of the grains but it melts so good in warm hands so that wasn&#x27;t even an issue. My skin and hair loves it so will order some once my stash gets low. A little goes a long way. I will order from this same company again because today they sent a 25% coupon code as a \\&quot;Thank You\\&quot; for purchasing their product. I feel that is good business but I won&#x27;t be using the code because you have only 72hrs to use it and I don&#x27;t need anymore at this time... Just the idea of them sending me that is awesome!!! I got mine from Top Shelf Barber Supplies. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal it&#x27;s soooo raw. I made a great shea butter mix with some essential oils added in. Shipping was super fast. I received it in two days. Great seller!</li>
    <li> Product worked well in my body bar. Had a shea butter scent which I expected a bit stronger than I liked. First time using butters so I have nothing to compare to. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this Shea Butter melts in my hand.  Use on my hair and body.</li>
    <li> Great Quality! Will order again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Arrived promptly.  I will be ordering more!  Great!</li>
    <li> Really like this shea butter.  It is very soft and smooth.  It works very well with our family&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this shea butter to make lip balm with.  You get a lot for what you pay! It smelled great, easy to work with and melted quickly.  I would buy this again</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing this product. I really like it since I&#x27;ve used up the first one in about a month. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and it does have a noticable nature-like scent but it&#x27;s bearable. Though the second batch I got tend to smell of cow manure and mixing scented oils barely masks it. Don&#x27;t know how I feel about that but nonetheless it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this Shea butter from Raw Apothecary. This butter is nonirritating and provides great moisture, especially after a shower! It just melts in your hand! My sister tried a little butter on her lips and she wanted to keep using it. Now she is hooked! Thank you Raw Apothecary!</li>
    <li> This is beautiful shea. It is an ivory color and it was soft and not grainy. I use it to make body butters and salves and this is one of the nicer shea butters I have tried. The included wooden knife was also very helpful. I also liked that it wasn&#x27;t in a jar, hard, where I would have difficulty getting it out. It wasn&#x27;t crumbly. I was able to cut off enough to weigh it with a kitchen scale and I stored the rest for later. I received this item in exchange for feedback and testing and in order to provide an honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to leave a review for a while now just been busy. This stuff is so light &amp; fluffy once mixed it&#x27;s like frosting for my skin my husband even tried to eat it it looked &amp; smelled so good. I would definitely buy again &amp; you should too! The seller was even nice enough to contact me to see if I was satisfied with my purchase. I would say this is my first purchase of something like this so if your trying to make big batches of body butter like me purchase 2. It was very fresh &amp; light great quality shea butter not gritty like store bought butter.</li>
    <li> I finally had a chance to work with the Shea Butter I purchased from Raw Apothecary this past week.  The quality is top notch.  The scent is light and pleasant.  The texture feels very nice... I almost didn&#x27;t want to mix it with the other ingredients (I was making a new deodorant batch).  I will definitely be back to order again, because I&#x27;ll be using the Shea Butter by itself for my skin, especially my hands. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it so much, but it just feels amazing on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very pure. The wooden knife that comes with it is cool too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d buy again but I wish it was packaged internally a bit better. It&#x27;s hard to get a chunk out without it flaking all over the counter. The product itself is marvelous.</li>
    <li> Great for my skin and natural hair!</li>
    <li> shipped fast...great product.</li>
    <li> this is my first time ordering raw shea butter and i absolutely love it. the texture is quite soft and when you apply it onto your skin, it smoothens out very easily. also it doesnt have those strong shea odor, only a light smell which is very acceptable to me. i think i would like to buy this again, just that i wish it costs a little less as my shipping fee is really high.. (i bought some cocoa butter from another seller at the same time, but it came in hard big chunks which is a big contrast to this one!)</li>
    <li> Love that I was able to purchase quality shea, that also has a great message.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 weeks I&#x27;ve seen improvement in my skin I have dry sensitive skin. My only problem is that it&#x27;s not thick enough to stay on all day especially during the winter months I find that I have to reapply the Shea Butter Twice a day to keep moisture on my skin but once again I do have a low case of eczema overall the product smells great the packaging is nice would be nice if the company could include instructions on how to use product.</li>
    <li> Great product and appreciate the knife for scraping. The packaging is nice as well, definitely a quality shea butter.</li>
    <li> For the money, you get the perfect amount of shea butter. I found that this shea butter was gritty when raw, but after rubbing it, it becomes smooth. What I disliked about this shea butter is that when I made my shea butter mix, it&#x27;s just too oily and weighed my hair down, and I only used two oils and one tbsp of each. Even though it caan be very oily, it will keep your hair moisturized for days!</li>
    <li> Great product, nice packaging. Good quality and a great price!</li>
    <li> Used this to make some home-made eczema cream.  Works great!</li>
    <li> There is absolutely no way you will not like this product. It arrived in this beautiful packaging that has paper on the outside( as you see on the picture) but has a foil+ plastic kind of thing inside so nothing will ever melt out. The shea butter is definetly the best i have had my hands on, ever! It has been 2 days since i got this and i already used it to make 2 different body butters. It just melts without any residue with the heat from your body. Most beautiful feeling ever. I am sure I will buy it again and again. (I did not recieve any complimentary stuff or payment in anyway for this review). I am just one happy customer.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! BEST SHEA BUTTER OUT THERE!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality product. Can be used for a lot of recipes &amp; it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I received great service.&amp; I received my product earlier than anticipated, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Amazing! The smoothest raw shea butter i have purchased thus far my new go to company i an definitely sold on this product! The packaging is very boho and the small wooden cutting tool is an extra nice plus. Blends to perfection out the package and is very easy to work with. Looove love love this Raw shea butter.</li>
    <li> Great shea butter! Wonderful silky texture and a nice ivory color. I love that it comes in a brick that is easy to slice with a sharp knife (I keep my shea in the fridge, so it&#x27;s usually pretty hard).</li>
    <li> This shea butter is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for almost 10 years and this is the best I have ever used.  The quality is super smooth and the smell is mild (as mild as shea butter can be).  It blends easily with my other oils. I use it for my hair and my body.  My only complaint is that my order did not come with the wooden knife.  I checked my box and the bag and there was no knife.</li>
    <li> it broke my skin out not a fan of this shea butter</li>
    <li> This is the worst shea butter I have purchased!!!! I bought it in Jan., and I used it for the first time today. It is very grainy, and it has a waxy coating on it  when you take it out of it packaging. This leads me to believe that it has been processed. I guess I will stick to using Coastal scents Shea butter, which whips to a smooth consistency.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I liked the consistency of the shea butter. I thought it was very moisturizing and soft.  I use this product for making soaps and the quality is just what I am looking.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as pictured, the only disappointing factor, is that it was completely melted when received. Other than that great, arrived on  time, I will be buying from this seller again!</li>
    <li> During my first impressions, I m in love with the consistency and how well it absorbed into my hair and skin. and the shea butter melt fast in my hands and it was so soft. It also has scent like no other, defiantly unique. I like it better than the store brought shea butter. When I compare it to other shea butter, It had a good value and the little knife was cute and it cut the butter easily while other shea butter tend to be gummy and harder to melt in my hand. The package is true to picture. Overall the product is superb quality shea butter.</li>
    <li> I liked the packaging. The feel of the butter is great too but the smell is very potent. It takes over everything I make. It might be authentic, but I just wish someone had told me.</li>
    <li> Enough Shea Butter to last a long, long time!  I started adding some essential oil and using this on my insanely dry winter skin.  LOVE it!  A little bit goes a long way.  good stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how raw and unrefined this product is. I&#x27;ve been on shea farms before, and the flakiness was never present as it is with this product. Nonetheless, it performed the way I needed to for making a whipped butter for my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Well when i recieved the item, I was on vacation and now I&#x27;ve returned and its very clumpy and it messed up my skin and it just didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m a little upset i spent so much money just to throw it away now</li>
    <li> Love how it feels. Blended it with coconut and olive oils. Fabulous.  It does have its own unique odor. Some essential oils do well masking. I will reorder</li>
    <li> It came in a very timely fashion and I it was better than what I expected.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I would recommend it to everyone.  It is smooth and light in color with a very mild smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great product . Love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I can&#x27;t wait to try it in my hair.</li>
    <li> Very good quality Shea Butter for my little Apothecary Kitchen in a DIY world.  :  )</li>
    <li> Packaged nicely. Ordered all the way from Trinidad (Caribbean)...Received in a timely manner. Consistency of product is beautiful. Not too graining.</li>
    <li> Love it. I warmed it and added essential oil and it was great.</li>
    <li> Ok product for hair but not so much on my skin. I used half to make a hair moisturizer and the other half for skin. It got a bit grainy.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivert and good quality</li>
    <li> This really is an awesome product!  I have dry skin during the winter and this was definitely needed!  Thank you,  Audra</li>
    <li> Love! Love! Love! Great quality, I won&#x27;t be purchasing my shea butter from anywhere else. This is it for me.</li>
    <li> nice packaging, nice product</li>
    <li> In comparison to the Shea butter I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere, this smells far better and smoother.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is exactly what I wanted.  It is so moisturizing and has a light Shea butter scent.  It last all day whereas my skin is dry in 3 hours with just using lotion.  If you have scaly or severely dry skin, I highly recommend this product.  I will definitely reorder this.</li>
    <li> This shea butter was spot on perfect texture, smooth and creamy. Great quality at an excellent price. Raw Apothecary goes to the top of my list for will order again.</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter. Great quality and I have ordered from other wholesalers and quality is just as good and quick delivery. Used it in my lotions.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hand cream</li>
    <li> high quality shea butter, great for all my products, will buy again when needed</li>
    <li> Best shea butter I habe ever used!!!Very good qulaity product!! We definitely be reordering for future projects!!</li>
    <li> Wow!  This shea butter is amazing.  Perfect for making lotions, creams, and lotion bars.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this Shea Butter had an awful smell that was not bearable at all. I could not imagine making any lip balms or lotions from this as the smell would overpower any essential oil I would have had to add by the tablespoons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the strong smell is natural and to be expected, but just wanted to put it out there so other buyers are aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that the shipping was super quick and the packaging nice, it even came with a nice wooden spatula but overall I could not use the Shea butter simply due to the stringent smell.</li>
    <li> This is the most moisturizing product I have encountered! I am natural and I use this on my hair. I don&#x27;t need nothing else on my hair for the rest of the week. I also use it as a facial moisturizer and it works wonders. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite Shea Butter!  I started making a body butter using this raw Shea butter as the base for myself, but discovered that it&#x27;s perfect for my Grandson who has eczema. It has worked wonders on his skin and mine as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue purchasing this brand as long as the quality remains the same!</li>
    <li> Good Stuff!!!  I made some body butter with this.  It appears to be excellent.  Nice and smooth.  I&#x27;ve tried another brand and like this one much, much better.  : 9)  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I use this Shea butter to make body butter and Chapstick. I honestly have no complaints! All of my batches have turned out amazing! I even just use it plain on my skin sometimes when I&#x27;m feeling extra dry. It is super soft and Emiliant once it melts into the skin. I keep it in the fridge and take it out a few hours before using. It&#x27;s great. I use the wellness mammas recipes for my chap sticks and body butter.</li>
    <li> Amazing price for such a large amount and great product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> Smooth, creamy and easy to blend for making lip balm and body butters. Delicate scent.</li>
    <li> I love it ,it helps clear up my inflammations everywhere</li>
    <li> This raw shea butter is amazing. It blended well as is very moisturizing to my hair and skin. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Came packaged very well, a resealable bag inside the outer packaging. The wooden knife is helpful, but if you lose it, the butter is soft enough you could probably just use a spoon.</li>
    <li> Nice product. You get what they are advertising.</li>
    <li> A fantastic ingredient for making home made body butter</li>
    <li> This shea butter is awesome! It&#x27;s my first time ever using pure shea butter and Raw apothecary doesn&#x27;t disapoint. Its wonderfully smooth and my skin soaks it up. The weight is true as well! Im planning on using this brand to make various skin and hair products. Love it!</li>
    <li> Use this in winter on my African American kids skin and the moisture lasts for days.</li>
    <li> Help&#x27;s my oh so dry and overused hands! Great moisturizer for my skin! Love it, tons of recipies online for making all kinds of yummy products to use on skin, hair, and whole body. I will buy more when I run out! Seems like a high quality product as well!</li>
    <li> I absolutely never leave a review but I had to make this one my first! I looove this shea butter and the next day shipping was perfect! Will be using this product again without a doubt!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. It&#x27;s that simple. I have bought pounds and pounds of Shea butter from all over but this thus far is thee best. I have had Shea Butter shipped to me in Tupperware like containers, and I know the quality of the butter would be compromised because of that, but not this Shea butter it comes double bagged the first bag is a ziploc bag and the outer bag is sealed well. It looks way more sleeker than other Shea butters shipped in a plastic pan!! Give it a go!!</li>
    <li> So far there has been no reason to not give 5 stars. This was my first time ordering/using Shea Butter, but it shipped and arrived quickly and looks as expected. Although I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. :)</li>
    <li> Shea butter has helped my skin drastically recover over the years. I&#x27;m used to using it in my skin care routine, but this was the first time I&#x27;ve bought a whole pound of shea butter at once, and the first time I used Raw Apothecary brand. I&#x27;m glad to say that I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this purchase. Unlike other shea butters I&#x27;ve used, Raw Apothecary is not rock hard at first. You can feel that it&#x27;s already quite soft just by poking the resealable plastic bag it comes in. It is extremely easy to work with thanks to the wooden knife included. I like how the shea butter does not feel grainy, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve used. It is creamy to the touch and feels extra nice on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the shipping time, packaging, and quality of this product, and hope to buy from Raw Apothecary again!</li>
    <li> Very soft. My skin likes this and it makes the hair feel softer. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> Awesome and fresh product!</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for .Will buy it again .</li>
    <li> Good pure product. Well priced.</li>
    <li> Very impressed!!  Fast shipping, easy checkout, and on point!!!</li>
    <li> Really good for the skin and hair specially if you have a dry skin and you want a natural moisturizer, you can either mix it with other butters and oils or you can just cut it and heat it up and put it allover your body</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter, soft, arrived in timely manner, well packaged. Feels wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> love this stuff! apothecary sent this product in the cutest packaging! not to mention the quality of this all natural shea butter is EXCELLENT. I use it to make hair creams at home and it&#x27;s exactly what I need. customer for life! highly recommend</li>
    <li> Works well as a base for the other oils I use for my new natural hairstyle. Makes an excellent base for the oils when creating a body cream.</li>
    <li> used this in my lip balm recipe! worked great......thanks</li>
    <li> This is grade A quality Shea butter. If you haven&#x27;t tried it you&#x27;re missing out! This is great for my whipped Shea butter mixture for my hair and body.</li>
    <li> Product came beautifully packaged.  It is easy to use.  I have made lotion and sunscreen with it so far and both products have been amazing.  I&#x27;ve also used it directly on my hands and it is awesome!</li>
    <li> Very soft and moisturizing</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the resealable bag.</li>
    <li> This is Exactly as it says it is. It is raw, in a Ziplock bag and works amazing. I had to try it the moment it arrived. Winter has made my hands and feet ridiculously dry. So glad I grabbed this to help with my dry skin. It is crumbly but when you rub it between your hands it warms up a bit and becomes silky and smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Can&#x27;t wait to put it to use!</li>
    <li> JUST GOT IT, I WANT TO SLATHER MYSELF IN IT, BEAUTIFUL, INDULGENT, SOOTHING</li>
    <li> Great quality product&lt;br /&gt;Soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;I whipped the shea with coconut oil, sweet almond oil, extra virgine olive oil, and castor oil. The butter is rich and moisturizing for skin and hair</li>
    <li> So so great!!  Absolutely love!!!  Feels amazing smells a bit nutty but great none the less.  It arrived in 2 days which is great, because I&#x27;m extremely impatient.  Will consider purchasing this product wholesale!!  :)</li>
    <li> This product rocks. The quality of the raw unrefined Shea butter was on point and made my skin feel instantly moisturized. The item was shipped and delivered right away. I am so happy I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> Smooth &amp; creamy.  Unlike any other Shea Butter I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great quality, does great inside my homemade shea butter lotions.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE..... I used this to mix with coconut oil,  magnesium chloride, and essential oils ..... I am already thinking of what else I can do with this dream cream!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Made a body/hair butter. Mixing coconut oil, jojoba oil, castor oil and sweet almond oil. Will be repurchasing soon! Better than any other shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased. The quality is just top notch!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing butter. It melts into skin so well and lasts a very long time. I have very dry skin and it helps me throughout the day with itchiness!</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is BUTTER!!!  So smooth NO grimy by product just PURE Shea Butter.  Love in my hair mixes and skin care.  This is it when it come to Shea Butter</li>
    <li> Wonderful and easy to use, love this product and would buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It came nicely packaged, as described, and you can tell right away it&#x27;s great quality. It goes on nicely, and is a perfect addition to home made lotions, etc.</li>
    <li> I made a face cream with the shea butter as soon as I received it. It&#x27;s most definitely the highest quality of shea butter I have purchased. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I was recommended by a friend to buy it from this seller and it live to all the expectations.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the quality of this product.  I will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome butter!  Super smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my skin and lips every day since receiving it - my lips are typically chapped most of the winter -and already they look and feel amazing! I love using it on my skin after my shower, but I&#x27;m still getting used to the stickiness - I think when it&#x27;s warmer I&#x27;ll do a better job getting it softened up and rubbed in. I&#x27;ve got my neighbor and my sister on it now!</li>
    <li> Great shea butter.I make soap, salves and balms and this shea butter worked great in all of them.Super fast shipping</li>
    <li> The product was fantastic quality.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was a little over the one pound.  Very nice customer service.  This product arrived exactly when promised and came just in time for me to finish my daughter-in-laws birthday gift.  I am extremely happy with the product and the service.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. The shea butter is creamy yet textured very soft. You get a nice amount of it and the smell is awesome. I use it to make my own hair and skin products and it never disappoints. Love, Love, Love it.....</li>
    <li> I am im love with this shea butter! I recieved my order within a few days of my purchase. It came packaged in a cute brown bag and the actual shea buttter was in block form in a plastic bag. I really like that it came with a wooden utensil to scrape the product out. In the morning I put it on and dont have to reapply it at all during the day. It is very rich and moisturizing. Im kind of a natural product junkie and I love that this is all natural. I dont have to worry about any chemicals being absorbed into my skin. I will definitely be re purchasing this product again in the future and I recommend it to any one!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Delivery was quick and everything went smoothly. I use this as a foot/heel moisturizer and it works great!!</li>
    <li> Love love love...... the best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a pure Shea butter without that strong cocoa butter scent and finally found it for use as a skin moisturizer and deep conditioner for my hair.  So far, I&#x27;ve used it only on my skin but even after one night&#x27;s application (a little goes a long way), I noticed that my face looked and felt smoother and my body like velvet.  It was as if Mother Nature was turning back the hands of time while I slept.  The product&#x27;s consistency was almost dry, so before using it I contacted the Seller to see whether or not this was normal.  They got back to me right away with a big, fat YES!  As soon as you rub it between your palms it turns into an unbelievable, buttery bliss ^_^ I&#x27;ve placed two orders within the last 30 days and both shipments arrived BEFORE the due date!  I was so impressed with the product that I shared some of my first order with a coworker.  She loved it as much as I did, so I placed the 2nd order for her as a birthday gift.  The package wasn&#x27;t due until February 9th, but it arrived on February 6th!  Needless to say, I was impressed.  This is truly an outstanding product from an A+++ seller.</li>
    <li> Love this product. First thing I did was rub some into my hands. It took a little work to work it in but boy was it worth it. (My hands are  always a mess due to my work) I have since learned many ways to use it including lip balm. Works great and I like knowing it&#x27;s all natural and good for me. It&#x27;s also safe to use on the grandkids because if I&#x27;m using it they have to also.</li>
    <li> Nice Shea butter, I made a whipped body butter with coconut oil and some essential oils, its really good!</li>
    <li> Great product! This shea butter is just like what I used while living in Africa. The consistency is great (not gritty, but smooth) and it melts easily in my opinion. Will definitely be buying more from this seller.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this!  It&#x27;s not too firm, and was easy to work with.  The smell is shea, but mild to me.  It was very emollient, and worked well for my homemade shaving cream!!</li>
    <li> The butter was nice and soft. My hair loves it. It stays soft all day. The product mices well with different kind of oils.</li>
    <li> Love this. It was drying out really quickly but I moved it to an air tight container and that solved the problem.</li>
    <li> I have gotten 1 other brand of shea butter but this is much better!  So smooth!!</li>
    <li> Best product ever! Just as described.  Beautiful packaging and item arrived on time.  Will definitely order again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am new to using shea butter and this is the only brand I have tried.  I have not rated over 4 stars as I have nothing to compare this brand with.  However, this shea butter is easy to use and it works well for my skin.</li>
    <li> Never thought about purchasing this type of moisturizer before until I saw the ad. Will definitely purchase again. Just a small pea size amount seals in moisture and makes dry skin feel smooth all day.</li>
    <li> It is so valueful for raw shea butter. It is so good for our whole family skin. soft skin,  special for my boy.  They don&#x27;t like smell lotion.  It is real raw unrefinesd raw shea butter.  Enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and the delivery!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this is pure Shea butter. Did not moisturize as well as it should have but as a sealant for hair it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Arrived early and is just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter! It is great, quality Shea butter for a great price. I love it for moisturizing my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after using Raw Shea Butter!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Shea Butter fanatic and always look for authentic sellers. I love the color and consistency. None of that fake yellow dye crap like the others. Thanks for the awesome product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shea butter.  Combined with other oils, I mixed it using a hair butter from Hey Fran Hey.  It has smoothed and moisturized my curls like no other product I&#x27;ve purchased in a store.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping. Great quality shea butter.</li>
    <li> I literally cannot get enough of this shea butter!  I use it every morning and night, and will be purchasing more very soon!</li>
    <li> Not as white and creamy as Rose Mountain organic shea butter.  More difficult to work with as an ingredient.</li>
    <li> The name says it all my body felt like 100% Butter I Love this stuff!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Use this in a homemade product. It smell wonderful and is fairly easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I make my own lip balms and body butter and hair products and this shea butter is smooth, and I love it.  The package arrived quickly and it smells nice.  It will take me a while to use up the entire block, but I&#x27;d happily buy it from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> Really like this brand. I have used others on the past that are in really hard crumbles making it really hard to measure. This ones softness was really easy to work with.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is fabulous. Was not grainy like other sheas&#x27;s I have received from other companies. Good customer service as well. Will certainly order again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because I make homemade lotion with It!</li>
    <li> First let me say the shipping was fast 2 days as promised,  I have used many flea market shea butters before u know the mustard colored butter in plastic bowls, well this is my first time with apothecary shea butter and I am blown away how good it is, I will forever buy this product it is amazing, the feel the texture is all like no other,  now I need to figure out how to get stock in this product......</li>
    <li> Very easy to work with. My wife loves the lotion I made for her with it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. This butter has a great consistency that is perfect to use to create your own body butters and natural hair products</li>
    <li> Love this, purchased to make lotions and body butter.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time to try the raw shea butter. It is organic so I applied it on my face, body and my hair. I have to say I&#x27;m impressed by it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great packaging. So moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I received a grainy batch and looked into it. At some point during transportation it had heated up and cooled.&lt;br /&gt;I made a whipped butter with mine and it had no effect on the end product.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This came and everything seemed OK but when I opened it the product within crumbled out. It was like it wasn&#x27;t  stored properly and started drying out.  I was still able to use it to make my hair moisturizer, which is why I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars. Other than that I would have given it a negative review. I will be buying a different brand and from a different seller. Sadly this did not work for me. Good luck to other buyers,  hopefully your experience is better than mine.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!!  Just as described!!  Fast shipping!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!!!!! 100% natural leaves my body and hair feeling soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this in my hair. Super smooth and piable. Smells amazing! I love this Shea butter and definitely will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this shea butter. I was worried about the texture going in however, It was kind of grainy I thought but, it might have been the different oils I used to mix with it.</li>
    <li> I use shea butter to make body butter and also a mixed hair oil. Always come out perfect.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a newby at making natural lotions etc.  I did make a recipe for body butter and liked the consistency.  Also it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  I used it it on my skin and it&#x27;s highly emollient, too much so for July.  I have it in the fridge and plan to try it again next winter.  Overall, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product--just the time of year I made the butter--and I will order the same when I need more.</li>
    <li> I found out about this through the amazing Francheska of HeyFranHey. It works great and it&#x27;s very soft. I use it to create my own body butter and it mixes well with other oils without heat. It also has a very, very light scent, which is always important to me when it comes to beauty products.</li>
    <li> I was really worried after searching around amazon and seeing some vendors selling something that wasn&#x27;t actually shea butter. But this is the real deal. Great.</li>
    <li> VERY nice product!  Fast shipping!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I finally had a chance to use this AMAZING Raw Shea Butter (with equal parts Organic Coconut Oil) to make some creams using my Essential Oils, for my little ones. I have to say, this is the second Shea Butter I have tried, and this blows away the product I previously used. It whips up into a luscious creamy, thicker, consistency, and the kids&#x27; skin is heavenly. I HIGHLY recommend this product and have even done so in the private online FB group I am in for the oils. Thanks Raw Apothecary - great stuff.</li>
    <li> After trying this product for the first time, I can see a definite improvement in my skin.  I have moderate eczema and am trying to avoid using steroids.  It takes a while to dissolve/absorb, so it helps to let it sit on your skin in order to melt a bit first, then rub it in.  This is my first time purchasing shea butter and I am quite pleased.</li>
    <li> Came really fast!  Works perfect for making homemade body butter!</li>
    <li> This is a great raw shea!!  I have used it to make several lotions already.  I will definitely​ purchase this again!</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is what I was hoping for. It is soft and creamy and spreads well. I will continue to purchase from this company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever bought shea butter one other time from my health food store, this was softer than I remembered the other being but it was a very great constancy still. Works well when heated and mixed.</li>
    <li> This is clean and the best Shea butter ever!</li>
    <li> We LOVE LOVE LOVE this shea butter!!!  We&#x27;ve used it to get through the rough winter here in the Northeast!  ABSOLUTELY 100% recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It is soft and I use it to make my hair &amp; body butter. It mixes very well with the other oils I use and I am hooked! Good quality butter... Not hard and sticky like the others...</li>
    <li> Really great shea butter! It came with a knife.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and I pretty much use just this and Weleda, arrived as expected:)  thanks so much:)</li>
    <li> wow what a great product will order again</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing! I have 4c hair and this butter combined with my essential oil and leavin conditioner is really hydrating to my hair!</li>
    <li> Smell is a little over powering...but once heated and the cooled seemed to be less intense. Texture was like wet sand...but it melted easy and was creamy and smooth after cooling.</li>
    <li> This product worked great on my natural hair, giving me a defined twist out. It also gave me soft and moisturized skin, which is great for the winter months! I definitely will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I bought it with the intension of using it on my curly, curly hair and I works so well! My hair stays shiny and hydrated for days after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say though, it has been a god send to my skin. I rub it behind my neck and my shoulders. It has become my favorite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can also melt it down and mix into anything for DIY treatments. All in all, great for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> So creamy and velvety. I would buy again and again. I used it in hair, skin, and face formulas. No breakouts and not an greasy residue on the skin. It is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Shea Butter!! I was this butter on my natural hair and my skin. This butter is very manageable compare to others.</li>
    <li> I used the Shea Butter an an ingredient in skin moisturizer. The butter melted nicely and blended with the other ingredients, I am very happy with the quality and speed of shipping!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I use Shea butter to make a body butter to massage with. (I&#x27;m a massage therapist.) I have received poor quality Shea butter before and was a little worried about trying it from someone new. Luckily, the product worked beautifully. I will be buying more very soon!</li>
    <li> High grade shea butter and easy to use</li>
    <li> Good for general use - not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of shea butter its very moisturizing and I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great stuff! I made some whipped lotion this morning and so far, so good! I loved it! It smells great - because it smells like it has no smell - just natural. I added lavender essential oils (from DoTerra...www.mydoterra.com/juliebowling) and coconut oil - whipped it up in the mixer to make a whipped body butter! Feels amazing!!! Thank you Raw Apothecary! I will definitely be purchasing another batch of this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Very excellent and high quality shea butter! I am so happy this time around because I had previously ordered this yellow stuff that I thought was shea butter but apparently isn&#x27;t a pure product.  I am excited to use this beautiful ivory butter in beauty products!</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly satisfied and have become a returning client!</li>
    <li> Just ordered this Shea butter, and I am impressed. It took a couple days to arrive because it was the holiday season I assume. The best product on Amazon compared to other sellers. After 4 days, my skin is healing very well, and I have been using this to combat cystic acne/dry winter skin. It has worked wonders! I love the wooden knife too! I just melt the butter in a mason jar and I apply it to my face after cleansing with natural aloe/shea butter soap. I use cotton swabs to prevent bacteria from entering the skin when applying to face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels softer, my tone is getting better!</li>
    <li> I bought this Shea butter to make a batch of body butters.  I noticed right away that this Shea butter was softer and fluffier than others I have purchased. This Shea butter left my body butter very gritty. For it to be so soft and clean, I believe it has to have been processes or refined in some way.</li>
    <li> This is the best Shea I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I can truly say that I love the shea butter. It&#x27;s a very high quality of shea butter  that I have tried. I haven&#x27;t mixed it up yet but I tried some on my skin and I love it. I purchased this butter because of Taren916  doing a product review.</li>
    <li> My son is 3 and I put him in swim classes for a month. I think the chlorine was too strong because his skin became dry and he started scratching a lot. I decided to buy this product for myself and a coworker and so far so good. My son&#x27;s skin has gotten smoother. This product came within 2 days, which was great as I know independent sellers can take a while to send products.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to others. My butter had no scent which was good as well.&lt;br /&gt;And unlike some people on here, I didn&#x27;t have to melt it down or mix it with something else to smoothen it. It&#x27;s extremely smooth. And yes, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shea Butter for years, before it became a huge thing. I have ordered only from Amazon and to say the least the quality has never been top of the line and it&#x27;s hard to find a good seller. This Shea Butter from Raw Apothecary is AMAZING!! It is the creamiest, richest Shea Butter I have ever purchased. I will defiantly be using them from now on!!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of Shea Butter. It&#x27;s so soft and moist and absorbs very well. There is a &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; scent, but it is not over powering at all and it fades after a short while.  My hair and skin love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Used in homemade body butters. Butter is soft and melts easily. No bark/shell left in butter.</li>
    <li> I purchased the raw mango butter, Shea butter, and the avacado butter. I made my homemade butters for my hair and body all of these products worked great and smelled awesome. I will definitely purchase my next batch from this vendor the shipment came quick and they were package nicely.</li>
    <li> Ordered two and both are grainy and weirdly discolored.</li>
    <li> I have always made my own body butter from raw shea and added oils so that I could control what was on my body; So I have used many different brands of Shea, Raw Apothecary by far is the best there is! This Raw Shea is so smooth, and so creamy you can pretty much use it as is or whip it even smoother with your choice of oils for added benefits based on your skin type. Will continue to purchase this brand. Thank you Raw Apothecary for making such an exceptional Fair Trade Shea Butter and offering it to us at a beyond decent price! Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is wonderful!!! It is packaged inside a sealed plastic bag along with a wooden knife so that you can cut into it and take what you need. This Shea butter has a great creamy consistency which makes it easy to get the amounts you need, and the little knife is so helpful! I ordered the 1 lb portion used it in lotion bars which came out lovely, and I love to tell my customers that they are made with this product. This product is top notch and so is the company. You get exactly what is described and you will love it!! I will order from them from now on. Thanks Raw Apothecary for making quality products that I can trust and get quickly.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this product. It was so rich in texture. It was perfect in my homemade body butter.</li>
    <li> Best post shave on the market</li>
    <li> I think this is true Shea butter, but it doesn&#x27;t work very well in my skin. I put it on my face at night, and my face is still dry when I wake up in the morning...</li>
    <li> I have bought this shea butter twice and I can say the quality is superior. It&#x27;s soft and easy to whip.</li>
    <li> Nice Shea Butter! Made my own body butter..love it!</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying raw shea butter but I ordered it to try making body butter and hand cream.  The product looks very clean, debris-free, and smells fresh and good quality.  Although it comes in an inner ziplock type baggie, I do wish the outer package had a zip-closure as well.  The hand &amp; nail cream turned out very well and is proving to be an excellent moisturizer during these cold and very dry winter days - and the making of it was surprisingly easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve had this product for a year now, storing it in the refrigerator, and it is still fresh. Sometimes I apply it full-strength to hands and feet at bedtime and let it work it&#x27;s magic over night. Love this stuff. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the finest shea butter you can find.</li>
    <li> Packaging is so cut comes with wooden knife to cute but I prefer a nice sharp knife to cut I love it overall</li>
    <li> If I could have selected 10 stars I would have done so. I have been using shea butter for some time as one of my absolute necessities but have not found a product as smooth and rich as this one. I did not add any essential oils to it because the smell it subtle enough just as is. It comes in a zip-locked bag and a small wooden knife for cutting. However the knife is not even necessary for the product is so soft that it literally melts in your hands. It does not have to be manipulated by heating but if you want an even smoother texture it would be easy to whip. I just love it and will buy from this seller over and over again. Oh and it is ivory colored unlike the shea butter in stores that is like that bright yellow color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s natuaral packaging I and product allworks well together.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very light , pleasant scent. Comes with a little knife. Very nice packaging. Worth every penny v</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shea butter.</li>
    <li> Work wonders for my severe eczema. I found this at just the perfect time. Thank you</li>
    <li> Lovely Shea butter....I like it plain...my hair likes it...my skin likes it.  This butter is soft and melt in your hands...rubs into skin easiky.</li>
    <li> I. Love. This. Product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Made a Shea butter cream for my hair and it was perfect, creamy and no grit! Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair and skin feel so healthy!</li>
    <li> I mix this with organic coconut oil for a great bath oil. I did notice that it becomes gritty when it cools but, that goes away once u warm it.</li>
    <li> The included wooden knife was great for cutting the shea butter.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter is the best I have ever had. I like it better than the yellow.  It is soft and smooth. I will certainly buy more. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you should.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter melts effortlessly in your hands! It has a pleasant smell and goes on smoothly without leaving a greasy feel to the skin. It is by far the best quality shea butter that I&#x27;ve ever used or purchased. I will definitely repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is so nice for your hair! Hydrates even with the dry winter air. I can&#x27;t wait to see how healthy my hair will be after using it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast delivery. made my first body butters with it and came out great.</li>
    <li> I am new to making lotions etc. and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I will be ordering more of this item. It is so soft and wonderful to work with. I love how it feels when whipped with essential oils. It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin!</li>
    <li> cant go wrong with shea butter....keep that body smooth and moisturized!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Creamy, silky, easy to use.  Perfect</li>
    <li> It arrived in such a great packaging. In terms of quality, it made a real great whipped Shea butter mix. Absolutely soft that melts into your skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome shea butter. Great quality. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> This was awesome to work with. I made chap stick with this and it worked really well</li>
    <li> I love that it has a light scent whereas others have a stronger scent that you can&#x27;t blend with essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter I&#x27;ve used in my life.</li>
    <li> Adds great strength/hardening to our soap bars. Bonus, it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of sticks and foreign objects in it like other brands.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Nicely packaged, pleasant smell, color and texture. I will be ordering this Shea butter again soon.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love raw apothecary shea butter.  Hands down it&#x27;s the best shea butter I had ever bought!</li>
    <li> I use this shea butter with cocoa butter in a lotion recipe. This stuff adds stuff a great lightness to the mixture and helps tame the smell of the cocoa butter. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very thick and creamy! Very generous amount. Leaves my skin super soft.</li>
    <li> I made a hair/body butter. It was great quality. It was packaged very nicely and looks exactly like picture.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to use! Using to make body butter and some other skin care items. Received fast and as described.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product my skin does not dry out after using this Shea butter, leaves my skin extremely soft while also allowing it to retain a great amount of moisture, this is even after showering with a antibiotic soap.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea Butter! I have tried many other brands and this is by far my favorite. It is very easy to use in the body and hair butters I make. The packaging was also great. Inside of the gold packaging is a seal-able bag as well as a wooden knife, making storage and cutting simple (not that you really need the knife because you can just use your fingers to break it apart). I will continue to use Raw Apothecary.</li>
    <li> This product is very moisturizing for the body and a very good sealant for the hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff, used it to make whipped shea butter and it was awesome! much love from the UK :)</li>
    <li> I used to purchase my butter from Nature with Love due to the quality but it was a bit $$$.  I feel head over heels for Raw Shea Butter!  The quality is nothing short of perfect.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and the product is exactly what I ordered.  It matches the picture to a T. Will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> Quality product and nice packaging for a affordable price.</li>
    <li> Great shipping time and delivery. Products were soft upon delivery but hardened after some time.</li>
    <li> PHENOMENAL quality shea butter! This is some of the best quality that I&#x27;ve ever used. It can be used straight or as a body butter when blended with other oils/butters/creams. Works very well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> great Shea butter, it so creamy and rich. I thought I was getting good shea butter until I brought this, I could believe in a shea butter being perfection! I will only buy this shea butter from now on</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, no weird odors and nice and solid but not rock hard it was easy to get a piece off for use.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for using my Young  Living oils to make my &#x27;special potions&#x27;,,,,,,love the smell!</li>
    <li> We love this product! I made Honey Lemon Body Butter.</li>
    <li> I received a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. I am in love with this shea butter. My son has eczema which makes his skin very dry and itchy. He usually scratches his skin until he bleeds. Since I started using this product his skin has been amazingly moisturized, and he&#x27;s no longer scratching!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Good sized loaf and feels great!</li>
    <li> The product came as quoted and is of very good quality. After using this shea butter I won&#x27;t turnback to another</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Comes with a wood knife, and neatly packed. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff! I bought it for soap making and as a moisturizer and im stoked on this brand. It arrived quickly and I love the little wooden knife that comes with it. A NOTE ABOUT SHEA BUTTER: Pure and unprocessed Shea butter SHOULD have a light nutty smell to it. It comes from a nut! Ignore reviewers who are giving low reviews for the smell. It&#x27;s natural and a sign that your Shea butter hasn&#x27;t gone through any weird chemical processes.</li>
    <li> I am loving this! a very small amount goes a long ways. It makes my skin feel so smooth, and make up goes on perfect and smooth over it. The smell is kind of nutty, and soothing. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> Great quality shea butter. No graininess, no inclusions (debris), melts well. The smell is a bit odd at first because of being raw and unrefined, but you get used to it. Would order again, though this will definitely last a while!</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It&#x27;s the perfect product for making lotions. I love that it does not have additives, and is so easy to use!</li>
    <li> The smell is a little rough, but it works well. I have been using it on my dry heels and my kid&#x27;s dry arms and I can see a difference right away. There weren&#x27;t any instructions or really any helpful information on the packaging as to how long it is good for or how or what to use it on.</li>
    <li> AMAZING product. Used it immediately on some skin that I typically need a steroid cream on that gets itchy and red. Within just two days of using this several times a day it is greatly improved. Nicer than coconut oil as it goes on nice and heavy and soaks in whereas coconut oil melts too much and gets messy. Can&#x27;t wait to use it in a few whipped recipes for skin care.</li>
    <li> Made some face cream with this and it is the best.</li>
    <li> This raw shea butter is great for making homemade body products. Simply mix some with some coconut or olive oil and a few drops of scented oil for a quick and easy body butter that works great for keeping your skin moisturized and soft. I used this product with some coconut oil and conditioner and made a deep conditioner for my hair. My hair felt very moisturized and healthy afterwards. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and the service was great!</li>
    <li> Good quality she butter.  Not grainy whatsoever.  As for the burn smell that some folks are complaining about... it smells like oil more than a burn smell.  Anyone that cooks will instantly recognize the smell.  I think people tend to forget that this is all natural and plant derived.... there&#x27;s going to be some sort of smell one way or another ubless artificial smelling agents are mixed in.  I recommend.  Only suggestion would be to ship in a resealable plastic bag.</li>
    <li> Great quality, soft shea butter. Received from seller when expected.</li>
    <li> Best Shea Butter I have come across in a while. One of the best on the market. I love the consistency of this raw shea butter. Absorbs to skin well and leaves a healthy glow that is not to greasy. I used it in my hair and diy leave in conditioner products. Awesome texture! Just wish it could be purchased as a package deal like 2 for 10 or 2 for 15. I bought two for roughly 30 dollars (including shipping and handling).</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff!  You can use it for so many things. You get a block similar to the one in the picture, in a bag, similar to the one in the picture.  Cut off what you need and use it.  I plan to use mine in body butter and also lip balm.  This is a good amount.  You&#x27;ll be back for more when you run out.  We didn&#x27;t even know it existed until awhile back and now we just have to have it.  Good thing it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
    <li> smells terrible, and completely difficult to use, mine was pretty off color as well. I was really hoping to love it.</li>
    <li> Pure shea at its finest the price excellent it came in raw form i can add any scent i want this is so good for massaging for pedicures you can make small batches put the rest in an air tight container.. this is a great product</li>
    <li> Good quality product and fast delivery. This was my second purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> Makes for some great lotions (I made solid lotion bars with it) and I&#x27;m going to use it for lip balm next! Great quality, easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It came in the estimated delivery time which was resonable for our area and the weather. No odd odor and color was a little darker than a creamy ivory. I use this in balms, muscle rubs and a non whipped lotion and its perfect. The only thing I didn&#x27;tlike was that it came in a plastic zipper bag. I feel that if it was in a plastic tub I would always buy this product.  The little knife that comes with it puts little holes in the bag if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> I have finally found the perfect Shea Butter!!  I must have used dozens over the years and none even come close to the results I receive with this product.  The item comes packaged in a bulk, one pound block with a cute little wooden, serrated knife to cut off the desired amount.  It arrived within two days of ordering and I was anxious to give it a try.  I melted some down and added it to an empty shampoo bottle for easy access in the shower.  I use it on my skin and hair.  Since using it, I have noticed a considerable difference in feel and look of my hair.  It is soft, shiny, and more manageable.  My skin feels hydrated and silky smooth.  I am very pleased with this Shea Butter and look forward to trying other products from Raw Apothecary.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is great.  I&#x27;m learning that I do not really like the smell of shea butter in general so to cover the smell you need to use a lot of essential oils. I&#x27;ve been using it for homemade lotions mixed with other ingredients but it seems to be a great quality.</li>
    <li> I wish this came with a recipe card, but other than that, its GREAT! Raw shea butter is so useful for so many things...</li>
    <li> Great product. I had wonderful results.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible. My mom has very dry skin so I tested it on her first, hours later her skin was still super smooth. Also a little goes a very long way. I cant wait to use this product myself.</li>
    <li> I won this shea butter in a contest and I absolutely LOVE this shea on my skin and my hair its very  moisturizing I rate this@100% certified thank you once this is gone I will order it from now on:)</li>
    <li> I ordered this for some DIY projects. It came quickly a block in a ziplock in a sealed bag so although its fall now, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to melt all over the place if you bought it in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;The butter does have a mild nutty scent which is somewhat reminiscent of playdoo funny enough. I weighed the bag and it came out exact which is nice. I hate it when places shave a half an ounce or ounce off. That guarantees I won&#x27;t buy from them again if they&#x27;re not honest.&lt;br /&gt;The butter has this almost grayish cast to it which I&#x27;ve seen before and doesn&#x27;t mean anything, it&#x27;s just a little unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;Now the texture of the butter was divine. Smooth and silky, it quickly absorbed into my skin. Excited I wanted to use it right away but since its raw, I knew that it could have bits of debris in there so I got to work to melt it down and strain it.  Well I melted it, but I didn&#x27;t have to strain it. The butter was clear as could be. I had melted it in a large wide mouth jar, so I simply turned off the stove and left it in there to cool.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it in a variety of projects and have been very pleased with the results. I&#x27;m going to keep trying different brands, to find what one I think is best, but this butter goes on the short list of ones I&#x27;d buy again.&lt;br /&gt;So why four stars you may wonder?  It&#x27;s only for the color. It is a very unattractive color. I wouldn&#x27;t want to pull this out in front of someone and start spreading it on....  Not appealing in the least. But once it&#x27;s mixed with other ingredients its not a factor at all.</li>
    <li> My hands are very dry. I ordered this hoping it would help them. I am so glad that it has helped. You only need a tiny bit. This product will last me a while. I hate the scent(I&#x27;m really sensitive to smells)but it only last a few mins. So glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> We are big fans of shea butter in our household.  We use it to make our own lotions, lotion bars and other products for our skin.  It&#x27;s gentle on skin, leaves it feeling smooth and soft and is a natural way to treat skin issues safely.  It&#x27;s rich in vitamins and hydrates skin well without leaving it to feel greasy.  What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular shea butter is, first of all, a great price for a large amount of quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shipment came quickly and was packaged nicely to prevent any damage from occurring to the product while in transit.  Though this may seem superficial to consider, I&#x27;ve had plenty of damaged products come my way over the years, so I can appreciate good packaging and prompt shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the product itself is wonderful.  It&#x27;s smooth without being grainy, it feels like a high-quality product.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my skin since i just had my second baby a week ago and am using it to help aid my stretch marks into fading.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, and I feel safe using it on myself, my daughter and anyone else in our household.  I also love that it came with its own knife for cutting the butter accordingly -- just a nice little perk.  I highly recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s looking to buy shea butter for hair, skin, etc. usages!</li>
    <li> Kinda grainy but I think that is normal, depending on what site you read.</li>
    <li> Best shea butter I&#x27;ve used; good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid shea butter user; I usually just get the yellow kind from my local beauty supply store. After hearing about this kind on YouTube, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I am already hooked! It is incredibly moisturizing, and unlike the yellow shea butter, it keeps me moisturized all day long. I&#x27;ve even used it in my hair (I&#x27;m an African American woman with thick, kinky hair) and it works wonders. It has an almost velvety texture and melts fairly easily when rubbed between your hands. I highly recommend this product for anyone who loves shea butter. Literally, the best shea butter I&#x27;ve used in my life--I will be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is pure magic. It is soft and easy manageable and smells awesome! I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is very nice Shea butter.  I made body butter with it and it turned out great!</li>
    <li> I love it in my homemade lotions.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smell is horrific but that&#x27;s 2 be expected since its in raw form.  Love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter, it works great on hair and skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it all over my body, even on my face and hair.  My skin and hair feels very smooth and soft since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve order twice so far &amp; it performs well in anything I use it in or on. It is a quality product.</li>
    <li> buy this. it is a great product on my 4c hair and skin</li>
    <li> I love this raw Shea Butter. It comes well packaged &amp; seems to be great quality &amp; very pure. Very moisturizing &amp; long lasting. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Came just as described. I used it to make lotion. Love the texture and packaging.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Shea butter on Feb 9. With Prime no rush shipping, I received it on Feb 14. It came as a block in a zip bag + a sealed bag. Just as the photos show, the package includes a wood knife as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of my daughter, I have tried the following moisturizers: Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby oil, Olive oil, SebaMed Baby Lotion, SebaMed Baby Cream, Cetaphil Skin Moisturizer (Formulated for Eczema), Eucerin Professional Repair Lotion, Eucerin Calming Cr&amp;egrave;me, Eucerin Original Healing Repair Cr&amp;egrave;me, Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched Hand Cr&amp;egrave;me, Medela Tender Care Lanolin, Aquaphor Healing Ointment (Dry, Cracked, and Irritated Skin Protectant), Laroche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5, Organic Coconut oil, Eucerin Baby Eczema Cr&amp;egrave;me, Aveeno Eczema Cream, Lucas Papaw Ointment, Raw Apothecary Unrefined Raw Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raw Apothecary Unrefined Raw Shea Butter is one of the moisturizers that I like and also helps my daughter&#x27;s Eczema, especially on the very dry area. It keeps the skin moisturized better than lotions and creams. However, in the winter time, it takes some effort to get it melts and absorbs by skin. I think this will be easier to work with in the summer time. The Shea butter has a unique smell that I cannot describe (close to nuts). I first don&#x27;t like the smell but later get used to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality Shea Butter</li>
    <li> Excellent butter great consistency. I was able to make several homemade lotions and creams that turned out beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is awesome. That is all :)</li>
    <li> Love this product! I used it to make body lotions and body butters and the consistency is very smooth.</li>
    <li> Quality ivory shea butter delivered as pictured will reorder</li>
    <li> I love Shea Butter. It can be used in so many ways. I have extra dry skin so that&#x27;s what this will be used for.</li>
    <li> Loved this shea butter! Very smooth texture! Softened my skin with daily use. I have no need for commercial lotions, being that this shea butter is loaded with nutrients for the skin! Will continue to purchase from this supplier!</li>
    <li> Nice packaging and the butter itself is beautiful quality!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this but I could not take the smell. Turns out whenever something is described as a nice &#x27;nutty&#x27; smell, I never like it. I did like the texture and can understand why it is so well loved, just not for me. Seller was great about the return. I ended up getting pure shea butter from L&#x27;Occitane. It is refined a bit but has no smell.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite Shea butter! Its smooth, creamy, and absorbs well. I&#x27;ve been buying Shea butter on Amazon for a few years and I typically order a few lbs at a time. I use it to make my own body butter. Out of all of the vendors I have purchased from, no one beats the quality of this particular Shea butter. Hands down.</li>
    <li> Great! Lighter nutty smell than yellow on bought in store!</li>
    <li> I just got my order today and when i tell you this sh--t is the business THE PACKAGING ALONE SOLD ME BUT I WILL BE GETTING MORE AND MORE OF THIS OVER AND OVER OVER ! Im hitting order as we speak !</li>
    <li> This shea butter is great! It has the typical shea butter scent, I mix it with different oils such as coconut oil, olive oil, grapeseed oil and fragrance oils. I use the mixtures on my hair and skin it works very well keeping my skin and natural unprocessed hair moisturized.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fantastic! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Used it to make my own shave butter using shea butter, coconut oil, and almond oil.</li>
    <li> First off, Arrived on time, in a timely manner. I was able to track my package and about meet it at the door. I tried some on my lips raw and it was smooth, but still solid, but softened from my body heat. Smells strong so I would recommend an essential oil if you were to use in a lip balm, or something equivalent such as myself. A solid block wrapped in plastic. With wooden knife inserted in the bag sealed paper putter, silver inside. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> So unfortunately for me I ended up loving this product. Omg its super soft and buttery! I love seeing how my electric beater cut through it like butter when I am making my Whipped Shea butter. I love how it melts right on my skin and I love how my hair drinks it up. I don&#x27;t remember my nautral hair EVER being this soft. Within 24 hrs of using this my hair changed! I swear my hair was always freaking dry! Plus i have low porosity hair so its a struggle to get that mositure in. Surprising this stuff mixed with my other ingendients does wonders. My skin loves it too! The smell was a little too much for me at first and it was something I had to get use to. No one mentioned that in their reviews! I could have used the warning but maybe they were all Raw Shea butter pros? I do notice now that I have come to like the smell and sometimes I don&#x27;t even notice it. I spoke to a member of their customer service team about the smell. In my opinion I found him to be rude so told him I would never purchase this product again. Usually I take my bans very seriously. The product is actually so good that I am willing to forget what happened and continue to purchase this product. Thats how much I love it! So unfortunately for me I won&#x27;t be blacklisting this product. Its too good to my hair! My freaking hair loves it and I love my hair so I&#x27;m doing what&#x27;s best for it even if that means going back on my word.</li>
    <li> great product, speedy delivery.  Will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! This raw Shea Butter is so creamy and feels very good on my skin like lush. I also use it to make my whipped Shea Butter mix for my hair. AMAZING!! I will be ordering another pound or 3. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this to mix with my natural oils and create a butter for my hair. let me tell you something.......this is my staple product. no ifs ands or buts. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> The most smooth in texture, light, and fluffy Shea butter ever!!  Blends well with oils in blender. Love it!</li>
    <li> Looking forward to exploring the many uses of shea butter.</li>
    <li> Good quality, Easy to put it on my tummy and can be absorbed easily.&lt;br /&gt;Reduced the tense and dryness of my skin.  Love it.</li>
    <li> High quality, great texture and makes my skin feel soft. 10/10</li>
    <li> Quality product. Does not come in reclosable container.</li>
    <li> This is my second one and I just love it! Ships fast too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely would be buying this product again. A hair guru on YouTube recommended this product to her viewers. I decided to buy and give it a try, I so far I like it. I made my own body and hair lotion with it. I suffer from dry hair and the Apothecary raw Shea butter brings moisture back in to my hair. It is also a good body butter.</li>
    <li> Good product to use for skin and hair d vm</li>
    <li> Excellent quality clean Shea butter.</li>
    <li> I made whipped shea butter mix with this product and I love it!!! Best shea butter I have ever purchased! I will be repurchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I have bought this several times now and love it! I use it to make my own lotion. It is very soft and mixes well with coconut oil, almond oil and other essential oils. It has a very raw, natural smell which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I love the way its packaged!!!</li>
    <li> Really like this shea butter. I received more than I thought I would so I was really excited to make my own hand cream. Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Terrific Shea Butter!  It served me well in making various homemade products!</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter I have purchased thus far and I have purchased a lot. I love this product and I will order again.</li>
    <li> THE BEST !! This vendor offers high quality unrefined shea butter. I tried other various vendors, but this wins hands down. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I used this as a base to make my daughters exzema cream and it&#x27;s so smooth and easy to use..I&#x27;ll be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Great quality and packaging. It smells very fresh and it comes with a cute little wooden knife to cut the shea! I whipped some of it and it was just lovely. I normally purchase from coastal scents. This is now my new source for Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality shea butter.  The butter seems fresh, has a lovely texture and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted !</li>
    <li> Exactly  what  I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
    <li> This is by far the best quality shea butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It&#x27;s butter- smooth and has less of that nutty smell than any other I&#x27;ve used. I like the simplistic packaging which I&#x27;m sure cuts down on the cost of shipping, making this product very cost-efficient. I&#x27;m also impressed with the speedy shipping- I had my product within 2 days.  I look forward to patronizing this company again.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;d like to say that this Shea Butter is the best that I&#x27;ve ordered thus far from any company.  This is truly the real deal.  The texture is very soft like clay and it does not crumble like other products have in the past.  I use this product to make my own body butter and hair moisturizer.  The product also arrived on time as promise and yes I will be ordering from Raw Apothercary in the future!</li>
    <li> Great quality!  I used this to make a shea blend for my daughter&#x27;s skin and it is very smooth.  I even made a batch for myself!  I would definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> This brand of shea butter is fantastic! It came in a nice package with a wooden knife and a re-useable bag. You can tell that the company really cares about the quality of their products. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every night, he works all day in the MN winters outside and has a dirty job so washes his hands a lot... this keeps him soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> The only shea butter we will ever buy</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and was as described. The packaging was very practical--allowing you to reseal the contents. The butter came in a ziplock bag which was contained in the paper bag visible in the image. The inclusion of a cutting tool was especially useful. Preparing the butter for my project was easy!</li>
    <li> I truly cannot say enough about this exceptional grade of Raw Shea Butter. I have been using Raw Shea Butter for over twenty years, and i have not purchased any that can be compared to this product. The aroma is mild not a smoky smell like most Shea Butters. I apply it to my natural hair as well as a skin moisturizer. I will look no further this is my go to Shea Butter!</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t even enough positives for this Shea Butter. We use it for almost anything. My daughter has moderately severe eczema and using just a small pea size amount will completely cover one arm/leg. Using this stuff daily we have seen a great improvement in her skin. It adds moisture without leaving a greasy nasty feeling or having a terrible smell like many other lotions/creams do. I really LOVE this stuff. 1 lb lasts us MONTHS and MONTHS.</li>
    <li> Great Quality &amp; very quick shipping too!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product!  Great Aroma!!</li>
    <li> Great quality and quantity!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Great for making my homemade whipped shea butter!! Also super soft and moisturizing. Would love to participate in your giveaways. Will you please send me more info on that??</li>
    <li> This has got to be one of the most exciting products I have purchased this year. That said, I am really focusing on getting chemicals out of my home, and changing to as many natural and organic options as possible. The cleaners were easily phased out, as well as scented products. I was having a hard time trying to find a good lotion solution for my family though, as the dry desert conditions constantly leave my skin rough and in need of attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved the Raw Apothecary Unrefined Shea Butter and already had a &#x27;recipe&#x27; for body butter picked out. I made a double batch, so I could make a &#x27;Valentine&#x27; gift for my mother, who also suffers from dry irritated skin. I will say that I had tried using concoctions with coconut oil before, but I was left feeling greasy. This recipe called for a carrier oil (I used Safflower), coconut oil, and Shea. It was wonderful knowing that I was only using 3 quality, natural products! The finished product was amazing, and only used about 1/3 of my Shea Butter- so this package will last for several months, easily. The shea butter really made the lotion not as greasy as my past attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the long shelf life and quality and naturalness of this product, it has definately become a staple for my household!</li>
    <li> Great Shea Butter! This worked great for making a homemade body butter.</li>
    <li> This is great quality unrefined shea butter. The texture is quite smooth and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Easy to open packaging, and product was as described. Good spread and worked wonderfully in my homemade deodorant recipe.</li>
    <li> THE BEST SO FAR THAT I HAVE TRIED.</li>
    <li> The Best Raw Apothecary Raw Shea butter I Purchased.I mix it with my Essential oils so It creates this Flawless Smooth rich Shea butter that I use for my skin, Hair also for my face and Lips and it actually healed the Dryness of my skin and chapped lips: Its worth the Hype&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Product.</li>
    <li> I really like this particular Shea butter because the smell is not so over powering like the yellow Shea butter.I used product to mix with essential oils for hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> This was my first time to purchase shea butter so I have nothing to compare it to. But, I will say I purchased it to make hand cream w/essential oils and my end result was wonderful!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. I&#x27;ve used several brands of unrefined raw shea butters and this one is by far the best. The quality and the consistency of this shea butter is superb, very creamy and it melts in your hands with no effort and applies easily to skin/hair. I love the little wooden knife it comes with, very handy and hygienic to take chunks and portion the block. Definitely will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff.  I made whipped body butter with coconut oil and its really nice.  There is still some grit/chunks with the shea butter but I don&#x27;t think I whipped it long enough.  Also, it smells a little earthy so I&#x27;m planning to re-whip to get the chunks out and add some essential oil for a different smell.  It feels amazing on my skin and keeps it so well hydrated.  I will definitely re-order this brand again.</li>
    <li> It melts into your skin making it soft as butter. It helps to lighten dark spots on the body but only a little bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Great for so many uses!</li>
