### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is an awesome product.</li>
      <li>But I have felt this gives the best coverage.</li>
      <li>This is the best beauty product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This bb cream has been the best one for me, from this brand.  </li>
      <li>THIS BB CREAM IS THE BEST for me.</li>
      <li>This product is great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am very happy with this product&#x27;s coverage.</li>
      <li>their tone is just flawless.</li>
      <li>I have tan/olive skin and it oxidizes perfectly on my face.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think this was intended to be worn alone, so I did my best to blend, apply powder (foundation powder) and than a bronzer.  </li>
      <li>Just love it!!!  </li>
      <li>and she was amazing with customer satisfaction!!</li>
      <li>It is a very good product.</li>
      <li>, I have very fair skin</li>
      <li>Both of them are great.</li>
      <li>The vendor, A-poly was great.  </li>
      <li>It blends great</li>
      <li>Skin feels great after I product is washed off,HAPPY CUSTOMER</li>
      <li>The consistency is on the thicker side (which I believe allows for great coverage).</li>
      <li>My mom, who has very light skin, also uses this product and it blends perfectly with her skin as well.  </li>
      <li>so i researched some more about all the benefits of bb creams and which ones were the best for people with acne-prone skin, and it led me to skin79&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>This has been a good product.  </li>
      <li>It stays on throughout the day and looks good after hours of wear.</li>
      <li>It smells good.</li>
      <li>I use it sometimes and it isn&#x27;t quite as good of a match for my skin tone</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is the perfect shade for me.. it does seem to go on a tiny bit lighter, but as soon as you apply it, it&#x27;s invisible and matches your skin tone perfectly.</li>
      <li>Great product, at an even greater price!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I started out with the Skin79 Oriental Gold Plus, and while I loved the coverage, texture, and the lip/cheek tint that came in the cap, it really wasn&#x27;t the best formula for my skin type</li>
      <li>I really really love this Balm!</li>
      <li>It worked better for that!</li>
      <li>all i have to say, is that this bb cream is absolutely amazing--</li>
      <li>This is a truly amazing product and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
      <li>I really love that it has sort of a greyish undertone to it, because I feel it does a good job at neutralizing my redness.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i guess anything can happen with makeup and water :P which reminds me, this stuff is relatively easy to get off with a makeup removing wipe.</li>
      <li>but i guess anything can happen with makeup and water :P which reminds me, this stuff is relatively easy to get off with a makeup removing wipe.</li>
      <li>however, it does a good job at masking  most blemishes along with most discoloration and redness&lt;</li>
      <li>so was surprised that this product was so wonderful I have switched forever.  </li>
      <li>This BB cream evened out my skin and nicely covered most of my breakouts and scarring.</li>
      <li>I believe the quality of this brand is great (even this product is - for the right person).</li>
      <li>The main reason i bought this was to maintain a shine free face and it works great !</li>
      <li>I have very light skin keep in mind</li>
      <li>I love this and would totally buy another :D</li>
      <li>I set the BB cream with some pressed powder just to give it an even more matte finish and to ensure it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I hope that explains how light it is!</li>
      <li>and it seems to be authentic</li>
      <li>Everyone should try it, I simply love it</li>
      <li>I like to use my BareMineral matte powder to top it off.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
      <li>but I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>Maybe in the winter with the dryer colder air it will work better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to give this brand one more try.</li>
      <li>hope this review helped! :)</li>
      <li>(i love the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s 3 1/2 months of this fantastic bb cream!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure I will buy this again</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>It also works well with my sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t get all cakey when it&#x27;s applied on top.</li>
      <li>- it goes on very smooth, minimizes the appearance of large pores and has good coverage.</li>
      <li>the whole concept of bb cream is to be honest!</li>
      <li>so i came onto amazon, found i, bought it, and began using it the day after i received it in the mail because i was so excited!</li>
      <li>I ordered it from Amazon not even sure I was going to receive a genuine product or a counterfeit.</li>
      <li>i used to use almay&#x27;s clear complexion foundation, and it wasn&#x27;t doing that great of a job on my pesky skin.</li>
      <li>and it does a fair job of keeping the shine at bay much longer than anything else</li>
      <li>The best beauty balm ever, perfect coverage, a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>The coverage is strong, at the level of pancake make-up.  </li>
      <li>* August 2015 Still going strong with my BB cream, it&#x27;s truly the holy grail of BB creams.</li>
      <li>i will continue buying this due to its outstanding performance, incredible value, reliability, and affordability</li>
      <li>i will continue buying this due to its outstanding performance, incredible value, reliability, and affordability</li>
      <li>and it blends in fine.  </li>
      <li>but I just mix it with my gold bb cream and it is fine.</li>
      <li>have mildly oily skin, mostly in my t-zone.</li>
      <li>I use a concealer under my eyes, around my nose, and then to cover any acne, and that, paired with my Intense Classic, is a perfect, super quick and easy face routine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Might be way too light for some people</li>
      <li>it would probably be too light.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something to put on daily as a moisturizer/foundation this is a great balm.</li>
      <li>By the end of the day without reapplying (and even with foundation/powder over) it looks like I had no makeup on at all - it is kind of slippery (?) and doesn&#x27;t seem to stay put very well.</li>
      <li>Light to medium coverage and lasted for 7+ hours with continual blotting throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I have oily sensitive, acne prone skin and have been looking for something that has good coverage that doesnt help break me out.</li>
      <li>i wish it had better coverage for evening out skin tone, but i am glad it is not heavy and cakey.</li>
      <li>Love this product, covers great without feeling heavy, will order again.</li>
      <li>A nice light covering that makes your skin look more even and gives you the look of moisture vesus the dry look some balms produce.  </li>
      <li>used to use Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay foundation for years and years, and I still like to use that for special occasions because it literally acts exactly the same as my Intense Classic, just with a slightly more &#x27;airbrushed&#x27; perfect finish.</li>
      <li>it feels pretty light weight and looks smooth.</li>
      <li>If you use the pink one it is a little thicker and will give you a more flawless finish that you would probably like better for a night out.</li>
      <li>I really liked the pink skin 79 BB cream, and as always thought I&#x27;d try another skin 79 product to see if it was even better.</li>
      <li>And my skin is quite fair (LOVING the SPF 35), with a lot of redness, pinky undertones, and some acne scarring as well as breakouts at least once a month.</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t do that though, it works really well to keep my skin from becoming oily.</li>
      <li>and i didnt look so light from the first application.</li>
      <li>, this bb cream by skin79 is amazing, and i hope they never discontinue the intense classic formulation or change the formula--</li>

      <li>I am still experimenting with how I can use this for my benefit,  but honestly, I will more than likely not buy this again, since it is clearly too light for me</li>
      <li>I am in love with it and cannot live without this product.</li>
      <li>i knew this before i bought it the first time, and i didn&#x27;t care really because i figured i could just put elf&#x27;s mineral foundation on top to try and match my correct color of mineral foundation to my skin tone.</li>
      <li>This is a good cream, it is just a little to light for me.</li>
      <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like as much about this BB cream is that it&#x27;s not as bright as the one I used before.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at this since I have a ruddy complexion and always feel like I need more coverage.</li>
      <li>I look dewy fresh.  </li>
      <li>i use this with the concealer and with elf&#x27;s mineral powder foundation, as a kind of setting powder/re-coloring powder (i&#x27;ll explain this later).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really liked the pink skin 79 BB cream, and as always thought I&#x27;d try another skin 79 product to see if it was even better. This one is very thick and cakey. I actually tossed the entire tube. It just made my face look like I was wearing skintone clown makeup!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have always been a Lancome girl so was surprised that this product was so wonderful I have switched forever.  This product makes my skin feel supple.  Just love it!!!  Going to try some of the other products in this line up.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product because it started to clog my pores. I have hormonal acne on my chin ONLY and I started to breakout on my cheeks. I was very disappointed since the reviews were OK for the bb cream, but I guess everybody has a different reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Also the finish of the bb cream is shiny and I did not like that at all, I much rather where foundation.</li>
    <li> I mix this with a little bit of my luminizer and a little bit of the Skin79 Gold BB Cream to make the perfect summer time tinted BB with a little more SPF and coverage. It is definitely thicker than the Gold BB but not as thick as the Orange BB, it&#x27;s like just right in between. I don&#x27;t like using it alone, it&#x27;s just too thick, slightly cakey on my skin if I use it alone... it&#x27;s better to mix with the other BB if you want the Pink or Gold BB to have just a tad more coverage.</li>
    <li> I really really love this Balm!</li>
    <li> This is a good cream, it is just a little to light for me.</li>
    <li> I have used the Skin79&#x27;s products for over 6 months, and have noticed a real difference in my skin. My redness has almost disappeared, my skin is smoother and my age spots have diminished.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had troubled, oily skin with some scaring and this product is amazing. You can regulate the intensity by how it is applied. If u like more coverage, dab it on your trouble spots for more coverage. I like to use my BareMineral matte powder to top it off.&lt;br /&gt;Look for the &amp;#34;lightening&amp;#34; in BB creams, that&#x27;s the secret! U.S. products are usually lacking this ingredient and when u find it, its 3 to 4 more expensive than Skin79. The Koreans did it right. Great product, at an even greater price!&lt;br /&gt;And shipment was fast!</li>
    <li> The color is darker than most BB and has a thicker consistency, so there was a little more coverage which was what I was gong for but this too broke me out... I&#x27;m going to give this brand one more try. If it doesn&#x27;t work out, we&#x27;ll have to break up permanently...so much disappointment :(</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Really good coverage especially for dark circles&lt;br /&gt;Cheap ($13-15 on ebay including shipping)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Good oil control (I have oily skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can be cakey if not blended right&lt;br /&gt;Might be way too light for some people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really oily skin and I&#x27;ve tried a few BB creams already and this is one that&#x27;s working really well for me in oily control. This is great for concealing dark circles because it&#x27;s on the thick side. The problem with it being thick is that it can be a little hard to blend and the color is pretty light so it might not match your skin tone.</li>
    <li> Exactly how seller described but it makes my face break out: I usually use the orange label skin 79. Maybe in the winter with the dryer colder air it will work better</li>
    <li> I had previously used the Skin 79 Super plus BB cream and liked it but found that my forehead got sort of greasy by the end of  the day and the coverage wore off after a couple of hours. I have combination skin and am very pale so finding a color match is always difficult for me with any makeup. The first time I used this my husband even commented and said how even my skin looked. It stayed all day and my forehead didn&#x27;t get greasy. I actually purchased this and Skinceuticals Blemish + Age defense b/c my skin was breaking out this month. This BB cream evened out my skin and nicely covered most of my breakouts and scarring. I used Bare minerals concealer and touch up veil to finish. It looked and felt like almost no make up at all. Love it and I will keep buying this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other SKIN79 products and BB creams and this cream is way too pasty/thick and doesn&#x27;t blend well.  I like medium to heavy coverage, but this product is just has a weird consistency.  Plus the color doesn&#x27;t oxidize as well as the other SKIN79 creams.  It makes me look washed out.  Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> The box was pretty smashed but it arrived fast and it seems to be authentic it is missing the instructions though. The seal and everything was intact so i think its new.</li>
    <li> I made a change to this for summer, it is lighter than the normal skin 79 bb, but it works for my 40, almost 50 something year old face.</li>
    <li> This was just a little white for my skin tone (medium Asian tone). I have oily skin and without moisturizer this accentuates dry patches. Light to medium coverage and lasted for 7+ hours with continual blotting throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This has been a good product.  The vendor, A-poly was great.  The shipping estimate was three weeks, but I got it within a week or so, and it came all the way from Korea.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the real thing and not an imitation.  I have very pale skin and it blends in fine.  It is a little thick and actually has a bit more coverage than I would prefer so sometimes I will mix it with some regular moisturizer.  If I don&#x27;t do that though, it works really well to keep my skin from becoming oily.</li>
    <li> I have oily sensitive, acne prone skin and have been looking for something that has good coverage that doesnt help break me out. This stuff is my personal miracle!! It blends really nicely and it covers extremely well..... I am in love with it and cannot live without this product. I purchased from Katie the Babe and she was amazing with customer satisfaction!! I have given up on foundation and this has forever taken its place in my makeup routine.</li>
    <li> This is the best beauty product I have ever used. I have very light skin keep in mind, I am a ginger who has a few freckles and I like to even my skin tone out a bit with foundation but I freakin hate foundation because it&#x27;s too heavy it looks cakey and gets all up in my pre emergent not quite there yet wrinkles and makes me look like old. I have tried bb  creams as substitute for the foundation and they just don&#x27;t cover anything. I mean seriously it would be better to just wear sunscreen then the maybeline brand bb cream. THIS BB CREAM IS THE BEST for me. If you don&#x27;t have light skin, I mean vanilla white skin it would probably be too light. For those who have the same problem as me and can&#x27;t find a foundation that doesn&#x27;t make a distinct line between your face and neck making your face look orange, this is for you. It blends great, you don&#x27;t need to use much to get decent coverage, it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or gross on your skin like foundation, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like most nasty American foundations. It lasts all day without giving breakouts and makes your skin look awesome and healthy, a healthy glow rather then a nasty caked on look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have light ish skin but can get away with the classic light foundation of most beauty brands without it being too dark for your skin tone, give BB Petit a try. It smells good. It covers good, a little bit goes a long way and is a bit darker then this cream. I use it sometimes and it isn&#x27;t quite as good of a match for my skin tone but I love the way it makes my skin feel. It is a very good product. Give either product a try and you will never look back.</li>
    <li> The best beauty balm ever, perfect coverage, a little goes a long way. I am hispanic and it blends into your skin tone after applying it. Please buy it!!! I have very dry, T zone oily skin. I will keep on buying it. ****Update**** August 2015 Still going strong with my BB cream, it&#x27;s truly the holy grail of BB creams. Everyone should try it, I simply love it and I have tried several BB and CC creams.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fresh natural airbrush finish. For lighter skin tones. Delivered on time!</li>
    <li> i was a little worried at first because i heard it was a light color but i found out after applying it, it actually started belending into my skin and i didnt look so light from the first application. I also feel it may only appear really light if you apply to much and a little goes a long way for this product. The main reason i bought this was to maintain a shine free face and it works great ! It doesnt feel cakey infact it feels pretty light weight and looks smooth. I love this and would totally buy another :D</li>
    <li> I fell in love with BB Cream after hearing about it from a Japanese makeup blog. I started out with the Skin79 Oriental Gold Plus, and while I loved the coverage, texture, and the lip/cheek tint that came in the cap, it really wasn&#x27;t the best formula for my skin type (it&#x27;s more for dry, mature, skin, and I have oily skin). This one has the same consistency and texture but it&#x27;s made for oily skin. I find that my face stays pretty matte for a few hours with this, and it has REALLY great coverage. Also, it&#x27;s cheaper than the Oriental Gold Plus. And I don&#x27;t have to miss the lip/cheek tint because I have a lot of it left over from old tubes. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like as much about this BB cream is that it&#x27;s not as bright as the one I used before. It&#x27;s a BB cream, so it&#x27;s pale, but it&#x27;s slightly darker than most.</li>
    <li> Love this product, covers great without feeling heavy, will order again.Skin feels great after I product is washed off,HAPPY CUSTOMER</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews and contacting the seller because I have oily/combination skin and this was recommended for me, I like the coverage, it&#x27;s easier to apply than foundation but it was created for Asiatic woman and I looked so pale when used so I cover with loose powder, Im going to use it as corrective cream and I will contact seller if they have a color that would be better to my brazilian white tone skin....I like the brand and I received in 10 days instead of 4 weeks that they said....</li>
    <li> This is the first BB cream I have used so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to in that regard. I do like it, I have very fair skin and it worked with my complexion. I like the consistency - it goes on very smooth, minimizes the appearance of large pores and has good coverage. I was surprised at this since I have a ruddy complexion and always feel like I need more coverage. On quite a few occasions I have used it in place of foundation. However, I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because I noticed that it does not seem to last well. By the end of the day without reapplying (and even with foundation/powder over) it looks like I had no makeup on at all - it is kind of slippery (?) and doesn&#x27;t seem to stay put very well. This may be due to the fact that my skin type is oily? Not sure, but I wish this weren&#x27;t the case since I really like everything else about it.</li>
    <li> I took a leap of faith when I ordered this product. It was my first BB cream and my first Asian beauty product as well! I ordered it from Amazon not even sure I was going to receive a genuine product or a counterfeit. But, to my relief, in a couple of weeks it arrived and, compared to images online, I had the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mildly oily skin, mostly in my t-zone. And my skin is quite fair (LOVING the SPF 35), with a lot of redness, pinky undertones, and some acne scarring as well as breakouts at least once a month. This product only comes in one shade, but luckily it matched mine quite well. I really love that it has sort of a greyish undertone to it, because I feel it does a good job at neutralizing my redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product&#x27;s coverage. I use a concealer under my eyes, around my nose, and then to cover any acne, and that, paired with my Intense Classic, is a perfect, super quick and easy face routine. I set the BB cream with some pressed powder just to give it an even more matte finish and to ensure it lasts all day. It combats my oilyness very well, only needing a touch up by late afternoon if I happen to be going out again (I usually apply around 8:15am.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay foundation for years and years, and I still like to use that for special occasions because it literally acts exactly the same as my Intense Classic, just with a slightly more &#x27;airbrushed&#x27; perfect finish. However, my Intense Classic has taken over as my daily &#x27;foundation&#x27; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use maybe a pea size and a half, depending on how many imperfections I&#x27;m focusing on. It dries slowly, so you have a lot of time to blend it out and cover everything. I just use my finger to apply and blend it. It&#x27;s also fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has never broken me out, and it leaves my skin looking so great for such little effort! I&#x27;m only giving the product 4 stars because it&#x27;s inconvenient to order online, it only comes in one shade (though that doesn&#x27;t affect me personally,) and I do feel like it&#x27;s necessary to set it with a powder to get that perfect matte finish (unless that isn&#x27;t your thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing this!in one shade (though that doesn&#x27;t affect me personally,) and I do feel like it&#x27;s necessary to set it with a powder to get that perfect matte finish (unless that isn&#x27;t your thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing this!</li>
    <li> not bad, but the tint is a little too light for my face.  i wish it had better coverage for evening out skin tone, but i am glad it is not heavy and cakey.</li>
    <li> A nice light covering that makes your skin look more even and gives you the look of moisture vesus the dry look some balms produce.  It stays on throughout the day and looks good after hours of wear.</li>
    <li> A little tiny bit goes a LOOOOONG way. I mean really.. a dab smaller than a pea will cover your whole face completely. It has such good coverage, it completely evens out your skin tone. It&#x27;s very, very thick, but still spreads and blends beautifully. I prefer the Skin 79 in the pink container because the coverage isn&#x27;t as heavy. But if you have any blemish problems, very uneven skin tone, freckles, scars etc, this product is for you. I set mine with powder as I don&#x27;t like the dewy look because I have very oily skin. I layer some Murad mattifier under this, and then set with a mattifying powder and it does a fair job of keeping the shine at bay much longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;It is the perfect shade for me.. it does seem to go on a tiny bit lighter, but as soon as you apply it, it&#x27;s invisible and matches your skin tone perfectly. I have let my daughters use it, and we are all differently complected, and you can&#x27;t tell they&#x27;re wearing it.. their tone is just flawless. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. The coverage is good and a little goes a long way. The color is odd (yellow/ flat nude) but I just mix it with my gold bb cream and it is fine.</li>
    <li> I used to order the Skin79 cream directly from the North American distributor, but I realized it&#x27;s actually a little bit cheaper here. I bought two of these as I really like the coverage and I know it will help with my very sensitive skin. This is by far the only product that can match exactly to my skin tone (extremely pale due to allergy with the sun) and keep me protected. It also works well with my sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t get all cakey when it&#x27;s applied on top. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i used to use almay&#x27;s clear complexion foundation, and it wasn&#x27;t doing that great of a job on my pesky skin. so one night i was doing some research about foundations and tinted moisturizers for comination/acne-prone skin, and i accidentally stumbled upon bb creams. so i researched some more about all the benefits of bb creams and which ones were the best for people with acne-prone skin, and it led me to skin79&#x27;s website. i used their diagnostic chart to determine which bb cream would be appropriate for my skin needs, and i ended up choosing the intense classic balm. so i came onto amazon, found i, bought it, and began using it the day after i received it in the mail because i was so excited! all i have to say, is that this bb cream is absolutely amazing-- the whole concept of bb cream is to be honest! i think i started using my first tube of this in the latter part of september, and i literally just finished the tube two days ago. that&#x27;s 3 1/2 months of this fantastic bb cream! now i&#x27;m onto my next tube :) it covers nearly everything--though i still do have to use a concealer to cover some of those stubborn blemishes or marks (i love the [[ASIN:B002MJHI0M Maybelline New York Super Stay 24Hr Concealer, Cream 720, 0.18 Fluid Ounce]] because it stays on even during swim practice or while i&#x27;m at the beach or gym--through workouts and hot days, anything basically). i use this with the concealer and with elf&#x27;s mineral powder foundation, as a kind of setting powder/re-coloring powder (i&#x27;ll explain this later). like previous reviews stated, a little goes a long way. i usually use about 2 pea sized dots to cover my face and maybe half a pea sized dot for my neck if i have forgotten to blend it down... another thing is that i use my fingers to blend this in. i use a patting motion to achieve moderate-full coverage on days where my skin is looking terrible. on days where i don&#x27;t have to worry about my acne as much, i&#x27;ll use about 1 pea and a half to cover almost everything, and it will look nice and concealed. i also sometimes use a wedge makeup sponge to blend the bb cream around my nose and eyes, and it looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are two minor reasons i gave it 4 out of 5 stars though..... mayyyyyybe 3 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) it doesn&#x27;t completely cover all of my blemishes, but then again, i&#x27;m a teenage girl with recurring mild-moderate acne... however, it does a good job at masking  most blemishes along with most discoloration and redness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) since there is only one shade of this, with no range of skin tones to choose from, like US-based company&#x27;s new bb cream lines have, it takes a little while to adjust to your proper skin tone (maybe 10-20 minutes tops). i knew this before i bought it the first time, and i didn&#x27;t care really because i figured i could just put elf&#x27;s mineral foundation on top to try and match my correct color of mineral foundation to my skin tone. this method has been working for me so far, but i just wish i could put the bb cream on along with concealer and then go, you know what i mean? it would just save a little time in the morning and i wouldn&#x27;t have to take as long to get ready.. but oh well, you can&#x27;t have it all i guess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and 3) (this really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal though concerning how the cream works) i love this so much, i wish i could just drive over to target or rite aid and pick it up like most other drugstore foundations. i wish i didn&#x27;t have to order it online and pay shipping and handling and then wait another week or so for it to arrive. it kind of sucks having to wait, but then again it&#x27;s always fun receiving a package in the mail-- even if you knew it was already coming :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another test this bb cream is going to have to stand up to is swim season... i&#x27;m on my HS swim team and practices are going to be starting in february, and we&#x27;ll see how it stands up to being worn throughout the day and then being worn in a chlorinated pool for 2-3 hours haha. hopefully it willstay on and not wash off-- but i guess anything can happen with makeup and water :P which reminds me, this stuff is relatively easy to get off with a makeup removing wipe. i use target&#x27;s up and up brand of makeup removing wipes and then wash my face like i normally would and everything comes off. so if you&#x27;re having trouble with removing this, i suggest just going out and getting some makeup remover wipes and then using them before your normal skin care regiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, this bb cream by skin79 is amazing, and i hope they never discontinue the intense classic formulation or change the formula-- i will continue buying this due to its outstanding performance, incredible value, reliability, and affordability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope this review helps make your decision easier if you&#x27;re on the fence about this product-- at least give it a shot! you might be pleasantly surprised, especially if you&#x27;re willing to put in a little extra effort to match your shade with a powder foundation :)stay on and not wash off-- but i guess anything can happen with makeup and water :P which reminds me, this stuff is relatively easy to get off with a makeup removing wipe. i use target&#x27;s up and up brand of makeup removing wipes and then wash my face like i normally would and everything comes off. so if you&#x27;re having trouble with removing this, i suggest just going out and getting some makeup remover wipes and then using them before your normal skin care regiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, this bb cream by skin79 is amazing, and i hope they never discontinue the intense classic formulation or change the formula-- i will continue buying this due to its outstanding performance, incredible value, reliability, and affordability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope this review helps make your decision easier if you&#x27;re on the fence about this product-- at least give it a shot! you might be pleasantly surprised, especially if you&#x27;re willing to put in a little extra effort to match your shade with a powder foundation :)</li>
    <li> This is a truly amazing product and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I&#x27;ve used very expensive designer foundations in the past and this product blows them all away.  I have tan/olive skin and it oxidizes perfectly on my face.  My mom, who has very light skin, also uses this product and it blends perfectly with her skin as well.  I put a pea-sized amount on my finger tips, rub them together, and then apply to my face like lotion.  If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this product do it, you have nothing to lose for the price and potentially a lot to gain!</li>
    <li> I gave this a three star rating only because it is incredibly light and on the colder/grey side. When I first applied it, I used the same amount as I do with my BB cream - not much at all. When I applied it onto my face in normal BB cream fashion, I looked like a Maiko (someone in training to be a Geisha) for those who don&#x27;t know what that is. I can also liken it to my gothic days, where I would purposely apply white face makeup. I hope that explains how light it is! I didn&#x27;t think this was intended to be worn alone, so I did my best to blend, apply powder (foundation powder) and than a bronzer.  It kind of worked, but when I used it again, I used a lot less and only applied to dark circles. It worked better for that! So, definitely not for whole face! Unless.... you have a slightly darker foundation and use it as a face primer. That&#x27;s a lot of work though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to coverage, of let&#x27;s say, dark circles - it covers well. The consistency is on the thicker side (which I believe allows for great coverage). I am still experimenting with how I can use this for my benefit,  but honestly, I will more than likely not buy this again, since it is clearly too light for me (I can use a MAC NW25, just to give you guys an idea of my skin tone). I believe the quality of this brand is great (even this product is - for the right person).</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the color of my skin. I have moderate acne due to hormonal break outs, so my complexion is very uneven with hyperpigmentation and scaring. Since I bought this, which to my surprise was delivered earlier than I&#x27;d expected, I&#x27;ve been using it daily just for treating the red spots and I&#x27;ve noticed how much smaller and lighter the spots have become. I personally prefer to use this as a concealer because the color doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone (which explains the 4 stars) and I initially wanted to use it as treatment to lighten my dark spots as well as cover them up. All in all I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I&#x27;m sure I will buy this again when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! Just a side note, I&#x27;ve also been using 100% aloe vera gel as a night treatment for my dark spots, too. So, if anyone out there is having trouble with dark spots and is thinking of buying this, they should also try using aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helped! :)</li>
    <li> Seriously.  I have struggled with agressive acne since puberty.  My dermatologist and I have been around the merry go round many times.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month, only a few pimples have appeared during this time, my old scars are all almost gone.  When I wake up in the morning, I look in the mirror and almost hesitate to put on make up now, my face looks even, it glows, redness is gone!  The coverage is strong, at the level of pancake make-up.  This is typical BB cream, it goes on grey but oxidizes and blends right in.  I look dewy fresh.  I am sold for life.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I tried this and the pink skin79 BB cream. Both of them are great. The pink one I leave at home for when i do my makeup before i go out. This one i take with me in my travel makeup bag. It is a good size and you only need to use half of a dime size in order to cover your face. I did notice that this produce blended a little better than the pink one and had more a &amp;#34;true to skin tone&amp;#34; color. I know that some people have said that the pink one is a little whiter in color than the classic balm, this is true, but both blend in wonderfully so there really is no difference. The only thing i will say is that this is definitely lighter than the pink balm. If you are looking for something to put on daily as a moisturizer/foundation this is a great balm. If you use the pink one it is a little thicker and will give you a more flawless finish that you would probably like better for a night out. I say get both, ordering two of these balms costs way less than one BB cream at sephora.</li>
    <li> This bb cream has been the best one for me, from this brand.  I have tried the white one and the pink one. But I have felt this gives the best coverage. Especially since I was on accutane while using it.</li>
