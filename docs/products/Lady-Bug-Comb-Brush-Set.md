      <li>The bristles are very soft for baby heads!</li>
      <li>They can&#x27;t really appreciate the bug design at that age, and by the time they can, its completely inappropriate for their hair.</li>

      <li>Might work on my 2 year old when he has a buzz cut...</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 6 month old, and I need to just put it in the trash.</li>
      <li>The comb is also soft, I certainly wouldnt violently run it through my newborns scalp, but with a gentle stroke it works just fine!</li>
      <li>The brush is soft enough for a younger infant and the comb has just enough teeth to tame lots of wild hair that tends to stick up and out!</li>

<li> you should brush hard anyways.</li>
<li> i am surprised to see bad reviews.</li>

    <li> Very cute, my 2-year-old granddaughter loves them and so does her mom. For the price, this is a very good value.</li>
    <li> Brush is not suitable for newborn. It is too stiff and could hurt baby&#x27;s skin. The brush given by hospital is alot softer.</li>
    <li> def worth the buy. i am surprised to see bad reviews. of course why would you brush your babys skin? its for her hair! they need exfoliation  on their scalp you should brush hard anyways. def a very adorable buy!</li>
    <li> The Sassy Lady Bug comb and brush set is super cute!  The bristles on the brush are very soft and the comb is a good length.  My daughter likes to play with the set and I love doing her hair with them!</li>
    <li> This soft brush and fine toothed comb are great for my baby&#x27;s delicate hair. The comb was even gentle enough to help me rid her scalp of cradle cap without causing her any pain or crying. And the set is cute to boot!</li>
    <li> We bought this because we thought it would make a good toy/hair brush.  The bristles are much too hard and close together to comb fine baby hair.  It doesn&#x27;t even do a good job on grown-up hair.  The baby likes to grab it and wave it around, but that is all we can say that is good about this brush.</li>

    <li> This is absolutely adorable - very nice quality and a steal as far as the price.  I never expected to receive such a nice product but my little grandaughter loves lady bugs and I knew she would like it.</li>
    <li> These are cute and great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the tines of the comb are very close together, making it tricky to comb through long hair. I think a comb for small kids/babies should have larger tines. Overall, though, I&#x27;m very happy with this set of products.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter loves this set. The colors are bright and fun and just the right size for your hand. Plus, it is durable and the bristles are just right for a 2 year old&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old grew over night. The baby brushes were not working for her hair anymore. So I purchased these because I knew she would love the lady bug. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t pull on her hair. Plus, it&#x27;s easy for her to hold in her hand. She&#x27;s learning to brush her own hair.</li>
    <li> This is perfect to use on my 1 year old great grandson.  He loves that it looks like a ladybug and worm and it works great on his hair.  They are both well made and in pretty colors.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it was nice and it said that the bristles are soft and for 0 months! This is NOT true. I comb my baby&#x27;s hair soflty and after that his skin was red and a bit irritated. Please DO NOT buy this product!</li>
    <li> Very cute, love the comb, but bristles on the brush are too soft for anything but tiny baby hair. In my opinion that&#x27;s a missed demographic in the design. They can&#x27;t really appreciate the bug design at that age, and by the time they can, its completely inappropriate for their hair. The comb is terrific though.</li>
    <li> Got these to use on my cats and they love the brush on their faces.</li>
    <li> Looks cute and colorful.  Brush is not bad. Comb bristles are way thin/sharp/hard for adults, let alone a baby.  Will be returning the set.</li>
    <li> The comb is too fine and pulls at my babies hair. The brush is okay but is almost too stiff with too many bristles to do anything. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is really a cute product.  It is adorable!  The brush is soft enough for a younger infant and the comb has just enough teeth to tame lots of wild hair that tends to stick up and out!</li>
    <li> I have used both the brush and the comb on our newborn.  The bristles on the brush are so soft, he likes the massage, and it helps rid his head of the cradle cap.  The comb is also soft, I certainly wouldnt violently run it through my newborns scalp, but with a gentle stroke it works just fine!</li>
    <li> Very pretty but space between the comb is too close which makes it had for the hair to go through without hurting the baby.  if your infant has lots of hair at birth he or she can&#x27;t use the comb for more than a few weeks after birth. The lines between the comb are just too close.</li>
    <li> It  have lovely modelling and color is rich.My baby love it,often into her mouth.I guess it comb very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;by use it.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my 2 month old granddaughter, and it is almost as cute as she is! One reviewer said it was TOO soft.  I thought it was just right. Everything we found in stores was much too stiff for a baby&#x27;s head. I did find another brush online that was softer than this, but in my opinion THAT was too soft. We couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> It look super cute. I bought it for my niece and my sister and niece love it. The brush is too rough. Not sure it can be used on baby skin and adults skin too for that matter. I give it 3 because Brissles are too harsh</li>
    <li> I love the fact that the tines of the comb form a curve that follows the contours of my daughter&#x27;s head. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m raking her scalp. It&#x27;s also pretty ergonomic and easy to hold. It&#x27;s cute, but I more appreciate the function of it!&lt;br /&gt;The brush is too soft to be of any use. I have had it since she was born and no matter what stage her hair was in, it never did anything.&lt;br /&gt;A previous reviewer says that her child loves to \\&quot;play\\&quot; with the brush. I don&#x27;t let my daughter run around with pens, her toothbrush, spoons, or anything else that could jam itself in the back of her throat if she fell, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a toy at this stage (19 mo). I still have it, so that maybe she can use it for a doll&#x27;s hair or something when she&#x27;s a little older.</li>
    <li> I love this set, and the kids love to look at one while I brush their hair with the other, super adorable.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to brush her hair with these fun items!  She likes the lady bug brush especially.  The bristles are very soft for baby heads!</li>
    <li> These are higher quality than some out there, and they are cuter in person than online. The brush is soft and will surely work well on my coming wee one.</li>
    <li> The design is very cute, vivid color and medium soft brush. Quality is very good. My son loves to wash himself using this brush.</li>
    <li> These items are awesome. The brush has soft bristles, both are brightly colored, cute design on both the brush and comb.</li>
    <li> what can i say...cute as a bug...price was great, they are very cute, perfect for my grandchild (bedroom decorated in ladybugs)</li>
    <li> We bought this set for our little girl, This is a very cute set and the brush is soft so it doesn&#x27;t hurt baby&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Granddaughter she loves it it arrived at her home right on time i would recomend this to anyone</li>
