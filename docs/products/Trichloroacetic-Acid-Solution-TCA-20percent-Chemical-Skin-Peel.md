### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am impressed!  </li>
      <li>The service was awesome i bought it friday</li>
      <li>I will buy this again &lt;3</li>
      <li>Excellent for removing blemishes!</li>
      <li>This is a medium peel that has worked perfect for removal of my outter dermis.</li>
      <li>Light frosting provides the best results.</li>
      <li>but this is a good strength for peeling - again</li>
      <li>/&gt;Invest in a good moisturizer too.</li>
      <li>The company I used was awesome too, they where really quick.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the product .</li>
      <li>nice I liked</li>
      <li>Nice reliable product.</li>
      <li>I got a nice frost within that time.  </li>
      <li>i bought the 20% for my face and the 50% for my tattoo although i haven&#x27;t used that one yet and honestly</li>
      <li>This 20% is good and strong.</li>
      <li>but it had done more in just two applications than this solution.</li>
      <li>Otherwise you&#x27;ll just do more damage to your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But when the peeling was gone, I was left with beautiful skin!  </li>
      <li>I will continue to purchase from Erlenmeyer&#x27;s as I am satisfied with their quality of product.  </li>
      <li>So far, this stuff has worked great for me.</li>
      <li>my sister paid 25 bucks for a 8% solution from another website and honestly i ordered two different concentrations for less than that :) which is awesome</li>
      <li>Made my skin clear and nice..</li>
      <li>This is a very potent facial peel.  </li>
      <li>and it seems like every time i do a peel my skin clears up even more and considering how self conscious i was about my skin</li>
      <li>If you know how to use peels properly, then you would know this product works effectively.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast .</li>
      <li>Really a good size and product, yes its very small but its cheap</li>
      <li>THIS DID NOT WORK FOR ME - VERY DISSAPOINTED!</li>
      <li>My face feels softer and my cheeks are starting to look a lot better.</li>
      <li>Always wear sunscreen and if possible a large hat or scarf to block the sunlight from touching your face.</li>
      <li>This strength doesn&#x27;t really do much for skin tags, so will also be getting the higher strength along the way for that,</li>
      <li>oh youll just go to the higher strength straight off the bat; ive used TCA peels for years, and still wont use stronger than 20% on my face.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t speak for anyone else&#x27;s TCA, but this is my experience with this particular company and my first with TCA.</li>
      <li>really acne prone skin which is why i even tried this</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m really grateful for this product and</li>
      <li>Thanks....</li>
      <li>This solutions did absolutely nothing for my wart after two weeks of applying it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this once on stretch marks on my tummy with very noticeable results.</li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle in a week.</li>
      <li>I think this is really going to move the scabs.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really helped a lot i&#x27;ve done three or four peels now and</li>
      <li>really well</li>
      <li>wear a high spf and a hat, or just avoid going out during the day as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first layer I applied directly into the stretch marks with a Q-Tip.</li>
      <li>I use it on select areas, mainly my nose and works well smoothing it out and cleaning the pores.</li>
      <li>If you try to do the entire area at once, wherever you start first will begin to burn first.</li>
      <li>By day two or three, your face will look a lot darker than your normal skin tone.</li>
      <li>For instance, on the belly do the right, the midde, and then the left.</li>
      <li>Your face will be bright pink or red after use, and should fade back to your natural color.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m a little more cautious, i shud hav bought a stronger one 2, but i like this so far</li>
      <li>each time i apply the acid right on top of any active pimples i have which seems to be the only place on my face that actually stings from this stuff</li>
      <li>Yes you will get heavier peeling with a TCA, and yes you wont need to leave this on more than a few minutes, as soon as it starts to frost or even if you cant stand it on your face any longer, wash it off, I mix a weak solution of baking soda and water and that neutralizes it just fine, but have it ready before you start the peel.</li>
      <li>the research, read the reviews, watch several instructional videos, and have a neutralizing solution nearby ready to go (a homemade solution is baking soda + tap water).</li>
      <li>so far no effect on warts.</li>
      <li>it was surprised at results.</li>
      <li>I just ordered a second bottle in a larger size after using the first bottle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Words from the wise: don&#x27;t let it sit past frosting and let it heavy frost</li>
      <li>The TCA is of high quality for such an affordable cost.  </li>
      <li>I wait until my entire face has finished peeling, and then allow the new skin an additional week to heal.</li>
      <li>Only on a old healed scab sore.</li>
      <li>My face usually feels normal the first day after use once the redness fades.</li>
      <li>Very minimal peeling, expected more due to the description.</li>

<li> I have done three treatments over my entire face, and did a single treatment on the apples of my cheeks.</li>
<li> This product is a complete waste of money and should be avoided.</li>
<li> But will NEVER use on my face , neck, hand and some other bodily parts.</li>
<li> I diluted it a little with pure water, very little.</li>
<li> a few other things i&#x27;ve been using to clear my skin up</li>
<li> The scars aren&#x27;t as deep as they previously were.</li>
<li> mostly do small spot treatments (on uneven skin texture or pigmentation)  because I don&#x27;t have the luxury to stay inside for 5-7 days while my skin then peels.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to cover up the small spots with a few layers of primer+mac concealer+setting power</li>
<li> not at all what I expected.  </li>
<li> I would recommend to anyone, just be careful.</li>
<li> to expect: After you put the acid on your face, watch carefully in the mirror.</li>
<li> Your skin will not like this, and it will be red for a few weeks.</li>
<li> It even burns a little</li>
<li> I used this after a bad case of hives that left alot of marks, especially on my face.</li>
<li> It never did &amp;#34;frost&amp;#34; and I had very little peeling.</li>
<li> It usually takes my face about a week to finish peeling.</li>
<li> And like I said start with a small percentage, like 5-10%, then build your way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re a chemical peel novice let me just say: START SLOW and WITH SMALL CONCENTRATIONS!&lt;br /&gt;You can always dilute the concentration with DI water (not tap water)</li>
<li> Use common sense and let your pain threshold be your guide.&lt;br</li>
<li> If you are looking for a review on how my skin turned out with a 20% Peel, then this is the wrong place.  </li>
<li> It burned like crazy, but it worked a miracle on my face.</li>
<li> , it stings like crazy, but no pain no gain.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It never did &amp;#34;frost&amp;#34; and I had very little peeling. I used the whole bottle in a week. Didn&#x27;t do.as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> not at all what I expected.  applicator is faulty (hole in tube below bulb).  so far no effect on warts.</li>
    <li> Product works as describe, I applied it on the age spots. The second days getting the age spots darker and It start peeling in 3-4 days.</li>
    <li> THIS DID NOT WORK FOR ME - VERY DISSAPOINTED!</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast . I am very pleased with the product .</li>
    <li> The service was awesome i bought it friday and it was here in the mail monday and it works really well my sister paid 25 bucks for a 8% solution from another website and honestly i ordered two different concentrations for less than that :) which is awesome i bought the 20% for my face and the 50% for my tattoo although i haven&#x27;t used that one yet and honestly if you&#x27;re thinking of doing a chemical peel you can&#x27;t beat this stuff i have really acne prone skin which is why i even tried this and it&#x27;s really helped a lot i&#x27;ve done three or four peels now and each time i apply the acid right on top of any active pimples i have which seems to be the only place on my face that actually stings from this stuff and it seems like every time i do a peel my skin clears up even more and considering how self conscious i was about my skin i&#x27;m really grateful for this product and a few other things i&#x27;ve been using to clear my skin up I will buy this again &lt;3</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase from Erlenmeyer&#x27;s Laboratory.  I am impressed!  The TCA is of high quality for such an affordable cost.  If you know how to use peels properly, then you would know this product works effectively.  I will continue to purchase from Erlenmeyer&#x27;s as I am satisfied with their quality of product.  If you are looking for a review on how my skin turned out with a 20% Peel, then this is the wrong place.  This review is strictly for the product and seller.  This is a medium peel that has worked perfect for removal of my outter dermis.</li>
    <li> Excellent for removing blemishes!</li>
    <li> I used this after a bad case of hives that left alot of marks, especially on my face. It burned like crazy, but it worked a miracle on my face. I would recommend to anyone, just be careful. The company I used was awesome too, they where really quick.</li>
    <li> Works as TCA should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words from the wise: don&#x27;t let it sit past frosting and let it heavy frost [completely white]. Your skin will not like this, and it will be red for a few weeks. Light frosting provides the best results.</li>
    <li> nice I liked it was surprised at results.Made my skin clear and nice..Thanks....doing a second peel will give update if anything changes. Nice reliable product.</li>
    <li> So far, this stuff has worked great for me. I just ordered a second bottle in a larger size after using the first bottle. I have done three treatments over my entire face, and did a single treatment on the apples of my cheeks. I have been using this product to soften up scars I have from acne. My face feels softer and my cheeks are starting to look a lot better. The scars aren&#x27;t as deep as they previously were. It has also cleared up all existing acne and blackheads. I would recommend this to people that have severe acnes or facial scaring from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to expect: After you put the acid on your face, watch carefully in the mirror. Your entire face is going to &amp;#34;frost&amp;#34;. It turns whitish. When your entire face frosts, use a baking soda/water mixture to neutralize the acid. Rinse and wash your face. Your face will be bright pink or red after use, and should fade back to your natural color. My face usually feels normal the first day after use once the redness fades. By day two or three, your face will look a lot darker than your normal skin tone. After this, it will start to peel. It usually takes my face about a week to finish peeling. Do not pick at your face during this time. Always wear sunscreen and if possible a large hat or scarf to block the sunlight from touching your face. I have been using this peel about every 2-3 weeks. I wait until my entire face has finished peeling, and then allow the new skin an additional week to heal.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a chemical peel novice let me just say: START SLOW and WITH SMALL CONCENTRATIONS!&lt;br /&gt;You can always dilute the concentration with DI water (not tap water) (its like $1/gallon at any drug store) if you feel intimidated.&lt;br /&gt;I started with TCA 10%, then 15%, and eventually 20%.&lt;br /&gt;I mostly do small spot treatments (on uneven skin texture or pigmentation)  because I don&#x27;t have the luxury to stay inside for 5-7 days while my skin then peels.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to cover up the small spots with a few layers of primer+mac concealer+setting power so i can go about my day.&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to do your entire face...covering up will not be as easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is A CHEMICAL. Let me repeat, a CHEMICAL!&lt;br /&gt;Take all the precautions you can!&lt;br /&gt;Do the research, read the reviews, watch several instructional videos, and have a neutralizing solution nearby ready to go (a homemade solution is baking soda + tap water). And like I said start with a small percentage, like 5-10%, then build your way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and sun protection is a must at all times. Otherwise you&#x27;ll just do more damage to your face.&lt;br /&gt;I wear a high spf and a hat, or just avoid going out during the day as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invest in a good moisturizer too.</li>
    <li> Really a good size and product, yes its very small but its cheap and you don&#x27;t want TCA to just sit around for ever on your shelf as it would in a bigger bottle. I use it on select areas, mainly my nose and works well smoothing it out and cleaning the pores. Yes you will get heavier peeling with a TCA, and yes you wont need to leave this on more than a few minutes, as soon as it starts to frost or even if you cant stand it on your face any longer, wash it off, I mix a weak solution of baking soda and water and that neutralizes it just fine, but have it ready before you start the peel. This strength doesn&#x27;t really do much for skin tags, so will also be getting the higher strength along the way for that, but this is a good strength for peeling - again, you WILL have heavier peeling with this strength, do NOT think oh youll just go to the higher strength straight off the bat; ive used TCA peels for years, and still wont use stronger than 20% on my face.</li>
    <li> My moles arent removing and ive been using it for about 2 weeks, why isnt it removing ?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this once on stretch marks on my tummy with very noticeable results. Ones that others can even see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT do the 5 minutes between the two layers I applied. I did about 2 minutes between. The first layer I applied directly into the stretch marks with a Q-Tip. The following layer I used all over and left on another couple of minutes. I got a nice frost within that time.  Use common sense and let your pain threshold be your guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it stings like crazy, but no pain no gain. I&#x27;m a medium toned African American and have had no issue with the use on my BELLY.  I can&#x27;t attest to facial use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 1.5 weeks before I even started to peel, but it started and the marks are definitely smoother. Skin is softer as well with no hyper pigmentation. I did not moisturize because I wanted to speed the peeling process up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else&#x27;s TCA, but this is my experience with this particular company and my first with TCA. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Do a section at a time. For instance, on the belly do the right, the midde, and then the left. If you try to do the entire area at once, wherever you start first will begin to burn first. You&#x27;ll end up washing it off before you get as deep a peel on the areas done later.</li>
    <li> This is a very potent facial peel.  My skin was burned for several days and it took two weeks to recover.  But when the peeling was gone, I was left with beautiful skin!  This is not something you can do to yourself unless you know what you are doing or you will end up with severe and irreversible damage.  But if you know what you are doing, this peel works!</li>
    <li> This 20% is good and strong. I diluted it a little with pure water, very little. I think this is really going to move the scabs. It even burns a little but I did after a short while wash the damaged skill area with power baking soda . I think this stuff works. But will NEVER use on my face , neck, hand and some other bodily parts. Only on a old healed scab sore.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a little more cautious, i shud hav bought a stronger one 2, but i like this so far,i will get a couple stronger ones next time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now.  I applied this TCA solution on 2 skin tags but there has not been any change in the appearance of the skin tag and no indication that it will fall off anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very minimal peeling, expected more due to the description.</li>
    <li> This solutions did absolutely nothing for my wart after two weeks of applying it. I had to go and by compound W, which is only 17% but it had done more in just two applications than this solution. This product is a complete waste of money and should be avoided.</li>
