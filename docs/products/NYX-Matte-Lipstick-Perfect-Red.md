      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The perfect red.</li>
      <li>It is an excellent lipstick: Matte and lasting!</li>
      <li>I love nyx cosmetics</li>
      <li>im looking forward to buy more matte colors from nyx</li>
      <li>It has three things going for it - it&#x27;s matte, which is great for older lips and faces</li>
      <li>Goes one well, nice bright red!</li>
      <li>And Like Its Called PERFECT RED Its Not Lying Red Is Perfectly Bright</li>
      <li>I order perfect red and violet and will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>On top of it the delivery is fast!  </li>
      <li>It Stays True To The Matte Texture</li>
      <li>Great purchase..thinking of buying in other shades.</li>
      <li>Most of the time I use a primer, but even with primer most lipsticks require constant touch ups, but not this one!</li>
      <li>If a bright red is not for you then I would try a different shade, however, I like a bright red color :)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
      <li>Now I have the whole matte set!</li>
      <li>I will definitely order more</li>
      <li>this matte lip was so pretty on me</li>
      <li>Normally, with red lipstick, it&#x27;s a constant commitment to keep it looking great all day after drinking, eating or talking.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a gorgeous red (not quite blue, a teeny bit orange), and it LASTS.</li>
      <li>Smears a little more than I like for a lipstick but not a deal breaker!</li>
      <li>I have a lot of red lipsticks, from Mac&#x27;s Ruby Woo, to L&#x27;ancome&#x27;s Haute Couture, and this is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s matte and not a high gloss,</li>
      <li>My favorite red lippy so far!</li>
      <li>This lipstick, however, really stays on, even after you&#x27;ve been eating with a fork or spoon.</li>
      <li>Very vibrant matte color, a true red &amp; for the price</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t require a liner, although I still use one most days, and you can put it on without a mirror and know that it looks terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extra staying power, I&#x27;d recommend using Lip Chic lipstick sealer, but it&#x27;s not really necessary with this item.</li>
      <li>I do still touch it up during the day, but nowhere near as many times as with much more expensive products.</li>
      <li>Can drink and eat normally</li>
      <li>Color is super long lasting!</li>
      <li>I love the Matte Red color and it stays on for about 6-8 hrs with just a little retouch !</li>
      <li>they also go on smooth they dry to matte but unlike a lot of other mattes like M.A.C these do not dry out your lips</li>
      <li>I was wondering if I could I get some free samples of the other lipstick or lip butter to see if I like the other colours.</li>
      <li>After eating and drinking you may want to refresh your lipstick , other than that it stays in place pretty long!</li>

<li> so I took a risk ordering this shade of red, but honestly not to toot my own horn, but this color &amp; brand is seriously to die for &amp;</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some VERY red lipstick for a long time.</li>
<li> of red, I got grey color lipstick.&lt;br</li>
<li> I am a tan colored girl and some colors look strange on me but not nyx</li>
<li> also not much product</li>
<li> Everything I buy comes off as almost orange or a really dark pink.</li>
<li> not even a slight gloss...</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed . :(</li>

    <li> I was scared to buy it as some matte lipsticks are kinda chalky but this lipstick was everything!! I&#x27;ve used NYX products but never the lipstick. Now I have the whole matte set! Its a great buy!</li>
    <li> My favorite red lippy so far! I love that it&#x27;s matte and not a high gloss, not even a slight gloss...PERFECT MATTE FEEL AND LOOK! Color is super long lasting! It doesn&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34; look that some matte lipsticks can give your lips. Can drink and eat normally and this lipstick STAYS ON! Most of the time I use a primer, but even with primer most lipsticks require constant touch ups, but not this one! The compliments I get everytime I wear this color make me love it even more, in fact it&#x27;s become my signature color. Perfect red lipstick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some VERY red lipstick for a long time. Everything I buy comes off as almost orange or a really dark pink. This one however is red. It stays on well and boy is it bright! I love it.</li>
    <li> The best! cant wait to purchase another!</li>
    <li> I love nyx cosmetics this matte lip was so pretty on me I am a tan colored girl and some colors look strange on me but not nyx they also go on smooth they dry to matte but unlike a lot of other mattes like M.A.C these do not dry out your lips they are inexpensive I will definitely order more I order perfect red and violet and will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> This color just makes your face pops it&#x27;s great im looking forward to buy more matte colors from nyx</li>
    <li> brighter than the picture they provide. also not much product but i guess u get what u pay for</li>
    <li> love it! Goes one well, nice bright red! Stays on fairly well throughout the day.. Smears a little more than I like for a lipstick but not a deal breaker!</li>
    <li> The perfect red. Love it.</li>
    <li> Very vibrant matte color, a true red &amp; for the price it&#x27;s worth it . After eating and drinking you may want to refresh your lipstick , other than that it stays in place pretty long!</li>
