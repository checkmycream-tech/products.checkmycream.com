      <li>Great aroma and feels good on the body !!!!!!!</li>
      <li>The fragrances are perfect without being overwhelming or underwhelming or setting off my fragrance allergies!</li>
      <li>This gel is not so great in the smell department.  </li>
      <li>I love it, great for your skin and smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>AMAZING!</li>
      <li>Not as good as their Pine scented.</li>
      <li>Every bit as good as her memories.</li>
      <li>and it is a good bang for the buck in that department.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this!</li>
      <li>I happen to LOVE THE SCENT!  </li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE this scent!</li>
      <li>I got hooked on the Frosting Gel first, then decided to try the Lemon since I was so impressed with the brand.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the Pine scented and decided to try the newer ones that they have.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would happily buy this product again and have already recommended this line to my friends; those with dry skin and those who just want a great shower gel!</li>
      <li>This bath gel smells more like a warm lemon cake.</li>
      <li>Lemon meringue pie in my bath - what could be better than that.  </li>
      <li>Other wise happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>Like Vitabath really well and loved the lemon bath and shower gel</li>
      <li>Pair this with the body mist and literally - sweet dreams!</li>
      <li>It smells great in the shower and my skin felt so soft and clean afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It was a fine product but</li>
      <li>AND so I like that it is a sulfate &amp; paraben free.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping this gel would be like the original lemon vitabath from years ago.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for making a product without floral overkill that keeps my sensitive skin happy.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve read good reviews about their products on several sites.  </li>
      <li>, that is the best product at least that we have tried.</li>
      <li>Smells like lemon pie not a bunch of fresh cut lemons.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite shower gel ever.</li>
      <li>The smell is more reminiscent of lemon meringue pie (sweet vice tart or tangy).  </li>
      <li>Not what I really was looking for but nice enough to recommend to others</li>
      <li>This was my first Vitabath product.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping the scent would be more subtle and have a more lemon scent</li>
      <li>The gel works really well</li>
      <li>but I feel clean and I will totally be buying it again.</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Nice enough, but not what I expected.</li>
      <li>I have used a couple of the other scents, like the vanilla, but the lemon is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>She absolutely favored it over more expensive presents, much more expensive presents!  </li>
      <li>I would definitely have the whole line in my bathroom.</li>
      <li>I only wish there was a whole line of products to go along with the gel.</li>
      <li>Quite frankly I&#x27;m surprised people are writing they don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
      <li>Maybe they got an old one.  </li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>For Vitabath brand,  I will stick to the original green fragrance.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong when you are first using it but becomes very subtle when you get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>The lime scent is great, but if only I could get my hands on the lemon!  :(</li>

<li> I&#x27;m happy to say I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!  </li>
<li> Like all Vitabath products, you only need to use a small amount for a lot of lather, so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
<li> It does not clash at all with any other fragrance that you may wear during the day.</li>
<li> A little disappointed it wasn&#x27;t just a little more lemony.</li>
<li> The scent is sweet, was very disappointed with this product, will try a different scent in the future.  </li>
<li> Always enjoyed all the fragrances of Vitabath - ordered as an add on, very disappointed, as there was no fragrance - thin and watery.</li>
<li> I was hesitant to try it because it seems a little expensive</li>
<li> That does have a lemon fragrance - but very subtle.</li>
<li> I did not end up smelling like lemon creme all day (sad face)</li>
<li> Just weird.</li>
<li> This bath gel is so yummy without any of the bad stuff like sulfates &amp; parabens in it!</li>
<li> I am very disappointed with this weird-smelling \\&quot;Lemon\\&quot; Vitabath.</li>

    <li> This was my first Vitabath product.  I was hesitant to try it because it seems a little expensive but I&#x27;ve read good reviews about their products on several sites.  I have pretty sensitive skin AND so I like that it is a sulfate &amp; paraben free.  I happen to LOVE THE SCENT!  It smells great in the shower and my skin felt so soft and clean afterwards.  I did not end up smelling like lemon creme all day (sad face) but I feel clean and I will totally be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This bath gel smells more like a warm lemon cake. A little disappointed it wasn&#x27;t just a little more lemony. Other wise happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Too Fruity as compared to the lime and basil, that is the best product at least that we have tried.</li>
    <li> Like Vitabath really well and loved the lemon bath and shower gel they had years ago.  This gel is not so great in the smell department.  The smell is more reminiscent of lemon meringue pie (sweet vice tart or tangy).  The gel works really well and it is a good bang for the buck in that department.</li>
    <li> Every bit as good as her memories. She absolutely favored it over more expensive presents, much more expensive presents!  Way To GO!!!</li>
    <li> Always enjoyed all the fragrances of Vitabath - ordered as an add on, very disappointed, as there was no fragrance - thin and watery. Hesitate to order again.</li>
    <li> Not a hint of lemon. Just weird.</li>
    <li> Smells like lemon pie not a bunch of fresh cut lemons. Not what I really was looking for but nice enough to recommend to others</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this weird-smelling \\&quot;Lemon\\&quot; Vitabath. It is not the delightful fragrance I remember from the Lemon Vitabath of 40-45 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I must stop my subscription and apply for a refund on this strange product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Morrissett</li>
    <li> Not as good as their Pine scented. This shower gel is too perfumey. I was hoping the scent would be more subtle and have a more lemon scent but it smells like perfume. I really liked the Pine scented and decided to try the newer ones that they have.&lt;br /&gt;My wife gave some of them away and I don&#x27;t like when she showers with it.</li>
    <li> Great aroma and feels good on the body !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Does what it was intended to do. Could have smelled mire lemony in my opinion</li>
    <li> I was hoping this gel would be like the original lemon vitabath from years ago.  But no such luck.  It was a fine product but just not what I was looking for so I gave it to my daughter.  They company, for some reason, discontinued the lemon scent going to lime. The lime scent is great, but if only I could get my hands on the lemon!  :(</li>
    <li> To me, the only thing lemon was the color. Could not find a hint of lemon in the fragrance - the only fragrance is the creme. Nice enough, but not what I expected. I have gone back to QVC and ordered Philosophy&#x27;s Lemon Custard. That does have a lemon fragrance - but very subtle. For Vitabath brand,  I will stick to the original green fragrance.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this scent! After my shower, the bathroom smells like the Lemon Creme. Quite frankly I&#x27;m surprised people are writing they don&#x27;t like it.  Maybe they got an old one.  I can&#x27;t be without this scent. AMAZING!</li>
    <li> The scent is sweet, was very disappointed with this product, will try a different scent in the future.  Would like to see a citrus  cilantro offered.</li>
    <li> I can only rate this 4 stars not due to quality but due to price , the price is a bit steep for the amount of product you get.</li>
    <li> I love it, great for your skin and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> Wow.  Lemon meringue pie in my bath - what could be better than that.  Pair this with the body mist and literally - sweet dreams!</li>
    <li> This bath gel is so yummy without any of the bad stuff like sulfates &amp; parabens in it! The fragrances are perfect without being overwhelming or underwhelming or setting off my fragrance allergies! Thanks for making a product without floral overkill that keeps my sensitive skin happy. I LOVE this!</li>

    <li> This is by far my favorite shower gel ever. The smell is strong when you are first using it but becomes very subtle when you get out of the shower. It does not clash at all with any other fragrance that you may wear during the day. Like all Vitabath products, you only need to use a small amount for a lot of lather, so the bottle lasts a long time. I have used a couple of the other scents, like the vanilla, but the lemon is by far my favorite. I only wish there was a whole line of products to go along with the gel. I would definitely have the whole line in my bathroom.</li>
