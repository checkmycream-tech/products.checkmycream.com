<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product and have to hide it from my family.</li>
    <li> I have found getting older requires veriation on a theme. Bending into a pretzel shape, while in the shower, on one foot, to wash the other, no longer applies to me..... Soapy Soles works great. ... Makes my feet happy, and that in itself is a real feat.</li>
    <li> Got this product to use after surgery when I could not bend to reach my feet.  Fantastic product!  I feel that my feet get clean now, and the product has soft bristles to gently massage the feet.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Soapy Soles is so soft and feels so nice when you wash your feet.  My feet feel clean and pampered after using it.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> need to own the tub to attach it to</li>
    <li> a bit ticklish when I use this but I got used to it after a while. I feel like I&#x27;m getting a thorough clean using this. It doesn&#x27;t slip on the bathtub when you scrub your feet, and after use I stick it to the side of the tub so it can drain out. I&#x27;d buy again</li>
    <li> My husband, who is never overly excited about anything, commented as soon as his foot passed over the top of this soapy sole, &amp;#34;this feels good!&amp;#34;  He uses it with each shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And.  It does adhere to the wall of the shower just as advertised.  One must push straight on to activate the suction cups on the bottom and, the sole does not fall between uses.  Really like the shade of blue.  Looks bright and clean on the shower wall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised why someone would give this item a negative review. Put your favorite liquid soap on it, put it on the floor of your shower, pad it down with your feet to get the suction cups working, and start scrubbing. It&#x27;s that simple. I used to have a terrible toenail fungus, and I bought this with a tea tree foot wash, and now my feet are 100% better. I scrunch my toes too, so I can use the soapy soles as a nail brush as well. It is worth the money, just make sure you clean it now and then, so that you won&#x27;t get mold on the back of the suction cups.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Terrific product.  Buy one for home and another for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly well satisfied with this product. I kind of wish I could get one like this with actual brushes, rather than these rubber fingers. However, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t like it as well so who knows. This works pretty well and stays in place pretty well too.</li>
    <li> Suction cups do not work on a textured surface as they are very small so I have to hold in place by stepping on it with one foot.</li>
    <li> this is great for people who cant bend down in the shower, pour some liquid soap on it and you&#x27;re good to go, gets feet nice and clean and a massage too!</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t expect it to be rubber bristles. It gets the job done, but it doesn&#x27;t make me feel I have cleaned my feet well enough</li>
    <li> I am in love with this item and have been telling my friends. A little squirt of liquid soap and let the bubbles fly. I have a plastic shower tub that does not have a smooth surface for the suction cups to stick to,but it is heavy enough that it doesn&#x27;t move around the tub floor. There is no chasing this thing and it stays in place. Buy one, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Its suction is not good when placed horizontally.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for anyone who can&#x27;t bend down to wash their feet anymore due to disabilities, arthritis, back pain, etc.  It works great and feels like a little exfoliating foot massage too.  I don&#x27;t want to ever be without one now that I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to treat some stinky feet from a trip abroad. I&#x27;d previously had the Earth Therapeutics foot scrubber of the same concept a couple years ago which was tossed during a move and because of frustration from its use.    The Soapy Soles has much better suction than the Earth Therapeutics. While I didn&#x27;t use both on the same exact surface, my tile now has less of a smoother surface which should be more difficult to grip. I&#x27;d stubbed my toe on the wall  with the Earth Therapeutics a couple times because it slid when in use.    Because the Earth Therapeutics was so finicky where it&#x27;d stick, when I was able to get it to stay I left it on the ground. It eventually got grimy and mildewy and even when washed, hard water growths showed on the translucent color.    Using Soapy Soles is great because it&#x27;s so easy, I don&#x27;t have to think about it. I throw it on the shower floor, pour some tea tree foot wash, and scrub away. Every few weeks I throw it in the dishwasher on with a load of non-consumption things like dog bowls on sani-rinse (high water temperature.)</li>
    <li> Love it. Make sure you punch it against the wall the ensure it sticks.</li>
    <li> This product has my feet looking great again.  Easy to use, and well priced compared to its competitors.</li>
    <li> iT IS HARD FOR ME TO BEND OVER AND PICK UP ANYTHING LET ALONE BEND OVER AND WASH MY FEET. THIS CLEANS MY FEET, FEELS GOOD,.  i BOUGHT ONE FOR EACH OF MY BATHROOMS SO EVERYONE CAN ENJOY.i ALSO BOUGHT THE ANTIFUNGAL SOAP FOR MY FEET, MY WHAT A DIFFERENCE, SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT BOTH OF THESE PRODUCTS SOONER.  MY FEET FEEL SO GOOD NOW.</li>
    <li> I gave 3 stars basically because it doesn&#x27;t  stick to my bathroom floor.  The floor is textured and the suction cups, which are many, still don&#x27;t stick.  I don&#x27;t remember seeing any remarks about the floor needed for the suction.  However, I would give it 5 stars on cleaning.  The super soft bristles are amazing.  I apply pressure to the pad with one foot while I scrub the other.  Anyway, good cleaning ability poor suction.</li>
    <li> Soft and easy on the feet, I love it.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I guess it okay if you are unable to bend down to scrub your feet.</li>
    <li> Stays put on shower floor and  lathers up nicely. I just squirt on some liquid soap and scrubba, scrubba, scrubba.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick to my tub floor because my tub has a textured finish but still works ok.</li>
    <li> Wanted something firmer, made out of flimsy rubber.</li>
    <li> When I wear sandals in the summer I don&#x27;t want to go to bed unless I scrub my feet first.  This works great I just step into the tub turn on the water and skirt a dab of soap on the foot pad and whella clean feet!  Works great!</li>
    <li> I really love my Soapy Soles!  My feet feel clean and pampered and the product is easy to clean.  It suctions to the wall when not in use.</li>
    <li> This enables me to wash my feet better.  I have a bad back and now I can get them cleaner easier.</li>
    <li> I wish I could have given this 0 Stars. Not effective. Does not do anything. Fibers are soft and doesn&#x27;t do anything for the feet. Even feet in good condition. Disappointed and pissed.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Doesn&#x27;t adhere to one of our shower floors but putting it in the corner works just fine.</li>
    <li> Reason for 4 stars is that it will not stick to shower floor area. Sticks fine on the wall. If you are not used to using this (which I am not) it kind of tickles. But I figured in due time I will adjust to that. It does clean the feet real nice. Even though I was surprised  by the size I wouldn&#x27;t want it smaller. Gives you enough room to move your foot back and forth without any problems.</li>
    <li> Its ok. The suction could be better.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002SVYIMU Soapy Toes Foot Scrubber - Clear Blue]]&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Soapy Soles for well over 10 years. They are truly a tremendous aid in personal grooming with hard to reach areas like your feet if you are at all physically compromised.  Actually, even if you&#x27;re not. Get for men or women.  They are approximately 11 inches long and 5 1/4 inches wide across the ball area of the foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft injection molded PVC projections on the surface of the large foot shaped Soapy Soles are soft and not irritating yet do a thorough job at cleaning your feet. Soapy Soles are an excellent aid if flexibility is an issue due to arthritis, orthopedic issues, balance etc.  Just press the foot shaped Soapy Soles to the shower or tub floor.  Suction cups grip the floor when it is wet and stay in place without shifting around. Squirt some liquid soap on the Soapy Soles and when you rub your foot and squish your toes over it a lather develops and does an excellent job in cleaning your feet and in between your toes while bathing.  Even my mother that has to use a bath chair can easily put her foot on the soap soles while she is seated to clean the bottom of her feet.  If you pick up the Soapy Soles after doing the bottoms of your feet, there is ample suds and soap on them to turn them over and brush or scrub over the tops of your feet. When you&#x27;re done just rinse it off and the suction cups will stick to the shower stall wall where they hang too dry until their next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase one, if not for yourself then for handicapped or aged loved ones.  I purchased the Soapy Soles from the Amazon.com website.  They arrived carefully packaged and arrived in just two days from \\&quot;Colonial Medical Assisted Devices.\\&quot; I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bristles aren&#x27;t very stiff, not scrubbing much.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful, I am barefoot a lot at home and I can quickly scrub off my feet... Dont expect 2 in the package like I did :) One is enough.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and does a good job of cleaning the soles of the feet.</li>
    <li> Having had back surgery about a year ago, leaning over to wash my feet is no longer an option.  My feet feel so clean and smooth after using Soapy Soles.</li>
    <li> This product works really well. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it sliding around on the bottom of my shower. I just squirt a bit of my body wash on the top, rub my feet in it to get it lather and voila. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> No more dirty feet.  Gentle scrubbers.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty soft like most of the reviews are mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;because of that, you may need to scrub harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it the bristles were a little more stiff and higher, it would probably turn into 5 stars so that&#x27;s the reason why i&#x27;m giving it a 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;taking one away because it&#x27;s too soft; stiffer would be better&lt;br /&gt;taking another one because the bristles are too short; if they were longer, you&#x27;d be able to clean between your toes</li>
    <li> I love this for the shower so much that I bought two this time. I&#x27;ve used this before this order (don&#x27;t remember who I purchased it from) but like the product so much that I searched Amazon.com til I found it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great way to scrub their feet while in the shower. It&#x27;s so hard(and dangerous) to stand on one foot and try to scrub the other one with a brush. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to the bottom of my standing shower. It does in fact clean the bottom of my foot if I keep the foot scrubber on the floor with my other foot holding it down. Might not be easy to do if you are unsteady.</li>
    <li> it works, however i could just bought an entire matt with the bristles on it for much cheaper</li>
    <li> This is great.  It stays in place, it feels good on the foot, and soap foams up fast on it.  A good purchase.</li>
    <li> Ordered one thing received another, not real impressed. I wanted something to scrub the dirt off my feet after working in the garden all day, this DID NOT do it.</li>
    <li> VERY disappointed since I actually didnt get the product that is pictured here. So i feel cheated honestly. I reported it havent heard a word about it. Suggest going to another seller or purchase directly fromt he store.</li>
    <li> It works just as described, I like it.</li>
    <li> Simply made, but very effective at cleaning the bottom of your feet. Leaves your feet truly feeling clean. You notice it&#x27;s effectiveness when you lotion your feet and feel how soft and smooth they&#x27;ve become.</li>
    <li> This is a great discovery.  Squirt a little liquid soap and run feet back and forth on bristles.  We are Californians and wear flip-flops all the time- this is a terrific way to have scrubbed feet in a flash!  Bought the product for friends, too...who all rave about it.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S WONDRFUL FOR MY FEET.  IT GIVES THEM THAT &amp;#34;PICKUP&amp;#34; AFTER A LONG DAY OF STANDING.  I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY DIABETIC OR NORMAL PERSON.</li>
    <li> I have a bad hip and hard to get down to my feet fully. This is a great thing to have. I still haven&#x27;t found the perfect soap though...looking for something that has some lather, but not too slippery making the tub a hazard. Throwing a bar soap seems to work best...so far</li>
    <li> stays put.  it doesn&#x27;t come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got this for my dad who is getting older and can&#x27;t bend over to wash his feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;he said it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use it every day.</li>
    <li> I ordered the soapy soles but got the sole scrub with the three different sections  .  I am not happy with the product sent since I wanted just the soapy sole....I had one and wanted another one.  I don&#x27;t have time to return it as I am going on vacation and this was a gift.  I am very disappointed in the product.  Thank You, Kathy Gibbons</li>
    <li> Feels great on my feet.</li>
    <li> Works well. Just use a touch of soap or the bottom of your shower gets really slick from excess soap. It sticks to the shower tile quite well to drain. Bought one as a gift and they also like it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Sticks to bathtub floor. Bristles not too hard.</li>
    <li> Made much better than the kind I had bought previously, and should last  long time. Glad I found them here.</li>
    <li> Fun gadget !!  Get one for each foot and massage as you shower .</li>
    <li> Great for washing and massaging my feet.</li>
    <li> I am 32yrs old and suffered a very severe neck and back injury a couple years ago.  Ever since bending over is a very difficult task.  It would take me lots of pain and about 20 - 30 minutes to clean the bottoms of my feet and between my toes.  This product not only has taken the pain out of the equation by not making me bend over, but has given me some dignity back.  I cannot say enough about this product.  I would recommend this product to everyone in my family.</li>
    <li> Perfect, just like the old one we had.  I put it on the side of the shower like the instructions said, to cut down on mold growth.</li>
    <li> great product....keeps my tootsies sparkling xlean!!</li>
    <li> A long time ago I bought this scrubber as a gift for a pregnant sister who had to be careful about Bending over. She spoke praises of it so I decided to get one for myself. Of all the fold scrubbers that I have bought soapy soles is the more safety friendly I have tried. The suction cups create a tight grip to the shower&#x27;s floor, and it will not slide while scrubbing. If you are diabetic like me, avoid all scrubbers that have the bridge on top with a tiny bristles, most of them are made of hard plastic that can harm that delicate skin between your toes. The downside is that you have to throw them away fairly regularly (not just soapy soles but any scrubber that is not well drained and stuck to the wall after use, develops that black funky mold that tends to grow on showers)</li>
    <li> ordering a 2nd of bath #2. Time will tell though what is going to lurk under this foot scrubber ....</li>
    <li> The bristles are much softer and shorter (&amp;#60; 5/8&amp;#34;) than I expected.  I was hoping for something a little beefier and longer to get in between my toes.</li>
    <li> This went into our offspring&#x27;s bathroom and they like it very much. We had been using the other version called Happy Feet, it think, but my son seems to prefer this one. The happy feet are nice, but the pumice stone tends to wear out. I am thinking this won&#x27;t have that issue and a pumice stone can be added separately or a different type of buffer could be used as well. It arrived in good time, thank you.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and scrubs well.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Love this! Just wish the material were a bit more rough to scrub more or have a pumice stone on it to get the rough spots.</li>
    <li> I ordered Soapy Soles and received Sole Scrub... Will keep it but not what I ordered.</li>
    <li> This actually feels great!</li>
    <li> Help me keep soles of feet free of dry skin</li>
    <li> This almost tickles your feet, it feels great but wish it was a little deeper so it would get the top of my foot too.  I keep it in the shower when I want to give my tired feet a treat!</li>
    <li> Never again. Developed mold about a month after purchase. Yes, it did a decent job of cleaning my feet, but who wants to clean them with mold. And yes, I did hang it to dry.</li>
    <li> Great idea but it doesn&#x27;t stick to the bottom of the shower! Makes it really hard to clean your feet.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the pic...there are two areas w/ different bristles and a pumice stone in the middle.  But, it does work well to clean/massage my feet, so I&#x27;m happy about that.  At least in my tub the suction cups don&#x27;t always work that well, but oh well...I didn&#x27;t buy it for the suction cups!</li>
    <li> I have had a few surgeries on the bottom of my feet. I have tried similar products and the bristles are too hard for me.  This one is just right.  I love using this every day.</li>
    <li> Works, but &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; heads need to be a little longer to be really effective between toes. But it is much less expensive, about 1/3 the cost, of the nationally advertised one and works alright.</li>
    <li> No, it only cleans the bottom of your feet. I was expecting something to also scrub the tops.</li>
    <li> After having back surgery, I was instructed not to bend for months while the bones were fusing together.  This has come in very useful for cleaning my feet.  It is good quality, easy to use.  It has little suction cups on the bottom to keep it in place.</li>
    <li> I love this foot scrubber!!! Works great and when I&#x27;m done in the shower I stick it to the wall to dry.</li>
    <li> Ok so I bought this for my husband who seems to not scrub his feet in the shower.  He thinks just cause he is in the shower they are going to get clean...lol...this is the best solution out there.  I actually think I might like this more than he does.  This is great to keep in shower, keep outside near garden hose or wherever.  The bristles are soft and do not hurt, very good size and has sucking cups on bottom so it will stay put.  However since I have a marble shower floor I cannot get it to stick firmly and stay put.  But that would cause me not to buy another one.  Great product and might also be a good gift for a person who has trouble bending over.  Go get your feet clean and buy the soapy soles</li>
    <li> Great product - attaches easily with suction cups and functions well to clean feet.  Hangs/attaches to the side of the shower for easy drying.  Considering purchasing a second soapy soles so that I can clean both feet at the same time.  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> My husband is disabled, has sore feet and struggles to bend.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Soapy Soles\\&quot; have been a real help to him in the shower, not only helping get his feet clean but from a safety perspective he&#x27;s much less likely to slip now he doesn&#x27;t have to try acrobatics to reach his feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally saw an advert for a &#x27;similar&#x27; product and I thought it was a great idea - but did my research first and avoided that product after reading all it&#x27;s poor reviews... I spent the (very) little extra for \\&quot;Soapy Soles\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I did!  It works great!  It doesn&#x27;t slip and cleans the feet great.  My husband did say it was a little tickly at first but he soon got used to it and is actually grateful that it&#x27;s soft not hard because he has reduced sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must confess that even though I don&#x27;t &#x27;need&#x27; Soapy Soles, I do enjoy using it every so often just because it feels good.  It requires very little soap.  In fact I use a shower scrunchie and squeezing a well-aimed lather ball onto the Soapy Soles is plenty for both feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother-in-law also has mobility difficulties and after we raved about \\&quot;Soapy Soles\\&quot; so much I surprised her with her own arriving mail order. She loves it too.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I have arthritic hips and find bending to clean my feet in the shower a nightmare.  Soapy Soles sticks perfectly to my shower&#x27;s tiled floor.  I just squirt a little body wash onto the surface and then I enjoy a lovely massage, as I clean my feet against its soft bristles. After showering, it detaches easily from the floor and I can leave it to dry thoroughly, before it&#x27;s next use.  I only wish I&#x27;d had Soapy Soles a few years earlier.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> it works well and sticks on the tiles perfect, No coming off or sliding. It is soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> So much easier with a back problem</li>
    <li> It tickles when using it.  I&#x27;m getting used to that</li>
    <li> great...can even stick it to the wall for your back</li>
    <li> I like this foot scrub. I wish the bristle were just a little bit more firm for better scrubbing.  I also do have any issues with this staying on my shower floor. It does not move around and stays in one place.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft so it doesnt tear up my feet. I put it in the floor of the shower and squirt my body wash on it. Does a great job of cleaning my feet without having to bend over in the shower. Just rinse off and stick to the shower wall when not in use.</li>
    <li> These are nice for the shower to clean your feet but the suction does not stay suctioned to the shower floor.  We have 1x1 inch granite tiles on the floor of our shower and the grout lines must break the suction.  I pushed them into a corner to use them so they will not move.  The suction cups on the bottom are very small too.</li>
    <li> My wife love its very soft</li>
    <li> I am not great at mornings. The knowledge that the sooner I stumble out of the bed the sooner I can pump some peppermint hippie soap on this thing and rub my smelly footparts all over it is a valuable thing. Obsessed.</li>
    <li> Love the soapy soles!</li>
    <li> My son has VERY dirty feet and this  does the trick.  It does tickle a bit, but is really helpful to get all the dirt and stink from the day.</li>
    <li> I have a plastic Shower insert and it doesn&#x27;t stick to the bottom of the shower.  It&#x27;s still works you just have to hold it in place with your other foot.</li>
    <li> My shower stall has a textured floor, so I suctioned it to the side wall. That worked great! And it makes it easy to keep it clean because the water drains off and it dries between showers. It feels nice, kind of like a scrubby terry cloth. The bristles are not super stiff like a brush.</li>
    <li> Soft and effective, and holds well to tile. This does tickle my feet a bit, but I&#x27;m very ticklish and sensitive.</li>
    <li> I find it best to rub it all over my feet rather than leave it on the shower floor. I use it every day and it seems indestructible. I highly recommend it. It feels good on my feet.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by how soft the bristles are and how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly worth the $!!</li>
    <li> I had used a similar item, but it was much better. The soap doesn&#x27;t stay on the scrubber and the bristles aren&#x27;t stiff enough to do much scrubbing. This is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love it! Feels great on my feet.</li>
    <li> Stays suctioned to the shower floor, but still moves around more than I&#x27;d like. Other than that, works fine.</li>
    <li> bought 3 of those so far. Use a few drops of a nice refreshing liquid soap, and rub. just rinse under water when you are done and stand it up to dry. Feet feel refreshed. wife and daughter love it too. bristls seem to be holding up well. Better than bending over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please click on the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button below. Thank you</li>
    <li> This foot scrubber certainly feels good on my feet, however, I am used to using a pumice stone to scrub my feet, so I feel that this \\&quot;Soapy Soles\\&quot; foot scrubber is a little too gentle to be of much use. Maybe kids whose feet are not calloused would benefit more. It might actually get a kid to clean their feet.</li>
    <li> the best foot scrub I&#x27;ve had in a while :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this a four star only because it doesn&#x27;t always stick securely on my nubby floor, which is not the products fault..</li>
    <li> There was some awful as-seen-on TV knockoff of this...with really prickly bristles and a horrible plastic smell.  But, THIS one is great.  It&#x27;s soft, feels really good against your feet, and does a good job cleaning an area of your body that wouldn&#x27;t normally get attention.  I walk around barefoot a lot so I like to use it.  The suction cups actually work too...which is rare from most products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I overpaid but I didn&#x27;t...it&#x27;s a high quality product.</li>
    <li> My husband and I absolutely love this thing.  It suds up really well just a small amount of body wash and makes your feet feel like they are brand new.  I personally have issues with poor circulation in my feet and read that cleaning your feet helps keep them warmer because the oils get washed off.  I have found this to be accurate.</li>
    <li> This is one product that does what it says it will and willingly and well. I will likely never be without it again. I&#x27;m up there in years and this is such a comfort. Do get a plan before trying it. Find a way to keep your balance when standing on one foot. Be sure the shower floor isn&#x27;t full of suds when you switch feet, and rinse off each foot when you take it off the sole. That way you are less likely to slip around. I rinse mine when done using it, set it aside then hang it to dry. My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good since my Mommy washed them before I started walking around.</li>
    <li> I have had another similar product which I didn&#x27;t like as well because its brush bristles were too stiff and hurt my toes. This product is softer but gets the job done quite well. The suction cups hold it firmly in place. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> Able to clean my feet properly which is so important being a diabetic and having arthritis. Highly recommend to anyone with issues of reaching your feet.</li>
    <li> These work as advertised and are easy to maintain</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend who found it too hard of a task to wash his feet with his own two hands.  It works well and the bristles are soft enough that it will clean but not hurt your feet.  It sticks well to the wall when you&#x27;re done so it&#x27;ll dry off quickly and avoid getting mold.  Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> I love my Soapy Soles!! Does the job! Wish I would have known about this product sooner!</li>
    <li> Great product. Especially for people who have had back surgery and can bend over.</li>
    <li> Saves my back from all kinds of strain and decreases the chance of a shower slip and fall.  First mounted foot scrubing product I have used and I like it.  Getting the tops of your toes and feet will take some work.  I also strongly suggest rinsing the pad and sticking it to the shower wall tile when not using it to give it a chance to drain and dry out.</li>
    <li> Works fine, suction cups and material is all durable and works well. I guess I just wish it had holes in it so it&#x27;d drain easier or had stiffer bristles. Sometimes I want to scrub more than just wash. (especially in the summertime!) But hey, I could have bought a different model. I like it, I just should have bought one with tougher scrubbers.</li>
    <li> I tried very hard to like this foot scrubber. The bristles (if you can call them that) are simply too weak; the material isn&#x27;t up to the job.  They seem to just flatten when trying to get a good scrub going. And no coming up between the toes. Much too short. Performs very poorly.  Finally tossed it.</li>
    <li> Really nice scrubbing and messaging action.  Adds a nice safety factor in the shower for we senior citizens.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while....scrubs bottom of foot great; add liquid soap of your choice; suds up great. Easy to clean. Hang up on shower wall to prevent mold from forming.</li>
    <li> I like the product, it feels great on the feet and lives up to it&#x27;s name.... highly recommend and better than other products</li>
