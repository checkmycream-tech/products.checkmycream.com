      <li>It is SO easy to use</li>
      <li>So, I was even more willing to learn more about this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I got it quickly and for free from NKC!</li>
      <li>and it really works!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the results as I continue to use it.</li>

      <li>I use this and have better results with the roller, because I am able to roll it completely and do a thorough treatment.</li>
      <li>but so far this is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t wait to receive this product because I have heard such good testimony on the derma roller</li>
      <li>It is not painful to use if used correctly and does not leave scratches on the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous decrease in the 2 times I have used this product</li>
      <li>but it goes away quickly</li>
      <li>This roller is fun to use.</li>
      <li>and so far I am pleased with it.</li>
      <li>but with this they come right out.</li>
      <li>first, I was scared to try this.  </li>
      <li>I was a bit concerned at first as I heard others&#x27; stories of pain.  </li>
      <li>Its that funny tingly sensation.</li>
      <li>I will most definitely recommend this roller to ANYONE!</li>
      <li>I use the roller first, &amp; then apply a cellulite cream &amp; my legs feel super soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>With this roller, you can do a mild version of this treatment, without the lidocaine or the downtime that a professional treatment would require.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed a huge amount of change in my scaring but again this is only week two.</li>
      <li>I was expecting this to hurt, but after my friends all got one, I really wanted to try..</li>
      <li>My derma roller seems to be working very well.  </li>
      <li>My face has already improved and looks fresh and young</li>
      <li>it real does help.</li>
      <li>I was very exicted to get this</li>
      <li>You are simply pressing lightly into your skin and moving your wrist in a rolling motion.</li>
      <li>Of course, it is not as effective as such a treatment, but over time and with repeated use, you can cumulatively get the same results if you are very diligent with your roller, follow the directions explicitly, and take care of the roller with its sanitation and safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have already noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my skin, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for ONE WEEK!</li>
      <li>I felt significant improvements in my saggy skin left after pregnancy together with stretch marks.</li>
      <li>We highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I bought this with high hoped of minimizing a surgical scar on my arm.  </li>
      <li>I was terrified of the pain especially when reading that this before length is for physician use right on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The needles on this roller are sharp, so it should be used lightly.</li>
      <li>This roller is better than ones I have tried in the past.</li>
      <li>I was a little hesitant to try this because of my reactive skin, but it was just fine.</li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;m aerating the lawn, rolling that little thing around, but it is doing fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so surprised with the results I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
      <li>I did get several emails on questions and answers on how to use the product and they seem very helpful</li>
      <li>people do not experience pain with its use, I however am sensitive to pain.</li>
      <li>I have only used it twice, I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in scars, but I can tell you that my pimples are much easier to take out after using it.</li>
      <li>It felt like those old needle tray toys everyone had in the 90&#x27;s from the discovery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, you need to take extra precautions and clean the needles thoroughly cause this is a rough product</li>
      <li>In my experience, it feels like when you have dental work done, lol, and your face is numb.. but not all over, only where you touch when you are doing it.</li>
      <li>Do not drag it across the skin, ROLL</li>
      <li>As a Licensed Esthetician, I have been trained on the use of Professional needling pens on clients in a medical spa setting.</li>
      <li>We both love how 5% of the purchases go to build schools for poor children in Madagascar.</li>
      <li>I have used it on a scar and it seems a little lighter and I haven&#x27;t even used it on that very much.  </li>
      <li>With continued use, I expect to see more dramatic results.</li>
      <li>This was a little intimidating at first</li>
      <li>Its a little strange at first</li>
      <li>Its a little strange at first</li>

    <li> As a Licensed Esthetician, I have been trained on the use of Professional needling pens on clients in a medical spa setting. With this roller, you can do a mild version of this treatment, without the lidocaine or the downtime that a professional treatment would require. Of course, it is not as effective as such a treatment, but over time and with repeated use, you can cumulatively get the same results if you are very diligent with your roller, follow the directions explicitly, and take care of the roller with its sanitation and safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needling works by creating tiny wounds deep in the skin. The body then uses Collagen and Elastin to heal these microscopic holes creating a firmer and smoother appearance. You will not damage your skin because you are only working on a fraction of it at any given time. This is why multiple repeated treatments is necessary for beneficial results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people do not experience pain with its use, I however am sensitive to pain. I recommend going to Sally Beauty Supply and asking for a Topical numbing cream, but use it sparingly and only on a small area at a time. I use this and have better results with the roller, because I am able to roll it completely and do a thorough treatment. Do not drag it across the skin, ROLL it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with Mudra&#x27;s Derma Roller. It is sturdy, comes pre-sanitized, and provides a relaxation CD for your comfort and benefit. The 1.5 mm depth of the needle point is the perfect length to use to achieve maximum results.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to receive this product because I have heard such good testimony on the derma roller and I concur with my peers as to this being a great cost saving beauty necessity it real does help.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice, I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in scars, but I can tell you that my pimples are much easier to take out after using it. They are usually really hard to get out because they feel like they are stuck under skin and no point but with this they come right out.</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review. The opinions expressed here are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a long long time to muster up the nerve to use this before roller. I was terrified of the pain especially when reading that this before length is for physician use right on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But pregnancy and weight fluctuation left me with a mangled stomach of marks and scars. It was time to take some serious measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a nice hot shower first, put on body lotion, she then treated my belly with a sanitizing wipe followed by a vitamin c, e and histrionic acid serum. Now it was time to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and honestly it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I imagined. It felt like those old needle tray toys everyone had in the 90&#x27;s from the discovery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward an itchy tingle started but I was able to aleve this with the Pro-nu ice roller. This is Inge if those things where you went see results for months so I took a before photo and hope this time next year, my belly will be looking a lot better!</li>
    <li> This was great. It actually help fade my stretchmarks signifacally.</li>
    <li> this will be the second week I&#x27;ve used this and so far I am pleased with it. I have not noticed a huge amount of change in my scaring but again this is only week two. It is extremely easy to use and does not hurt which I was concerned about from the beginning. after using my face does feel tighter and toner. I will update this review after a couple more weeks to see what type of improvement I have on my scaring but so far this is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous about trying out this item, but I went ahead. I was offered this at a discounted rate and it arrived packaged nicely so no damage could be done. The instructions themselves were easy to read and follow and after my evening bath, I prepared my skin on my stomach to try out the Mudra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit scary because I am not a fan of needles but this isn&#x27;t like you are taking a needle and dragging it across your skin. You are simply pressing lightly into your skin and moving your wrist in a rolling motion. There was a bit of &amp;#34;surface&amp;#34; blood but was easily wiped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from stretch marks after having twins and have tried a lot of things so this was another last ditch effort. I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous decrease in the 2 times I have used this product and it gets easier to manuever over time.</li>
    <li> very happy with results from product, i can tell a difference in the appearance of my stretch marks! Does not hurt and it is well worth the asking price! I will continue to use my dermaroller!</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to hurt, but after my friends all got one, I really wanted to try.. In my experience, it feels like when you have dental work done, lol, and your face is numb.. but not all over, only where you touch when you are doing it. Its that funny tingly sensation. But I like it and it makes me giggly in a way bc it is not what i expected, but it is working to help shink my pores, im already noticing the difference, so I will keep using it</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out this becsuse some of my friends have tried out derma rollers.  I wanted to use it for tiny liny and scars.  Now I&#x27;ve heard that using it can hurt but thats if you use it the wrong way.  Now I&#x27;ve used it and I&#x27;m happy because it didn&#x27;t hurt me at all.  I&#x27;m so surprised with the results I&#x27;ve gotten. This product is wonderful.  I have used it on tiny lines and they seem less.  I have used it on a scar and it seems a little lighter and I haven&#x27;t even used it on that very much.  Very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I received this product for free or a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I never suffered from acne as a teenager so when I was in my 30s and my face went crazy with acne, I was looking for new ways to help with this new problem.  I had seen several different needle rollers, but was not really sure what they were or if I should try one.  I was given the opportunity to try out the Mudra Needle Roller at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  I was very exicted to get this product.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was scared to try this.  They wanted me to use a device with the word &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34; in it.  Are they crazy!  I am glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;First off, I like the case it comes in, as I like knowing I have someone to keep this when I am not using it.  When I took it out of the case, I tried this on the top of my hand first to get an idea of how it worked.  It did not hurt!  So, I was even more willing to learn more about this!&lt;br /&gt;I finally used it on my face, and I have already noticed some small differences in my acne scaring!  I am hoping after some time using this, my skin will continue to clearer!&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> I did not get the mp3 for some reason. I did get several emails on questions and answers on how to use the product and they seem very helpful but I have not asked about the cd because I actually forgot about it until I was reviewing the product. The roller is good quality and easy to use. I have never used one before so I just followed the directions given in an email I received from the company. I do have redness but it goes away quickly and I am not using it for scar tissue so I have no thoughts on how well it may work with removing scarring. I don&#x27;t see any wrinkle reduction but maybe I have not used it long enough yet. Overall, I like the product.  EDITED____ I got the mp3 after all !! :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I got it quickly and for free from NKC! My face has already improved and looks fresh and young and I don&#x27;t need as much make up to look flawless!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to try this because of my reactive skin, but it was just fine. I feel like I&#x27;m aerating the lawn, rolling that little thing around, but it is doing fine. The CD is a download that you get through an OCR square thing.</li>
    <li> The needles on this roller are sharp, so it should be used lightly. I&#x27;ve been using it quite a bit &amp; I think I&#x27;m starting to see a difference in the appearance of my cellulite. I use the roller first, &amp; then apply a cellulite cream &amp; my legs feel super soft afterwards. With continued use, I expect to see more dramatic results. This was purchased at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I am not so sure about this yet. It is possible i am not doing it 100% correctly but the product is just as described!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried one before and heard great things about them. Its a little strange at first but I&#x27;m already seeing results! Wish I found this sooner!</li>
    <li> I liked how elastic my skin became as I used it diligently for over two weeks. I felt significant improvements in my saggy skin left after pregnancy together with stretch marks. However, you need to take extra precautions and clean the needles thoroughly cause this is a rough product and you don&#x27;t want to infect any areas in your body with it. So keeping it clean is very important. I also used stretch mark cream along with it to increase its effect on my body and stretch marks. It helped me to absorb the stretch mark lotion deeper into the areas I wanted to reach.</li>
    <li> My derma roller seems to be working very well.  I was a bit concerned at first as I heard others&#x27; stories of pain.  It didn&#x27;t seem painful to me, at worst it is temporarily irritating.  My C-section scar looks like it is fading.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to  give it a try!</li>
    <li> I bought this Roller to remove my stretch marks, and I love it! Very effective. My stretch marks were gone.</li>
    <li> This roller is better than ones I have tried in the past. I have only used it a short while but it has already helped my acne scars on my face some. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more it will work as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am a very skeptical person, especially when it comes to taking care of my skin and getting rid of scars and stretch marks. But this Mudra Roller is the BEE&#x27;S KNEES! I absolutely LOVE this product! It is SO easy to use and it really works!!! I have already noticed a significant difference in the appearance of my skin, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for ONE WEEK! I will most definitely recommend this roller to ANYONE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried one before and heard great things about them. Its a little strange at first but I&#x27;m already seeing results! Wish I found this sooner!</li>
    <li> This was a little intimidating at first but I gave it a shot and have been very pleased with the results. I use it on my stomach for stretch marks I got during pregnancy and the skin has become firmer and more healthy looking. It&#x27;s very easy to use and pain free for me. I&#x27;m excited to see the results as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I bought this feeling a littlw skeptical, but it actually has helpeed reduce the look of my csection scar. I am amazed with the results and I&#x27;m sure anyone else buying this will be as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter to use on stretch marks. She loves it. It is not painful to use if used correctly and does not leave scratches on the skin. My daughter swears by this product. Her stretch marks are fading with each use. We both love how 5% of the purchases go to build schools for poor children in Madagascar. This is an A+ company! We highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This roller is fun to use. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time to use and my son likes to help me out and copy me when I use it.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product but after receiving it and using it i really like it. I have used it for a week and have seen a bit of fading.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hoped of minimizing a surgical scar on my arm.  You don&#x27;t have to press hard and its only slightly uncomfortable to use.  I wasn&#x27;t able to see any difference in the scar.  I did try it on my face but had a difficult time fitting it into my routine since it leaves your skin so red for so long after using it.  For someone with a better schedule for it, it might work better.  They recommend using it 5 times a week...and it was just too time consuming for me.</li>
