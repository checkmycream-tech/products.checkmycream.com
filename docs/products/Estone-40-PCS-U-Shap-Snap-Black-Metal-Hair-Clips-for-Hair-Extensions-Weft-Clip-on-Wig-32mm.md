    <li> I used these inside my wigs, to hold them on my head, it a great idea if you don&#x27;t like wearing those caps like me...</li>
    <li> These are great quality!&lt;br /&gt;They are the perfect size, and clip into my thin hair easily!&lt;br /&gt;I glued my hair extension feathers together, and put them on one of these clips earlier, then wore it the rest of the night, and it didn&#x27;t slip or fall out AT ALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I got ALL 40 pieces in the mail safe and sound! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will def. buy these again, I just wish they came in the color blonde!</li>
    <li> I sooner them faster than expected. Got all 40 pieces.</li>
    <li> Very well made &amp; sturdy! Better then ones I&#x27;ve ordered in the past! Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> loveeeeeee them and their a great price.</li>
    <li> My order came early without problems.&lt;br /&gt;The items seem okay, I have not used them to date, hopefully,  all will be well.</li>
    <li> Very slow shipping, but worth the wait, nice!</li>
    <li> Got here before the estimated delivery time, which is great. However, I recieved&lt;br /&gt;41 clips and 39 of them are funtional which is ok and out of the 39 that are not broken, some are chipped and on the verge to break. But it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, so what can you expect. I still like them though :)</li>
    <li> These clips are a great price for the quantity I would defininetly order again</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE. I purchased these so I could make clip in extensions &amp; they&#x27;re great</li>
    <li> To small and the are not comfortable at all.</li>
    <li> There is no problem per se with the clips BUT they are very teeny tiny, which I did not realize when I ordered. If you want very small clips this is a great offer. I did not.</li>
    <li> Is was smaller than I thought but was perfect</li>
    <li> thank you so much I&#x27;ve been waiting for days so I can make my own hair extensionsthank you and God bless</li>
    <li> These are hair clips. The same kind used for feather hair accessories as well as extensions. Took a while to find them but well worth the effort. Use for bead, feather and/or ribbon hair clips. Can be very creative. Love the versatility. Arrived before the stated date. Very nice!</li>
    <li> Used these pieces to make some BOMB clip ins! They were just the right size, they were convenient, and I have more left over. This has to be one of the best buys on amazon! at my local beauty supply, they give you like 2 clips for $1. One of my best buys</li>
