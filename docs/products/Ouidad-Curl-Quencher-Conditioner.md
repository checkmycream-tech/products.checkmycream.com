      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>Nice shine  </li>
      <li>It also has a really nice smell.</li>
      <li>it has a mind of its own.</li>
      <li>Someone told me how the creator (i love her&#x27;) of Ouidad has curly hair of her own</li>
      <li>This could be great news for the right kind of curl, but for me it was just ok</li>
      <li>okay but very strong perfume scent.</li>
      <li>I first experienced this conditioner at the barber</li>
      <li>Like many folks with curls you try a million products - top it off that my curls are very fine - frizz city.</li>
      <li>I think this could be a great conditioner for certain curls...</li>
      <li>Love all the products from this line.</li>
      <li>Great product for very curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Love this product</li>
      <li>I love this product line.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on my hair just walking around every day.</li>
      <li>My hair is mostly curly.</li>
      <li>My favorite condition.</li>
      <li>Love Ouidad products.</li>
      <li>I love how this calms my frizzy curls.</li>
      <li>Love it all.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Ok, 3 words...</li>
      <li>I love all their products....</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>well I love it</li>
      <li>My hair is softer, smoother, and seems to be in better condition.</li>
      <li>but this was a much better price.  </li>
      <li>I loved this condition when I first tried it.  </li>
      <li>awesome for curly dry hair!</li>
      <li>I love the no-residue feeling along with how smooth and calming</li>
      <li>The whole product line is good, but this works fantastic on my curly hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m even able to make tendrils and curls; truly cool product</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner combo is fabulous.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best haircut of my life and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Again, purchased originally at the hair salon</li>
      <li>it really works and its perfect for my dry, curly hair!</li>
      <li>As a stand alone not so good, but if you&#x27;re going to be abusing you hair than I&#x27;d say a definite must.</li>
      <li>I bought the travel size to take on a trip, got a lot of compliments,  and ordered the full size bottle.</li>
      <li>, I just condition with this product, comb it through my hair during my shower, and then rinse my hair with cool water after my shower.  </li>
      <li>Nice and soft hair, too.</li>
      <li>I have thick, curly hair and found this on a list of best beauty products.</li>
      <li>does a great job, but I&#x27;ve used other products at cheaper prices that perform just-as-well.</li>
      <li>So while I have no complaint about this product&#x27;s performance, I just think that you can find better values elsewhere.</li>
      <li>if it worked I thought it would be well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It is great for my curls &amp; helps to tame &amp; define the curls.</li>
      <li>I had shine, nice curl definition and more hang than usual.</li>
      <li>I will definitely repurchase! :-)</li>
      <li>This is a reorder -- that&#x27;s how much we like it!</li>
      <li>fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve known about Ouidad for years, but I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would have enough moisture for my 3c hair (for the record, I have everything from 3b to 4a growing from my scalp).    </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re not fully satisfied with your current conditioner, I&#x27;d highly recommend trying this out (and their shampoo!)</li>
      <li>After using it a few times, I find that my curls are too poufy, even when I use a bit of the leave in conditioner on top of that, my curls look bushed out and not as smooth.</li>
      <li>Most conditioners for curly hair leave my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
      <li>and you do not need to add too much gel.</li>
      <li>I used a whole bottle and ordered another...</li>
      <li>I used it whether my hair was going to be straight or curly that day.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like this product as much as I do.</li>
      <li>But it seemed to almost flatten my waves, to make them body-less and almost straight.</li>
      <li>This one works really well, leaving my hair shiny and my curls bouncy.</li>
      <li>Fragrance-free would be much preferred.</li>
      <li>This product does an okay job of conditioning my hair, but I much prefer other products I have tried.  </li>
      <li>: pop on a heating cap and it works just as well as a deep conditioner, better than Ouidad&#x27;s $$$$ deep conditioner, IMHO.</li>
      <li>well i bought this particular product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This has been a nearly weekly ritual for the past 20 years, said to women who would supposedly either pay $1,000s of dollars to have hair like mine or would love to just cut it off right there and make a wig out of it.</li>
      <li>use this everyday and love the way my hair feels</li>
      <li>I normally use Ouidad&#x27;s Lock-in leave in condtioner</li>
      <li>I live in a humid climate.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;naturally curly hair\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo and conditioner together and later separately thinking the issue could be that it was  moisturizing too much either way</li>
      <li>Really defines the curls and minimizes frizz- especially if you take the time to comb through in the shower.</li>
      <li>hair feels so much stronger, yet softer at the same time.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair silky soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If your curls tend to be dry this conditioner will quickly clear up the problem. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years with great results. Here&#x27;s a tip: pop on a heating cap and it works just as well as a deep conditioner, better than Ouidad&#x27;s $$$$ deep conditioner, IMHO.</li>
    <li> Like many folks with curls you try a million products - top it off that my curls are very fine - frizz city. This shampoo and conditioner combo is fabulous. Really defines the curls and minimizes frizz- especially if you take the time to comb through in the shower.</li>
    <li> Something has changed broke my scalp, face and ears out!  They changed something in this Conditioner.  The Ouidad.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible!</li>
    <li> My favorite condition. Leaves my hair silky soft. I go to Morgan at the ouidad salon in Santa Monica. If you have curly or wavy hair you know all the haircuts you wish you never had. This is hands down the best haircut of my life and worth every penny. Love all the products from this line.</li>
    <li> This product has an awful chemical aroma that shuts down my sinuses and brings on headaches. Fragrance-free would be much preferred.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like this product as much as I do. I&#x27;ve known about Ouidad for years, but I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would have enough moisture for my 3c hair (for the record, I have everything from 3b to 4a growing from my scalp).    I layered a bit as a leave-in under the Climate Control gel and the result was my best wash and go to date! I had all but given up on wash and go&#x27;s, but after four years as a natural I have finally found what works for me. I had shine, nice curl definition and more hang than usual. My hair is quite dry and tends to frizz but the Ouidad products left my hair very soft, shiny and defined. I will definitely repurchase! :-)</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and it never looks like straw when i&#x27;m using Quidad products. Love it all. I never fight with my hair or have bad hair days! I try everything out there for curly hair and i always return to Quidad. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo and conditioner do to all the great reviews I saw on it. Though is is quite expensive if it worked I thought it would be well worth the money. I have long coarse dry wavy to curly hair and have had issues with not getting enough moisture to stay in in my hair especially in the summer. I used this shampoo and conditioner together and later separately thinking the issue could be that it was  moisturizing too much either way it resulted in me having greasy hair by the second day and I eventually started having breakouts on my neck shoulders and back were my hair hits on my body. If you are going to try it get the smaller bottle or a sample so you are not throwing your money away like i did.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It makes my typically course, dry hair smooth and easier to comb out. It also has a really nice smell.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try this. Love this product</li>
    <li> This is a little too rich for my hair.  I have course hair and live in Denver where it is extremely dry, I felt like it left a residue.  This being said, when you use your hot iron, your feel has a lot of forgiveness because it seems to protect against extreme temperature.  As a stand alone not so good, but if you&#x27;re going to be abusing you hair than I&#x27;d say a definite must.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair from feeling like straw.</li>
    <li> This is the best styling gel I have ever used. The whole product line is good, but this works fantastic on my curly hair. I bought the travel size to take on a trip, got a lot of compliments,  and ordered the full size bottle. It is amazing!</li>
    <li> Conditioner works okay but very strong perfume scent.</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner - my hair is healthier and my curls look much better</li>
    <li> Love Ouidad products. After using multiple curl specific hair products, I always come back to Ouidad.</li>
    <li> So playful, So curly...so playfully curly and quenched!!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed in this product. I normally use Ouidad&#x27;s Lock-in leave in condtioner and so when I was running out I decided to give this a try in hopes that it would work just as well.  After using it a few times, I find that my curls are too poufy, even when I use a bit of the leave in conditioner on top of that, my curls look bushed out and not as smooth. Will be going back to the other conditioner, disappointed that I wasted money on this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use Wen in winter and use this after to add back the curl and shine. Wen leaves it a little flat. This is super wonderful stuff. get it/</li>
    <li> This is a reorder -- that&#x27;s how much we like it!</li>
    <li> I think this could be a great conditioner for certain curls... Of course it cannot work for everyone! My hair is mostly curly. It&#x27;s has some wavy sections, but my biggest concern is the frizz. I live in a humid climate.  The conditioner definitely helped with the frizz! But it seemed to almost flatten my waves, to make them body-less and almost straight. Maybe its too heavy for me, but i never thought that could be possible because my hair is SO this and naturally dry. Seemed like I lost volume when using this conditioner. This could be great news for the right kind of curl, but for me it was just ok</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for my 3a-b curly hair.  I use it each morning during my shower (I only wash my hair a couple of times per week, other than that, I just condition with this product, comb it through my hair during my shower, and then rinse my hair with cool water after my shower.  I use a couple of products after my shower, including a very small dab of coconut oil as a final layer (to contain the frizzies).  This is a good product and I recommend it to my family and friends with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this conditioner!  For color-treated, lifeless hair, it&#x27;s the ticket!  &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Again, purchased originally at the hair salon but this was a much better price.  Makes hair manageable without being unruly.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and found this on a list of best beauty products. Fantastic. My hair can get frizzy on the outer layers and I do have my hair colored. Not a lot needed and I used it as conditioner. My hair is softer, smoother, and seems to be in better condition. Only disappointed in what a tiny bottle it is - kind of expensive for the amount your receive but a really great product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft and manageable. I would definitely recommend this product for people with course or kinky hair. Great!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Do not like using any other conditioner for my extremely curly hair.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this conditioner -- it&#x27;s totally fine. It does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, curly black hair that&#x27;s stripped and color-treated, and frizzy, so I&#x27;m careful and selective about picking products that serve my hair well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does a great job, but I&#x27;ve used other products at cheaper prices that perform just-as-well. So while I have no complaint about this product&#x27;s performance, I just think that you can find better values elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian with curly hair.  This product does an okay job of conditioning my hair, but I much prefer other products I have tried.  My hair feels dry and course after I rinse this product out.</li>
    <li> This conditioner really softens my curly thick hair.  I love this product line.</li>
    <li> great works well I love it and I will not go back to store products</li>
    <li> A must have for winter and summer.</li>
    <li> I love all their products....it really works and its perfect for my dry, curly hair!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday.  I love it.</li>
    <li> awesome for curly dry hair!</li>
    <li> This conditioner didn&#x27;t rinse through well and left lots of tangles, but worked well to keep curly hair bouncy and not flat.</li>
    <li> I love how this calms my frizzy curls. Nice and soft hair, too.</li>
    <li> As the perfect complement to their shampoo, Ouidad&#x27;s curly-hair-friendly conditioner is top notch. My hair seriously loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first experienced this conditioner at the barber I went to, he recommended only rinsing the majority of it out at the end of my shower to leave some of it to continue nourishing my hair after I dry off. This was a brilliant recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels so much stronger, yet softer at the same time. I get so many compliments on my hair just walking around every day. People ask me what I put in it, but I don&#x27;t use any gel - it&#x27;s just that naturally amazing now after switching to Ouidad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not fully satisfied with your current conditioner, I&#x27;d highly recommend trying this out (and their shampoo!)</li>
    <li> Horrible product and horrible customer service.</li>
    <li> Ok, 3 words...\\&quot;naturally curly hair\\&quot;. Words I have uttered all my life *followed by* and it&#x27;s almost impossible to work with bcuz it has a mind of its own. This has been a nearly weekly ritual for the past 20 years, said to women who would supposedly either pay $1,000s of dollars to have hair like mine or would love to just cut it off right there and make a wig out of it. Discovered this product about a month ago and now refuse to use anything other than Ouidad products in my hair. I did try Wen at one point, desperate for hair control and although it wasn&#x27;t a completely horrible product, it left me relatively unimpressed. So I figured after 30-something years of unmanageable, dry hair that I would finally embrace my curls and go with it. Someone told me how the creator (i love her&#x27;) of Ouidad has curly hair of her own and then I sae the words \\&quot;unquenchable, dry, thirsty, conditioner, and moisturizing\\&quot; all in the same sentance combined with user reviews...well i bought this particular product. Yeah, I have already budgeted $100/mo to use exclusively on Ouidad products for my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this curly hair product! It is great for my curls &amp; helps to tame &amp; define the curls.</li>
    <li> As in my review for the shampoo, I was pleasantly surprised at how using just the Ouidad products could make such a difference in the way my hair looks.  They do not cause my hair to dry out.  I have extremely tight, curly, frizzy hair and these products tame my hair.  Makes a difference in the look of my hair if I use all Ouidad products.</li>
    <li> This tames my frizzy hair, and my hair drinks it up!&lt;br /&gt;I only need a very small amount to condition my hair.</li>
    <li> Best out there for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, silky results</li>
    <li> Most conditioners for curly hair leave my hair dry and frizzy. This one works really well, leaving my hair shiny and my curls bouncy.</li>
    <li> Always looking for the perfect gel and this might be it.I wish it cost less but it does work and does not make my hair crunchy. Nice shine  and you do not need to add too much gel. If your looking to cut back on buying a trillion gels this is it.</li>
    <li> I have short course curly hair and this the only product that works to keep the fuzz down and gives me a well groomed  stylish head of hair. I&#x27;m even able to make tendrils and curls; truly cool product</li>
    <li> Great product for very curly hair.  I bought this before and will buy again...fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I loved this condition when I first tried it.  I used it whether my hair was going to be straight or curly that day. No frizz, great curls, tangle free.  I used a whole bottle and ordered another... then my hair started getting disgustingly greasy.  I thought it must be the shampoo, since I&#x27;ve been using the same conditioner for so long without problem.  (I did, at one point, use the matching shampoo for this product and didn&#x27;t like it).  I tried changing my shampoo over and over and nothing helped.  Finally I tried a different conditioner and my hair eventually went back to normal.  I don&#x27;t understand why it took so long to start getting greasy but I will never use this again.</li>
    <li> I love the no-residue feeling along with how smooth and calming it is for my curls. It doesn&#x27;t weight too heavy. Totally sold.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t the worst conditioner for my curls but for the price I was expecting my hair to have less frizz</li>
    <li> use this everyday and love the way my hair feels</li>
    <li> Best conditioner for curl hair!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter and she loves this hair product!</li>
