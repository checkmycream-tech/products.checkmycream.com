<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Simple tool that is totally functional and works.  Godd purchase.</li>
    <li> It is OK I mad my own better</li>
    <li> Bought this even with some mixed reviews and am so happy I did. When I recieved the strop I put some Fromm strop dressing on it and let it sit overnight. Used it to sharpen my straight razor before a shave and WOW! Talk about a fast, effective, inexpensive, quality product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> When my strop came in, I was happy, and then when I found the leather of the strop folded to such a degree that it was no longer viable, I was unhappy. Three stars because I&#x27;m just hoping it was a one time mistake.</li>
    <li> I would not let my Dovo touch that inferior quality strop!!!  It is just for show!!!</li>
    <li> good , well made product.  I use it daily to strop my razors.  I like it.  I give 2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> What I ordered and was not disappointed. Not top quality leather but, also not top dollar. Works for stropping my straight razor. Excellent choice for a beginner or someone on a budget.</li>
    <li> The leather had several bumps and a ridge running down the entire length of the strop. This was easily fixed by stropping a sanding block with 220 paper. Once smooth, I sprayed it down with WD-40 to soften the leather. The strop now works quite well!</li>
    <li> I liked it because my husband was happy with it said it was exactly what he wanted.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy strop. Scratches easy.</li>
    <li> I am a new enthusiast to stropping my own straight razors.  This product was my first strop.  It was a complete disappointment. The leather is hard and wears unevenly and will ruin your blade.  The canvas is probably the best portion of the strop.  I would try to use a paste on it but I fear the same problems could occur.  I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I purchase this before I knew anything about strops. I am still new but I can tell you that it arrived hard, almost brittle feeling. It had a huge gouge in it. Just to make it usable I had to sand the whole thing with 600 and 1200 grit and then apply a bunch of coats of mink oil. That was just the leather side. I am not happy with it. If I could do it again, I would stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> I first ordered one of these strops becuase it was the perfect size, and horsehide, and a really low price.  Then I read all of the negative reports, and had my doubts, but for the price thought that I would find out for myself.  The truth is I ordered two of them becuase of the low price, and to save on shipping, and the extra 9 bucks for a practice trap was nothing.  Then I also purchased a couple of two dollar and six dollar practive razors just to have something to break the new strops in with. ( two of those cheap practice razors also ended up being quite good also)    Anyway the two new strops arrived, and I was really surprized aty how good they were.  The most important part, the horsehide leather, was real good.    The fasteners were just a bit weak, but useable, and those can so eaily be changed out with new stuff easily acquired from the local hardwear suppier for a couple of bucks.  Again the most important part is the leather, and both strops has quite good leather, thich wide and quite smooth, and actually not too hard, but remember these are new not broken in strops.    Perhap the nylon back piece is not what you want, but it can be removed and the back side of the horsehide strop can have some jewelers rouge applied.  Anyway it may prove to be fine I just am not use to it, and will have to find out.  I do know the leather will work out just fine, and I do know the back side with treatment does the same thing as a second strop.    Come on guys this strop is really fantastic for the price.  It is a good piece of leather, and a really nice size.  Sure a person can go ahead and pay $60 or $80 dollars for something a bit better, but you are not going to beat this strap for less than forty bucks.  This will be a real strop instead of a downsized get by with strop, and horsehide will end up so much better than cowhide.    I have sharpened knives and razors for forty plus years.  Even today I touched up a sloppy shave with my pocket knife on my neck, dry, and without burning my face.  I know sharpening, and these strops are fine.  They and will break-in and up being great. A person can buy one of those five dollar cheap razors, and break-n this strop and have something really good that could last a lifetime.  I think all of you over critical people who have bad mouthed this bargain strop need to rethink your opinion.  Both of the ones I got were well worth the price.     It is an excellent piece of leather that is worth more than twice the price for just that perfect piece of horsehide which is plenty wide, and long enough too.</li>
    <li> Ordered two of them to cover in paste and use for sharpening. Leather looked so rough out of the package on both of them that I never used them for anything. One came scarred up with knicks in it, the other had a 2 inch square section that was all messed up as if it were a knot in a piece of wood. The leather had deep cracks in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when buying from prior reviews, but I got even less than that.</li>
    <li> I got this for a straight razor, and as others have noted, the canvas is too course and the leather is of poor grain and quality. But this tool is also heavy, akward and entirly too wide for a straight razor. This might be the right strop if you wanted to do a poor job sharpening an axe</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I&#x27;d found my old straight razor, wanted to start using it again and couldn&#x27;t find my old German strop. The company packed it well and shipped it promptly. The strop is nice looking and works well. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not quite cosmetically perfect, having one edge of a leather handle slightly peeled away from the underlying canvas, and the leather strop has a section that has a creased texture. Minor stuff, really, and it brought my razor to a fine shaving edge after I&#x27;d honed it on my Hard Arkansas oilstone.</li>
    <li> Really low quality. Spend a bit more and get a good quality strop.</li>
    <li> I just received this absolute piece of garbage. I knew based on the price it would most likley not be the best, and most of the time I do have to buy things on a budget so I tend to try to save money on things like this. This time- EPIC FAIL. It is advertised as a strop but the leather is too tough even if this was to be used as a whip. it is poorly made with cheap parts. The leather looks like they got it from an animal that sat dead in the desert for 50 years, the leather is so tough that it could almost be used as a hone rather than a strop. ABSOLUTE PIECE OF GARBAGE DO NOT BUY. I would bargain to say that the only favorable rating on here is either from the seller or from someone who has no idea what a strop is. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great strop just wish it was a little wider</li>
    <li> It is probably the best strop you can get for being a beginner shaver I purchased two and the consistency of the product differ some but I was pleased it didn&#x27;t come with waves or wrinkles I feel like I lucked out since others had issues with theirs</li>
    <li> article was and is working as advertised.  I hung it up by my station at work and hone my straight razors to keep them sharp and ready to use.</li>
    <li> Received my strop and liked it very much.  Personally I think it a quality item and it sharpened my Razor very well.  In short it did its job but I agree with an earlier reviewer when he said the canvas side was too coarse as I also feel a finer finish would do the job a bit better.  That&#x27;s why I gave this a 4 star rating.  Otherwise I like the horse hide strop very much.  Besides it does do the job.....  Nuff Said.  Indiana ED</li>
    <li> Item arrive quickly and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I got my product on time and a tracking number was provided for me to track the package.&lt;br /&gt;This strop is fair for beginners on shaving with straight razors, but it wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> There are many problems with this strop: tough leather (even with several applications of strop dressing), coarse \\&quot;canvas\\&quot;, and low quality metal hook bending easily are just a few.  When mine arrived, it was folded in half in it&#x27;s package and that gave it some...interesting cracks on it.   I&#x27;ve had it under a heavy flat object on a flat surface for a week and it&#x27;s still not completely straight.    That being said, you get what you pay for. Barely.</li>
    <li> I bought this strop because I trim my hair with a straight razor and researched the best ways to keep it sharp.  I saw this item and it was perfect.  It arrived very soon after ordering and I used it right away.  The strop had a minor defect in the leather, but was so high up that it was easily handled.  The canvas was a higher quality than my last strop and gave a keen first edge after honing.  After working some soap into the leather, I gave it a few strokes and tried it out.  The results were truly acceptable.  While I would not use this economical strop for daily use in a business environment, it was pretty decent for home use and I would recommend it to anyone that still employs a straight razor for fine trimming.</li>
    <li> The thing about this strop is, most strops are 2 inches wide and you need to use a special technique to sharpen the average (2 1/2 inch) barber razor. This is straight up and down. Also unlike cheap strops this has smooth soft suede/canvas making it hug the blade just enough for the perfect sharpen. There is nothing about this strop that is lacking, or anything short of the perfect sharpening tool for the average size barber razor.</li>
    <li> I would not recommed this razor strop to anyone.  I purchased this item for the low price only. I got what I payed for......(JUNK).  If you&#x27;d like a great strop, purchase a good strop made from Germany.  I&#x27;ve been using razor strops for many years to finish the cutting edges on my Gunsmithing tools after using sharpening stones and the like.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> Not expensive, but also not a high quality product.  The leather grain was uneven, and inconsistent.  The leather is too hard to properly strop a straight razor, and the canvas side is too coarse.</li>
    <li> Works great, it&#x27;s used all the time and we love it. I would recommend this to anyone. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> excellent strop for my straight razor...price was right too..no better way to put that final edge on a blade...just like going to the barber shop..</li>
    <li> I had been using a &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; strop I got with my razor, but it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it, so to speak. This is excellent for the price and the quality of my shaves has improved dramatically. I see a number of negative reviews stating the strop isn&#x27;t flat or similar, I expect those are shipping and handling problems, rather than with the quality of the item. I&#x27;m VERY happy with this strop.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item before I knew what I was doing. The materials are very poor, I found many bumps and gouges in the leather. If you&#x27;re going to buy it, use it only for stropping practice on a practice razor. Its simply not useful for anything else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for a new straight razor user.  This thing is cheap, but great for the price and works just fine.  Understand it&#x27;s not a $100 Buffalo leather strop.  Use this to learn and practice your straight razor stropping technique.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. The leather is stiff and too rough to use to actually sharpen a razor. I wish I had been paying more attention when I bought this. You live and learn.</li>
    <li> I have seen one thing after another on here about Razor Strop&#x27;s. I sure have not seen very much in this bunch about what makes a good or a great STROP.&lt;br /&gt;First off we have to have two parts to the Strop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The first one you use each and every time you shave is the Canvas or cloth or in this particular strop it is a mixture of synthetic Materials that you can use to heat your straight Razor or chisel plane knife blade against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is the first thing you see a good barber doing when he starts getting ready to shave your shorthairs. You need to flip it a good fifteen or twenty times against the cloth first one side then the other. a down and back is considered one stroke. Now after this has been done you will switch over to the leather side of the strop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now you should have begun your break in on the strop at least 24 hrs before. by slathering an oil like substance on the harder of the two surfaces of the leather. That side is also smoother and normally shine and maybe even darker that the back side. That was the outside of the cow or horse or goat or the neighbors cat. what ever you have made you leather out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Many times you can also tell as it will have some scratches on it where the horse rubbed up against the fence and cut the hide a bit. Yes their are many times that the hide looks fairly bad to start with. Still that is fine as you have already made it much more pliable,flexible, and forgiving by putting the strop dressing on that side of the hide. I use two differing products. One is old Gents a liquid and then there is Frommes which is more of a creame type. I cut up old squares of T shirt or use gun patches out of cotton 3x3 hey some of this cotton is so old my grandfather must a picked it before the war between the states. Hey some of My hand me down T shirts are so old the don&#x27;t even have anything printed on  them but the label and it says JC Pennys on it. So rubbing in circles slather just like that word slather, on the outside of the hide and then let it dry over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Then after warming the blade you stroke the blade up and down the strop with a light pressure on it and this will help the metal flow down from the high spots to fill in the low grooves the hair from you beard or head leaves in the blade while you cut the hair and skin and blood from your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now any more questions Go look it up or you could just dig up my granddad and ask him course he has been down there a day or two. So no Guarantee&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps I did buy several so I just might post this fufty or one hundred timesrd slather, on the outside of the hide and then let it dry over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Then after warming the blade you stroke the blade up and down the strop with a light pressure on it and this will help the metal flow down from the high spots to fill in the low grooves the hair from you beard or head leaves in the blade while you cut the hair and skin and blood from your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now any more questions Go look it up or you could just dig up my granddad and ask him course he has been down there a day or two. So no Guarantee&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps I did buy several so I just might post this fufty or one hundred times</li>
    <li> for the price, it is something that you cannot complain about. Ive read a lot of reviews about this strop being good for practice. How hard is it to learn to strop? i suggest you save your money and invest in a better quality strop. The canvas was cheap and hardly bore any resemblance or feel of canvas texture.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see. You pay for a decent straight razor,then spend $10.00 on a strop and want to complain about the quality.  I read a lot of the reviews and no one committed on the dye. You can&#x27;t strop a blade well on dye. Still not a negative. I bought this several months ago for my wood working tools. Carve a little, strop, carve a little. I used a very fine stone previous but this strop gives my knives a much sharper edge.  Same results on my pocket knife. Take the time to work the leather / horses hide a bit and get rid of the thick layer of dye and you will have a strop to be proud to whip out in public while whittling. Having always been a wet shaver I have had a straight razor beside my soap mug, for show, because I prefer a double edge razor. Well, I pulled out that razor, used the canvas to remove some light rust. I gave it a light honing and strop and tried it on my arm. Now I have a 3 inch bald spot as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom on my arm.  Am I man enough to try it on my face? I double dog dare me...</li>
    <li> 5 stars mmmm ,you are going to love it, nothing wrong with it .......read this I ,,,,spend too much time reading reviwes ....Am glad I see this bad a$$ strop, no expensive...very good. sincerely AE</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s cracks, it&#x27;s stiff, it&#x27;s my first strop and it works. I bought to practice stroping my straight razor. My blade gets sharp to cut my hair so I guess it works  and I guess I&#x27;m doing it right. Can&#x27;t beat the price. I bought a more expensive strop but bought this one to practice with. I&#x27;ll just keep using this strop until I give it to my lil bro when he gets older.</li>
    <li> As advertised. It&#x27;s not the best, it&#x27;s not the worst  - and it&#x27;s worth exactly what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Grain was not even on the leather works SO so. Good for starters set if you cut it in half you don&#x27;t feel to bad.</li>
    <li> Another 30% price increase. In December 2014 I got this for less than $12.50 and now it is $16. It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to realize it&#x27;s not quite the great deal it was. Bear in mind when you read the reviews here that a lot of people got this item in the $10 range, so naturally they are more enthusiastic. I would recommend shopping harder for a better deal. There is no reason for this item to go up 30% in 2 months. It&#x27;s a nice strop and does what it is supposed to, and most any strop will.</li>
    <li> The length is good. the leather used is heavy but of poor grade [lumpy and bumpy]. It will take a long time of use befor it gets smooth enough to work as it should. The must have skipped the manufacturing step of dressing the leather.</li>
    <li> Cheap strop for a cheap price. This isn&#x27;t good enough to use on a straight razor. There were a few large imperfections in the leather that would have ruined my blade.</li>
    <li> Hi everyone,  the Scalpmaster Barber Strop is getting some mixed reviews.  I ordered mine from Wasatch Beauty.  My ordering experience is great.  I ordered it early in the afternoon and it shipped that same day.  When it arrived, it was loosely looped (not folded or rolled) in a sealed plastic bag and shipping envelop.  The leather is stiff, smooth and has finished edges.  The canvas appears to be 100% synthetic, with a course side and a smoother side.  The metal fasteners are not beautiful but are functional; strong enough for use.  The country of origin appears to be Pakistan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall condition of the strop is very good and after applying mink oil to it, it softened up and became pliable.  The dye runs a bit and a light color came off on the rag I used to apply the oil (3 applications), but no more than I see in a good pair of boots, or a tool belt I recently bought.  I don&#x27;t see the dye as an impediment, and the leather is smooth without the “bumps and gouges” some people complained about (no I don&#x27;t work for the company or in the industry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is very good and the strop works well.  As with everything surrounding straight razor applications, patience, preparation, consistent application and TLC are all thats required to make this work for you.  10 out of 10 for Wasatch Beauty and 9 out of 10 for the strop (I&#x27;d prefer real canvas to synthetics, but it works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I&#x27;m breaking the strop in with my secondary razor and am not applying any past, oil or other conditioner to it (other than the initial breakin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> For the price, I can&#x27;t expect much but this leather is really dried up. If your looking to save some money, go with a sharpening stone not this.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Leather\\&quot; is debatable. The smooth side seems to be coated with plastic, and is too stiff for use without a significant break-in period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;canvas\\&quot; strip is extremely stiff and coarse. It&#x27;s much more likely to chip the fragile edge of a straight razor than to polish it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardware is merely fine, but definitely the best part of this overall terrible product.</li>
    <li> a good strop.  Works well</li>
    <li> Very good quality for this price range and it works as good as it looks. Recommend getting instructions before use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> this thing would have bin perfect if not for a nick that looked like someone stroped and nicked it as well as a spot that seamed to be messed during the cut. Though its fine cuz those spots are at the end.</li>
    <li> This will do the job, and the cost won&#x27;t break anyone. I use mine to maintain the edge on my pocket knives.</li>
    <li> good strop for the price..the leather is a bit stiff and its not as long as other strops but the price is right.</li>
    <li> It came pretty straight. On the leather side there are ridges and scratches on it so I can&#x27;t use that part but the rest of it decent.</li>
    <li> got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  He uses it for everything from straight razors to knives. It gives a great edge.</li>
    <li> really good product for a good price</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t really want to use this on even your budget razor. It doesn&#x27;t seem like real leather. Very rigid. Save your money and get a real strop.</li>
    <li> Mine came awfully stiff and dry. I rubbed some saddle soap into the smooth side and rubbed in some jeweler&#x27;s rouge on the rough side. Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a while it does the job quite nicely. I threw away the canvas strop. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary. It required some breaking in, but now it&#x27;s well worth the money. The hardware is cheap but has held up considerably well. I even clamp this onto my workbench to sharpen woodworking tools. Its size is really quite good.</li>
    <li> dyed leather, dye comes off on blade and the finish is crappy</li>
    <li> This will be hanging from a small shelf in my bathroom with a shaving cup, shaving soap, shaving brush and a straight razor.  This bring nastolga from the past.</li>
    <li> It camre quick but it was creased at the top middle section... Probably a shipping error but it seems to work good for my razors though.</li>
    <li> Takes some time to get use to but works great.</li>
    <li> If you want to get that &amp;#34;Razor sharp edge&amp;#34; on any tool, (Razor, knife, axe, Mother-in-law&#x27;s comment&#x27;s) you need to finish it off with a good leather strop. Remember to order stroping compound and research proper technique. It really does work wonders for sharpening blades.</li>
    <li> the concept is ok, but the leather had a big ding in it about a third of the way down from the handle.  Doesn&#x27;t make it useful for stropping.  No obvious damage to plastic bag, so I have to assume it came that way from factory.</li>
    <li> What is it for?  Leather part really improves the sharpened edge.  Knives are razor sharp.  But what is the cloth for?</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work to good for my razor</li>
    <li> Leather was actually quite thin, and had a small crack in the back.  Canvas side of the strop is quite nice.  It does do a pretty good job of dressing a knife, and treated my opinel No 9 quite well.  The back on the opinel did take a bit of the finish on the strop off, but that was due to the sharp edge on the spine of the Opinel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad.  I&#x27;d recommend going with a more expensive one, or making your own, but this is a decent one if you aren&#x27;t too familiar with a strop and want to get your feet wet.  And I&#x27;ll use this one until it falls apart, which is going to take longer than I think.  Does that make sense?  I hope so, but I&#x27;m not too worried about it.</li>
    <li> While this product doesn&#x27;t seem well-suited to stropping straight razors, I have found it to be very good for my purposes (which as been for finishing off kitchen knives and folding pocket knives which I have sharpened on a Lansky sharpening system).  While the leather is admittedly stiff, my strop is even and consistent.  The canvas side offers a nice alternative to the leather as a polishing surface on some of my pocket knives.  You get what you pay for, certainly, but as one of the lowest-cost options, I think that this will suit the purposes of most general knife maintenance.</li>
    <li> The leather strop was abit dried up. Get strop dressing. Plus there is no information with the packaging about use of the strop. Some are made to use both inside and out using 4 different surfaces. this does not specify and the inside does not look usable.</li>
    <li> Okay for a beginner. The strap need some work to make it better. There was some slight veining on the hide which had to be smoothed out with 1000 grit sandpaper and worked with some mineral oil to get that suade-ish finish. The second strap is basically useless since it&#x27;s more nylon than anything. But for the price and for a beginner it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> It at least looked like a strop. Other than that, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Should have known I was going to get a crap product due to the price I paid. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Major waste of money. Does not sharpen at all. Save yourself the trouble and get a strop that cost a little more money</li>
    <li> The way it was shipped and packaged bent the letter to where I could not get the wrinkles out and it tends to affect the razor a bit.</li>
    <li> This strop needs to be treated or rubbed with something to be useable. Its way too tough and has some kind of coating or finish on it that&#x27;s completely not necessary and now I&#x27;ll have to remove it before I can use it.</li>
    <li> The leather had a gouge in it right out of the box. The cheap &#x27;metal?&#x27; clip at the end broke first time trying to use it.</li>
    <li> Great strop buy nice swivel ring and handles the only reason its not 5 stars is the grain on the leather is a little big but it still works fine so the pull is very light on this strop and the webbing side is good and takes polishing compound well I purchased strop dressing along with this and it improved the grab on the leather. I also purchased a 5 dollar straight razor to break in the strop and the razor took such a keen edge it shaves great, it dose not keep the edge through the entire shave but great value none the less. I would recommend this product and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Finished side of the leather was okay; the rough side is so rough as to be useless. The &amp;#34;fabric&amp;#34; part of the strop seems to be coated in plastic...hard and stiff. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Good strop for the money.  Thick leather. Great size.  Full size strop like seen in barbershops.Not exactly sure what the canvas side is made of as it appears extra heavyweight material. Seems to work good. Seems quality workmanship. Mine came with a small defect on one edge of the leather.  A small nick. Sanded it down and no problem.  I bought some Fromm strop dressing and used it on the strop. Now it seems like a super strop. I highly recommend both. This strop should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> The first thing I saw was that it was dry and had two big cracks right in the middle. Save your money and get one for a lil more money.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality item although the metal parts required a little fine tuning. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and for the price, I don&#x27;t think you can do better.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in only a day and a half sfter ordering! I was surprised at the fast shipping and the quality of the strop, Although this is my first razor strop, I was truly impressed with the outward quality and finish of this product. I have yet to use it but it appears very well made as well as very attractive. Fisnish on the leather section was 98% percent perfect with only a minor flaw down by the handle (not a big issue). Excellent buy!</li>
    <li> Really cheap, poorly built, I guess if you&#x27;re new to straight razors and are afraid of ruining a nice strop then this one is for you. It looks cheap, it feels cheap, it&#x27;s ugly. It&#x27;s been a while since I bought and I&#x27;m wondering why on Earth I didn&#x27;t return it as soon as I opened the package. The brass plated piece at the top is corroding an ugly green color, really poorly built.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my Strop</li>
    <li> I bought one that is better.</li>
    <li> firm leather but I&#x27;m also a beginner with straight shaving.</li>
    <li> Its a great strap for sharpening my razor &amp; my knifes. I would definitely buy another if I ever needed to.</li>
    <li> It was not a good quality strop. It was cheap. I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> It works well.  I was going to make one, but this one is quite sufficient.  The clasp however, will probably break, but a piece of cord is working fine for me.  The clamping mechanism is still holding tightly.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected for the price and has kept my straight razor nice and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Should have order this sooner.</li>
    <li> just what I needed for the job,would recommend to any one needing same.. fast delivery. will use daily . at avery good price.</li>
    <li> This item is great,  I have it hanging on a door knob and use it after sharpening and for touchups.  I have been using this item for about three months.  It handles small blades and is sturdy enough to handle12&amp;#34; and 14&amp;#34; blades on large knives with ease.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Use it daily to keep razors sharp. excellent product! It has a swivel to mount to a wall for easy use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this very cheap item with the intent for it to be a practice strop to work on my technique. I knew the quality would be poor, but I was surprised how completely unusable this product was even for just practicing. The strop arrived in expert amazon packaging but with a huge deep bend in the center of the leather (see picture attached to item). The bend caused deep bumps and ridges in the leather which makes this just unusable. The fabric side doesn&#x27;t have this problem, but it is of very low quality. Even if the product arrived with out the crease, the quality of the strop is very poor. I could only recommend this as a decorative prop.</li>
    <li> the strop works great, and price was right. even though this is an infrequently used item, the built in hook let&#x27;s you put it practically anywhere.</li>
    <li> great price and the non-leather portion really takes the burs out</li>
    <li> Serviceable but not great.</li>
    <li> The leather is dry and hard, bent so that the razor was almost completely dull after some stropping. Spend the money, get a decent leather strop, this is a Civil War era belt.</li>
    <li> I bought a strop from China.  very short and not real leather...bought this one and started using it right away...a six star and made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I would have given five stars but the leather  had a crease in it</li>
    <li> I like this strop. Not much money, but still a good strop. Well, its not like I&#x27;m a strop expert or anything but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very poor craftsmanship.  The buckle is made out of cheap metal and will likely break.  The leather is not smooth, and would NOT work to strop a razor.  Would be acceptable as a stage prop only.</li>
    <li> Decent strop, just use some oil on the leather.</li>
    <li> I got this as a starter.  Needless to say, I was able to get a razor I got at an auction to shave (and some kitchen knives too!)  I am still using it (though not every day) for about 9 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap&lt;br /&gt;-Hook and Handles are a good feature&lt;br /&gt;-Great as a starter&lt;br /&gt;-strops OK&lt;br /&gt;-Canvas side seems to be good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The leather side was not as flat as it could be, and had a few too many wrinkles for my liking.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to affect its function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that I have nothing to compare this to.  But I have had good success so I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Item received with a nick on the leather, so it can&#x27;t even be used.  If you want a practice strop that you aren&#x27;t going to use your good straight razors on, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> This was my husband&#x27;s first time stropping and he found it very easy with this strop. The more coarse came in handy because the strait razor he has is very old and dull and needed to be honed. The course side will work well to keep the razor in tip top shape!</li>
    <li> Bought to use as a stage prop for Sweeney Todd.  Arrived in a timely and efficient manner. Never used to sharpen anything.</li>
    <li> For years I have looked for a good piece of leather to use as a strop to sharpen my knives with. I picked this up at a very reasonable price. I did not want or need a super expensive one because this will be used out in my garage to sharpen woodcarving tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it I was pleasantly surprised to find it of higher quality than I expected. This strop is well worth the money and anyone who buys it to sharpen their woodcarving tools with it should be very happy. If this fails me in any way I will come back here and edit this post and possibly downgrade my rating. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to do that so I am going ahead with the review.</li>
    <li> When I received this as soon as I took it out of the package I noticed a very large gouge in the leather. The gouge was almost right in the middle of the leather. If i were to try and use this stop all i would be doing would be damaging my blade. The clasp to secure this strop to a hook is also very small and cheaply built. I was not expecting an amazingly built product for the price that I paid. However I could not even use this item. Perhaps you will have better luck with this then I did. I am returning it and looking for one again.</li>
    <li> Maybe the seller doesn&#x27;t understand that nylon webbing is NOT canvas?  Canvas is a heavy-duty COTTON cloth with a relatively smooth surface...  The leather is too hard for use on a sharp razor.  With some cleaning and conditioning it can be usable, however the &amp;#34;canvas&amp;#34; side is worthless for straight razor use.</li>
    <li> The item shipped quickly and arrived quickly, and with everything we needed to mount it on the wall. It works great with our other razor. Solid construction and good quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it does the job. If you can complain about a $10 strop that does a pretty good job ... You have more money than me to be throwing around. It&#x27;s well worth the price and does a decent job.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find a better strop for their price. This Barber Strop is awesome , its a great one for beginners. and pros alike. A great product.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.  I conditioned the leather with a solution of light oil and very fine \\&quot;shavings\\&quot; from a fine sharpening stone.  It gives a great edge.  Hung it on the cabinet in the kitchen where it is convenient for touch-up sharpening.  So impressed, I bought a dedicated one for the shop and another for the beach.  Very pleased, especially when taking price into account.</li>
    <li> I can nott say if this is a good or a bad one. It&#x27;s the only one I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a Christmas Present.  Husband loves it.  Works great, and now we have very sharp knifes for not only household use, but for hunting as well.  Price was great and would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> For $12 I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are looking for.  I am very pleased, it certainly took some breaking in, but that is to be expected</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I would recommend a strop by Illinois razor strop company. Much better quality. The scalpmaster was okay. The clothe side was dirty and too rough. The leather side had gouges. Overtime when the strop has been worn in these blemishes will become less of a problem. The question is at what cost to your razors edge.</li>
    <li> I guess it is better than a kick in the pants...but not much better. Stiff as a nun on Sunday</li>
    <li> This was one of several shaving related items I purchased for my son this Christmas. He was very excited at seeing everything delivered, and very impressed that I would think to add a strop and dressing to his package since it wasn&#x27;t on his list. I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the strop and am anxious to hear how he likes using it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend orderd this with a razor and oxide compound. He liked the strop at first but he doesn&#x27;t like it anymore, he says it doesn&#x27;t get the razor sharp enough for him.</li>
    <li> If your using the old fashion razor this is great, I thought it would also sharpen todays safty razor; unless I&#x27;m useing it wrong it doesn&#x27;t.  If you need a Barber Strop you will never find one as well made or priced as well as this one in a store. I do recommend it, it&#x27;s well made.</li>
    <li> I bought this with a straight razor that had the largest high quality blade I could find.  I always go for the larger blades and this is the first strop I have found that accommodates The whole blade.  This saves wear and tear on the strop because if you have slide the blade in two directions simultaneously(such as when honing a kitchen knife) no matter how careful you are or how well oiled the leather, you are much more likely to damage the strop.  Would buy from this seller(Scalpmaster) again.again.</li>
    <li> wow....i have made my home a barbershop by ordering this</li>
    <li> What a great strop. My blades get really sharp. I keep it hooked up to my work bench. It&#x27;s the perfect size.</li>
    <li> looks good havent used it yet</li>
    <li> Was hoping to get at least what was described but I didn&#x27;t get that. As you can see in the image the strop is not the size they are advertising. The package doesn&#x27;t even state 2 1/2 inches by 23 inches that they have described this stop as being would love to know where they got the size from.  Now with that said I figured this is a beginner strop and it was cheap so I would still go with it. After opening it at looking at at I put it back and set up a return. The canvas is not canvas or any sort of fabric it is plastic. The leather is in bad shape if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact it was in a sealed package I would have thought it was used, there were nicks all along the strop alot of which were right in the middle.  I gambled with this one as a beginner strop but I lost, now have to try and find a different one.</li>
    <li> this is a to have  item if you use a straight edge razor.you will not be disappoint in this strop</li>
    <li> Holy Cow....must have been made from.  This Strop is the best I have seen out there for sale nice  thick leather and wide cut.  This is a professional barber strop a must have for those who use a straight razor.</li>
    <li> This was also a gift to go along with the razor i bought at the same time.  So far my son has no issue with this item as it has worked fine for the little he has used it.</li>
    <li> Hard as a rock!! stiff.</li>
    <li> This product was not exactly what I expected.  The workmanship is less than what I thought.  Thin leather.  Brass fixtures are flimsy and look like they will break soon.</li>
    <li> When you start out learning the straight razor you want an inexpensive strop because you will probally cut it atleast half a dozen times. This is alright for that, however in about a year or two when this thing wears out there are better strops to be found.</li>
    <li> Perfect. This is exactly what I was looking for and it works great.</li>
    <li> A little cheap quality but it works fine.</li>
    <li> Great product, puts a really sharp edge back on my skinning blades..</li>
    <li> These were as describe. With the proper use they work perfectly for the straight razor. My husband was pleased wth this item. If you are looking for a great strop for a great price you found it.</li>
    <li> I needed a new stop when a momentary lapse in concentration forced me to nearly cut my old one in 2. I needed a replacement FAST so without putting too much concern on quality, I ordered the first strop I could find with fast shipping. this one shipped with Amazon Prime 2 day shipping. The strop cost me less than 12 bucks and arrived in less than 48 hours. My crisis was over for the moment and as long as I had a usable strop, I had something to shave with until I can get a more suitable replacement...so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out I never did order a replacement. After breaking this strop in I was very pleased with the quality. The leather was nice and thick and it broke in easily. The Linen/canvas side was great too. The fabric is soft and the blade glides well on it. It can be used on both sides and the middle insert is stiff enough to remove any sag while stropping while not making the fabric tough on the blade. Can&#x27;t get much better for your buck. there are better strops out there so I cant give it a perfect score, but you&#x27;d be hard pressed to get more for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the cheap dye they used in tanning the leather. When I was breaking it in a lot of the brown dye seeped out. My advice is when prepping the strop, apply oil such as mineral oil or neatsfoot oil with an old cloth or a towel you don&#x27;t mind throwing away afterwards as a lot of the pigment in the leather will stain whatever it comes in contact with. If you are a more traditional type who treats the leather with shave lather, DO NOT APPLY LATHER WITH YOUR BRUSH. If you have a fine badger hair brush the dye will certainly stain the bristles, and perhaps even transfer it to your face on your next shave. If you are using lather rub it in with your hands and wear latex gloves so you don&#x27;t stain your skin. Once the leather has been adequately oiled and is ready for use, the dye is no longer a problem making this strop as good as any I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> cheap buy will do for a starter</li>
    <li> Although it is made in Pakistan, I have seen the same strop sell for $10-$15 extra on other sites.  Very good price.  I have no issues with this.  The leather is smooth with no flaws.  I was actually surprised at the hardware which was better that I thought it would be.  For the price, you won&#x27;t beat this strop!!</li>
    <li> I looked over the strope which did not cost much to check for flaws and quality of build.  Not much to brag about with this product except for the price.  My razor will at least be stroped before use.</li>
    <li> The leather strop was not properly tanned, but coated on the top grain with a varnish like substance, requiring the leather to be sanded and moisturized before it was usable.  The hardware is very cheap, and the stiching is irregular, like it was done by different people.  The supposedly rayon section is made of a very coarse weave on one side, with an exceptionally coarse grained texture on  the other, not suitable for fine razors.  I would not recommend it for straight razors, but loaded with cromium oxide, it&#x27;s wonderful for knives.</li>
    <li> The gouges in the leather make this poor for it&#x27;s intended purpose.  It would damage a fine razor&#x27;s edge.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, FAST delivery, good price and packing.  :-)</li>
    <li> A very good deal for a horse hide strop.</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s a strop... but not that great... Not supple, and mine did have what looked like a scar.  You really need to condition this thing and break it in... If you want a strop you can use right away, pass up on this one.  Yeah, it&#x27;s thick... but no it&#x27;s not that great... Honestly, i&#x27;m gonna pass on a strop... so yeah, go for the $60 one at least.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I could done better for 12 bucks ...leather really thick ....  stropped 5 st8 razors on it ......all pass hh test,,, once it is worn in I say it&#x27;ll get better.... not too bad now .....in fact for 12 bucks its awesome  hint ....learn to strop on  newspaper ... save a strop</li>
    <li> Strop worked fine.  Not great but does the job.</li>
    <li> May not cost $100 or be made of some exotic leather with adornments, but it keeps the straight razor hummin&#x27; for me. For ten bucks, I like it. Leather DID come with two small crease-like indentations; oh well, I just avoid them while stropping.</li>
    <li> The leather side looks like a section purchased from a \\&quot;Seconds pile\\&quot; rendering factory after all the other good leather was taken the scraps were used to make this Strop..  Bottom line: you get what you pay for..  kinda low rent!</li>
    <li> sharp very well my straight blade . I recommended. it was a great idea to buy this product. I  recommended it</li>
    <li> This product fulfills its requirements. It does the job it is supposed to do. It arrived as specified. It was undamaged.  It is a necessary tool to have to keep a straight razor edge sharp.</li>
    <li> Good strap, great price. I also own a strop made by the Illinois Razor Strap  Co. Except for the gold lettering imprinted on the handle, both strops appear to be identical!</li>
    <li> Super nice to get that extra fine edge to your knives.  I&#x27;ve wore out one side of my canvas already.  Will definitely get another.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. It&#x27;s very simple and the hook is flimsy. No frills, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Leather is so wrinkled and cracked, even after I conditioned it, I&#x27;m not sure I even want to try it on a blade.</li>
