      <li>These Remington SP 5161 Teflon coated rotary replacement heads and cutters work as intended and also give a smooth cut.</li>
      <li>and they cut just as well as the ones that came with the original shaver.</li>
      <li>Used the original blades for almost 5 years, had to replace them because i droped it</li>
      <li>Original blades were damaged by the airline baggage monkeys.</li>
      <li>Just exactly what was advertised, fast delivery, great price, I am very satisified.</li>
      <li>However, the true test of a razor is how well</li>
      <li>The shaver is a good product, and these replacement parts, though necessary, don&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
      <li>The whole top of the product packaging looked like it was cut off (appears to have been a return from another customer.)  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great to have sharp blades again.</li>
      <li>Quick, convenient, and in stock</li>
      <li>My husband has used these replacement heads for years - in various shavers - LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Should have come to Amazon First!</li>
      <li>Nice price as well - definitely has improved the shaver.</li>
      <li>, this was the right purchase to make</li>
      <li>went on easily and works just like new.</li>
      <li>and this was my first Remington buy.  </li>
      <li>I am glad that I can purchase replacement heads instead of having to purchase an entire shaver.</li>
      <li>I used them the first time I received them.</li>
      <li>Had to replace the heads on my razor, and this was the exact thing needed.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Did a much better job than the original ones that were uh several years old.</li>
      <li>I think the quality of this item is very low, it said that might fit my razor</li>
      <li>VERY well.  </li>
      <li>I get much cleaner and easier shaves now.</li>
      <li>I even spent some more to get the teflon BS.</li>
      <li>Much improved shaving experience.  </li>
      <li>They really improved this version of the replacement blades.</li>
      <li>It still pinches and pulls the occasional hair, but the original blades did that as well...</li>
      <li>They do their job and thats all I can really ask of new blades.</li>
      <li>These blades are reasonably priced and they really improved the shave I get from my old razor.</li>
      <li>and now I can go a long time with my same favorite  razor.</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;ll be buying a new shaver which is what I was trying to avoid by buying the replacement blades.  </li>
      <li>I thought at first, the new blades weren&#x27;t giving me the same close shave, but that was all mis-perception.  </li>
      <li>Had I ordered it from Remington directly, they would have charged me 9.50 for shipping!</li>
      <li>After taking almost the entire shaver head apart, I discovered that the blades load from the top; a slight twist on each head, and it pops out.</li>
      <li>So they last much longer than the 1 year they say they should.</li>
      <li>will repost down the road to see how long before he needs to replace it! :)</li>
      <li>but I just shaved after three days, and the new blades didn&#x27;t have the same pain!  </li>
      <li>I bought this item for my husband, and so since I don&#x27;t shave, but he hasn&#x27;t complained once, I assume they are fine.</li>
      <li>a fault of the shaver design, apparently.</li>
      <li>In fact, the old blades would pinch my hairs pretty bad if I let it grow for more than one day...</li>
      <li>I was a little surprised that the whole head did not come off as that is how it looks in the pic</li>
      <li>Used my originals far too long.  </li>
      <li>So, I can get to work a few minutes earlier, or maybe better, sleep a few minutes</li>

<li> Was hard to find in Walmart where I bought the shaver.</li>
<li> The quality of the product would be hard to beat.</li>
<li> total cost over the life of an electric razor must include that of replacement cutting heads.</li>
<li> I mean, this is a well know company, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
<li> The box that I received did NOT list the 5150, which explains why they would not fit!!  </li>
<li> Ever broken a razor head?</li>
<li> I ordered this for my father because after he bought the shaver, we were unable to find the refills in stores.</li>
<li> marketing expensive BS.</li>
<li> However, I have used the Remington shaver for over one year before having to replace the cutting heads.</li>

    <li> Used the original blades for almost 5 years, had to replace them because i droped it and they broke. Awful quality compared to the original, absurd amount of pulling and pain when using even when beard is still short. Don&#x27;t buy this, i&#x27;m looking for a different solution. I even spent some more to get the teflon BS. marketing expensive BS. RIP george carlin.</li>
    <li> Works good. Was hard to find in Walmart where I bought the shaver. Checked several stores. Should have come to Amazon First!</li>
    <li> The Remington Flex360 family of electric razors includes the R-4130, R-5130, and the R-7130. The high-end R-7130 sells for around $80 on Amazon, the R-5130 for $55, while the low-end model, R-4130, goes for $44 on Amazon. The difference among the models is the charging system. There is also a charging stand available for $10. These are all competitive prices. However, the true test of a razor is how well it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have used electric razors manufactured by Remington, Braun, and Norelco. I have found that the Flex360 gives me a close uniform shave which is the equal of the best that I have had. It also does this in about three minutes, half the time of that of my previous razor, a rotary of Norelco of similar design. So, I can get to work a few minutes earlier, or maybe better, sleep a few minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total cost over the life of an electric razor must include that of replacement cutting heads. The SP-5161 head for the R-5130 and the R-7130 sells for $27 on Amazon, while the SP-3141 head for the R-4130 is $21. These are equal to or lower than the prices of replacement heads for other razors. The instruction booklet suggests replacing the heads every twelve months. That sounds optimistic since I have had to buy replacement heads for other razors after around six months. However, I have used the Remington shaver for over one year before having to replace the cutting heads.</li>
    <li> havent had to use this yet.. will repost down the road to see how long before he needs to replace it! :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my father because after he bought the shaver, we were unable to find the refills in stores. I order it, it&#x27;s easy to pop into place and they cut just as well as the ones that came with the original shaver. ALso, because I ordered from Amazon, I didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping. Had I ordered it from Remington directly, they would have charged me 9.50 for shipping! (NOT worth it) Order from Amazon instead!</li>
    <li> I never thought about buying replacement blades for an electric razor.  Turns out, it makes quite a difference!  I thought at first, the new blades weren&#x27;t giving me the same close shave, but that was all mis-perception.  In fact, the old blades would pinch my hairs pretty bad if I let it grow for more than one day...but I just shaved after three days, and the new blades didn&#x27;t have the same pain!  I&#x27;ve now signed up for regular 6 month interval replacement orders.  The new blades were very easy to install, good design Remington!    Electric razors aren&#x27;t as close of shave as Fusion (or even Mach 3), but everyone still always noticed that I shaved, and unless someone is standing within 3 feet of me, you can&#x27;t tell the difference anyway.  I made the switch to an electric razor a year ago and find a hard time believing I&#x27;ll go back anytime soon...</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR CEATES A LOT OF DRAG OR RESITANCE WHEN SHAVING MORE SO THAN A 15;00 RAZOR ALSO OVER PRICED THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD IT TO BE FREE SHIPING WASTO BE FREE  AND I ORDER ONE AND RECEIVED TWO RAZORS I WAS CHARGED FOR TWO I CALLED AND WAS PROMISED A SHIPPING LABEL TO RETURN ONE AND HAVE NEVER RECEIVED RETURN LABEL ALSO ANYBODY CAN PURCHASE THE SAME RAZOR FROM WALLMART FOR 59;97 AND NO SHIPPING ALL DAY LONG SO THIS APPEARS TO BE A RIP OFF SAM</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husband, and so since I don&#x27;t shave, but he hasn&#x27;t complained once, I assume they are fine.</li>
    <li> These blades are reasonably priced and they really improved the shave I get from my old razor. The last set of replacement blades I bought were not as big an improvement over the blades they replaced as these are. They really improved this version of the replacement blades.</li>
    <li> These Remington SP 5161 Teflon coated rotary replacement heads and cutters work as intended and also give a smooth cut.</li>
    <li> Received package and knew I was in for trouble.  The whole top of the product packaging looked like it was cut off (appears to have been a return from another customer.)  I looked and looked to make sure that I ordered the correct replacement blades for my shaver when I was shopping online.  The Amazon website for this product listed my razor (Remington R-5150) as accepting it.  The box that I received did NOT list the 5150, which explains why they would not fit!!  To make matters worse, I broke a piece of the plastic housing on my old blade assembly while trying to replace the blades.  Now, I&#x27;ll be buying a new shaver which is what I was trying to avoid by buying the replacement blades.  I was a Norelco user for 40 years and this was my first Remington buy.  Now, it will be my last....Grrrrrrr</li>
    <li> Original blades were damaged by the airline baggage monkeys. These replacements cut about the same as the originals. It still pinches and pulls the occasional hair, but the original blades did that as well... a fault of the shaver design, apparently. After taking almost the entire shaver head apart, I discovered that the blades load from the top; a slight twist on each head, and it pops out. Buy the Remington lubricant, too.</li>
    <li> Had to replace the heads on my razor, and this was the exact thing needed. I got the thing back up and going, and am scruffy no more! Quick, convenient, and in stock, this was the right purchase to make</li>
    <li> My husband has used these replacement heads for years - in various shavers - LOVE IT! Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Just exactly what was advertised, fast delivery, great price, I am very satisified.</li>
    <li> great replacement hea /cutters.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I can purchase replacement heads instead of having to purchase an entire shaver. Installed easily and works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Not as good as original cutters and head cover doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> Well they work. They do their job and thats all I can really ask of new blades. Did a much better job than the original ones that were uh several years old. So they last much longer than the 1 year they say they should.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit,, like a new razor. Actually arrived earlier than expected. Fit my razor perfectly and it cuts like a new razor.</li>
    <li> The replacement head fit perfectly. went on easily and works just like new. I will definitly buy another set when I need to, in about a year.</li>
    <li> Do the replacements work?  Yes.  VERY well.  However...first thing you need to do is grab your magnifying glass to read the instructions.  Then throw them away because they don&#x27;t work.  There&#x27;s a dot and a dip.  MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS WHEN YOU START...because to put them on requires you to go in the opposite way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know...sounds really simple.  Remember what I said about the instructions.  I mistakenly put my faith in them.  I mean, this is a well know company, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah...dip and dot - remember where you start.</li>
    <li> Ever broken a razor head? I lost one, purchased this kit and have been shaving ever since. Must have been two or three years ago now.</li>
    <li> Much improved shaving experience.  Wish I&#x27;d bought them sooner. Used my originals far too long.  Won&#x27;t do that again.So there.</li>
    <li> Target, where I bought my shaver a few years ago, no longer stocks these replacement parts.  Since they wear out with regular use, blades and heads have to be replaced every year or so.  The shaver is a good product, and these replacement parts, though necessary, don&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> I used them the first time I received them. I was a little surprised that the whole head did not come off as that is how it looks in the pic but you have to insert each blade which is no biggie. I get much cleaner and easier shaves now. Will definitely be ordering when these start to dull.</li>
    <li> I think the quality of this item is very low, it said that might fit my razor but it does only if you change the heads, you can not change only the razors.</li>
    <li> works great and now I can go a long time with my same favorite  razor.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described. Best price on the internet. The quality of the product would be hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and it&#x27;s great to have sharp blades again. Nice price as well - definitely has improved the shaver.</li>
    <li> great price for replacement heads fast shipping</li>
