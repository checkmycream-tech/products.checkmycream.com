### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but I feel it will be great once my friend comes to cut my hair.  </li>
      <li>Looks good on the picture</li>
      <li>Works great in catching hair as it is being cut.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>works good for my son</li>
      <li>Fast shipping Very handy dandy Excellent product A+++++</li>
      <li>idea seems good, but it does not have the ability to tighten the straps to make it stand up more to catch hair, as it claims on the package it does.  </li>
      <li>If you cut hair at home, it&#x27;s handy.</li>
      <li>Got this one for a friend, as a gift, but have one of my own.</li>
      <li>I had used one of these hair-cutting umbrellas for years, until my daughter snatched it from me for her her own family hair cuts.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Perhaps if it was made with a sturdier material it would work better.</li>
      <li>The material used to make the umbrella part collects hair and is easily cleaned, and any remaining hair can be cleaned by flicking umbrella ring.</li>
      <li>Folds easily also.</li>
      <li>It also folds up easily and I secure it with a clothespin.</li>
      <li>I say thank you for such an exceptional offering that is the haircut umbrella!</li>
      <li>Like it because don&#x27;t have much to clean up.</li>
      <li>I really like how easy it is to use.  </li>
      <li>This product is all right.</li>
      <li>Once you open it, it tends to want to stay open.&lt;br /&gt;Costs more than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Looks like it would fit kids better, my husband has wide shoulders, but we make do and it works well.</li>
      <li>However, the product certainly does what it was designed to do.</li>
      <li>It works so can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
      <li>an item that can be stored away without bulk @ a reasonable price...</li>
      <li>Work out real</li>
      <li>and I am very happy with the hair cutting umbrella.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to be super careful with the cuttings as they fall right into the umbrella.</li>
      <li>I only wish I still had my older version.</li>
      <li>but I think it was due to the broad shoulders taking up much of the material.</li>
      <li>My husband has broad shoulders (he is a giant)</li>
      <li>My first one I wore out, this one works, seems to be a little smaller and not as heavy duty material as the first one.  </li>

<li> Love the hair cutting umbrella, now we can cut hair in the house and don&#x27;t have hair flying all around.</li>
<li> So-called straps too long had to pin them so that it would cup to catch the hair.  </li>
<li> It is nothing I expected.</li>
<li> That is not at all what I expected after reading description.</li>
<li> The one I&#x27;ve had for 25 years was much better than this with a larger base to catch hair.  </li>
<li> It just hangs down and around the shoulders.  </li>
<li> and we managed without creating a mess on the floor.</li>
<li> It catches hair well, a little awkward at first.</li>
<li> Hard to empty in the trash without hair spilling out.</li>
<li> toss the hair in the waste basket.  </li>
<li> Still had a few that manged to excape</li>
<li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair monthly, no more mess.</li>
<li> Stiff, wrinkly texture, can&#x27;t make the velcro closure very small, and it is nearly impossible to remove the umbrella without spilling the hair caught in it, in the first place.</li>
<li> Also, the opening for the head is small, so messes up the hair when removing.  </li>
<li> so this looked small on him</li>
<li> Also hard to take it off without spilling hair all over.</li>
<li> I have used a similar product for years to keep hair cutting mess under control when cutting my husbands hair.  </li>
<li> I finally ordered one and was disappointed.  </li>
<li> The disposing of the hair is a little awkward as well.</li>
<li> Poor quality</li>
<li> but in reality it&#x27;s difficult to use.</li>
<li> It is very inconvenient and hard to use it.</li>
<li> No more sweeping the floor or brushing annoying hair cutting from the clothes.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve seen these hair cutting umbrellas in catalogs for years.  </li>
<li> Edge of umbrella does not stand up as the picture shows, that is disappointing.  </li>
<li> I am very,very disappointed.</li>
<li> Horrible product</li>
<li> Terrible.</li>

    <li> Fast shipping Very handy dandy Excellent product A+++++</li>
    <li> Works well. My husband has broad shoulders (he is a giant) so this looked small on him but it did the trick and we managed without creating a mess on the floor. Still had a few that manged to excape but I think it was due to the broad shoulders taking up much of the material.</li>
    <li> works good for my son</li>
    <li> The one I&#x27;ve had for 25 years was much better than this with a larger base to catch hair.  This one allows a lot of hair to miss the catcher part.  Can&#x27;t find one like the one that finally wore out.</li>
    <li> This product is all right. It does its job. Once you open it, it tends to want to stay open.&lt;br /&gt;Costs more than it&#x27;s worth. But then again,  it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Love the hair cutting umbrella, now we can cut hair in the house and don&#x27;t have hair flying all around.</li>
    <li> Stiff, wrinkly texture, can&#x27;t make the velcro closure very small, and it is nearly impossible to remove the umbrella without spilling the hair caught in it, in the first place.</li>

    <li> It is very inconvenient and hard to use it. Also hard to take it off without spilling hair all over. That is not at all what I expected after reading description.</li>
    <li> Have always wanted one.  Definitely helps keep cut hair together.  Would like velcro to be longer for wider range of adjustability.</li>
    <li> This does the job. I cut my husband&#x27;s hair monthly, no more mess.</li>
    <li> Have to move around a bit because it gets in the way a bit.  Like it because don&#x27;t have much to clean up.</li>
    <li> Hard to empty in the trash without hair spilling out.</li>
    <li> idea seems good, but it does not have the ability to tighten the straps to make it stand up more to catch hair, as it claims on the package it does.  Also, the opening for the head is small, so messes up the hair when removing.  The hair just falls on the floor when removing the umbrella from the head, as you have to bend it to get your head out, thus dropping the hair.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have not figured out how to get the rim to stand up to catch the hair.  It may be simple, but I can&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> A simple item that can be used over and over without any muss nor fuss...an item that can be stored away without bulk @ a reasonable price...I say thank you for such an exceptional offering that is the haircut umbrella!</li>
    <li> So-called straps too long had to pin them so that it would cup to catch the hair.  Would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Edge of umbrella does not stand up as the picture shows, that is disappointing.  I am using it though.</li>
    <li> I thank you for your prompt delivery and I am very happy with the hair cutting umbrella.  As yet I have not used it but I feel it will be great once my friend comes to cut my hair.  Saves a lot of sweeping after the hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;Once again thank you.</li>
    <li> It is nothing I expected. Looks good on the picture but in reality it&#x27;s difficult to use. I am very,very disappointed. Horrible product and I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen these hair cutting umbrellas in catalogs for years.  I finally ordered one and was disappointed.  I had to shorten the straps with staples to get the bottom to stay turned up to catch the hair.  Perhaps if it was made with a sturdier material it would work better.</li>
    <li> I had used one of these hair-cutting umbrellas for years, until my daughter snatched it from me for her her own family hair cuts.  I really like how easy it is to use.  After the hair-cutting session, I gather the umbrella and  its content, lift it gently above the head and presto! toss the hair in the waste basket.  No more sweeping the floor or brushing annoying hair cutting from the clothes.  I do like it a lot.</li>
    <li> For my dad. Catches all of the hair. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Poor quality</li>
    <li> I cut my husbands hair and we always used a grocery bag to contain the clippings. Love this. You don&#x27;t have to be super careful with the cuttings as they fall right into the umbrella. Looks like it would fit kids better, my husband has wide shoulders, but we make do and it works well. It also folds up easily and I secure it with a clothespin. If you cut hair at home, it&#x27;s handy.</li>
    <li> It catches hair well, a little awkward at first. The disposing of the hair is a little awkward as well. However, the product certainly does what it was designed to do.</li>
    <li> Got this one for a friend, as a gift, but have one of my own. Works great in catching hair as it is being cut. The material used to make the umbrella part collects hair and is easily cleaned, and any remaining hair can be cleaned by flicking umbrella ring. Folds easily also.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an earlier version that finally wouldn&#x27;t close any longer.  I had no idea this product would change so drastically.  It just hangs down and around the shoulders.  Not at all like the photo.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.  I only wish I still had my older version.</li>
    <li> Thank You, It is just what I needed.  Work out real good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs Kelly</li>
