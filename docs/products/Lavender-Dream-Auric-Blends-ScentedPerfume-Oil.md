      <li>great shipping, good price.</li>
      <li>Reviews were good, and so was the price.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful, light scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>I love it and keep buying it again!</li>
      <li>that are really nice, so</li>
      <li>For some one who&#x27;s allergic to a lot of this kind of stuff</li>
      <li>I have tried many lavender perfumes and oils and this one smells as if you are standing in a field of lavender.</li>
      <li>more of a chemical-type smell.  </li>
      <li>My gift for my self love these Scented Oils.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
      <li>Overall, wonderful.</li>
      <li>Nice light fragrence</li>
      <li>people around me love the smell</li>
      <li>I guess this is ok, but on my skin it seemed too powdery.</li>
      <li>LOVE Auric Blends though.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent from them is [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>but then it is very mild.</li>
      <li>but I really enjoy this perfum.</li>
      <li>A heavenly, fresh clean aroma!</li>
      <li>I would not recommend if you are looking for a true Lavender smell.  </li>
      <li>this was an oil I would get something that smelled like true lavender.</li>
      <li>Strong when you first put it on</li>
      <li>For me, I&#x27;d rather just use pure lavender essential oil mixed with a carrier oil--instead of this, which if it does smell like lavender, really smells more like some really old lavender soap that you forgot you stuck in a drawer (very strong but in a more soapy-floral way than fresh lavender).</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable, too.</li>
      <li>and so if the scent is very intense at all, it will give me a migraine.  </li>
      <li>You just roll a little on and you are good to go.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell strong enough.</li>
      <li>This roll on has a very calming lavender fragrance.</li>
      <li>I had used the vanilla and coconut oils before and they were true to their scents so I was hoping for the same on this Lavender oil.</li>
      <li>This is very subtle and quite nice!  </li>
      <li>This is better for an everyday perfume if you just like the scent of lavender.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance and this made my head hurt.</li>
      <li>It felt like some cheap drugstore perfume for little girls playing dress up.  </li>
      <li>It has hardly any notes of lavender in it and smells more like old French-milled soap.</li>
      <li>Its not too powerful, and its one of those &#x27;hard to get&#x27; lavender sents that doesnt make me think of an old woman.</li>
      <li>Lavender Dreams by Auric Blends is a really pretty, soft, and lovely lavender perfume oil with a very small hint of jasmine and other green notes.  </li>

<li> This smelled really strange, not like Lavender at all,</li>
<li> My wife loves the natural scents and uses it everyday!  </li>
<li> This is not at all what I expected and it does not smell like Lavender.  </li>
<li> I have other fragrances from Auric Bends</li>
<li> I have to be very careful with fragrances because I get migraines</li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s either missing something or has something else in it besides lavender</li>
<li> Not sure if it lasts all day (i dont tend to sniff my wrists too often)</li>
<li> It is an oil based roll on perfume intended to be applied in scattered areas, i.e., behind the ears, on the elbow fold, etc.</li>
<li> no oil really and terrible smell</li>
<li> The smell isn&#x27;t horrible &amp; it lasts but it was what I had expected.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad just not what I was looking for.</li>
<li> Well, I was sadly disappointed when I received the item.</li>
<li> Nasty stuff.</li>

<ol>
    <li> My gift for my self love these Scented Oils.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> This perfume oil arrived on time, in perfect&lt;br /&gt;condition and was just what I wanted for a&lt;br /&gt;natural, lightweight perfume.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that becuase this was an oil I would get something that smelled like true lavender. Well, I was sadly disappointed when I received the item. It has hardly any notes of lavender in it and smells more like old French-milled soap. The smell isn&#x27;t horrible &amp; it lasts but it was what I had expected. I had used the vanilla and coconut oils before and they were true to their scents so I was hoping for the same on this Lavender oil.</li>
    <li> I expected a calming, natural smelling lavender and this isn&#x27;t it. I think it&#x27;s either missing something or has something else in it besides lavender that I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE Auric Blends though. My favorite scent from them is [[ASIN:B0000ZLEJG Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess Roll-On Perfume 1/3 oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a calming, night time lavender smell to relax you and put you to sleep, this is not it. This is better for an everyday perfume if you just like the scent of lavender.</li>
    <li> Lavender Dreams by Auric Blends is a really pretty, soft, and lovely lavender perfume oil with a very small hint of jasmine and other green notes.  Exceptionally priced for the beautiful fragrance!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the natural scents and uses it everyday!  She has been using this for years.  They last forever too!</li>
    <li> This is not at all what I expected and it does not smell like Lavender.  I would not recommend if you are looking for a true Lavender smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad just not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> How on earth did this get such raving reviews?  Maybe the fragrances were switched, but this smells nothing like lavender. I lived in England and France and know what lavender smells like. It felt like some cheap drugstore perfume for little girls playing dress up.  Nasty stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light scent. You just roll a little on and you are good to go. Nice light fragrence</li>
    <li> It smells like bug spray</li>
    <li> The best blend out there and The best smell out there</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, light scent.</li>
    <li> A heavenly, fresh clean aroma! I love it and keep buying it again!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.  Reviews were good, and so was the price.  I have to be very careful with fragrances because I get migraines and so if the scent is very intense at all, it will give me a migraine.  This is very subtle and quite nice!  I am happy with it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it lasts all day (i dont tend to sniff my wrists too often) but I really enjoy this perfum. Its not too powerful, and its one of those &#x27;hard to get&#x27; lavender sents that doesnt make me think of an old woman. Overall, wonderful. great shipping, good price. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Very very nice... people around me love the smell, I will re-order once I run out. Auric Blends has wonderful Scented/Perfume Oil and this one is a winner!</li>
    <li> This smelled really strange, not like Lavender at all, more of a chemical-type smell.  I have other fragrances from Auric Bends that are really nice, so I don&#x27;t know what was going on with this one.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> This roll on has a very calming lavender fragrance. It is an oil based roll on perfume intended to be applied in scattered areas, i.e., behind the ears, on the elbow fold, etc. Auric blends does a great job with their scented perfume oils.</li>
    <li> I guess this is ok, but on my skin it seemed too powdery. The jasmine notes overpowered the lavender. For me, I&#x27;d rather just use pure lavender essential oil mixed with a carrier oil--instead of this, which if it does smell like lavender, really smells more like some really old lavender soap that you forgot you stuck in a drawer (very strong but in a more soapy-floral way than fresh lavender). I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance and this made my head hurt.</li>
    <li> no oil really and terrible smell</li>

    <li> Strong when you first put it on but then it is very mild. For some one who&#x27;s allergic to a lot of this kind of stuff it is the only perfume i use.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for the perfect lavender scent this is it. I have tried many lavender perfumes and oils and this one smells as if you are standing in a field of lavender.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell strong enough.</li>
