      <li>Nice product, but kind of cheap looking.</li>
      <li>This mirror may be distortion free to someone who has good vision to start with, but it&#x27;s not distortion free to me.  </li>

      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>That is even better for travel.  </li>

      <li>The magnification is perfect for someone like me who recently had cateract surgery and lost close-up vision.  </li>
      <li>The price was too high in my estimation for product, but my wife was happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>My wife wanted a lighted mirror with more than 8 power magnification, so this one seemed to fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>Easy to take on trips.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to travel with, though I wish it had a padded carrying case.</li>
      <li>It is easy to store away and takes AA batts which is convient.  </li>
      <li>Strong recommendation for anyone to purchase.</li>
      <li>When I first tried to return it on Amazon I got a message saying it was hazardous material</li>
      <li>fine</li>
      <li>(Perhaps I didn&#x27;t read the fine print.)  </li>
      <li>but when it arrived it looked so cheap that I could not give it.  </li>
      <li>The magnification was great and the led lighting was bright enough to clearly see.  </li>
      <li>I always need to supplement with room light to see.</li>
      <li>and then I get the light.</li>
      <li>Hotels rarely have magnifying mirrors, so I was so glad to find this to do my make-up.  </li>
      <li>It folds flat which is great for tucking it away when not used or travel.</li>
      <li>found this item on Sky Mall while traveling, and originally ordered through them in December 12, but on 2/23 received a post card that they could not fulfill the order.</li>
      <li>this is the 3rd one I have ordered I love the mirrow except the movable part breaks very easily.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t bright enough, in my opinion, without additional area lighting.  </li>
      <li>I love this mirror, its very portable and I like how it runs on batteries because I can use it anywhere.</li>
      <li>Works Very Well but needs additional light source to be really useful; such as sun light or bright bathroom light</li>
      <li>Luckily I had one from another mirror</li>
      <li>The light button on my first one gave way.  </li>
      <li>The lights are just the right brightness and it truly is distortion free when you get your face the right distance away from the mirror.  </li>
      <li>I would have to say on this round, I&#x27;m not too happy.  </li>
      <li>The mirrors are very distortion free.</li>
      <li>Nice quality made and designed product that should last.  </li>
      <li>It runs on batteries and has more light then my regular lighted makeup mirror at home.  </li>
      <li>It is worth the price</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m just using the bubble wrap envelope it was shipped in to store the mirror.  </li>
      <li>However, that said, it&#x27;s perfect in all other respects: Size, the way the front and back swivel from normal to 10x magnification.</li>
      <li>The mirror was very portable, Solid, well built and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>- Amazon came through fast!  </li>
      <li>an added expense ... and this smaller mirror cost more than the Rialto.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed for travel.  </li>
      <li>I agree with other reviewers that a travel case would be really nice.  </li>
      <li>The positive is that it moves in any direction you want and it is 12 magnification.</li>
      <li>I have had several travel mirrors in the past and this one is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>My rating is really in between &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay&amp;#34;.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The lighting is great and very cool to the touch. No more hot lighting problems. Love the way it folds away! A very nice product that lived up to expectations.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this item! I use it every single day, and I couldnt be happier! It is perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> My wife picked this out for a Birthday present to replace one that she had broken.  Turns out it was an excellent choice.  She highly recommends this mirror for travel and use at home.  She particularly likes how it folds so compactly, multiple mirrors and lights.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect mirror to use for makeup and plucking those unwanted hairs. The lights really help. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife to travel with.  Light is bright, folds compactly ans securely.</li>
    <li> Hard to use because the LED lights shine from both sides.  Too small of a surface to adequately put makeup on.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very clear, and the size is perfect for home as well as travel.  You can see your full face on the zero mag side, and the close up on the magnification side is very good.  Love that it&#x27;s cordless, too.  I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> this is the 3rd one I have ordered I love the mirrow except the movable part breaks very easily.</li>
    <li> My wife needed a battery operated mirror for camping.  She was pleased by it&#x27;s versatility and fold-up compact size.  The price was too high in my estimation for product, but my wife was happy with the product.  Happy wife... happy life!</li>
    <li> not a strong as my 10X the lighting ok</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  The light button on my first one gave way.  I&#x27;ve had it for many years. Still use it along with my new one. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. I bought this as a gift my wife and she is very happy with it. The lamp is good quality and functionally good designed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why this mirror does not show an undistorted view on the magnified side.  I thought this was exactly the same one I purchased years ago, so I threw away all the packaging not realizing yet that only the bottom portion of the mirrow shows clearly. I would have to say on this round, I&#x27;m not too happy.  The bonus compact was so hard to open that my husband had to use pliers to open it for me.  Oddly enough, the tiny compact magnifies better than the big mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for travel: it&#x27;s lightweight and folds up easily, but best of all the bright light and high magnification enables the user to avoid &amp;#34;the clown effect&amp;#34; which happens when one attempts to put makeup on in dimly lit hotel rooms and guest suites.  I&#x27;m never leaving home without it!</li>
    <li> Mirror is a bit larger, thicker and heavier than i expected which is partly due to the double mirror.  I like that the entire mirror swivels if u want to look at the 1x side...so u don&#x27;t have to turn the whole thing around, just swivel the mirror head.  Its still small enough it my opinion to look nice by the sink or on a vanity or bureau and can fold down to about 1.5&amp;#34; when u want it out of site.  Nice quality made and designed product that should last.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I just received this vanity mirror.  I like the 12 times magnification.  It is much like my last one with 9 times magnification (Rialto), but it is smaller.  The problem with my last one is that the plastic piece holding the mirror and the swivel broke.  The jury is out as to whether or not this will happen with this one too.  While the company producing the mirror provided batteries, it did not provide the AC/DC adaptor, something I had assumed was included. (Perhaps I didn&#x27;t read the fine print.)  Now I will have to see if I can purchase an adaptor ... an added expense ... and this smaller mirror cost more than the Rialto. (The Rialto didn&#x27;t run on batteries, just AC/CD.)  With the mirrored tops, I doubt that either vanity mirror would survive in a travel bag.</li>
    <li> The mirror was very portable, Solid, well built and very easy to use. It was great! My fiancé loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Nice product, but kind of cheap looking. Both mirrors are what I expected. The lights are nice &amp; bright. A bit pricey though.</li>
    <li> Quality and ease of use and portability. It was every bit as described. The mirrors are very distortion free. It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> I am looking for a nice lighted travel mirror with magnification.  This is not the one.  You have to be so close to the mirror to get an undistorted view that there is no room for applying makeup.....and it really hurts my eyes.  I ordered this through Amazon and it came from Genesis21.  When I first tried to return it on Amazon I got a message saying it was hazardous material and I had to contact the seller.  If you are going to sell through Amazon, why don&#x27;t you allow us to return through Amazon?  I don&#x27;t like the extra hassle. Anyway, contacted them and I&#x27;m mailing it back tomorrow.</li>
    <li> it is compact and works great.  It is easy to store away and takes AA batts which is convient.  i love it.</li>
    <li> Just 2 things.  It could be a little brighter and the charger should have been part of the package.  i have orded other mirriors in the past and it has been included. Otherwise it was great!</li>
    <li> Woman I. House loves third</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter for her birthday.  She was very pleased with all the functions of this mirror.,,magnification for applying makeup, skin repairs, etc.  In addition, it folds so that it can be used conveniently for travel.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror to replace another mirror whose fluorescent bulb burned out and couldn&#x27;t replace. I like the fact that this has LED bulbs.  It provides ole&lt;br /&gt;Illumination and magnification for what I need</li>
    <li> OMG I love this little travel mirror.  It runs on batteries and has more light then my regular lighted makeup mirror at home.  It is very compact and I have taken it on two trips so far.  It is worth the price and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made - definitely not worth the price.  I purchased this as a gift but when it arrived it looked so cheap that I could not give it.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> On/off switch broke after only using it 3 days on a trip</li>
    <li> My wife loves this mirror.  Since it folds up, she takes it with her when we travel.  Less expensive than if purchased from other vendors.</li>
    <li> I love the magnified lighted mirror.  I will be taking this with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> This mirror may be distortion free to someone who has good vision to start with, but it&#x27;s not distortion free to me.  Oddly, when I put my glasses on, I can see in it fine but that kind of defeats the purpose. Since it&#x27;s quite expensive and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it due to distortion, I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research and this was the best bright light travel makeup mirror out there.  The light is great and makes it very easy to see in the mirror.  Some mirrors have a softer, dim or yellow light but not this one. It gives off a white light.  It swivels nicely and folds into a small size.  Even has a small section to hold some makeup.  I do wish it had a case.  I took it on a trip and my sister and cousin used it and they both ended up ordering one for their own travels.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror, its very portable and I like how it runs on batteries because I can use it anywhere. The only thing I see a slight problem with is the magnified side. You have to be really close to see on it and the lighting could be brighter.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for travel. Very compact, bright and shows every flaw which is a good thing!  found this item on Sky Mall while traveling, and originally ordered through them in December 12, but on 2/23 received a post card that they could not fulfill the order. Well, I&#x27;d already requested cancellation - Amazon came through fast!  The item is great...highly recommend</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for travel.  I have a soft cloth bag I put it in and tuck it in with my clothes.  The magnification is perfect for someone like me who recently had cateract surgery and lost close-up vision.  Hotels rarely have magnifying mirrors, so I was so glad to find this to do my make-up.  The lights are just the right brightness and it truly is distortion free when you get your face the right distance away from the mirror.  The price is much better than through some of the other catalogues that carry the same product.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a magnifying mirror with LED lights and this is perfect! It&#x27;s easy to travel with, though I wish it had a padded carrying case. I wrap it in clothing in my suitcase currently.</li>
    <li> Okay so I spent a very long time reading reviews and pick this merit. The positive is that it moves in any direction you want and it is 12 magnification. The negative is that the light is worth nothing after a short amount of time I have to use my little book light which twisted around and then I get the light.</li>
    <li> The magnification was great and the led lighting was bright enough to clearly see.  Strong recommendation for anyone to purchase.</li>
    <li> Great to travel with.  This vender was expensive &amp; the mirror could have been purchased for less.  Do get the electric adaptor as the batteries do not last long</li>
    <li> Very compact. Great light. Easy to use little expensive but worth the money. Easy to take on trips. Would also be a great gift</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these mirrors as gifts for my daughters because they are always doing their makeup on the go.  They say they are perfect and suit their needs to a T.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a lighted mirror with more than 8 power magnification, so this one seemed to fit the bill.  Plus it&#x27;s portable, battery powered.  With the LED lighting, the batteries should last quite awhile.  She&#x27;s happy with the way it works, and the quality of the light on here face.  It was a little spendy, but worth it for her!</li>
    <li> Of all the folding mirrors I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best!  LED light and magnification are both excellent.  The 12X is really distortion-free.  It might be a bit larger than other mirrors I&#x27;ve tried, but I find this a plus since you can see a lot more of your face.  The only suggestion I would make is:  I wish the mfg. had thought to make a nice slip cover or protective case to store this product.  This is my reason for only 4 stars.  Right now I&#x27;m just using the bubble wrap envelope it was shipped in to store the mirror.  Perhaps later I can find a cloth case to slip it into, especially for travel purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several makeup mirrors thru the years but this is the best ever. The lights are very bright and the mirror is very good quality. It folds flat which is great for tucking it away when not used or travel. The magnification is wonderful for checking your imperfections close up and tweezing. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have had several travel mirrors in the past and this one is by far the best.  It&#x27;s cordless portability and bright LED lights are unmatched.  It is very stable and the magnification is just perfect.  The only negative comment I have is it should come in a protective drawstring bag of some sort.  Luckily I had one from another mirror I had that was the proper size.  But I would not hesitate to buy this mirror.  It&#x27;s just perfect and just the right size for travel.  I love it !!!!!</li>
    <li> Very difficult to focus.  I was too lazy to return item so I will only use it for plucking eyebrows.</li>
    <li> From the picture, it looks like the lighting would be great....but it&#x27;s not.  My rating is really in between &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror everyday and it is easy to travel with--folds compactly. My only complaint about the mirror design is the lighting. Very small bulbs dot the circumference of the mirror and don&#x27;t provide sufficient light. I always need to supplement with room light to see. It would not be a mirror that would work in a dark room as the only light source for applying make-up or tweezing. However, that said, it&#x27;s perfect in all other respects: Size, the way the front and back swivel from normal to 10x magnification. The tray at the base is perfect for keeping small items like lipstick or tweezers. It&#x27;s a very handy mirror to have.</li>
    <li> Works Very Well but needs additional light source to be really useful; such as sun light or bright bathroom light</li>
    <li> Best Travel mirror ever!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  Great for travel; when power is lost in storms.</li>
    <li> Nice bright lights and the magnification is perfect. I love that you can fold it up for travel. I plan to get one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50+ and my vision isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  I need extra lighting and magnification when I travel.  This works great for both.  It isn&#x27;t bright enough, in my opinion, without additional area lighting.  I wish the lights had more punch.  It is small and lightweight. The mirror is roughly the size of a teacup saucer, which I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to in the description.  That is even better for travel.  It is battery operated but an electrical attachment can be used but is not included.  I don&#x27;t even think that was mentioned in the description.  I just borrowed one from another appliance.  I agree with other reviewers that a travel case would be really nice.  It probably will be fine in a suitcase if secured in the center of soft clothing.</li>
