<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I recently tried the oils from Plant Therapy and through my tests have found that these are very good oils. I especially like that each bottle comes with the oil label on the lid. Other suppliers that I have purchased from do not have labels. Yes, you can purchase the labels but I have found that the purchased labels DO NOT have every oil as an option and they are not cheap. I am a very happy customer and will continue to use oils from Plant Threapy.</li>
    <li> I love essential oils. This Ginger is no exception. Great stuff</li>
    <li> I love the smell of ginger root, and it is surprisingly hard to find ginger scented body products that are made from natural ingredients, so I am looking into formulating my own. This essential oil has a good, rounded aroma -- not too sharp, not too sweet. It comes as close to the smell of the real thing as any essential oil I&#x27;ve sampled so far, and the price was reasonable. It will be wonderful in hand lotion and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon quickly shipped this bottle wrapped well in bubble wrap, and it also had its own plastic seal around the cap. I am pleased with the excellent care taken to ensure no leakage occurred. I would certainly order from this company again: it merely remains to be seen over time how well the oil lasts.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It really does smell like fresh ginger root. I use it in soaps and it combines with other oils to give the overall scent a lovely, musky, earthy undertone. My favorite combination is ginger and grapefruit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried essential oils from quite a few different companies &amp; Plant Therapy is by far my favorite, the brand I keep coming back to. I love this ginger root oil, and I use it so often! I drink a drop of it in a glass of water for nausea or an upset stomach, I diffuse it for menstrual cramps, or I mix it with some carrier oil along with lavender, lemongrass, &amp; frankincense and apply topically for bruises. Very versatile, I highly recommend this oil!!</li>
    <li> CO2 processing ensures all the good plant parts and none of the unwanted ones. This works VERY well for any nausea or vertigo! I keep it for those who get motion sickness if any type! A great price!</li>
    <li> I use it in my pressure points on wrists along with sea bands for motion sickness or when I&#x27;m dizzy or not feeling well. Works awesome.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Plant Therapy essential oils. I bought a few different brands of oil and did the construction paper test where you put a tiny drop on the construction paper and if it goes away completely you know that it&#x27;s 100% pure. I tried five different brands. The only two that were 100% pure were the Plant Therapy and Young Living ones. The Plant Therapy brand is much, much less expensive than Young Living so I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> I love ginger. I love Plant Therapy. Do not hesitate to buy this. It is everything I hoped it would be and more.</li>
    <li> Very nice, love the scent, very nice grade</li>
    <li> Good quality oil...has good strong odor of genuine ginger.  Used to make lotion and smells great with sandalwood and patchouli.</li>
    <li> Got this for 1st aid kit motion sickness do far haven&#x27;t needed it but I&#x27;m ready!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Such a warm feeling. Calming for my kids and great for upset tummies.</li>
    <li> This oil is AMAZING!! If you suffer from circulation problems put a few driop in your bath and you will start feeling better. It is a powerful oil!!</li>
    <li> not enough oil and it really smells BAD..</li>
    <li> I have not yet used this oil.  I bought it to go into a headache relief recipe.  But i&#x27;m sure I will love it as I love all of plant therapy&#x27;s oils!</li>
    <li> Just a few drops sooth an upset tummy and smells wonderful.  Delivery was quick and bottle was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Will order more in the future and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love Plant Therapy, they are such a high quality, honest company. I purchased this product to help with my frequent motion sickness issues. I usually just use this via inhaling but occasionally I will use topically. When I use it topically I use it diluted in a carrier oil. The ginger oil smells just like fresh cut ginger. I can&#x27;t wait to try more products from Plant Therapy!</li>
    <li> Received in good order and in use now.</li>
    <li> Ahhhhhhh great grade, smell, feel and consistency.&lt;br /&gt;I am no expert, but I am diggin this EO and my body smells great!</li>
    <li> Love plant therapy oils!  The best. Fast shipping and quality products.</li>
    <li> A great essential oil to add to my diffuser at the end of the day to help me relax and fall asleep.  I also add it to different massage oils for whatever needs I may have at the time.  Smells great and the price is great too!</li>
    <li> I purchased Ginger to make my own menstrual cramp relief blend (5 drops sweet marjoram, 3 drops ginger, 2 drops Vetiver, 10 ml carrier oil).  This blend worked wonderfully to ease my cramps (they&#x27;re very bad the first two days). :) I believe that Plant Therapy Essential Oils are of good quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> it really has the fresh flavor as the plant, this is second time I buy the essential oil of this brand.</li>
    <li> Did not like at all. Ginger that&#x27;s crushed smells awesome.  This smells like dirt.  Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of the oil being concentrated.</li>
    <li> I bought this purely for the scent and it is very nice! I make lotions and body care products. I wish it was organic but you only need a few drops of it to do the trick. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This oil smelled very good and rich.  You can tell it is pure ginger oil.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This ginger essential oil is formidable.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll wake you up, but its scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I will buy more as it&#x27;s going fast.</li>
    <li> Gross smell, even when mixed with orange oil, could not deal with it</li>
    <li> This ginger root from Plant Therapy is a quality product at an excellent price.  Using it in conjunction with peppermint essential oil to combat motion sickness and nausea while traveling this week and it has proven effective!</li>
    <li> This was given to our daughter for her essential oil kit. She loves using these!</li>
    <li> high quality oil with a rich fragrance</li>
    <li> Nice light essential oil with a strong, but not overpowering, ginger scent. Mixes great with other oils and diffuses well.</li>
    <li> Excellent for massage oil blends, I mix this with Sweet Orange and Black Pepper. The ginger adds a warming feeling.</li>
    <li> it was just what i wanted and the scent is very nice. my orders always come quickly and securely wrapped. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Love! I have anxiety and this is so calming, it always makes my stomach feel better when I get too worked up. I just dab a drop on my wrists and mix with some coconut oil to run on my stomach and I am feeling better in no time.</li>
    <li> The oil came quickly and it smells good. Love the benefits of Ginger root.</li>
    <li> I am yet to start using this oil. We recd. it on time and it was packaged well. No leak or anything. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this as it said 100% pure as I planned to make ginger ale out of it.  After drinking one bottle the taste wasn&#x27;t bad but was a little off, then i read on the bottle that it&#x27;s for external use only.</li>
    <li> Excellent for arthritis mixed with baby oil</li>
    <li> I have a lung disease I mix this with orange perfect blend to relax lungs.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to use for sugar and salt body scrubs.  The scent is very natural and not over-powering.  The final products smelled heavenly!</li>
    <li> I received my 10 different essential oils in a timely fashion, and they were wrapped VERY well.  I am new to aromatherapy, and have no other oils to compare to, but these oils are being used by me with a diffuser, which is making my room smell delightful.  I dont know if they are any different from any other products.. but I am happy with my purchase at this point, and if I ever determine any different opinion, I will update it in a post.</li>
    <li> I tried to buy two other ginger root essential oils that are steam distilled and I have to come back to Plant Therapy&#x27;s. Plant Therapy extraction method is CO2 extraction and I believe that is why I prefer theirs over the others. They have the best ginger root. It smells like fresh ginger powder, I don&#x27;t know how fresh ginger root smells so I can not say. But I am going to buy the one ounce of their ginger root instead of this smaller one. Will definitely buy their ginger root again and again.</li>
    <li> This essential oil was my first purchase from this company. I am very pleased with the quality of the essential oil and speed of delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ginger essential oil smells fresh and lively, like real fresh ginger root. It is very potent... so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this ginger essential and company as well. I have since ordered more essential oils from them and am happy with all of them!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Great product and great value. Will definitely buy again when I need to add to my essential oil stash!</li>
    <li> Ohmygosh I love this oil! I bought it to use to make body butters, and everyone loves the smell in the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve become interested in aromatherapy. Ginger root has a nice rooty smell, so not terribly feminine~a man could use it without smelling like a flower shop. In addition to its most common use for motion sickness, nausea and stomach upset, It is said to be good for concentration, fever and flu, rheumatism and works as an aphrodisiac (sacral chakra)! Esoterically it is said to help release anxiety and motivate you to put plans into action, perfect for the New Year!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  The scent is great and so is the price.  Will continue to purchase my essential oils through Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> Great addition to potpourri or relaxing bath salts or soak. It will add the smell of fresh baked cookies and makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> I received the ginger eo quickly and unharmed. It smelled really good too. I have yet to put it in anything yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders. I&#x27;ve purchased alot of oils from them.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to add to my hair products to enhance them and it works beautifully! It&#x27;s a small bottle but I&#x27;m able to get a lot of use because of how I use them. I was spending so much money on hair products with ginger in them and I no longer have to do that. The smell is wonderful to me and when I use it my hair smell wonderful for days!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the ginger root.  It usually overpowers the other oils it mixes with which is nice since it is a better smelling oil.</li>
    <li> These are very good oils.</li>
    <li> I love this ginger root oil! My hubby and I both had upset tummies and we rubbed each other&#x27;s feet with this oil diluted in some sweet almond oil. Our nausea was GONE! I think the smell is amazing! Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t look at the description close enough. I wanted an oil that was digestible.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this today, and I am so glad I chose this one of all the ginger EO&#x27;s available.  It is reasonably priced, and it smells and tastes just like fresh ginger root!!! It is incredibly potent and spicy! Love it! :)</li>
    <li> The ginger root oil and all of Plant Therapy&#x27;s products are great.  They have high quality products at a reasonable price and this one is no exception.  I love doing business with this company.</li>
    <li> I have been pleased with all my purchases of plant therapy oils...they are high quality products and I would recommend them to anyone interested in aromatherapy.  I use them for making my own detergents and cleaning products.  The ginger root smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> Great oils, the purest I can find. Strong fragrance is so refreshing!!!</li>
    <li> fast shipping good price thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to essential oils, and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  This wouldn&#x27;t be my favorite scent, but that&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.</li>
    <li> I bought my essential oils through Amazon when just starting out in making soap........................Quality is excellent........ So if you would even like to try oils for your own aromatherapy, this would be great as well ..............</li>
