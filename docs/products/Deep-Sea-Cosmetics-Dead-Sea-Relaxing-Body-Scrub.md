<li> All of the dead winter, itchy, dry and peeling skin fell off, leaving this smoothness all over.</li>
<li> We bartered (she wouldn&#x27;t let me go) until she brought it down to $25.00 each.</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t stir it, you will end up with an uneven mix of salt and oils.</li>
<li> so I do not have to use it everyday.</li>
<li> the oil is not even aromatic, I think it is just plain oil..</li>
<li> Unfortunately when I received it it was extremely dissapointed.</li>
<li> It was ridiculously priced in the mall however, around $60.</li>
<li> and I scratched , so this salt stung a little while applying (my skin was so badly off).</li>
<li> She must be out her crazy @zz mind.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love the softness, scent and clean feeling after use  No longer feel like a dried up old prune!  excellent for relaxation--just like a home spa</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as fast as possible - sure it&#x27;s scrubbing me just fine but I&#x27;m left w/ what feels like baby oil smell and feel ALL over.  I now rinse it completely off with a body wash b/c it&#x27;s overwhelming.  However, they have another product I love with was a honey lotion.</li>
    <li> This product works great to rub on skin and remove the dead skin and when water is applied, it quickly desolves.  For the face finer granule may work even better.  I use it daily with good results.</li>
    <li> A co-worker told me about this product and I decided to try it.  Well, I just did and it has left my skin feeling so soft, that I am AMAZED since my skin is never smooth nor soft!! I have never used a salt scrub before and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I trusted my co-worker and decided to get it.  All of the dead winter, itchy, dry and peeling skin fell off, leaving this smoothness all over. Even my rough, dry hands feel baby soft.  Just be careful since my legs itched and I scratched , so this salt stung a little while applying (my skin was so badly off). I used about 2 teaspoons for all over the body, one for the upper and the other for the lower body and it was enough.  It has a pleasant smell and is mixed with lots of aromatic oils, so my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry at all.  This was one of my concerns.  I followed up with lotion afterwards.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I, like many people, first experienced this product at a mall.  I love this salt scrub.  I like the smell and how it turns to an oil as you scrub.  Do not buy this at the mall!! Amazon is much, much cheaper!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought some Deep Sea Cosmetics Dead Sea Relaxing Body Scrub and Coco Lime Body Butter at our local mall as a gift for me. I have to say he spent significantly more at the mall than what you will find for pricing on Amazon; even the website for these products are higher. Go figure. I use about a teaspoon of this body scrub on my hands to relieve dryness, though it can be used most anywhere. It does need to be gently stirred before using and I do mean gently, otherwise it may slop over the side. If you don&#x27;t stir it, you will end up with an uneven mix of salt and oils. It leaves my hands soft and smooth. I follow the scrubbing with Deep Sea Cosmetics Milk and Honey Body Butter; a little goes a long way. If you have dry skin, this is probably one of the best products you could use. I have also seen Dead Sea salt advertised as a remedy for dry, flaky skin.</li>

    <li> I love the product, it makes my skin look healthy and radiant and it feel&#x27;s so soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and leaves skin clean moist and very smooth! I&#x27;m living it and will use it forever and ever!</li>
    <li> to wet  not what i really wanted  to watery feeling  so when you go to use it you need to stir it first</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I&#x27;d tried it in the mall and was amazed with how my hands felt afterward. It was ridiculously priced in the mall however, around $60. This was a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grains are a lot finer than those at the mall, and there&#x27;s a lot more oil in it than the stuff at the mall, though maybe I didn&#x27;t order the exact same product from the mall. Also, my skin didn&#x27;t feel drastically different as it did in the mall.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin very oily and slick until you towel off, but my skin did feel a bit softer after I used it.

    <li> This product is wonderful and less expensive when purchased from amazon  gave one to a friend and we were both very happy with this product, the  Relaxing  sea body scrub.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this product before today.  I bought mine today...at the mall. She was trying to charge me $59.00 each (scrub and body butter). She must be out her crazy @zz mind. We bartered (she wouldn&#x27;t let me go) until she brought it down to $25.00 each. Long story short...I love the product. I haven&#x27;t used it on my entire body yet but my hands feel great.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells wonderful and leaves the skin much smoother than lotions. Good response from the vendor and received it fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this scrub as a gift for my Dad.  He has been plagued with hands and feet that develop thickened dry skin which cracks and bleeds becoming extremely sore.  Since using this product his hands and feet have cleared up completely.</li>
    <li> this is what my wife got from me before she loved it, so get it again is a no brainner.</li>
    <li> Your skin will feel pampered and soft after using this luxurious product. It smells divine too. i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> deep sea boby scrub- soften and deep clean my skin so I do not have to use it everyday. these two together makes me and my skin feel soo good and so soft and makes me love me even more</li>
    <li> I used some dead sea scrub from another company(obey your body) and i really love it so i decided to try this similar product. Unfortunately when I received it it was extremely dissapointed. the box has about 50% salt and 50% oil, as compared to very little oil on top of the other product...the oil is not even aromatic, I think it is just plain oil..this product does nt give a pleasant sensation neither scrubs well, you are simply very oiled down after use&lt;br /&gt;I will never use again, better buy other brands&lt;br /&gt;Sorry there is no possibility to give a zero star rating for this</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product! Well worth the money and it does what it says. Great for acne prone skin as well. No other product can compare to this. Try it on your feet. They will thank you! Also makes a great gift idea. Got to my door within the time frame. Products were in great condition.</li>
    <li> This scrub is absolutely amazing!!! I love the way my skin feels and also love the smell of this product!!! Deep sea products are the best!!!:)</li>
