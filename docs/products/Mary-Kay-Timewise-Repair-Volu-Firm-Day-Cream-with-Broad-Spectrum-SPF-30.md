      <li>My mom was happy that she got her cream so quick</li>

      <li>But for the most part skin was softer after the oily part was gone.</li>
      <li>After I lost some weight, it seemed that my skin was more wrinkly or saggy.  </li>

      <li>and I used to sell MK, so I favor most of their products, but not this one.  </li>
      <li>This cream is perfect as a moisturizer under my daily make up.  </li>
      <li>I have better results from this product an a lot of others.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s important to me because I have a very light complexion and have already had to deal with skin cancer.</li>

      <li>As with most Mary Kay products, it is a good quality moisturizing product that hleps your skin feel soft, renewed.</li>

      <li>it works FANTASTIC</li>
      <li>Thanks from Germany !!!</li>
      <li>my face is so soft and feels amazing.</li>
      <li>I use this day cream not only because it moisturizes my skin, but also because it&#x27;s a good sunscreen for your skin.  </li>
      <li>Most people say that I look as though I am 59 or 60 years old.  </li>
      <li>These products could be old or not even authentic at all.  </li>
      <li>I use this product all the time and love it, but the one 2 I receive are old cream and discolored.  </li>
      <li>It always peels/rubs right off my skin within minutes of putting it on.  </li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>I recommend people buying this product because you get it quick and its information was real.</li>
      <li>It looks like a nice size jar, when actually it could have fit in a tiny tube.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is a GREAT day cream, has all the benefits you need all day long and over a short period of time you can really start to see the wrinkles fade, however it has a shelf life of 3 years straight from the company/consultant, so I have no idea</li>
      <li>Love this stuff been using Mary Kay for 40 years and this new stuff makes me look 20 years younger!  </li>
      <li>My makeup looks much nicer with them also.</li>
      <li>Really like the fact that I can get this product at a lower price than what my Mary Kay consultant sells it for.  </li>
      <li>I have not noticed to much of a difference</li>
      <li>Will be ordering from here again real soon.........</li>
      <li>My skin has improved so much since I started using their products.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin before.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I am consistent to use them daily .</li>
      <li>how old these products are that are sold from these people who are not backed by MK, it may have been on their shelf for 5 or 8 years, buy from a consultant.</li>
      <li>I am over 71 years old.  </li>
      <li>Definately worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>The product was new and in its same box that was advertised.</li>

    <li> The product is fine.  Just was delivered later than what was expected from this seller</li>
    <li> Please order your Mary Kay products from an independent Mary Kay consultant. These products could be old or not even authentic at all.  Please don&#x27;t play Russian roulette with your skin.  Go to www.marykay.com/ageorge</li>
    <li> I have used it before and really thought it was great.  After I lost some weight, it seemed that my skin was more wrinkly or saggy.  This product seemed to help.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  I have a problem with cover, it does not close properly...</li>
    <li> I love all Mary Kay products. My skin has improved so much since I started using their products. Definately worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely!  MK products are the best!</li>
    <li> E͓̽x͓̽c͓̽e͓̽l͓̽l͓̽e͓̽n͓̽t͓̽</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT day cream, has all the benefits you need all day long and over a short period of time you can really start to see the wrinkles fade, however it has a shelf life of 3 years straight from the company/consultant, so I have no idea how old these products are that are sold from these people who are not backed by MK, it may have been on their shelf for 5 or 8 years, buy from a consultant.</li>
    <li> Great Price!!  Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Does everything it says it will!  This is all I put on my face during the day and I feel protected with the moisturizer and the spf 30.  I just reordered again and I continue to be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just a couple of Mary Kay products and am not impressed.  This had a &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; texture.</li>
    <li> This creme is very good</li>
    <li> Received product in April and it says it expires in July...just 3 months. No warning on the listing that it is almost spoiled, but it does look okay and the person getting it said it was okay.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay timewise repair volu-firm day is a wonderful product.  Delivered in a timely manner at a good cost.</li>
    <li> I am over 71 years old.  Most people say that I look as though I am 59 or 60 years old.  You will love what this does for your skin immediate results are seen.  You need to get the set to get ultimate results.  But purchasing this WILL WORK FOR YOU!</li>
    <li> PRODUCT Sold by AMAZING BEAUTY DEALS&lt;br /&gt;Product was not only NOT new, the inside access tab had be opened &amp; removed.  Also, the product had been used, as witnessed by residue of the product on the inside access platform.  Not only that, but after use for two days, the product pump no longer functions. To access the product, the inside components have to be unscrewed.  I, on the other hand, WAS screwed.&lt;br /&gt;  I have not contacted the seller.  She knows what she sold me.  I will never again buy from \\&quot;AMAZING BEAUTY DEALS.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Karl Kuykendall.&lt;br /&gt;  PS:  My wife was a Mary Kay Beauty Consultant for about 35 years, so I know what I am talking about.  Also, she would turn over in her grave if she knew people were selling Mary Kay products on the Internet.</li>
    <li> I just started using the Mary Kay product but can see a difference already.  I have better results from this product an a lot of others.</li>
    <li> In tried it and my face was red and irritated and also my eyes burn so bad.  I had to quit using it.</li>
    <li> It always peels/rubs right off my skin within minutes of putting it on.  and I used to sell MK, so I favor most of their products, but not this one.  (Darwin&#x27;s wife - Helene)</li>
    <li> I was expecting to receive this package within 4-7 business days, but I received it within 2 days! The product was new and in its same box that was advertised. I recommend people buying this product because you get it quick and its information was real. My mom was happy that she got her cream so quick and now she stopped complaining to me because she got her product lol</li>
    <li> I used this and was extremely disappointed especially for the amount of money it cost. Just because I hadn&#x27;t made a choice on what product to try next as a face moisturizer and didn&#x27;t have anything on hand I put some body moisturizer I bought on my face (Hempz Pomegranate) it works FANTASTIC my face is so soft and feels amazing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product</li>
    <li> This lotion contains a sun screen and it makes my foundation go on smoother.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I did like the cream, but I did not like the container.  The container was too heavy, especially if you wanted to travel - and I could not tell when I was running low.  It looks like a nice size jar, when actually it could have fit in a tiny tube.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed that the product expiration date was already expired when I received it.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time and love it, but the one 2 I receive are old cream and discolored.  Jar does not work properly to depress the cream out.  Broke!</li>
    <li> After using for two weeks I have noticed no difference. It is very smooth and non- greasy but just hasn&#x27;t done anything. I will continue to use the container and review after it has had more of a chance.</li>
    <li> Really like the fact that I can get this product at a lower price than what my Mary Kay consultant sells it for.  Plan to tell my other Mary Kay friends about this site.  Will be ordering from here again real soon.........Thanks!</li>
    <li> Product was good.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I use this day cream not only because it moisturizes my skin, but also because it&#x27;s a good sunscreen for your skin.  That&#x27;s important to me because I have a very light complexion and have already had to deal with skin cancer.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer actually made my face very red and irritated.  I tried to use every other day but that didn&#x27;t help.  I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> As with most Mary Kay products, it is a good quality moisturizing product that hleps your skin feel soft, renewed.</li>
    <li> I use both the time wise repair day and night  repair treatment products and am very satisfied with them. At 61 I am wrinkle free and love the way they make my skin feel. My makeup looks much nicer with them also. I am consistent to use them daily .</li>
    <li> This is the worst moisturizer ever!!! I have been using lotions for years and this is the first that burns my eyes and breaks me out something terrible. I thought it was just me but I had my husband use it (he has extremely dry skin) and a few days later the same thing happened to him. I do not recommend this products at all.</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect as a moisturizer under my daily make up.  It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, but just right.  What&#x27;s best of all, I don&#x27;t have to worry about sun screen because it&#x27;s in the product.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed to much of a difference and it burns  on my cheeks.  But for the most part skin was softer after the oily part was gone.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do I guess, but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin before.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff been using Mary Kay for 40 years and this new stuff makes me look 20 years younger!  so they say</li>
    <li> Thanks from Germany !!!</li>
