      <li>I loved this!</li>
      <li>What a great product.  </li>
      <li>results are still great, its just getting through the process that seemed to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and it shipped super duper</li>

      <li>My face feels very smooth after washing it off</li>
      <li>fast!&lt;br /&gt;-Katie :-)</li>
      <li>I used the apple cider vinegar, which I think would be more potent than just water.</li>
      <li>It is ok.</li>
      <li>I also love that this quality product comes from the USA (Wyoming).  </li>
      <li>Like most clay mask, redness can occur so we just do the mask when aren&#x27;t planning on doing anything that night.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love what it does to your skin and spirits.</li>
      <li>way more than I needed.</li>
      <li>Directions call for mixing with vinegar for better results which I did...</li>
      <li>if you wear contacts the vinegar can make your eyes water after awhile - but who doesn&#x27;t want better results?  </li>
      <li>Mixed with the Apple cider vinegar gave me the best results!</li>
      <li>However, better that than clogged drains.  </li>
      <li>I am very particular with what I use for skin care products, and this is amazing!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes in a powder form (I didn&#x27;t read the full product description, so I was a bit surprised when I opened the jar) which means you can mix the clay to your desired thick/thinness which is awesome.</li>
      <li>It cleared up quickly though and my skin felt amazing.  </li>
      <li>It washed off easily and without any pain.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and amazing!</li>
      <li>First off, I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest feedback, so here it is.</li>
      <li>and I loved how soft my skin was after just one use!</li>
      <li>I must say, you get what you pay for with the cheap clays.</li>
      <li>Light acne, discoloration, scars, etc.</li>
      <li>It made my face feel so smooth and clean, and like my skin could breath after using it.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this, to compare the two brands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So easy to use and make your skin feel so fresh and rejuvenated.  </li>
      <li>Great skin the following morning after trying it for the first time, and</li>
      <li>so everyone knows just how to get the full usage out of the clay.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend and I have used this mask a few times to great success!</li>
      <li>I saw this healing clay when I was searching around for a new type of face mask...and boy, am I glad I found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and we were ready to take it off!!</li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more when I run out!</li>
      <li>Fun to do as a group and mud it up with your friends.  </li>
      <li>Mixing it together and clean up is fairly easy - I suggest mixing it in a plastic cup or a ziplock baggie (it&#x27;s better to throw away leftover mix than put it down the drain).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a REALLY big jar &amp; i can see it lasting me like a year (unless i decide to cover my whoe body with it lol).</li>
      <li>I was heisitant at first to put vinegar on my face but it really seems to help clump it all together and dry more evenly on your face (and my sensitice skin is fine with the vinegar).</li>
      <li>Best part is that the rest of my skin was left  feeing soft not dry like other acne products would have made it:)</li>
      <li>I cannot wait to see what my skin looks like after using the whole jar!</li>
      <li>Although my skin does feel MUCH smoother (a plus!)</li>
      <li>My wife and I decided to use the Apple cider vinegar instead of water and that was an intense mask!</li>
      <li>GOOD NEWS is that it still worked just as well as the other brand, leaving my skin super clear and soft!</li>
      <li>They say they are pure high quality, but they are NOT!</li>
      <li>Afterwards, we put a little moisturizer on and our skin felt amazing.</li>
      <li>I have tried other Healing Clays and Bentonite Powders and even the super cheap ones -</li>
      <li>My skin is so much smoother and looks refreshed.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>and we&#x27;ve tried everything to heal it, but nothing has helped so far) and after washing it off it looked better and the skin was definitely softer.</li>
      <li>and cleaner after using it, it&#x27;s messy to use, I&#x27;m worried about clogging my drains, and I have used a fair bit of water to get it to rinse completely off (which kicked off the guilt sensors for me since we&#x27;re in a drought).</li>
      <li>Perhaps you can save it and just add more water after it&#x27;s dried out, but I wasn&#x27;t interested in trying that.</li>
      <li>received this product in exchange for my honest review, but I will probably stick to my usual brand that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
      <li>In the morning my skin felt nourished with the most even texture, and a couple pimples that looked like they wanted to surface were less noticeable.  </li>
      <li>We also applied some to my husband&#x27;s leg where he had a couple of decent scratches.</li>
      <li>that were mentioned in an info sheet sent to me, but I highly think this would be helpful to get sent out with the product</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve learned that the product seems to work a lot better when used with just a little bit of apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>We haven&#x27;t formed an opinion yet if using one works better than the other, so I think it&#x27;s just a personal choice.</li>
      <li>My skin was SO soft after using this!  </li>
      <li>So, I wasted a fair bit of clay both times, and even though I paid less than full price, I felt sort of lame for throwing out most of the mixture I&#x27;d made.</li>
      <li>did notice that this product was 100% pure organic sodium bentonite clay, where as the other brand is 100% pure organic calcium bentonite clay.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve added honey so far).</li>
      <li>reminds me of the ones LUSH masks- except those spoil/mold &amp;</li>
      <li>The only difference I noticed was my skin was much redder with the ACV.&lt;br</li>
      <li>All in all, like I said, my face definitely feels much smoother and cleaner, but if I&#x27;m going to do a clay mask, I&#x27;d rather use one that comes in a tube so that I could squeeze out just what I need.</li>
      <li>I only used half of the recommended mixture (1 Tbs. of water/1 Tbs. of clay) and it was more than enough to cover my face.  </li>
      <li>I mixed the powder with apple cider vinegar and left it on for about 20 minutes and after the first use I could already see a difference.</li>
      <li>It was super tight feeling</li>
      <li>Finally since my skin is dry I don&#x27;t typically get much acne however every once in a while I&#x27;ll be stressed &amp; get a huge zit.</li>
      <li>I scraped as much out of the bowl and off of my face to throw in the trash before actually rinsing anything, but again, this made me feel wasteful and also made my face red.</li>
      <li>I used it the first time mixed with water and the second mixed with the apple cider vinegar!</li>
      <li>I could barely keep the mask on for 10 min before having to take it off.</li>
      <li>Used it two times so far &amp; the bump on my chin just went away on the third day.</li>
      <li>The second time, I cut that in half (1:1), and while it was a little thinner, it was still way more than I needed.</li>
      <li>(it comes off easier when u let it dry completely, even if it starts to feel tight, and then a little help from a washcloth), although I am hoping to see more results upon continual use.</li>
      <li>However, for those of you who are interested in trying it out, here are a few tips: 1)</li>
      <li>The jar is also quite large, and holds a lot of powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the healing clay mixed with apple cider vinegar instead of water like recommended for a stronger mask last night, and after using it, my skin is noticeably softer, and feels a lot smoother (less bumps from acne and blackheads).&lt;br</li>

    <li> This stuff is GREAT!!! My wife and I decided to use the Apple cider vinegar instead of water and that was an intense mask! About 18 minutes in and our mask had dried almost all the way. It was super tight feeling and we were ready to take it off!! After we washed our faces we looked at our skin and it was red!!! We knew it had done the job! Afterwards, we put a little moisturizer on and our skin felt amazing. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My skin was SO soft after using this!  I only used half of the recommended mixture (1 Tbs. of water/1 Tbs. of clay) and it was more than enough to cover my face.  My face was red for a little bit after I washed it off but it was just from pulling all the toxins/metals out of my skin.  It cleared up quickly though and my skin felt amazing.  Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> First off, I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest feedback, so here it is. I tried the &amp;#34;Native Vitality Revitalizing Healing Clay&amp;#34; twice, and I don&#x27;t think I will try again. Although my skin does feel MUCH smoother (a plus!) and cleaner after using it, it&#x27;s messy to use, I&#x27;m worried about clogging my drains, and I have used a fair bit of water to get it to rinse completely off (which kicked off the guilt sensors for me since we&#x27;re in a drought). However, for those of you who are interested in trying it out, here are a few tips: 1) The directions say to mix 2 tablespoons of the dry powder with 2 tablespoons of water. I did that the first time, and it created a LOT of VERY thick wet clay... way more than I needed. The second time, I cut that in half (1:1), and while it was a little thinner, it was still way more than I needed. So, I wasted a fair bit of clay both times, and even though I paid less than full price, I felt sort of lame for throwing out most of the mixture I&#x27;d made. Perhaps you can save it and just add more water after it&#x27;s dried out, but I wasn&#x27;t interested in trying that. 2) Though I didn&#x27;t experience this problem, because the clay was so thick, I was worried that the clay from rinsing the bowl and from rinsing my face would clog the drain. I scraped as much out of the bowl and off of my face to throw in the trash before actually rinsing anything, but again, this made me feel wasteful and also made my face red. However, better that than clogged drains.  All in all, like I said, my face definitely feels much smoother and cleaner, but if I&#x27;m going to do a clay mask, I&#x27;d rather use one that comes in a tube so that I could squeeze out just what I need. It&#x27;d be less wasteful and less messy.</li>
    <li> Native vitality is the best. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this is quite soothing. I prefer to use the apple cider vinegar. Any other products in this line?</li>
    <li> Great skin the following morning after trying it for the first time, and then a week later I tried it again but used it two nights in a row.  In the morning my skin felt nourished with the most even texture, and a couple pimples that looked like they wanted to surface were less noticeable.  (Wonder what my skin would look like if I did this every night for a week!)  Directions call for mixing with vinegar for better results which I did...if you wear contacts the vinegar can make your eyes water after awhile - but who doesn&#x27;t want better results?  Suggest try only mixing half of what they tell you on the package and you shouldn&#x27;t have any leftovers to store.  My skin has been a bit red after washing the clay off, so suggest to only do this in the evening/night.  Seller sent an email after purchasing the product with some excellent tips and instructions.  Talk about great service!  I did receive this item at a discounted price for an honest review - and I will be purchasing this clay again.</li>
    <li> Makes my fave itch so bad I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful firming mask, and its organic!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I have used this mask a few times to great success! We found that when you mix the clay powder with water, the consistency tends to be a bit thicker and lumpier as compared to using it with apple cider vinegar (easier to mix and goes on smoother). We haven&#x27;t formed an opinion yet if using one works better than the other, so I think it&#x27;s just a personal choice. Mixing it together and clean up is fairly easy - I suggest mixing it in a plastic cup or a ziplock baggie (it&#x27;s better to throw away leftover mix than put it down the drain). Then when washing your face, I suggest placing a paper towel over the sink drain to catch the clay that washes off (again - just another way to prevent any drainage issues). I recommend using it once a week (depending on your skin sensitives, of course) and at nighttime. Like most clay mask, redness can occur so we just do the mask when aren&#x27;t planning on doing anything that night. As for the actual product benefits - we have definitely noticed smoother skin and no breakouts. That&#x27;s a skin care win! I received this clay mask in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  So easy to use and make your skin feel so fresh and rejuvenated.  Fun to do as a group and mud it up with your friends.  A little goes a long way.  Lots of use in one jar.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Purchase Vitality now!  You&#x27;ll love what it does to your skin and spirits.</li>
    <li> It is ok. Messy to mix, and you end up wasting plenty if you follow the instructions for how much to use. I tried it a few times with apple cider vinegar, and a few with water. The only difference I noticed was my skin was much redder with the ACV.&lt;br /&gt;It did not improve my skin in any way. Light acne, discoloration, scars, etc. no improvement.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I mixed with water and I loved how soft my skin was after just one use! We also applied some to my husband&#x27;s leg where he had a couple of decent scratches. After just a couple of applications the scratches looked better but he said they also felt better! This will definitely be one of our go-to household products!</li>
    <li> The Native Vitality Revitalizing Healing Clay is really starting to grow on me. I received this product in exchange for an honest review and I have used it once a week for about a month (on my face as a mask) and I&#x27;ve learned that the product seems to work a lot better when used with just a little bit of apple cider vinegar (like they state in the instructions). I was heisitant at first to put vinegar on my face but it really seems to help clump it all together and dry more evenly on your face (and my sensitice skin is fine with the vinegar). My face feels very smooth after washing it off (it comes off easier when u let it dry completely, even if it starts to feel tight, and then a little help from a washcloth), although I am hoping to see more results upon continual use. The instructions state to use 2 tablespoons of the clay but I can cover my face in a thick mask with just a little less than 1 tablespoon, so use only a little at a time, or else u might get stuck wasting some product. I am anxious to use this in other ways (than my face) that were mentioned in an info sheet sent to me, but I highly think this would be helpful to get sent out with the product so everyone knows just how to get the full usage out of the clay.</li>
    <li> I saw this healing clay when I was searching around for a new type of face mask...and boy, am I glad I found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a powder form (I didn&#x27;t read the full product description, so I was a bit surprised when I opened the jar) which means you can mix the clay to your desired thick/thinness which is awesome. The other big plus was the fact that since it is in powdered form, it won&#x27;t dry out, which is another complaint of mine solved regarding products like this. The jar is also quite large, and holds a lot of powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the healing clay mixed with apple cider vinegar instead of water like recommended for a stronger mask last night, and after using it, my skin is noticeably softer, and feels a lot smoother (less bumps from acne and blackheads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only recommendation I would have for this is product is that you should use 3 tablespoons of water/apple cider vinegar for every 2 tablespoons of clay. I thought the 2 for 2 recommendation on the directions made for a really thick clay mask, but it could be just my personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I am very particular with what I use for skin care products, and this is amazing! I used it the first time mixed with water and the second mixed with the apple cider vinegar! Mixed with the Apple cider vinegar gave me the best results! My skin feels so soft and amazing! I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> So as a person, that uses clay mask a lot  (I have always used a different brand) I was really excited to try this, to compare the two brands.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that this product was 100% pure organic sodium bentonite clay, where as the other brand is 100% pure organic calcium bentonite clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the mask, I mixed it with apple cider vinegar, it seemed to be a bit thicker than the other brand, so a little more difficult to apply evenly. Besides that, the most concerning, was that it immediately made my eyes burn and water like crazy. I have never had that happen to me, using the other brand. I could barely keep the mask on for 10 min before having to take it off. GOOD NEWS is that it still worked just as well as the other brand, leaving my skin super clear and soft! Perhaps, I had a weird reaction to the sodium.&lt;br /&gt;I did wait and tried again, with using only water, and the burning sensation still happened.&lt;br /&gt;The results are still great, its just getting through the process that seemed to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review, but I will probably stick to my usual brand that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
    <li> This clay is awesome, might as well be called &amp;#34;facial in a jar&amp;#34;.  My skin is so much smoother and looks refreshed.  I also love that this quality product comes from the USA (Wyoming).  I cannot wait to see what my skin looks like after using the whole jar!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I&#x27;m a fan of organic creams/lotions &amp; this mask reminds me of the ones LUSH masks- except those spoil/mold &amp;this one wont. Since it comes as a powder &amp;you mix it yourself with water (or apple vinegar) it&#x27;ll last for ever despite beeing organic! It&#x27;s a REALLY big jar &amp; i can see it lasting me like a year (unless i decide to cover my whoe body with it lol). Also what I like is that there is no smell to this product (smell typically means chemicals, which means it&#x27;ll dry out your face) For me this was a BIG plus beause i have sensitive &amp; dry skin &amp; its hard to find products gentle enough for it. I&#x27;ve purchased an Aveda facial product set before which had totally destroyed my skin &amp;made it peel! You can however add different scented oils to it (I&#x27;ve added honey so far). Finally since my skin is dry I don&#x27;t typically get much acne however every once in a while I&#x27;ll be stressed &amp; get a huge zit. I applied this mask when a REALLY painful big one was starting to appear on my chin and guess what? #1 it relieved the pain #2 the zit didn&#x27;t come the next day! Used it two times so far &amp; the bump on my chin just went away on the third day. Best part is that the rest of my skin was left  feeing soft not dry like other acne products would have made it:)</li>
    <li> I loved this! It made my face feel so smooth and clean, and like my skin could breath after using it. I used the apple cider vinegar, which I think would be more potent than just water. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and it shipped super duper fast!&lt;br /&gt;-Katie :-)</li>
    <li> Great product! I mixed the powder with apple cider vinegar and left it on for about 20 minutes and after the first use I could already see a difference. I also tried it on my husband&#x27;s elbow (he has very dry skin on one elbow and we&#x27;ve tried everything to heal it, but nothing has helped so far) and after washing it off it looked better and the skin was definitely softer. Will definitely be buying more when I run out!</li>
    <li> I have tried other Healing Clays and Bentonite Powders and even the super cheap ones - I must say, you get what you pay for with the cheap clays. They say they are pure high quality, but they are NOT! I must say that Native Vitality Revitalizing Healing Clay is by far the best healing clay that I have tried. I recommend this to all of my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Native Vitality Healing Clay is a terrific product.  I mixed it with apple cider vinegar and used it as an exfoliating mask.  I have tried other clay products before, and found they were painful when I would remove it from my face.  This product is different.  It washed off easily and without any pain.  I will definitely repurchase this item in the future.</li>
