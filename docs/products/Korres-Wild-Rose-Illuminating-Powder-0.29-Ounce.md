    <li> Great brand and easy to use product. Very versatile for face or body. Can use a little amount mixed with lotion on body for an illuminating sheen.</li>
    <li> Very nice powder. I use it on my cheekbones as highlighter. It is subtle but you can see it (as highlighter should be). You can layer it if you need more for an evening look. I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powder. I use it over a simple routine of moisturizer and BB Cream and it gives me a perfect clean and healthy skin look. I love the lightness of the powder, and it keeps my face from becoming oily throughout the day. It is a bit sparkly but it doesn&#x27;t come across looking unnatural at all.</li>
    <li> This is very illuminating. I use it over my blush on checks only. Great for sensitive skin. Product is smooth and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the Korres line so I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of this powder.

    <li> I love the subtle illumination of this powder. It is getting a little harder to find. The powder is not a brash shimmer, perfect for highlighting, but not over the top.</li>
    <li> I use a loose powder everyday over my moisturizer. I was skeptical of purchasing this product because it seemed liked it was part of a multi-step process intended to go over Korres foundation. But, I tried it anyway. It definitely does what it says; when I first put it on it illuminates my whole face and makes it brighter and seem to glow. However, as the day goes on, I find that my skin ends up getting too shiny/oily. I was using blotting sheets around lunchtime to try and mattify my skin, which I don&#x27;t normally have to do with other powders. I have since purchased Tarte smooth operator powder and continue to use the Korres powder as a highlighter.</li>
    <li> More pink than neutral. This makes a lovely highlighter for anyplace you want to draw the eye, but I think using it on the whole face would be a bit much.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it under my eyes and on my cheekbones. Gives me a great glow without looking at all glittery.</li>
    <li> I knew from review, this power has illuminating. But too shine to look natural. I believe it is good for night or dark place.&lt;br /&gt;I work school, which too shiny looking face .&lt;br /&gt;But I will keep this power, because somewhat my skin looks healthy . And it seems like less show wrinkle, dark sport .</li>
    <li> I really like the way my skin looks after I applied the korres illuminating.it made my skin glow.</li>
