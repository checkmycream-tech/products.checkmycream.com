      <li>I liked this razor but still felt it was too pricey and did not care for how close a shave it provided.</li>
      <li>The 6 blade system is awesome and really covers a lot of area.  </li>
      <li>The head has excellent flexibility which was particularly noticeable when working on areas like shins and knees.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;d use this again if I had to, but it&#x27;s not in my top three razors.</li>
      <li>So I felt like I was covering a lot of ground and getting a close shave, without the need to try for more strokes to get all the hair.</li>
      <li>I love this Remington razor.</li>
      <li>Compared to that, the Remington worked better.  </li>
      <li>However, my favorite part about this shaver is the packaging.</li>
      <li>I love the aloe lavender</li>
      <li>I can definitely say this is the best feeling razor I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a better razor</li>
      <li>The extra blade comes in its own cover, which is ideal for travel purposes.  </li>
      <li>I get a nice clean shave but no nicks.  </li>
      <li>It is ergonomically designed fit nicely in the palm of my hand and feel comfortable to use for an extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do have to say though that I really can&#x27;t see that the moisturizing strip does any good.  </li>
      <li>And, the blades are easy to change out with just the push of a button.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s some swivel to the head so that you can get into the curves easily.  </li>
      <li>I figure if it can clear out the &#x27;no shaving for months&#x27; to give me smooth skin ready for summer it&#x27;s got my vote for best razor</li>
      <li>What I like best about it, is that I have used so many different kinds of razors, and this one really gives my legs a smooth shave, without nicking myself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>handle is easy to hold and it fits comfortably in hand.  </li>
      <li>I was able to quickly shave without worry about cuts and knicks.</li>
      <li>Really comfortable</li>
      <li>What a smooth shave this razor provides.  </li>
      <li>The razor is easy to clean and replace.</li>
      <li>Amazon sent this twice and both times it was not the correct product, just a bunch of cheap disposable razors.</li>
      <li>In addition the handle is comfortable and flexible; it works will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Remington Radiant Smooth razor rocks.  </li>
      <li>The soap allows the razor glide smoothly and effortlessly.  </li>
      <li>The razor moves smoothly and doesn&#x27;t nick the skin.</li>
      <li>The razor&#x27;s head follows curves very well, glides easily, and  gives a very smooth shave with no nicks or cuts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unlike more traditional razors, the six-blade system does not leave you covered in nicks and scratches, and is effective in the more-difficult-to-shave bony regions.  </li>
      <li>The head swivels well to reach all the places for a clean shave.</li>
      <li>But overall this is a good razor.</li>
      <li>Other than that I&#x27;m completely happy with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather replace my cheap razor more frequently.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rinses clean, easily, and has a really convenience wall mount, with a suction cup on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found my new razor.</li>
      <li>You can expect a clean shave the first time around.</li>
      <li>It covers a large surface area and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s an awesome bend in the middle of the 6 blades that really let&#x27;s you contour around ankles and knees and such.  </li>
      <li>Is the cost worth it for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ultimately, it gave a nice, close shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cheap bic razors for about a year now, because they seemed as good as more expensive razors.</li>
      <li>With that said, the technology really has improved tremendously from those single-bladed razors.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ve ever felt the skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I admittedly didn&#x27;t like this razor at first.  </li>
      <li>I can get several more uses out of my Intuition</li>
      <li>That was fixed by simply adding a significant amount more water to the suction cup and trying again.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin (OK, OLD! skin)</li>
      <li>The moving head is of course nice, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s nice enough for the cost.  </li>
      <li>Again be careful when you clean this because a cut can easily happen.</li>
      <li>The feel of the handle is also a huge improvement over the straight handles of razors of old.  </li>
      <li>One swipe with the razor and it has pretty much obliterated any stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I actually noticed substantially more itching than normal.  </li>
      <li>The big rubber handle makes it easy to grip in the shower and comes with a suction case that allows the razor to attach to shower wall.</li>
      <li>This is a large shaving head and had a bit of &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; to it even when used with soap.</li>
      <li>The 6 blades did a good job of cutting off the hairs on my legs quickly and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It was a really close shave and left my legs super soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>My legs are very hairy</li>
      <li>This is really just a nice rubbery contoured handle that is sturdy and firm, but the head is really very flexible and bendy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This women&#x27;s razor works very well.</li>
      <li>And, if you really need that much strength could you make it a bit easier to get into.  </li>
      <li>With 6 blades, this is the razor that will get uber close to the skin without causing nicks, thanks to the way it&#x27;s designed.  </li>
      <li>I ended up with a really close shave and no cuts at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done men&#x27;s shaving razors, Nair, sanding pads, an electric razor (gradation gift in high school!)</li>
      <li>It has six blades that gives you a very close shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It shaves very close, and gets around ankles nicely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I am left with a smooth, close shave.</li>
      <li>As for the multiple blades, I thought my cheap razor did just as well.  </li>
      <li>The last razor I used was nice, but it only had three blades, and I didn&#x27;t think there would be much of a difference, but there really is a difference.</li>
      <li>The six blades may have trimmed my hair faster but not in any real noticeable fashion.</li>
      <li>that nicks easily, and this razor with its wide shaving head and six blades was very gentle with me.</li>
      <li>Other razors sometimes skip right over some fine, silky hairs, but this one gobbled them all.</li>
      <li>It has stayed sharp and given many smoothe shaves.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The 6 blade coverage seems amazing, but I am unsure how long one cartridge will last?  </li>
      <li>, letting it all grow (yes, UC Berkeley in the 60s/70s), epilation, waxing, new improved epilation, disposable razors, and finally the REMINGTON PRODUCTS WOMEN&#x27;S RADIANT AND SMOOTH SIX-BLADE SYSTEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Handle is comfortable and allows for good flexibility to curve around tough areas to shave such as around ankle or knee.  </li>
      <li>Sadly the greatest impact these six blades versus five has is that it is more difficult to clean the six because they are closer together.</li>
      <li>The head pivots up and down and the rounded sides are lined with silicon, which makes shaving armpits much more tolerable.  </li>
      <li>The blades are very sharp now but that&#x27;s how most of my razors start out.  </li>
      <li>This is significantly better than the Gillette Venus, which is what my partner used previously.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The head swivels well to reach all the places for a clean shave. The moisturizing strip makes the razor glide quite well but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last. I don&#x27;t know if all 6 blades are needed but it does not seem to hurt either.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my girl friend and she reports: The six blades provide a lot of float so to speak which helps prevent nicks and cuts.  Really comfortable to hold and suction cup allows it to be placed in a convenient place in the shower/bath.</li>
    <li> I am comparing these to my favorite razor Schick Intuition which is very expensive in my opinion.  The six blades are very sharp and give you a VERY close shave.  Be extra careful on your first use.  I was not so afraid of cutting myself after the first shave, however still a very close shave and I felt I needed extra moisturizer after using.  With Intuition I do not use any shave cream, with these razors, I used a body oil wash as I felt I needed something to help it glide better.  Razor lasted 4-5 uses.  I can get several more uses out of my Intuition and I prefer having the cream built in to the razor.  I liked this razor but still felt it was too pricey and did not care for how close a shave it provided.</li>
    <li> I was able to quickly shave without worry about cuts and knicks. I was really impressed that it would go with the curves of your body and not cut you.  With other razors, I tend to frequently cut my knees. I am not sure how much of a difference there was between the 3 blades and 6 blades (this razor has 6).I  shaved half of my body with my old razor, and the other side with this new razor, and the hair grew back at the same rate. The handle is very comfortable (your thumb fits well without sliding off). The suction cup that it comes with actually stayed on the wall. Others I&#x27;ve tried would fall off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a better razor and I finally found one! It was a really close shave and left my legs super soft and smooth. The blades are flexible so it was easy to shave the difficult edges like around the knees.</li>
    <li> This women&#x27;s razor works very well. It has two sets of three blades. The big rubber handle makes it easy to grip in the shower and comes with a suction case that allows the razor to attach to shower wall. The blade itself rolls with the contours of your body making it easy to shave underarms, legs and other parts of the body. The razor is easy to clean and replace. You can expect a clean shave the first time around. The price is reasonable and it comes with an extra cartridge. There is a band that contains Aloe, Lavender and Vitamin E. Good concept, but I&#x27;ve used competing razors that have greater utilizing thus feature. But overall this is a good razor.</li>
    <li> I admittedly didn&#x27;t like this razor at first.  I had become accustomed to the lady-razors with the soap and I&#x27;m spoiled.  The soap allows the razor glide smoothly and effortlessly.  When I started on this razor, it tugged and pulled slightly in my arm pits.  Not the razor itself but the plastic part just above the blades.  However, shaving with and then against the hair gave me the smoothest shave ever!  I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ve ever felt the skin so smooth and soft.  With the soap-razors I wonder if the residue prevents a close shave? I&#x27;m not sure but I&#x27;ll be purchasing refills for this razor from now on.</li>
    <li> For a long time I&#x27;ve been using Schick&#x27;s Intuition razor.  Compared to that, the Remington worked better.  The 6 blades did a good job of cutting off the hairs on my legs quickly and smoothly.  My legs are very hairy and usually I have to rinse a lot as I&#x27;m shaving because the little hairs get stuck in the little blade.  Maybe it was because of the extra blade, but I didn&#x27;t have to rinse the Remington as much.  In addition the handle is comfortable and flexible; it works will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only question is how long the original pack of 6 blades will last me.  The blades are very sharp now but that&#x27;s how most of my razors start out.  The refills seem really expensive.  Other than that, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Best ever for my legs. I have sensitive skin (OK, OLD! skin) that nicks easily, and this razor with its wide shaving head and six blades was very gentle with me. Other razors sometimes skip right over some fine, silky hairs, but this one gobbled them all. I am afraid to find out how much the replacement blades might cost, but I&#x27;ll be buying them.</li>
    <li> The head is very flexible but the overall razor is less moisturizing than I would have liked. We like the color and the convenience of the suction cups which hold the entire assembly to the shower wall. The overall look is &amp;#34;pink, girly, and fashionable,&amp;#34; in the words of my partner. There is the convenience, of course, of the extra blade. You get a close shave, but not quite as close as with long blades. This is significantly better than the Gillette Venus, which is what my partner used previously.</li>
    <li> On the plus side, I didn&#x27;t cut myself with it - that the main advantage of these multi-blade shavers. On the down side, I&#x27;m spoiled  from using the Venus razors that have a &amp;#34;moisture strip&amp;#34;  that makes soap or lather unnecessary for shaving. This is a large shaving head and had a bit of &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; to it even when used with soap. I&#x27;d use this again if I had to, but it&#x27;s not in my top three razors. Ultimately, it gave a nice, close shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  I get a nice clean shave but no nicks.  I have dry, super sensitive skin.  Despite this, I&#x27;ve had no razor burn or rash after the fact.  I&#x27;m glad I found my new razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cheap bic razors for about a year now, because they seemed as good as more expensive razors. This Remington one with six blades changed my mind though, because the extra blades give it more surface area, so it sits solidly on you as shave. So I felt like I was covering a lot of ground and getting a close shave, without the need to try for more strokes to get all the hair. I ended up with a really close shave and no cuts at all. Plus the head moves really well and has this flicking action where it attaches to the handle, so that feels really solid as well and I didn&#x27;t feel like it was going to come apart like some other razors I&#x27;ve tried. I can definitely say this is the best feeling razor I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Ah, the shaving products women use in a lifetime... I&#x27;ve done men&#x27;s shaving razors, Nair, sanding pads, an electric razor (gradation gift in high school!), letting it all grow (yes, UC Berkeley in the 60s/70s), epilation, waxing, new improved epilation, disposable razors, and finally the REMINGTON PRODUCTS WOMEN&#x27;S RADIANT AND SMOOTH SIX-BLADE SYSTEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order of use these products have been:  bloody, stinky, time consuming, loud and ineffectual, time to move on, ow, expensive and time consuming, slightly less ow, haphazard, and HEY, THIS THING REALLY WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike more traditional razors, the six-blade system does not leave you covered in nicks and scratches, and is effective in the more-difficult-to-shave bony regions.  I use it in the shower blindly yet when I emerge I appear to have neatly and painlessly removed any hair that needed removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> The Remington Women&#x27;s Radiant and Smooth Razor is very good razor overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is easy to hold and it fits comfortably in hand.  The razor&#x27;s head follows curves very well, glides easily, and  gives a very smooth shave with no nicks or cuts. Also, I have had zero armpit burn! I love the aloe lavender strip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have only found one con, the razor head is large which makes it difficult to use in bikini area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this razor again.</li>
    <li> The Remington Radiant Smooth razor rocks.  I love that the head of it is a little larger than standard razors - for me this speeds up shaving.  There&#x27;s some swivel to the head so that you can get into the curves easily.  Like the aloe too.  All in all a really good shave.</li>
    <li> Love this razor!  I&#x27;ve been waiting for a good quality, affordable replacement for the razon I&#x27;m currently using and this is it.  There&#x27;s an awesome bend in the middle of the 6 blades that really let&#x27;s you contour around ankles and knees and such.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I love this Remington razor. It has six blades that gives you a very close shave. What I like best about it, is that I have used so many different kinds of razors, and this one really gives my legs a smooth shave, without nicking myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a nice grip, and fits in my hand very nicely. I use it in the shower, and it never slips out of my hand, even when I&#x27;m shaving under my arms. The shave it gives is very smooth and silky. I think the six blades have a lot to do with that. The last razor I used was nice, but it only had three blades, and I didn&#x27;t think there would be much of a difference, but there really is a difference.</li>
    <li> Amazon sent this twice and both times it was not the correct product, just a bunch of cheap disposable razors.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s the razor, a holder that sticks to the shower stall wall, and an extra blade cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves smoother underarms and legs with very little effort and no nicks or cuts.  This was my first wacking away at the legs since the last fall early winter and it was no trouble at all.  I figure if it can clear out the &#x27;no shaving for months&#x27; to give me smooth skin ready for summer it&#x27;s got my vote for best razor I&#x27;ve tried so far in mumbly-mumbly years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 rather than 5 stars is because it took me nearly 10 minutes to get the thing out of the clamshell plastic.  Come on people who needs that much stiff plastic for a simple razor package.  And, if you really need that much strength could you make it a bit easier to get into.  Once I sliced open one end, I found I couldn&#x27;t pull the two section apart -- finally, I gave up and cut all the way around two more side to get it out.  Granted I&#x27;m not a weight-lifter but I&#x27;m not totally lacking in upper arm strength either -- so be prepared to just cut the edge off the packaging.</li>
    <li> This razor works well for many shaves. It has stayed sharp and given many smoothe shaves. However, my favorite part about this shaver is the packaging. It pops right out of the package without having to use a hacksaw to get through the thick plastic. I will buy this blade system again.</li>
    <li> (Note: I&#x27;m writing this for my wife) No complaints at all about this women&#x27;s razor. The head has excellent flexibility which was particularly noticeable when working on areas like shins and knees. The multi-blades do a nice job of cutting, and leave the skin feeling soft. My wife really likes it, though doesn&#x27;t feel it performs better (or worse) than the Mach 3 system she&#x27;s used previously.</li>
    <li> Wow! It&#x27;s rare that I am impressed with a razor. They all are pretty much the same. Until now.  This comes with 6 razors! It&#x27;s surrounded by a textured rubber backing, I assume this helps to lift hairs. The blades move, pivot, bend, etc. Then I tried it &amp; wow. I noticed it especially when I did my underarms. They were the smoothest they have ever been with shaving!  No nicks or cuts and I am left with a smooth, close shave. I will be buying this in the future!</li>
    <li> What a smooth shave this razor provides.  The head pivots up and down and the rounded sides are lined with silicon, which makes shaving armpits much more tolerable.  (No one ever talks about arm pits!)  No more poking the soft underarm tissue!  The handle is ergonomically designed with a quick-release for the blade.  The extra blade comes in its own cover, which is ideal for travel purposes.  The carrier for this comes with an inch-wide suction cup which can be placed in the shower area.  NOTE:  BLADES LAST LONGER WHEN DRIED COMPLETELY AFTER EACH USE AND STORED IN A DRY AREA, which makes a &amp;#34;wet blade&amp;#34; less useful if consumers go by that notion alone.  Wet environments damage a blade&#x27;s lifetime considerably.  If taken care of properly, this razor should last a few months.</li>
    <li> The ergonomic handle on this razor make it easy to work with even if your dexterity is a little off at times (like me with MS and quite a bit of neuropathy and don&#x27;t get a solid handle sometimes on razors).  The 6 blade system is awesome and really covers a lot of area.  One swipe with the razor and it has pretty much obliterated any stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if 6 blades (or 4 or 3) really make that much of a difference in the long run ... but as far as area covered, 6 blades seem to make for more coverage and a more complete shaving stroke.  The one issue that you may want to think about in the long run is the cost of use.  A 4 pack of refills cost $11.49 (at this time on Amazon).  Is the cost worth it for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 6 blade coverage seems amazing, but I am unsure how long one cartridge will last?  Time will tell.  If they last as long as other disposable razors, then the cost of entry seems high.  Personal choice.</li>
    <li> This is really just a nice rubbery contoured handle that is sturdy and firm, but the head is really very flexible and bendy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves very close, and gets around ankles nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinses clean, easily, and has a really convenience wall mount, with a suction cup on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very nice</li>
    <li> One of the best women&#x27;s razors on the market,it provides a smooth close shave without any nicks. I do have to say though that I really can&#x27;t see that the moisturizing strip does any good.  Other than that I&#x27;m completely happy with it.</li>
    <li> With 6 blades, this is the razor that will get uber close to the skin without causing nicks, thanks to the way it&#x27;s designed.  After using a couple of times on legs and underarms, I&#x27;ve found it to be very effective, no cuts and easy to use and can quickly clean with rinsing off after use.  Handle is comfortable and allows for good flexibility to curve around tough areas to shave such as around ankle or knee.  The package contains one extra replacement cartridge/blade.  Only slight negative is the moisturizing strip isn&#x27;t a complete replacement for a cream product (or a thicker moisturizing body wash).  If your skin tends to be on drier side, recommend using a moisturizing product with it and/or after shaving.</li>
    <li> I usually use cheap razors and thought this would be an improvement but I think it just confirmed my previous conclusion - a razor is a razor is a razor.  The moving head is of course nice, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s nice enough for the cost.  As for the multiple blades, I thought my cheap razor did just as well.  I had not shaved for about a month (it&#x27;s cold here, why bother) and I had to go over the same areas just as much as I did with my other razor.  I actually noticed substantially more itching than normal.  Overall I don&#x27;t mind using it, but I won&#x27;t buy replacements.  I&#x27;d rather replace my cheap razor more frequently.</li>
    <li> This razor replaced a 5 blade Remington version that also could hang up and be used in the shower. Only time will tell how long it will hang on the tiles but it seems to have a wider suction cup so perhaps it will last longer. The base that you put the razor in is also larger and the razor has to be lifted up and pulled out to be removed which means you really can&#x27;t do it very well without looking at it but then it wouldn&#x27;t be very safe to do it with your eyes closed because of water or suds coming down. Razor is a razor and you can cut yourself if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you can keep it in the shower, the moisturizing strip is rather pointless after a few showers however. The first and second usage I could feel that strip but after that, nope, it didn&#x27;t feel like anything. The six blades may have trimmed my hair faster but not in any real noticeable fashion. Sadly the greatest impact these six blades versus five has is that it is more difficult to clean the six because they are closer together. Again be careful when you clean this because a cut can easily happen. It comes with one extra razor cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is entirely decorative but the package is purple, black, and white yet there is no purple on the razor or the base which I think is just really odd.</li>
    <li> I remember the days when a razor had a single blade and you changed it out when it became dull.  Those days seem to be long gone and here we now have a six-blade razor - I never thought I&#x27;d see the day.  With that said, the technology really has improved tremendously from those single-bladed razors.  With this razor I do not fear cutting myself, even when using it on bony curves like my ankles.  And, the blades are easy to change out with just the push of a button.  The feel of the handle is also a huge improvement over the straight handles of razors of old.  It is ergonomically designed fit nicely in the palm of my hand and feel comfortable to use for an extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially when I attached the holder to the wall of my shower, it held for about 5 seconds before falling with a clatter.  That was fixed by simply adding a significant amount more water to the suction cup and trying again.  Since then it has held for weeks, even with me taking the razor in and out of it.</li>
    <li> The package includes a handle, two cartridges, &amp; a holder attached to a suction cup. Each cartridge has 6 blades. The razor moves smoothly and doesn&#x27;t nick the skin. It covers a large surface area and leaves the skin smooth. Great shaving device!</li>
