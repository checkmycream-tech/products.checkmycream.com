### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>toxicity rating on the EWG website was just about perfect.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect product for Winter.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with how it turned out.</li>
      <li>Awesome self tanner is the best i have used so far!!looks</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>Gorgeous and EVEN color, at that!  </li>
      <li>and it pointed her to this product and as anticipated  finds this to be a great product.</li>
      <li>This self tanner is great.</li>
      <li>get lots of compliments on how nice my tan is!</li>
      <li>I also found that when reapplying, it really is best to exfoliate well in the shower, too, before putting on more.</li>
      <li>Works so so good just make sure to wash your hands after applying I had a beautiful all over tan and orange hands that took days to scrub off!</li>
      <li>This is a perfect fit.  </li>
      <li>When I was done the bottle felt like I didn&#x27;t use any at all, so I thought If I get good color from it, then hip hip</li>
      <li>Leaves nice color, smells great.</li>
      <li>very pleased .she</li>
      <li>ever it smells great not like most self tanners and maybe for others it would work</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
      <li>LOVE the color this one produces after just one use!</li>
      <li>My favorite self tanner!</li>
      <li>The spread-ability is amazing.</li>
      <li>Leaves a nice even color.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, there is a hint of DHA smell to it</li>
      <li>It smells nice on application, but as with any self tanner you will get an after smell from the chemical reaction, this one isn&#x27;t too bad.0</li>
      <li>It gave me a nice glowing orangey peachy look for a day or</li>
      <li>is kind of a pain.</li>
      <li>With Jergens I had to use a lot to yield a reaction but stuff is much more effective.</li>
      <li>This product gives a nice color but the coconut smell is so strong it&#x27;s nauseating.</li>
      <li>Nice, quick results!  </li>
      <li>I have tried MANY self tanner products over the years.</li>
      <li>streaks and freckles terribly, not what it claimed to do</li>
      <li>Nice light fragrance, streak free and gives a nice tan.</li>
      <li>Has a nice light smell to it and goes on evenly.</li>
      <li>Overall awesome though.</li>
      <li>she says its ok</li>
      <li>I have had many compliments are</li>
      <li>*, organic, you can feel safe and healthy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Just light and nutty kind</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t streak at all.</li>
      <li>It has a smell but not too strong.</li>
      <li>Again, fine for the body, not for the face as it states.</li>
      <li>It is also organic and natural, with an amazing score on EWG,which is very important to me.</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
      <li>extremely* sensitive skin on my legs, and have been seeking a good self-tanner that I can use without irritation.</li>
      <li>The smell is fine; it&#x27;s light and not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>The color lasts significantly longer than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Finally a self tanner with a tolerable fragrance, actually pleasant,</li>
      <li>So right now it&#x27;s a good rich *natural* golden brown color</li>
      <li>Just make sure you blend very well.</li>
      <li>I dont know if I just dont spread it in good enough or what.</li>
      <li>Less chemicals, great color that isn&#x27;t orange</li>
      <li>The color it produces is a very nice dark ran color not orange at all.</li>
      <li>Pros : a little goes a long way - a tiny amount spreads all over the place, no smell, super even, blends perfect into areas that you don&#x27;t put it, blends perfect on hands and feet, golden but not yellowy, all natural</li>
      <li>At the time, I had my favorites and never thought I would be able to replace them with a natural, non-toxic alternative.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll overlook it since I love that it is natural and gives me the tan I want.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using sunless tanner for years and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Other than that the color is pretty good.</li>
      <li>and I could probably achieve close to that with one more applications and being a little more liberal about the amount (but not on face</li>
      <li>Great product overall, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
      <li>goes on smooth and looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>I got very nice medium brownish golden color (not yellow golden) with a minimal amount.</li>
      <li>The best part about it is that a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Would absolutely buy again!</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend it :)</li>
      <li>we lose most of it starting at sixty.</li>
      <li>Waste of good money.</li>
      <li>This works very well to give a natural appearing glow, but the smell is teeny strong when you put it on and while it soaks in.</li>
      <li>I thought how would I ever get more than one and a half full body applications...</li>
      <li>Not bad for a natural tanner.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a natural sunless tanner ever since I learned that the ones you buy at the drugstores are full of chemicals.</li>
      <li>I like the scent, not that usual self tanner smell, its very light and a bit sweet.</li>
      <li>I use it on the face and have never broken out from it.</li>
      <li>This lotion is not tinted, very moisturizing, can be used on the face (hypoallergenic).</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
      <li>and I have never broken out after using a self tanner for the face.</li>
      <li>Really rubbing it in until it was evenly soaked into my skin.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really is very pure,natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is no color guard, so I couldn&#x27;t really see where it was going.  </li>
      <li>*really</li>
      <li>Too waxy and very stinky.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>my nice, dark tan and people are very surprised when I tell them that it is not from the sun but a self</li>
      <li>(well ok, sometimes i could maybe detect like 1% of what you get with the other self tanners, but really it&#x27;s like nothing)</li>
      <li>I am light to medium now that I am religious about sunscreen an live in the NW, but like to build my color to a darker medium shade.</li>
      <li>Better than any other self tanner I have tried!</li>
      <li>I typically put this on in the evening, let it &amp;#34;air dry&amp;#34; a bit in front of the TV and then wake up in the morning with a lovely tan.</li>
      <li>I will agree with some of the other reviews on the scent being a bit strong.</li>
      <li>Fake Bake gives great color but is drying an the tint</li>
      <li>However, I just applied it like I normally would lotion.  </li>
      <li>I ended up a bit more tan than I wanted after the first use because I lathered too thick.</li>
      <li>and I am very sensitive to smells.</li>
      <li>Works well using only a little bit, just make sure you wash your hands afterwards</li>
      <li>Really would like my money back.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted something as absolutely natural as you could get and it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Gives a natural looking color.</li>
      <li>so natural...</li>
      <li>It is VERY greasy and takes 8 or so hours to finally absorb.</li>
      <li>I ordered this because of it&#x27;s natural ingredients and rave reviews.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this product. I like that as far as I can see, there are no harsh chemicals in this and after a few hours I turn golden brown! Just make sure you blend very well. I didnt on my face and later on I saw streaks. I like the scent, not that usual self tanner smell, its very light and a bit sweet. I usually go to the tanning salon and I never got this dark after a session. I wish the bottle was bigger but Ive noticed a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this self tanner! Finally a self tanner with a tolerable fragrance, actually pleasant, no streaks, natural results with one first application, no orange look and not laden with harsh chemicals. I started with the Dark shade, now I think I will try the Medium to maintain. I have olive skin. No regrets with this purchase.</li>
    <li> love it! goes on smooth and looks very natural.  get lots of compliments on how nice my tan is!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have *extremely* sensitive skin on my legs, and have been seeking a good self-tanner that I can use without irritation. I like that it&#x27;s a vegetable-based DHA, which seems to be the trick in creating less irritation for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit to dry; it&#x27;s certainly not an instant glow. I typically put this on in the evening, let it &amp;#34;air dry&amp;#34; a bit in front of the TV and then wake up in the morning with a lovely tan. It won&#x27;t streak and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my sheets, but it does leave a very slight sticky feeling (like you just put on lotion, which, duh). The smell is fine; it&#x27;s light and not unpleasant. I also found that when reapplying, it really is best to exfoliate well in the shower, too, before putting on more.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used and I think I&#x27;ve tried them ALL</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted something as absolutely natural as you could get and it&#x27;s toxicity rating on the EWG website was just about perfect. This stuff really is very pure,natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I got it out of the box I almost got really mad. It is the smallest bottle of self tanner I&#x27;ve ever had and therefore, at this price, the most expensive. I thought how would I ever get more than one and a half full body applications...So I decided to exfoliate (i just use plain natural cane sugar and it really gets rid of all dead skin and works awesome)and put the smallest amount that I could get to lightly cover everything, which is about 4 pea sized squirts per arm, 1-2 on face, 2 quarter sizes per leg...etc. You really don&#x27;t need much at all. The spread-ability is amazing. When I was done the bottle felt like I didn&#x27;t use any at all, so I thought If I get good color from it, then hip hip hooray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started seeing color after about 2-3 hrs...fully developed after 6hrs, so don&#x27;t lose hope after a couple hours. I got very nice medium brownish golden color (not yellow golden) with a minimal amount. I&#x27;m the type that likes the color from an airbrush tan at the salon (but you should never inhale the mist from spray tans so i stopped doing that) and I could probably achieve close to that with one more applications and being a little more liberal about the amount (but not on face, it got dark enough on face!) So right now it&#x27;s a good rich *natural* golden brown color and I&#x27;m very happy with how it turned out. Looks like that teensy weensy expensive bottle will last a while :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell :  What smell?? There was no development smell! Not even a little bit. (well ok, sometimes i could maybe detect like 1% of what you get with the other self tanners, but really it&#x27;s like nothing) and I am very sensitive to smells. I can usually smell stuff other people can&#x27;t. It only ever smelled like natural lotion. Just light and nutty kind of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros : a little goes a long way - a tiny amount spreads all over the place, no smell, super even, blends perfect into areas that you don&#x27;t put it, blends perfect on hands and feet, golden but not yellowy, all natural *really*, organic, you can feel safe and healthy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons : I cannot find anything I don&#x27;t like about this product! I definitely recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural sunless tanner ever since I learned that the ones you buy at the drugstores are full of chemicals. I used to buy Jergens but just couldn&#x27;t do it after I learned the ingredients in these are hormone disruptors. So I started looking online. I also wanted one that could produce a DARK color. I like to use it on my legs since they don&#x27;t tan as well as the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the color this one produces after just one use! I have had many compliments are my nice, dark tan and people are very surprised when I tell them that it is not from the sun but a self tanner!&lt;br /&gt;It does have the usual sunless tanner smell that I not a fan of but I&#x27;ll overlook it since I love that it is natural and gives me the tan I want.</li>
    <li> This product turned my skin orange. Be careful!</li>
    <li> Thumbs down. It gave me a nice glowing orangey peachy look for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Not bad for a natural tanner. I use this only for my face and the only thing I notice is that it tends to make you face a bit hot, also must wash off your hands after applying or they will turn orange.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  Like everyone else, I had heard about the toxic chemicals in the self-tanners that I have been using for years.  Being a cancer survivor, I have been trying to go all organic.  This is a perfect fit.  The best part about it is that a little goes a long way.  You may be surprised at the size of the bottle when you get it and think it is too small, but don&#x27;t let it&#x27;s size fool you.  It goes a long way.  No orange, no streaking, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like the other self tanners do.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This self tanner is great. The color it produces is a very nice dark ran color not orange at all. I will agree with some of the other reviews on the scent being a bit strong. It&#x27;s not as bad as others I&#x27;ve tried however, I always put it on at night so I don&#x27;t worry about going around smelling like it. This is a smaller bottle but it has lasted me a long time, a little goes a long way. Great product overall, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like the color is gives, but whenever I put it on, it&#x27;s always spotty. Its never uniform. I dont know if I just dont spread it in good enough or what. Other than that the color is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Works so so good just make sure to wash your hands after applying I had a beautiful all over tan and orange hands that took days to scrub off! Would absolutely buy again!</li>
    <li> Not as advertised....................Does not tan well at all.  Have used far less expensive products with much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite self tanner! Less chemicals, great color that isn&#x27;t orange and it doesn&#x27;t have that nasty tanner smell!</li>
    <li> This is True Stale Crap! This product stunk so bad, because it was so old when I got it. I would recommend to everyone to NOT  ever buy this product, especially by this seller.I didn&#x27;t even dare try wearing it because it smelled so stale when I opened it.</li>
    <li> Gives a natural looking color. It still contains DHA though. It has a smell but not too strong. Read ingredients.</li>
    <li> my wife is using this since day it arrived. very pleased .she had done the research and it pointed her to this product and as anticipated  finds this to be a great product.</li>
    <li> This product gives a nice color but the coconut smell is so strong it&#x27;s nauseating.</li>
    <li> Has a nice light smell to it and goes on evenly.I actually mix a dime size amount into my regular lotion to help spread it out and make it last. Leaves a nice even color.</li>
    <li> Nice, quick results!  I use the tanning beds a couple times a week during the summer, but I never tan my face &amp; neck (an age/vanity thing)&lt;br /&gt;I use this self tanner so that my face &amp; neck blend with the rest of my body.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it can be a little splotchy after using for several days in a row and it could be a little darker. I wish it was possible to build a darker tan with continued use. I use this morning &amp; night after washing with a &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; scrub.  When it starts looking splotchy I skip a couple days of use. I&#x27;ve tried it without the scrub to build a darker tan, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t streak at all. It smells nice, there is a hint of DHA smell to it but I had to hold the bottle to my nose to detect it and never even got a whiff after it was applied. A word of caution- if you are naturally pale (like I am!) use sparingly! I ended up a bit more tan than I wanted after the first use because I lathered too thick. With Jergens I had to use a lot to yield a reaction but stuff is much more effective.</li>
    <li> I initially had my doubts.  I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tanners for 10+ years and had given them up when I found out the amount of terrible chemicals they contained.  At the time, I had my favorites and never thought I would be able to replace them with a natural, non-toxic alternative.  Boy was I wrong.  This stuff is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out white.  There is no color guard, so I couldn&#x27;t really see where it was going.  However, I just applied it like I normally would lotion.  Really rubbing it in until it was evenly soaked into my skin.  I only applied it to the upper part of my body and face to test it.  After a couple of hours I was already seeing color.  Gorgeous and EVEN color, at that!  There were no streaks, I was amazed.  Even my old favorite tanners used to leave at least some streaks.  I went to bed that night and when I woke up the tan was even deeper and my skin felt extremely moisturized.  This is the perfect product for Winter.  Will definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> I prefer this self tanner to Fake Bake, Lavera, and basically every well reviewed tanner out there. Fake Bake gives great color but is drying an the tint is kind of a pain. Lavera is too orange for me. All of the drugstore brands (Loreal, Nutragena, Jergens....) were either too drying, too orange, or upon continuous use would &amp;#34;scale.&amp;#34; Not pretty. I am Hispanic/Caucasian, and have very little pink tone in my skin color. I am light to medium now that I am religious about sunscreen an live in the NW, but like to build my color to a darker medium shade. This lotion is not tinted, very moisturizing, can be used on the face (hypoallergenic). I use it on the face and have never broken out from it. I like to use it about 3 times a week, exfoliating one to two times a week, so my tan fades naturally. This is the only tanner that I constantly get complimented on. It is also organic and natural, with an amazing score on EWG,which is very important to me. It also has one of the least offending odors out there. It smells nice on application, but as with any self tanner you will get an after smell from the chemical reaction, this one isn&#x27;t too bad.0</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using sunless tanner for years and this is by far my favorite. The color lasts significantly longer than others I&#x27;ve tried. Bonus - it doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets!</li>
    <li> Leaves nice color, smells great. I am of Italian decent, I&#x27;m not naturally dark at all but my skin does have an olive tone to it and this doesn&#x27;t make me look orange.</li>
    <li> Better than any other self tanner I have tried! Nice light fragrance, streak free and gives a nice tan. Multiple applications will give you a darker color.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Too waxy and very stinky. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> It was expensive, turned my skin orange and it streaked . I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to any one. I can&#x27;t believe I ordered Two and it wasn&#x27;t cheap. Waste of good money. Sorry the truth hurts. Oh and I had to SCRUB it off with Chlorox!!!!  Really would like my money back.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister and she just loves it!</li>
    <li> This works very well to give a natural appearing glow, but the smell is teeny strong when you put it on and while it soaks in. It has a coconut scent and smells a little like sunscreen. Overall awesome though.</li>
    <li> This is the only self tanner that I have ever used that leaves a natural, yet dark tan without any streaks! I&#x27;ve got numerous compliments lately at dinner parties, formals, and most recently a wedding. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> girlfriends uses it....she says its ok</li>
    <li> streaks and freckles terribly, not what it claimed to do</li>
    <li> This product did very little for me I do have dark skin olive complexion and I was hoping this would give me some color!&lt;br /&gt;How ever it smells great not like most self tanners and maybe for others it would work I am over 70 so things don&#x27;t take like they use to&lt;br /&gt;In my pigmentation  we lose most of it starting at sixty.</li>
    <li> Works well using only a little bit, just make sure you wash your hands afterwards</li>
    <li> Awesome self tanner is the best i have used so far!!looks so natural...and lasts alot longer then other self tanners...just got another bottle!! You wont be dissappointed..</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY self tanner products over the years. I ordered this because of it&#x27;s natural ingredients and rave reviews. I like this product for the body, but it should never be touted as a product for the face. It is VERY greasy and takes 8 or so hours to finally absorb. It&#x27;s not the type of self tanner you can apply on the face and go in public afterward; unless you don&#x27;t mind looking oily and greasy. It also broke my skin out and I have never broken out after using a self tanner for the face. Again, fine for the body, not for the face as it states.</li>
