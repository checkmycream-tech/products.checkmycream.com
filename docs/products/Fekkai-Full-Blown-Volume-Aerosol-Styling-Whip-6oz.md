      <li>but it&#x27;s very fine and tends to wilt.</li>
      <li>Feels nice and silky in my hand and it&#x27;s easy to work through my hair.</li>
      <li>This is not a product or line of products I am real familiar with, but this particular product is very nice.</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;hair momma&amp;#34; but my youngest daughter wanted to get one of those cute A line bob type cuts.  </li>
      <li>smells great and works very well.</li>
      <li>It seems to support wave, curl, volume and style better, even when used with the hair spray or alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fekkai’s lighter touch does give my hair more softness and shine than the Paul Mitchell sculpting foam does.  </li>
      <li>It definitely gives my hair a lot of volume and smells delicious!</li>
      <li>When I used it as the directions stated, I achieved better results.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off with Suave.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for 8 years and put more on my hair</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>

      <li>I really love how it makes my hair look and feel</li>
      <li>Glad we have a month to practice before school starts  </li>
      <li>I found all it did was add a scent and nothing much more.</li>
      <li>Because it is rather pricey and doesn&#x27;t work that much better than the drugstore/grocery store brands.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending more to get more, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I cannot believe it since I love Fekkai shampoo.</li>
      <li>Fekkai&#x27;s Styling Whip smells amazing, a unique salon scent of citrus and mint.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite mousse or styling product, but it is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>This product offers a perfect light styling help for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>really did not see good performance out of this mousse</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply--you just squirt it on your hands and put it on your hair, but it&#x27;s supposed to add volume</li>
      <li>I did like the scent, not too strong and it didn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>Very soft and pleasant.</li>
      <li>love Fekkai Full Blown Volume Aerosol Styling Whip.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a Paul Mitchell mousse for years with good results, then for the past year have bumped it up to a gel with great results.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this gives me texture and volume.  </li>
      <li>This styling mousse adds a touch of volume and control to my fine, color-treated hair.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I was told it helps add volume to fine hair.</li>
      <li>This Aerosol Styling Whip from Fekkai should be light and airy and it is when in your hand.</li>
      <li>Even mousse can be too heavy, but this styling whip is just perfect for me!</li>
      <li>My hair is wavy and it tends to get frizzy and this product was a bit too light for me.</li>
      <li>like the light fresh scent of this product the most - and it did leave my hair feeling/looking a bit fuller.</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing, very fresh, light with a hint of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product overall.  </li>
      <li>They are very tricky to get right, and need a good mousse and some judicious blow-drying to get them to do what I want them to do.</li>
      <li>Smells very fresh and citrusy.  </li>
      <li>This would be the perfect product for fine or thin hair to give it more body and manageability.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a light fruity mint, the scent will not last on your hair, but it is pleasant while you are applying it.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it is very light and works good for my very fine thin hair.</li>
      <li>Nothing stood out as being significantly better in quality than cheaper alternatives, but she liked the product overall.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and airy and works very well</li>
      <li>just right!  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, and in particular a cowlick that makes my bangs want to part where I don&#x27;t want them to part.</li>
      <li>Fekkai full blown volume styling whip</li>
      <li>Next morning still looking good.</li>
      <li>, I thought perhaps that the Full Blown Volume Aerosol Styling Whip would work well hand in hand with</li>
      <li>Full volume is what you get.  </li>
      <li>When you first dispense the product there&#x27;s a strong grapefruit scent, but that dissipates once your hair is</li>
      <li>Sure, I like the occasional luxury item, but it is more of an impulse buy at the fancy make-up stores.</li>
      <li>For the price, I expected a bit better performance out of it on its own.</li>
      <li>Another point in Fekkai’s favor is that my hair does not get oily as quickly as it does with the Paul Mitchell.  </li>
      <li>My short, fine hair has more volume without being sticky or greasy and it still looks good the next day.</li>
      <li>I let my friend who has straight, fine hair try it</li>
      <li>I have more of a natural look and don&#x27;t like to pile on the products to achieve what my hair doesn&#x27;t want to do.</li>
      <li>She said the front felt so nice and why doesn&#x27;t the back ever feel that way...</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s really the only good thing I can say about this product.  </li>
      <li>what do you know the back was as nice as the front after trying this whip.  </li>
      <li>I wish other hair products smelled as good as this.  </li>
      <li>There were so many products that worked incredibly well, and it was like an oasis to buy, because every other brand didn&#x27;t meet such high expectations as Fekkai.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;styling whip&amp;#34;, or what normal people call mousse, does not work well on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>For when I want to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair, I use this, blow dry, and use those Caruso steam rollers (which are my favorite tool!)</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy or frazzled as some products can for my baby fine hair, but left it nice and soft.</li>
      <li>She trusts the brand also very much.</li>
      <li>, of course, nothing is forever good, and Fekkai changed all the ingredients, and in general, changed the entire product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>think this would work even better for short layered cuts.</li>
      <li>like I expected on its own.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the smell and it is very light and works good for my very fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I have fine hair and this gives me texture and volume.  The price is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> Not packaged properly and sprayed out in the box during shipment,clear cover was not in the box.Not worth the trouble or money, adds some volume but strange texture.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy this product again.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> Blegh. Save your money. I bought this because I was told it helps add volume to fine hair. I found all it did was add a scent and nothing much more.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;styling whip&amp;#34;, or what normal people call mousse, does not work well on my fine hair. This stuff is extremely expensive for mousse and it doesn&#x27;t work well for hair that gets frizzy. You&#x27;re better off with Suave.</li>
    <li> Lightweight mousse- doesn&#x27;t get sticky or goopy. I really love how it makes my hair look and feel (never crunchy)</li>
    <li> This mousse is not nearly as nice as the product it just replaced.  It smells nice--but adds none of the fullness of the previous product, which really added body to hair.  I will probably be switching to another brand, rather than purchasing more of this. . . . any suggestions?</li>
    <li> This item was given to me for my review.&lt;br /&gt;Just love Fekkai Full Blown Volume Aerosol Styling Whip. It&#x27;s one of the few mousses that works on my fine hair giving me both volume and shine. I find most styling products like this have a tendency to dry my hair out, but not this one, so far. It has a light lemon/citrus/ginseng scent, that is not overwhelming. This is not a product or line of products I am real familiar with, but this particular product is very nice.</li>
    <li> I have very thin and fine hair and have to be careful of adding any styling products that might weigh it down. Even mousse can be too heavy, but this styling whip is just perfect for me! It&#x27;s very lightweight, but still helps me style my hair and maintain that style throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have long straight fine hair. Usually don&#x27;t do much with it, but now and then I need to glam up. So I get out the big big velcro rollers and up she goes. No curl, just a lot of body and that big hair look. Since it&#x27;s such a bother I was thinking about getting a styling gel to help the hold last longer. So I tried out the new styling mousse by Fekkai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a light non sticky mousse and it is easy to pump a small amount out of the can so you don&#x27;t waste any. The fragrance is a light fruity mint, the scent will not last on your hair, but it is pleasant while you are applying it. I applied just a bit evenly to the crown of my hair where I wanted the volume. Went out to the garden to pick beans and it was dry in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make sure my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down with product, I skipped conditioner after shampooing and used a light spray of de-tangler instead. Combed out hair and when slightly damp applied the mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked very well. Next morning still looking good. You&#x27;re not going to get a stiff hold here, but a soft natural volume which was just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would work even better for short layered cuts. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> This styling mousse adds a touch of volume and control to my fine, color-treated hair.  I&#x27;d recommend applying about a golf-ball size amount to the root area only before blow drying.  When you first dispense the product there&#x27;s a strong grapefruit scent, but that dissipates once your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volumizing effect of this mousse is subtle, so if you&#x27;re looking for mega-body this might not be the product for you.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s lightweight and does not leave my hair with a sticky feeling, and as an added bonus it seems to help keep the frizzies under control on humid days.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Full volume is what you get.  A little bit of this mousse is all you need..  Use this with the matching shampoo &amp; conditioner to get the best results.  It smells good, worked very well for me and doesn&#x27;t give you a nasty build up on your hair. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> My hair has a lot of volume toward the ends but the roots sometimes look flat, so I tried out this product. I&#x27;ve seen reviews complaining about the smell, but I found it to be very light and pleasant. It also did not dry out my hair. I didn&#x27;t see dramatically increased volume, but it gave me a little bit of lift. A lot of product for the price and it worked better for my moms shorter hair.</li>
    <li> The good thing about this product is the smell.  Smells very fresh and citrusy.  I wish other hair products smelled as good as this.  That&#x27;s really the only good thing I can say about this product.  Instead of naming it Fekkai, it should be called Grease Pit because my hair looked like I had spent the day changing my oil.  Left my hair incredibly flat.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s very fine and tends to wilt. I&#x27;ve used a Paul Mitchell mousse for years with good results, then for the past year have bumped it up to a gel with great results. But a gel can feel like a lot of \\&quot;product,\\&quot; so I was interested to see if this volumizing mousse would get me back to a lighter effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of the canister as luxuriantly creamy foam, then collapses instantly between my hands to a film that initially seemed to make no difference in the texture of my wet hair. But as I blew it dry, it developed noticeable body. It felt soft and luxurious when I took sections to use with a curling iron. When I brushed it to smooth it into a style, there was a slight drag that felt like ultra-thick hair. Wow! And there&#x27;s zero flaking. I was so impressed that I bought a little 2-oz travel size of the volumizing shampoo to pair with the mousse, and the two together seemed somehow to lift my hair and make it dry faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best mousse I&#x27;ve ever used. My only waver is that it *is* a mousse, and doesn&#x27;t have the staying power of a gel, especially in heat and humidity. But I&#x27;m very impressed, and even if I use a gel this summer, I&#x27;ll look forward to this product again in the fall.</li>
    <li> This mousse is amazing. It&#x27;s extremely easy to use--I usually work a bit into my hair after showering and then blow dry it to start styling. It definitely gives my hair a lot of volume and smells delicious! But would I pay they $20 retail for it again? Probably not.</li>
    <li> Fekkai&#x27;s Styling Whip smells amazing, a unique salon scent of citrus and mint. That&#x27;s pretty much where it differs from a product that costs $13.00 less. I used it a few times and got a decent style but nothing to write home, or to you, about. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and will give you some lift if you apply it to the roots. It loses a star for the ridiculous price. This is not a miracle worker, at all.</li>
    <li> HAIR TYPE:  Medium long layered baby fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Fekkai Hair Spray for quite a few years and have been increasingly disappointed in the way that it has decreased in effectiveness.  I was about ready to give up when I found that it has actually improved in my most recent can again which I was asked to test and review. That was a pleasant surprise for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this improvement in the hair spray, I thought perhaps that the Full Blown Volume Aerosol Styling Whip would work well hand in hand with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first trial runs with it were with the Fekkai hair spray.  Together, they worked well.  My hair gained a lot of volume and I was able to go for three or even four days without washing and only wetting to re-form my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used alone, however, I found that it did almost nothing to hold my hair up.  I used it in a variety of ways.  I used at roots only.  I used through my hair.  I used a little.  I used a lot.  I scrunched.  I fluffed.  I styled in a variety of ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did not see good performance out of this mousse like I expected on its own.  My style pretty much fell apart within an hour or two of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrances is lovely, however, and together with the hair spray, it does seem to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found after testing this Full Blown Volume Aerosol Styling Whip that I still prefer the TIGI Foxy Curls Mousse hands down.  It seems to support wave, curl, volume and style better, even when used with the hair spray or alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this three stars because I do get good performance out of it with the Fekkai hair spray.  Alone, however, I would have to say two stars max.  For the price, I expected a bit better performance out of it on its own.</li>
    <li> I picked this up for my wife and she reported back that she really likes this product. She is pleased with the results on her somewhat thin hair and says she will purchase this hair product again.</li>
    <li> I am just disappointed in all of Fekkai&#x27;s changes in general. There were so many products that worked incredibly well, and it was like an oasis to buy, because every other brand didn&#x27;t meet such high expectations as Fekkai.&lt;br /&gt;Well, of course, nothing is forever good, and Fekkai changed all the ingredients, and in general, changed the entire product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this, thinking it was the Boabab Whip, which is what works. But I didn&#x27;t read, fully, and when it arrived, I was upset, but I decided to try it anyway. It is not nearly as full as the Boabab Whip, and it&#x27;s just a huge disappointment. I&#x27;m trying to grab all the old products before they&#x27;re gone, and afterwards, I don&#x27;t who I&#x27;m going to turn to, because quite frankly, Fekkai isn&#x27;t my hero anymore....</li>
    <li> This product offers a perfect light styling help for my fine hair. It adds volume with blowdrying. It did get a little sticky when I tried it with the straight-iron, but was great for styling with a round brush and blow dryer. I love the smell, It is a little fruity with a light floral. Very soft and pleasant.</li>
    <li> My wife loved the product. She used after showers and the hair indeed got volumized, no stickiness, smell was good. She trusts the brand also very much.</li>
    <li> hair length: below shoulders&lt;br /&gt;type: baby fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the light fresh scent of this product the most - and it did leave my hair feeling/looking a bit fuller. It didn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy or frazzled as some products can for my baby fine hair, but left it nice and soft. The cost of the product is a little high, but when compared to some other products I use, it&#x27;s not out of line (and Fekkai does tend to be a little more pricey than the run-of-the-mill drugstore brands). I don&#x27;t mind spending more to get more, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing my hair, I put a golf-ball sized amount in my palm and worked it through at the roots - it specifically advises not to pull it through all the hair, which the first couple of times, I did. When I used it as the directions stated, I achieved better results. My hair was shiny, soft, with a little more fullness, and it smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d consider this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;hair momma&amp;#34; but my youngest daughter wanted to get one of those cute A line bob type cuts.  We loved what the stylist did but eventually you wash it and it never looks as good as what the professionals do :(  She did the best she could herself but she really needed mom to step in and give her a little extra help. I decided to try out his whip and we both loved the smell.  It was sticky on my hand but her hair turned out so soft and silky. She said the front felt so nice and why doesn&#x27;t the back ever feel that way... what do you know the back was as nice as the front after trying this whip.  Glad we have a month to practice before school starts  but I need all the help I can get and this will help me whip it into great shape.</li>
    <li> The Fekkai Aerosol Styling Whip is applied similar to styling mousse. I used a small amount, about the size of a golf ball, and worked it evenly through my hair. I then dried it with the blow drier and finished off any unruly ends with a flatiron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few weeks and am pleased with the results. It is much better than using a leave-in conditioner, and works as well as the similarly priced mousse I had been using. My short, fine hair has more volume without being sticky or greasy and it still looks good the next day. Plus, it has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and silky in my hand and it&#x27;s easy to work through my hair. Smells good and lasts all day, too. I can&#x27;t think of anything BAD about this product, I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing it. Because it is rather pricey and doesn&#x27;t work that much better than the drugstore/grocery store brands.</li>
    <li> I like this pretty well; be careful bot to use too much!  The first time I used it, I must have done so, because my hair was very heavy and hard to style.  I tried again, though ,and voila!  just right!  i would say to err on the side of caution and use a little less of this than you would with your usual product.  It works great, if you do.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work so well in my hair. The product smells amazing and it is lightweight. It made my hair sticky. Not the good kind of sticky but the kind of sticky that looks greasy. I didn&#x27;t get volume either. I even use a blow dryer and followed all instructions. Might try it again, but not a big fan. I was hoping it would work as well as foamoliant.</li>
    <li> Review from my teenage daughter: A big thing I like about this is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy like hair spray does. It was easy to apply--you just squirt it on your hands and put it on your hair, but it&#x27;s supposed to add volume and really I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change when I used it. The bottle says it would be a huge difference, but it only seemed to add just a little volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> This was just OK for me, especially factoring in the price point on the Amazon page. I have very fine hair, and in particular a cowlick that makes my bangs want to part where I don&#x27;t want them to part. They are very tricky to get right, and need a good mousse and some judicious blow-drying to get them to do what I want them to do. Usually I buy the cheaper drug-store brands with good success, so I was surprised that this product didn&#x27;t stand up to them (or my bangs) as well as I would expect for a higher priced product. I did like the scent, not too strong and it didn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> I have long, curly hair that I sometimes wear straight, and sometimes curly.  One thing I hate about wearing it curly is the crunchy feeling many products leave on my hair.  This mousse works very well in that aspect.  It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  This isn&#x27;t my favorite mousse or styling product, but it is pretty good.  It also has a very pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised how well this worked. I have thinning hair but when I use this it looks like my hair has doubled in thickness and does not take much to get results. Leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny - not dried out and frizzy like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t normally spend a lot of money on beauty products. Sure, I like the occasional luxury item, but it is more of an impulse buy at the fancy make-up stores. Still, I really like the Fekkai hair products. I tried the glossing cream once and have since branched out to shampoo, conditioner and now styling products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice smelling item...not too perfume-y that it bugs me or clashed with my other fragrance, though. And the hold is sort of light and soft...not like the crunchy mousse stuff girls wore in the 80&#x27;s to keep their bangs at anti-gravity! ha ha! I have more of a natural look and don&#x27;t like to pile on the products to achieve what my hair doesn&#x27;t want to do. For when I want to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair, I use this, blow dry, and use those Caruso steam rollers (which are my favorite tool!) I get nice soft curls or waves that last and last. I wish I could find the perfect hairspray now!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. All other volume mousse products I&#x27;ve used left my hair oily or weighed down. This mousse leaves my hair shiny, soft, and full of volume.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give as much volume as other products and one needs to shampoo more frequently after use.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing, very fresh, light with a hint of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product overall.  It did not leave my hair heavy and It did add some volume to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had to really do a full blowout to get it light and fluffy.  Simply doing a basic blow-dry with no round brush, I did not see any volume in my hair after applying solely to my roots as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: Part hair and then draw a line with the product on my root-line and gently rub in.  I had to really work my round barrel brush in and blow-dry in an upwards fashion.  I did help give me the lift I wanted and did stay in for a good amount of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it wasn&#x27;t amazing...For the price I could go with a drugstore brand and get the same experience.  I would repurchase this only for the smell...</li>
    <li> My hair is fairly short, primarily grey, thin and fine, mostly straight, and limp.  I do not like to spend a lot of time on my hair, nor do I expect miracles from hair products, only some slight improvement.  For two weeks, I used three Fekkai full blown volume products together, the shampoo, conditioner, and aerosol styling whip, and no other products.  I have no allegiances to shampoo or conditioner, but I have used the Paul Mitchell extra-body sculpting foam for over 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used about a half of a palm sized amount of mousse because my hair is pretty short.  For me personally, the smell of the Fekkai foam is a little too light, and my hair seems to stay wet longer.  Fekkai’s lighter touch does give my hair more softness and shine than the Paul Mitchell sculpting foam does.  Another point in Fekkai’s favor is that my hair does not get oily as quickly as it does with the Paul Mitchell.  However, I still prefer the Paul Mitchell mousse because there is much more body and fullness and less frizz in my hair versus the Fekkai.  Then there is the price.  Even on sale for 6 ounces at $13.67, the Fekkai foam is still more expensive than Paul Mitchell at $10.99 for 6.7 ounces without providing what I personally am looking for in a foam mousse.</li>
    <li> I use mousse (same thing as styling whip) every time I wash and blow dry my hair. The scent on this Fekkai product is great--it says it&#x27;s infused with mint and fruit. It&#x27;s very light and airy and works very well--does what it promises. However, there are a number of mousses/styling whips from a variety of brands that you can get in the drugstore for under $5 and they work just as well. I see no noticeable differences between the Fekkai product and drugstore products. So while I like this product, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth spending $16 on...</li>
    <li> smells great and works very well. It is a little sticky but it makes hair very full.  would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is what we used to call mousse back in the 80&#x27;s. It is a foam that you work into wet hair to add body. It is light and does not weigh hair down. This would be the perfect product for fine or thin hair to give it more body and manageability. It does not have any strong scent and does not leave any residue, so you don&#x27;t feel like you have any product in your hair, other than it holds the style better and has more fluff. I don&#x27;t think it is strong enough for thick or frizzy hair. My hair is wavy and it tends to get frizzy and this product was a bit too light for me. I like a thicker product like a gel. I let my friend who has straight, fine hair try it and it worked well for her, since that type of hair often can&#x27;t handle a heavier product. If you have fine limp hair, I bet you will like this product. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> My wife tested this product, and she liked the fact that it boosted the volume of her thinner hair, it has a pleasant smell, and works well as a styling product, with a light feel after using it. However, as with other styling products, getting rain or mist on your hair leaves it feeling sticky. Nothing stood out as being significantly better in quality than cheaper alternatives, but she liked the product overall. If comparably priced with competitors, she feels she would choose this product.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as it claims no matter how I used it. It felt sticky and useless for volume but I loved the smell. I went back to my other brand that works much better.</li>
    <li> All three of Mr Frekkai volumizing hair products; Shampoo,conditioner then towel dry hair put your hair upside down Shake his volumizing mousse then spray in the palm of your hand spread all over your hair starting from roots to hair ends then blow dry upside down when done drying flip hair over and straighten with a Paul Mitchell hair straightener  and BAM! You have superb volumized hair after hours have gone by just take your hand to the root of your hair squeeze it and BAM VOLUME AGAIN!! This is by far the best hair products I have ever used! Highly recommended for volumized hair this is the only product I buy for my hair especially if you always want your hair FULL of VOLUME and very fine hair</li>
    <li> First time giving anything by Fekkai a bad review and I cannot believe that I am actually. This Aerosol Styling Whip from Fekkai should be light and airy and it is when in your hand. The moment you put it in your hair and then blow dry it, it weighs down your hair. I cannot believe it since I love Fekkai shampoo. Both my daughter and I have brownish thick wavy hair and a little product goes a long way. So when I saw this styling whip (which means it is suppose to be extra light on my scalp of thick hair) ... I was so excited to try it. Such a disappointment. I tried different amounts thinking maybe I was using too much, but followed the directions on the back of the can before experimenting myself with it. Nothing has worked so far.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair product it holds your style for 2 days and truly makes your hair look and feel thicker I have been using it for 8 years and put more on my hair then it says to use . Try it I think you will like it Fekkai full blown volume styling whip</li>
