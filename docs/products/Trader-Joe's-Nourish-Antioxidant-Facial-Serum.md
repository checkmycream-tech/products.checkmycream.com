### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>LOL!</li>
      <li>Perfect for under your makeup.</li>
      <li>but I am truly IMPRESSED</li>
      <li>(if I&#x27;d been that good at chemistry I&#x27;d be a pharmacist!).  </li>
      <li>This serum feels amazing!  </li>
      <li>A mark on my hairline at the very top of my forehead has never gone away and</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels amazing .</li>
      <li>That said: I don&#x27;t know what kind of witchcraft is in this serum</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that this product has helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>Bought it at the store for myself, and loved how smooth my skin felt.</li>
      <li>Mom asked me to buy two more so that her friends can try it.</li>
      <li>I will for sure see what Trader Joe&#x27;s has.</li>
      <li>and I feel I look much better - better skin tone, and skin feels better too.</li>
      <li>I really love about this serum</li>
      <li>I cant see myself living without it.very top of my forehead</li>
      <li>the Olay lines just caused more breakouts and redness.  </li>
      <li>My skin tone is much more even and it has improved the texture, too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;shine control&amp;#34; makeups and moisturizers.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited for what&#x27;s to come!</li>
      <li>When a woman gets a compliment on her appearance, she becomes more confident, and she become a free advertiser for that product.  </li>
      <li>- I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the way my 58 year old skin felt and looked without a \\&quot;serum\\&quot;, I picked this up and started using it under my moisturizer</li>
      <li>but it dries quickly and your skin feels so smooth!</li>
      <li>In the morning I use it after applying a light sunscreen by NeutrogenA.  </li>
      <li>I thought that for this price $9.99 at Trader&#x27;s Joe ,it will be not so good ,i am very surprise ,my skin feels soft and my skin more  luminous after just 2 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s unique skin-feel (must be the silicon in it), but also by how well the moisturizer I applied afterwards sunk in.  </li>
      <li>After using this serum with a light moisturizer on top its like my face went from combination to normal overnight.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love how the serum makes my face feel baby soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Most last a few hours at best.</li>
      <li>I ended up buying my own bottle and a week in, I find myself touching my face to feel the softness or noticing dark spots fading.</li>
      <li>I put it on and it seemed like it was going to stay oily, but within minutes it had absorbed into my skin.</li>
      <li>I drink tons of alkaline water and take supplements and eat right</li>
      <li>My skin tends to get irritated and red very easily</li>
      <li>I noticed the difference after the first application.</li>
      <li>I noticed the difference after the first application.</li>
      <li>Used it for the first time one evening a week ago and was immediately struck by</li>
      <li>is how smooth and baby soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>Until I see some positive reviews from people who have used this product for a while, I am not going to spend any money on it.  </li>
      <li>The serum and moisturizer (I use just Lubriderm&#x27;s advance healing) totally absorbs into the skin and disappears into just a light silk.</li>
      <li>So much for reading labels.</li>
      <li>The battle of my life, though, has been my VERY oily skin.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel fantastic instantly</li>
      <li>As a die hard fan of most things from TJ&#x27;s I bought this for the first time more than two years ago and have used it daily ever since.  </li>
      <li>so I wasnt sure what was causing the rash like breakouts (forehead on the eyebrow itself) and it would leave a dark mark on my skin when they healed</li>
      <li>An area near my mouth which is always the first place to break out during PMS or with</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m older than 30.</li>
      <li>The serum itself has the feel of a primer, similar to the original, clear SmashBox primer.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks glowing, instead of shiny, and it&#x27;s really helped me be less self conscious, and helped my makeup stay more intact throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I think I wasted a good few pumps thinking it was soap at first!</li>
      <li>I picked this up from my local TJ because I bought the cleanser and moisturizer in the past and loved them.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s good enough to cost $26 online if there is no Trader Joes in your area.</li>
      <li>I am 45 years old and have had people randomly tell me how great I look more since I have used this product than in the previous 5 years combined.</li>
      <li>In addition, someone FINALLY got it right.  </li>
      <li>I tried to think at first whether it could be anything else because surely it could be the serum that I had only used once for a few hours, but I couldn&#x27;t think of anything.</li>
      <li>It was listed as a new offering at</li>
      <li>and I like to try new things.</li>
      <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want smooth, glowy, and younger looking skin for only $10?</li>
      <li>I checked the ingredients on the EWG website, the first three didn&#x27;t raise any red flags.</li>
      <li>ask a friend to get you some if you don&#x27;t live near a TJ&#x27;s bc</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been receiving so many compliments on my skin from strangers as well as my husband (who hardly ever gives me</li>
      <li>So, I use this at night after my Retin A has fully dried, to provide some light moisture along with an eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I am 41 with sensitive, combination dry/oily acne prone skin.  </li>
      <li>And my skin tone has evened out considerably.</li>
      <li>I have used this on my chapped lips and that was chronic also and now that is completely gone as well.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it works well for me.</li>
      <li>And my skin tone has evened out considerably.</li>
      <li>I have never used this product but my 79-year old mother bought it 2 weeks ago to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I a. have kids (I&#x27;m 35 1/2years old) and</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>somewhere else cheaper if you don&#x27;t have a TJ near you.</li>
      <li>This product measures up to any of the high end antioxidant facial serums I&#x27;ve used over the years</li>
      <li>I was going without a serum under my normal moisturizer for a while simply because I had run out</li>
      <li>And I have oily skin in certain zones and dry in others.</li>
      <li>Was in the aisle at my local TJ&#x27;s to pick up some Honey Mango Moisturizing Cream Shave and saw this new product.</li>
      <li>And I definitely don&#x27;t bother with those tiny oil absorbing papers (I would need about 3-4 at</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m disappointed, because TJ skin care products are normally pretty good for me.</li>
      <li>Got plenty of other products to use up first, anyway.  </li>
      <li>I am a long time buyer of VERY high end skin products (Sisley is the latest and most expensive addiction), so not sure what compelled me to pick this up on a recent trip to trader Joes.  </li>
      <li>and then it provides the perfect base for Clinique Perfectly Real foundation, which has very little slip on its&#x27; own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and while all of the ingredients were on point, I didnt give it much credit since I have used much more expensive products but had no real results or noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for those with dry or mature skin.  </li>

<li> A few months back I ran out and couldn&#x27;t get to a TJ&#x27;s for about 3 weeks.  </li>
<li> so there&#x27;s really no reason you shouldn&#x27;t try it and see for yourself.</li>
<li> I let it dry down</li>
<li> and the other doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
<li> I was picking up my usual teat tree oil facial wash and peppermint soap.</li>
<li> It does dry off after a  few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not worth the $26</li>
<li> and Nourish beats them hands down.  </li>
<li> What I mean by that is the design of their containers allow you to use the product to the very last drop.</li>

    <li> Like other reviewers have said, buy it from TJ&#x27;s direct for 9.99, NOT online. That said: I don&#x27;t know what kind of witchcraft is in this serum but I am truly IMPRESSED and I&#x27;m NEVER impressed. I bought it on a whim since I had not seen it before. I was picking up my usual teat tree oil facial wash and peppermint soap. I think I wasted a good few pumps thinking it was soap at first! LOL! So much for reading labels. Duh. I mean I read what was IN it and while all of the ingredients were on point, I didnt give it much credit since I have used much more expensive products but had no real results or noticeable difference. And I have oily skin in certain zones and dry in others. Either Im over dried out or too oily where it concerns product. BOY is this product everything it claims to be. Who knew. I had chronic breakouts lately. I chalked it up to stress and/or my supplement routine figuring it was internal. I drink tons of alkaline water and take supplements and eat right (no wheat/gluten/grain/dairy or sugar in my diet) so I wasnt sure what was causing the rash like breakouts (forehead on the eyebrow itself) and it would leave a dark mark on my skin when they healed but then it was so frequent they never really went away. I also had dry patches around the mouth and upper eye lid. No more. After using this serum with a light moisturizer on top its like my face went from combination to normal overnight. The dark marks are completely gone! No more dry spots or breakouts. ALL gone! Say Whaaaaa? Hard to believe since I had zero expectations. And my skin is no longer oily or dry...its actually balanced out all over. The serum and moisturizer (I use just Lubriderm&#x27;s advance healing) totally absorbs into the skin and disappears into just a light silk. I have used this on my chapped lips and that was chronic also and now that is completely gone as well. No more peeling skin on lips or around the mouth. No more rash breakout anywhere, marks or bumps. A mark on my hairline at the very top of my forehead has never gone away and I dont know where it came from. That disappeared overnight. Voodoo I tell ya! And my skin tone has evened out considerably. This is within a week of use. I noticed the difference after the first application. I turned my mom on to this today. She is 79 but still cares about her skin. I bought some for her. I cant wait to hear about her experience. This is def a winner. I cant see myself living without it.very top of my forehead has never gone away and I dont know where it came from. That disappeared overnight. Voodoo I tell ya!

She is 79 but still cares about her skin. I bought some for her. I cant wait to hear about her experience. This is def a winner. I cant see myself living without it.</li>
    <li> This has nourishing healing ingredients in it.  I put it on under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I thought that for this price $9.99 at Trader&#x27;s Joe ,it will be not so good ,i am very surprise ,my skin feels soft and my skin more  luminous after just 2 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i don&#x27;t understand why it is so expensive on Amazon ...for the same product</li>
    <li> As a die hard fan of most things from TJ&#x27;s I bought this for the first time more than two years ago and have used it daily ever since.  Four stars because they change the pump mechanism and now it&#x27;s darn near impossible to get all of the product out without breaking off the top and using a cotton swap to dig out the last bit.  The serum itself has the feel of a primer, similar to the original, clear SmashBox primer.  However, the SmashBox product makes me break out horribly with white heads, particularly on my nose.  Both products contain silicone derivatives so not sure why one does and the other doesn&#x27;t bother me (if I&#x27;d been that good at chemistry I&#x27;d be a pharmacist!).  So, I use this at night after my Retin A has fully dried, to provide some light moisture along with an eye cream.  In the morning I use it after applying a light sunscreen by NeutrogenA.  I let it dry down and then it provides the perfect base for Clinique Perfectly Real foundation, which has very little slip on its&#x27; own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a makeup and skincare addict (maybe there&#x27;s a 12 step...) and have used everything from drugstore to crazy expensive products.  Give this serum a try, but buy it in the store for $9.99.  Use it up and see if you like it.  If not, TJ&#x27;s will take it back, even without a receipt so you have nothing to lose.  Oh, forgot to mention I use it on my décolleté and it has helped with the texture of my skin after a lifetime of sunscreen neglect in that area.</li>
    <li> I started using this several weeks ago and didn&#x27;t notice anything different in my appearance but just kept using about once or twice a day. All of a sudden, every single day, I keep getting compliments on my appearance. Every day someone is shocked I a. have kids (I&#x27;m 35 1/2years old) and b. I&#x27;m older than 30. This is the ONLY change in my daily skin routine. No clue if this is the actual cause for the sudden onslaught of compliments but at $9.99 I&#x27;ll keep buying! It does seem kinda &#x27;waxy&#x27; when it goes on but it dries quickly and your skin feels so smooth!</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I was going without a serum under my normal moisturizer for a while simply because I had run out - I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the way my 58 year old skin felt and looked without a \\&quot;serum\\&quot;, I picked this up and started using it under my moisturizer and I feel I look much better - better skin tone, and skin feels better too. This is the first Trader Joe&#x27;s skin care product I&#x27;ve tried, when my current moisturizer is gone (name brand item at $56.00 for a small jar) I will for sure see what Trader Joe&#x27;s has.</li>
    <li> I checked the ingredients on the EWG website, the first three didn&#x27;t raise any red flags. I am a little concerned about the slightly petroleum like feel (the fruit wax?). It does dry off after a  few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS it&#x27;s $9.99 at Trader Joes. Not sure if it&#x27;s good enough to cost $26 online if there is no Trader Joes in your area. It was listed as a new offering at the Trader Joe&#x27;s I picked it up from.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The dimethicone makes it non-greasy like a primer. Perfect for under your makeup.</li>
    <li> I am a long time buyer of VERY high end skin products (Sisley is the latest and most expensive addiction), so not sure what compelled me to pick this up on a recent trip to trader Joes.  Used it for the first time one evening a week ago and was immediately struck by it&#x27;s unique skin-feel (must be the silicon in it), but also by how well the moisturizer I applied afterwards sunk in.  I have been using morning and evening ever since and I am hooked.  I will continue to use this as a supplement to my mositurizers and to marvel in how well my skin has responded to it.  An area near my mouth which is always the first place to break out during PMS or with retin-A use is not only totally cleared, any residual &#x27;scarring&#x27; or marks in the area that indicated it was my problem place are gone.  As this is the ONLY change in my beauty routine, I am giving it my fullest, and highest, marks in making that problem go away.  And, at $10 in Trader Joe stores, it&#x27;s a steal...</li>
    <li> I tried the serum at a family member&#x27;s home. The winter air left my skin dry and I like to try new things. I put it on and it seemed like it was going to stay oily, but within minutes it had absorbed into my skin. The next day I took a look in the mirror and saw a difference. I tried to think at first whether it could be anything else because surely it could be the serum that I had only used once for a few hours, but I couldn&#x27;t think of anything. I ended up buying my own bottle and a week in, I find myself touching my face to feel the softness or noticing dark spots fading. I&#x27;m excited for what&#x27;s to come!</li>
    <li> I am not one to randomly review things, but have been using the Trader Joe&#x27;s serum for 6 months and can say that I am in love.  I am 45 years old and have had people randomly tell me how great I look more since I have used this product than in the previous 5 years combined. It makes my skin feel fantastic instantly and I notice a difference in my neck the minute that I apply it.  Have used Clinique, kiehls and olay products and nothing compares to this $10 bottle that I buy at trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Until I see some positive reviews from people who have used this product for a while, I am not going to spend any money on it.  Got plenty of other products to use up first, anyway.  And besides, it&#x27;s only $9.99 in the store!</li>
    <li> This product measures up to any of the high end antioxidant facial serums I&#x27;ve used over the years and I&#x27;ve tried several.  In addition, someone FINALLY got it right.  What I mean by that is the design of their containers allow you to use the product to the very last drop. Thank you Trader Joe&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Was in the aisle at my local TJ&#x27;s to pick up some Honey Mango Moisturizing Cream Shave and saw this new product. I&#x27;ve never used a serum before, but at $9.99 this seemed like the time to try one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 28 and am just starting to think about some longer term skin care. The battle of my life, though, has been my VERY oily skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;shine control&amp;#34; makeups and moisturizers. Most last a few hours at best. And I definitely don&#x27;t bother with those tiny oil absorbing papers (I would need about 3-4 at a time)...instead, I&#x27;d been in the habit of blotting the oil off my face with paper towels almost every time I was in the restroom throughout the work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, I&#x27;ve gone entire days without needing to blot. My skin looks glowing, instead of shiny, and it&#x27;s really helped me be less self conscious, and helped my makeup stay more intact throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Bought it at the store for myself, and loved how smooth my skin felt. I apply it in the am and pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom and mother in law tried it too, and now they use it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy in at the store though. It is only 10 dollars there.</li>
    <li> I have never used this product but my 79-year old mother bought it 2 weeks ago to give it a try.  Within days, she got three compliments from three different people on her looks.  Since this serum was the only change to her daily beauty routine, she attributes her &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to this product.  Mom asked me to buy two more so that her friends can try it. When a woman gets a compliment on her appearance, she becomes more confident, and she become a free advertiser for that product.  I guess I will be giving Trader Joe&#x27;s Facial Serum a try now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hovering between 2-3 stars on this one.  I would recommend this for those with dry or mature skin.  This is not a good product for oily/acne-prone/hormonal skin, due to all the silicone in it.  Silicone is what I put in my hair to condition it and deal with frizzies, not something I want to put on my already-oily skin.  The texture of this product is really heavy and oily-ish, it&#x27;s like putting an anti-frizz serum on your face.  The only use I might have for this is to use as a primer for mineral makeup.  I&#x27;m disappointed, because TJ skin care products are normally pretty good for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a couple of months and I&#x27;m totally hooked. I am 41 with sensitive, combination dry/oily acne prone skin.  I&#x27;ve used products from Lancome, Estee Lauder, Olay Regenerist, etc. and Nourish beats them hands down.  My skin looks and feels amazing . My skin tends to get irritated and red very easily and I&#x27;m happy to say that this product has helped tremendously. My skin tone is much more even and it has improved the texture, too.  I honestly never saw a difference in my skin with all the other things I&#x27;ve used and the Olay lines just caused more breakouts and redness.  Now, my skin is softer, smoother, younger looking and not red!</li>
    <li> I am completely addicted to this serum.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 months and noticed a difference in the tone and tightness of my skin.  I&#x27;m 52 and look younger than I did 5 years ago.  I&#x27;m regularly told I look much younger than my age. A few months back I ran out and couldn&#x27;t get to a TJ&#x27;s for about 3 weeks.  My skin looked and felt different and was so very dry and &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34;.  I won&#x27;t run out again.  Ladies don&#x27;t forget to use it on your neck and upper chest area too!</li>
    <li> It makes your skin feel so soft. I use it on my hands too. It&#x27;s only $9.99 so don&#x27;t buy it here ask a friend to get you some if you don&#x27;t live near a TJ&#x27;s bc it&#x27;s not worth the $26+ pricetag. I have sensitive skin and it works well for me. In the summer I just use it without anything else.</li>
    <li> This serum feels amazing!  But I think it&#x27;s only $10.99 at the Trader Joe&#x27;s stores...</li>
    <li> I purchased mine in the Trader Joe&#x27;s Houston Store on Voss Street. I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve been receiving so many compliments on my skin from strangers as well as my husband (who hardly ever gives me compliments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really love about this serum is how smooth and baby soft it makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s only $10 in the store so there&#x27;s really no reason you shouldn&#x27;t try it and see for yourself. Who doesn&#x27;t want smooth, glowy, and younger looking skin for only $10? And the product lasted me well over 2 months.</li>
    <li> I picked this up from my local TJ because I bought the cleanser and moisturizer in the past and loved them. I absolutely love how the serum makes my face feel baby soft and smooth. But I feel like you could probably find it somewhere else cheaper if you don&#x27;t have a TJ near you.</li>
