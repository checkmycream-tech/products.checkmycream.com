### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I am thoroughly impressed.  </li>
      <li>Best Vitamin C Serum I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great results</li>
      <li>&amp; I think it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good C serum at a great price, you should probably try this one.</li>
      <li>Thank you Hydra Select for giving us good quality products at a price we can afford.</li>
      <li>The ingredients and concentration levels that Hydra Select uses are a perfect fit for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great results and more affordable than the rest.</li>
      <li>decided to make my own serum.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it at night before bed and it gives my face a nice tightening feel.</li>
      <li>Very happy with the results thus far.</li>
      <li>Very happy with the results so far after using this for about 3 weeks now.</li>
      <li>So after about 2 weeks of using it, my face and neck look and feel very smooth.</li>
      <li>I could visibly see the transformation of the fine lines into smoother skin, while keeping a nice hydrated feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think the combination of using it with their Hyaluronic Acid serum will improve my skin and keep my skin healthy and nourished.</li>
      <li>Hydra Select even smells much better than the others.</li>
      <li>but it seemed to have irritated my skin more than help it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using a product with identical ingredients for a couple of years now and thought I would try this as it was more affordable.</li>
      <li>but I could still lose some more wrinkles.</li>
      <li>and I already see brightness in my skin, reduction in the appearance of fine lines, and increased softness.</li>
      <li>More importantly, it is working just like the higher priced serums, even better.</li>
      <li>I was told to find a CEF formula and this one seemed to fit that description.  </li>
      <li>Seeing good results at this stage, my face and neck are definitely a lot firmer and more</li>
      <li>One thing I did not want is a serum with fragrance and this one smells very fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived very fresh with a consistent water liquid texture which makes me believe that it does contain 17% Vitamin C as claimed.</li>
      <li>Hydra Select has earned a new satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>My new favorite skin product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absorbs pretty fast, allowing me to apply my moisturizer on top.  </li>
      <li>A friend told me to look into the Hydra Select product for similar effectiveness and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
      <li>This works exactly the same &amp; was a much better price.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find such a nice alternative to the pricier Skin Ceuticals version here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have used Vitamin C serums in the past but didn&#x27;t get good results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very particular about what I apply to my body</li>
      <li>But the smell is too much to bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product was very watery.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t help much with my scar</li>
      <li>or so it didn&#x27;t just turn an orange-brown color (which happens with most vitamin C products due to oxidation)</li>
      <li>The results are more noticeable and show up quicker compared to other vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried, and it didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for men and women alike.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have noted, this product degrades very quickly and changes in color, consistency, and smell.  </li>
      <li>The Skinceuticals product costs nearly three times as much and the ingredients were practically identical.</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd Vitamin C Serum bottle I have purchased from Hydra Select (the first one was from their website)</li>
      <li>The wrinkles will probably never totally disappear but I certainly have noticed a change in texture and healthiness.</li>
      <li>far, I&#x27;ve noticed some blemishes that have been removed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 40 year old guy that soaks up a lot of sun since I work outdoors</li>
      <li>The only times the bottle was exposed to air and light (the elements that oxidize Vitamin C serums), was when I would quickly remove the dropper to drop some serum on my skin, and replace the dropper and seal tightly and put back in the box, then back into the medicine cabinet.  </li>
      <li>Turned yellow 2 weeks after use (when vitamin C serums go from milky white to yellow, it signifies oxidation and thus negates any anti-oxidant effect that the vitamin C is supposed to render in the first place).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, is NOT a clear serum as depicted in their picture, but an opaque milky white color that turns yellow in 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>and I am not comfortable using it nor am I able to return it because it&#x27;s past the return period.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using a product with identical ingredients for a couple of years now and thought I would try this as it was more affordable. I did not care for the film it left on my face, but what was worse is that after a month or so it didn&#x27;t just turn an orange-brown color (which happens with most vitamin C products due to oxidation) it became sort of chunky. I even made a point of never touching the dropper to my fingers, but to just drip the liquid onto my fingers in an effort to prevent transferring any sort of bacteria/dirt into the bottle. I have half of the bottle left since you only need a few drops at a time and I am not comfortable using it nor am I able to return it because it&#x27;s past the return period. I would not purchase it again; other similar products in my experience have not degraded as quickly or to the point that I would be afraid to put it on my face.</li>
    <li> Turned yellow 2 weeks after use (when vitamin C serums go from milky white to yellow, it signifies oxidation and thus negates any anti-oxidant effect that the vitamin C is supposed to render in the first place).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, is NOT a clear serum as depicted in their picture, but an opaque milky white color that turns yellow in 2 weeks.  I kept it in the original box, closed, and behind the medicine cabinet.  The only times the bottle was exposed to air and light (the elements that oxidize Vitamin C serums), was when I would quickly remove the dropper to drop some serum on my skin, and replace the dropper and seal tightly and put back in the box, then back into the medicine cabinet.  Yet it still degraded rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, noticed NO difference despite 1 month of use.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have noted, this product degrades very quickly and changes in color, consistency, and smell.  All to be expected due to oxidation, but I can&#x27;t handle it anymore.  It makes my skin smell terrible.  My poor husband has taken to giving me &amp;#34;air&amp;#34; kisses at bedtime, and that won&#x27;t do at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it in the morning instead, but I still smell the funky, fishy odor all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said this, after 2 months of faithful use (2 bottles), I HAVE noticed a difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s smoother and &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; if that makes sense.  But the smell is too much to bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to make my own serum.  I ordered L-ascorbic acid powder and hyaluronic acid to mix together every night. Hopefully I&#x27;ll get the benefits without the stinky side effects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m outdoors everyday in the Florida sun and started noticing a few dark spots, along with my skin already being dry and sensitive.  I&#x27;ve tried a Vitamin C serum before but it seemed to have irritated my skin more than help it.  The ingredients and concentration levels that Hydra Select uses are a perfect fit for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve noticed some blemishes that have been removed. Skin feels smoother and firmer in a short period of time. Very happy with the results thus far.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Vitamin C Serum bottle I have purchased from Hydra Select (the first one was from their website) and I am thoroughly impressed.  I can finally &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; my skin looking healthier.  Definitely a lot smoother than it was but I could still lose some more wrinkles. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still see improvements every week.  Great results and more affordable than the rest.</li>
    <li> Has not done a thing for me</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to replace the $150 bottle of vitamin C serum from my dermotologist.  This works exactly the same &amp; was a much better price. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now &amp; I think it&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;m ordering another.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find such a nice alternative to the pricier Skin Ceuticals version here on Amazon. I gave this product a chance about 1.5 months ago and it delivered! I could visibly see the transformation of the fine lines into smoother skin, while keeping a nice hydrated feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need for me to look elsewhere. Hydra Select has earned a new satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> My new favorite skin product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very particular about what I apply to my body but I heard about this product through a friend and had to try it out.  I&#x27;m a 40 year old guy that soaks up a lot of sun since I work outdoors so my skin has paid the price. I was a bit skeptical at first but mark me down as a believer and faithful customer at this point in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started seeing results in about 2+ weeks.  The wrinkles will probably never totally disappear but I certainly have noticed a change in texture and healthiness. Great results so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;michael</li>
    <li> This product was very watery. Will never buy again</li>
    <li> The product arrived very fresh with a consistent water liquid texture which makes me believe that it does contain 17% Vitamin C as claimed. The results are more noticeable and show up quicker compared to other vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried, and it didn&#x27;t break me out. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used Vitamin C serums in the past but didn&#x27;t get good results. I was told to find a CEF formula and this one seemed to fit that description.  So after about 2 weeks of using it, my face and neck look and feel very smooth. I can tell it&#x27;s repairing my skin. It didn&#x27;t help much with my scar but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even supposed to.  I will buy from again.</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C Serum I have ever used.  Visible results immediately.  I use the Vitamin C Serum every morning in place of moisturizer and then apply foundation.  I highly recommend this product for men and women alike.</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended me using Skinceuticals C E Ferulic serum on my face along with the treatment I was undergoing. A friend told me to look into the Hydra Select product for similar effectiveness and I&#x27;m glad I did! The Skinceuticals product costs nearly three times as much and the ingredients were practically identical. More importantly, it is working just like the higher priced serums, even better. Hydra Select even smells much better than the others. My search is over.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the Hydra Select Vitamin C serum for a few weeks now and I already see brightness in my skin, reduction in the appearance of fine lines, and increased softness. I use this product in the morning under my makeup and at bedtime. I think the combination of using it with their Hyaluronic Acid serum will improve my skin and keep my skin healthy and nourished. Thank you Hydra Select for giving us good quality products at a price we can afford.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results so far after using this for about 3 weeks now. One thing I did not want is a serum with fragrance and this one smells very fresh and clean.  It&#x27;s somewhat of a milk white color which I assume is the Vitamin C.  No greasy feel either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it at night before bed and it gives my face a nice tightening feel. It absorbs pretty fast, allowing me to apply my moisturizer on top.  Seeing good results at this stage, my face and neck are definitely a lot firmer and more clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good C serum at a great price, you should probably try this one.</li>
