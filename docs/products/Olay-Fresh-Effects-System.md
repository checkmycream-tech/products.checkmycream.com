<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everything was in orginal packaging and worked even the battery was included! great buy and I saw it in the store for 6 dollars more! likeI said awesome buy</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift and it was loved, no complaints and no allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> I love how clean my face feels after I use this product. I have acne problems and I love to use this twice a day.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because I&#x27;ve tried just about every face product (that is affordable to the common person) and thought that for around $10, I wouldn&#x27;t be too upset if it didn&#x27;t work. To be fair, I don&#x27;t use the face cleansing product that comes with it, but use a salicylic acid acne cleanser. Such cleaners have NEVER worked for me alone before, and I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for years that wasn&#x27;t helped or harmed by any over the counter (or prescription) salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide medications--it just stayed the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it was a total shock to me when I started using this brush with the acne cleanser and actually noticed a difference. I&#x27;m not sure if it just gets in deeper than a washcloth or how it works, but my parents and friends were all telling me my face looked better after about a week, and I feel more confident about my skin tone. Even besides the acne, it just seems more even-toned. Additionally, right after I use the product, my face feels really fresh, soft, and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this is not a miracle product and like everything else, I&#x27;m sure results vary. However, for the price and the results I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to my friends. I&#x27;ve ordered hundreds of things from Amazon but this is the only thing I&#x27;ve yet been inspired to review.</li>
    <li> the wash kinda burns my face, the scruber is alright it tickles and the button stopped working the turn on part. but that was after a few months</li>
    <li> Its Good to clean on Daily basis with this. So far I&#x27;m satisfied with the performance</li>
    <li> This mini brush really cleans I use it once or twice a week, easy to carry and so small that you can put it in your handbag.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Didn&#x27;t work that well and does not suds or spin.</li>
    <li> The reviews that compared this product to the Clarisonic brush is illogical. These brushes are nothing alike and for a comparison to be valid there should be some similarities. The design, price and size is completely different and I think this brush is the absolute BEST! It suds and cleanses like a pro. I had two pimples on my face which reduced in size after a few hours when I used this brush and the Shine, Shine Go Away! shine minimizing cleanser. I was so surprised and pleased with the results. My face felt super clean and smooth. (Note I use the Olay Fresh Effects Out Of This Swirled Deep Pore Clean Plus Exfoliating Scrub at night and the Shine, Shine Go Away! shine minimizing cleanser in the morning). I am so happy with this purchase and I cannot see myself going back to hand cleansing my face ever again. The only regret I have is not purchasing this product sooner.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many of these face brushes finding one I liked.  I tried the Olay Pro X and it was okay but a little bit harsh for my face.  I tried this and loved it but it breaks every few months so I decided to get a Clarisonic Mia.  I hate it.  My face broke out no matter which bristles I used they all seemed way too harsh.  At 40 bucks a brush head and 100 to purchase my clarisonic was a waste of my time.  After trying a few others and being disappointed, I went back to this.  Even if I have to replace it every few months it is much cheaper than anything else I have tried AND it cleans my face the better than any other product I have come across.  My only issue now is that it is hard to find in stores which is why I am buying here.  I hope they aren&#x27;t discontinuing it!</li>
    <li> I like it nothing fancy.  a bit different from other facial brushes.  reviews says it one of the best..</li>
    <li> I mainly bought it for the scrubber thinking that it has good scrubbing action. However, it is just a vibrator that tickles when you bring it near your nose. Doesnt really remove dirt stuck in the pores. Would be better suited for a sexual stimulant. LOL</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these, it&#x27;s horrible. Does nothing for the skin. The size is actually perfect to get every crevice of the face, around the nose, areas like that. But the actual product, the rubber head does nothing. Olay is a good brand but this item would have to be a miss. Hopefully Olay comes out with new cleansing system, maybe with soft natural bristles. The size of this is small and perfect for traveling if it actually worked. What a bummer, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product my fave was oil free after using this and I use the brush with other products I have and it works great.</li>
    <li> I got this on clearance from a local drug store chain and because of the low price I figured there wasn&#x27;t much to lose (under $4). Even at that price I was disappointed. I had to use nearly a third of the tube to get any type of suds or foam and the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; does nothing. I don&#x27;t feel it even rotates-more like vibrates. The &amp;#34;bristles&#x27;&amp;#34; are rubber and I didn&#x27;t even feel particularly clean after using it. The size and shape of the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; is great though. If I&#x27;d paid full price for this product (originally marked $14.99) I&#x27;d have been mad. I get much more out of my facial loofah disc. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week now. Olay Fresh Effects is my favorite brand for facial cleansers (I also use Proactiv). I decided to try this out and see if it cleans my face better and help to clear me up. It definitely makes my skin softer and less oily.</li>
    <li> Really a cute little item..........just big enough to do the job and small enough to put in a drawer in the bathroom cabinet and to travel with.............does a good job.</li>
    <li> My pores are already significantly smaller after just a couple days of using this with my favorite cleanser. I was rather surprised when I opened this and saw the size and material. I wasn&#x27;t convinced it would do anything. Working in cosmetics for a period of time in my life, I was always a Clairsonic snob even though I never had one. I was just taught to believe it was the best of the best. Maybe it is, I&#x27;m still yet to use one. But I was never willing to fork over the crazy amount of money for one. This works great for me because I think I just needed something to get to my pores and heck, for 6 bucks, I will take it!!!</li>
    <li> This little tool is like a toothbrush for your face. It does what it says - it removes oils from your face, but leaves face dry and in need of lotion. It was worth a try for $10, but I won&#x27;t be using it much.</li>
    <li> Uggghh!!! I&#x27;m a ruined woman! Ever since I first bought this a few months ago in this small trial size, I AM HOOKED!! I have oily skin and nothing I&#x27;ve used to clean my face has shine free lasting power like this does. And a little bit goes a very long way--even better. I&#x27;d normally hesitate on trying new products but the price was great. And shortly after falling in love with this, Wallyworld put their Olay face washes on sale AND there was a coupon in the newspaper bringing the grand total of this $7-11 face wash to $2! Well I stocked up and will never have to buy face wash again as.long.as.I.live. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I may say this product is great my face feels so nice when I washed my face every morning love it , I been using Olay and it never disappoint me at all 👌🏼 thanks</li>
    <li> I have had the Sirius Sonic(40 bucks)and this works just as well for a lot less.  I love that it&#x27;s tiny and easy to use.  I also think the rubber head is cleaner and better to use than the bristles on the brushes that have to be changed monthly.  I have been using for about two weeks and my skin is so smooth and have virtually no acne.  If I do get a zit, I just use this on it for a day or two and it&#x27;s gone.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> Works well minus the fact that the batteries tend to drain to fast.</li>
    <li> I combine this with my roche cream that works wonders! The only downside is that sometimes the vibrations get me all wet.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy another for my face.</li>
    <li> This Olay is so easy to use and makes my skin feel great.  It is nice to have it in such a compact size.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I saw the kit at a store, so I knew the brush is small. But that is the good thing about it. Because it is so small, it is easy to handle and you get in every corner of your face.&lt;br /&gt;After I used it for the first time, my face felt clean and my skin was less shiny than before. I really recommend that product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a gift for the owner as well as all of the admin girls in a client&#x27;s office as a thank you for their assistance and they all called me and told me how much they loved it, including the owner.</li>
    <li> I have been reading the reviews and I dont see why people are so down on it. If you follow the instructions, it lathers just fine. It isnt a deep exfoliator but it is wonderful to give an extra boost to your daily routine. I use it with my Olay Daily Regenerist cleanser and its wonderful. As for the cleanser, it clearly states it is for oily skin types. If you dont have oily skin, dont use it. I think its perfect for hot weather where you might sweat a bit more than normal. Overall, I love this kit and think it is worth what you pay for it.</li>
    <li> This little brush is just the right size, my face shines after cleaning with this brush, I feel like my face is really clean and it feels so good when you run it over your face I will buy another one when mine wears out!</li>
    <li> It works really well with my skin and my sister likes it too. Her skin is harder to clean than mine and it works great!</li>
    <li> Broken scrub brush - the top won&#x27;t click into the bottom.</li>
    <li> i was debating between this one and the olay $30 spin brush cleaner...saw this at $10 so decided to try it..its just ok..its better than cleansing with just plain hands..</li>
    <li> So this thing came WAY smaller than what I was expecting. The Brussels remind me of rubber toothbrush Brussels. I actually really like how it feels on my face. I think it cleans my face well.. But we will see if it actually takes the shine away.</li>
    <li> I first bought the product because I read in the ingredients online that the cleanser contains kaolin which I need most days since my skin gets oily on a daily basis. I started noticing a noticeable difference after just a couple days. The pores around my nose are shrinking and the cystic acne is healing which is a major thing for me. Since using it, I&#x27;ve paired it with neutrogena pore refining toner and aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer and my skin looks so much better now. I hope this review helps out if you have really oily skin and cystic acne like I do! :)</li>
    <li> Nothing Great about it.</li>
    <li> The massage component is ok, not sure what i expected. The cleanser is great and my skin feels awesome after I use it.</li>
    <li> This does not make a good facial cleaner because the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; is made up of very large rubber bristles and does not even make the most sudsy cleanser bubble.  It is not really a brush at all and, although it is cheap, it is not worth the money.  And no I do not want to spend another 30 bucks to try the Advanced Cleansing System.  I have given this company enough of my hard earned dollars for shoddy crap and will spend my money on another brand!</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Works well and is gentle on your skin.  Prompt delivery.  AAA+++</li>
    <li> It states on the box that it will clean away dirt and makeup, but I rub the corner of my eye and I see makeup residue. You can&#x27;t rely on this product alone to clean your skin.</li>
    <li> UPDATED 5/7/14:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this since December 2012 and I still like it.  I have not had to replace the battery and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I use this every day in the shower - and get a nice, clean feeling face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I guess I wasn&#x27;t paying enough attention when I ordered this...but I was very surprised that it came with only the brush tool and no cleanser.  So - I grabbed a facial cleanser I had on hand - and revved this up.  I ran it over my face for about a minute and during that time, was completely unimpressed.  It felt like I was putting a barely vibrating cheap (dull) toothbrush up to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And THEN - I rinsed my face and felt my skin?  WOW.  I have never seen my skin that clean and it has rarely felt so soft.  I did a total 180 on this product after seeing the end result.  Used it again today in the shower with the same result.  As cheesy as the cleansing process seems to be - it REALLY works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> I have mixed reviews about this brush.  When I first opened the kit and pulled out the brush, I had a lackluster response to it.  The small brush has tiny rubber bristles and when you turn it on and put it on your face, it feels like a tiny vibrator as opposed to a cleansing brush.  I thought it was a dud and wouldn&#x27;t cleanse very well.  However, I started using the corners of the brush to get into those angles around the nose, eyes and forehead and thought it was really great at getting into those crevices.  I realized it is a really good brush (or face vibrator) for getting into that T-zone area. After cleansing and drying, I really felt the effect.  It surprisingly did a really good job.  My face felt and feels very clean, and that was unexpected after seeing and feeling the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think many may have trouble with expecting one thing and getting something else in this kit.  The brush is not what one expects because it is so small and because of the texture of the bristles, and because it feels more like vibration rather than scrubbing.  However, It did a good job in cleansing without irritating my extremely sensitive skin, and I do like the results. Just understand this is not some powerful cleansing system. The brush is small and its vibration is not powerful, but its effect is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I haven&#x27;t tested the cleanser however because the kit I received for testing only came with the brush so I can&#x27;t tell you about it unfortunately.</li>
    <li> *Edited*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many others have said, what I received did not include the facial cleanser so my review is on the wand itself, which is, at best, a cute gimmick but not much more.  The buttons are ridiculously small and, for whatever reason, they are placed on the outside, which would make sense if it felt natural to push a teeny tiny button with your knuckle but, when I hold it, my thumb naturally falls onto the inside and, had the buttons been placed there, I could easily turn it on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, you are probably arguing, wouldn&#x27;t you accidentally turn it off while washing your face?  Maybe, if the buttons were easy to push. I had to push the button thrice to get it to hold.  I&#x27;d press down and the wand would start up but the button itself had not clicked into place.  Two more tries and there it goes, staying on.  Turning it off is only slightly easier.  It takes 1-2 presses rather than 2-3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it a bit ticklish to use around my nose and I am not a ticklish person.  Not at all. So if you are a typically ticklish person, you&#x27;ll definitely want to stay away from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, even if you are not, why not stay away from it anyway?  I have exfoliates from Olay that are just as effective at sloughing away my skin and feel no less stimulating than this vibrating toy.  I enjoy massaging my face with my fingertips and find it leaves my skin feeling just as soft and looking just as glowing as this silly wand does.  Plus, I don&#x27;t have to worry about sneezing because of too vigorous vibrations around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This probably appeals to younger users but I would hope that even they would see that the waste of using something that requires batteries and will eventually and inevitably break down (as all electronic devices are wont to do over time).  Rather than add to your carbon footprint, just use your fingertips and take some time for once to just pamper yourself.  If you&#x27;re too busy to take five minutes to cleanse your face without the use of some gimmicky toy, then you need to re-prioritize and take some of that precious time for yourself.  After all, you deserve it and, trust me, you do not need this thing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My adult daughter spent the night and I asked her to give this a try.  She was unimpressed and said that it added nothing of value.  Massaging her face while cleansing, occasionally using an exfoliate, are sufficient to give the same benefits.  If you can do it all with your fingertips, what&#x27;s the point?  She did not, however, find it ticklish to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you go.  Two reviews for the price of one.  Neither review positive.leanse your face without the use of some gimmicky toy, then you need to re-prioritize and take some of that precious time for yourself.

    <li> dont be fooled how it looks its about two inches tall including the brush part the wash is like 3 and a half inches tall but it does the job of cleaning the dirt of your face well</li>
    <li> I been using this facial brush for maybe 4 days now and I do like it so far..I love the small size of the brush and i really like how the brush head is triangle shape because is easier to clean all over my face.I brought it because i needed a affordable facial brush tool so i brought this one to try it out.I also like how the brush head is made of rubber because i don&#x27;t need to replace the brush head every six months LOL, i save money.</li>
    <li> i like the brush, the wash is a travel size bottle that didn&#x27;t last long, I signed up for the 6 month shipments over all, its decent for the price.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this product was purchased to help with that issue. I tried this product for 1 week saw no difference in my skin. I will continue to use it until I see result or not.</li>
    <li> The rubbery bristles are not very soft. I feel like i&#x27;m punishing my face when I use it. However, it was cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for. The cleanser is great through! smells lovely and does a good job controlling oil without over drying!</li>
    <li> I was looking to buy a facial cleansing system that would slough off dead skin, remove blackheads, and reduce pores. Boy, was I disappointed. I tried to give this product a fair shot, because I know miracles don&#x27;t happen over night, but I&#x27;ve seen absolutely NO change in the last month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine reducing cleanser completely stripped the oil from my face and left my skin feeling &#x27;tight&#x27;, while the vibrating brush head did less for massaging my skin than I could have done with my fingertips. Since I began using it, I&#x27;ve had MORE breakouts than before, which I can only assume is because my body is trying to replace the oil the cleanser stripped away. I think I&#x27;ll just go back my my old routine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. The brush is pretty small, but it fits very nicely in my hand. The triangle shaped head helps the brush fit into the contours of the face, so that no area is left untouched. The brush just vibrates, which for some people is a downer, but for me it worked out perfectly. I needed a brush that cleaned out my pores and brushed away any oil or impurities, but was gentle enough for my sensitive and dry skin. This brush has been the best.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very easy to keep clean, since the bristles are rubber.&lt;br /&gt;i would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Hmmm..... personal I don&#x27;t feel it does any good.....not as expected.....I have other cheaper face washer pad better than this....</li>
    <li> Great little travel product--every bit as good as a clairisonic</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with an oily t-zone, and I bought this to minimize pores and clear blackheads. I have used it twice along with Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser that I had been using for months before I purchased this tool.  I use it once in the morning every other day, and since the first time I tried it, I feel like this tool helps my moisturizer absorb better and the cleanser penetrate my pores. My proof of this is the fact that my cleanser has menthol in it, which gives a cooling sensation when it is applied on the face. The first time I used my cleanser I felt the &amp;#34;coolness&amp;#34;, but every time after I don&#x27;t feel it and my skin feels very oily when I wash it .  My skin also does not feel refreshed after I rinse.  After using the Olay facial brush, I felt the &amp;#34;coolness&amp;#34; both times, something I don&#x27;t feel without it.  I think this means the brush is clearing surface oil and dirt to allow the cleanser to penetrate.  My skin also felt cleaner and still moisturized (I don&#x27;t think anything can negate the moisture I get from that cleanser). I noticed lots of new pimples emerging underneath my skin after the first use, but I read that this is normal, and they decreased in size the next day. My skin is only slightly less oily, but I do see how it can dry some people&#x27;s skin out with overuse,wrong cleanser, etc. Overall, I love the small design, because it fits in my hand perfectly and is a good size for my face; I don&#x27;t see any reason for a brush to be bigger.  Also, the stiff, rubber bristles prevent me from pressing too hard, which goes a long way in terms of cautioning overuse. So far, so good. If it stops working or I have a bad reaction, I&#x27;ll get my money back through the Olay guarantee or return it to Walmart.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Va-Va-Vivid! I use it at night with my Ponds Cold Creme cleanser to remove my makeup. I first work the Ponds into my face with my hands, and then put more cleanser on the brush. I use that on my face and I can see all the gunk on my brush! The cleanser that comes with it made me break out but I ain&#x27;t even mad. For $10 it&#x27;s worth the money and cleans way better than your hands alone.</li>
    <li> THis makes my face oily and it does not clean very well. I can wash my face with my wash cloth and its feels smoother with my wash cloth then this procduct. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for.  It just vibrates a little, barely noticeable and if it didn&#x27;t buzz you wouldn&#x27;t think it was doing anything.  The accompanying facewash foams nicely but it a weird purpley-gray color.</li>
    <li> I like so much that i bought it as gift 8 times :))</li>
    <li> This concept is great!  However, it really needs to be an actual brush instead of the little silicone nubbies that make up the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; part of the cleaning tool.  But the triangle shape and size of the cleaning unit overall is great!  In fact I would have LOVED to keep it had it had a regular soft bristle brush.  I never tried the cleanser so I can&#x27;t comment about that.</li>
    <li> First of all, I was very disappointed that the item&#x27;s packagin is very misleading - it looks like you receive the cleaning brush AND a small tube of Olay cleanser - this is NOT true!  You ONLY receive the cleansing brush.  I used some of my own cleanser I had on hand then to try to the product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, here is what I found to be true about the brush I did receive... My face is very sensitive to certain cosmetics and harsh chemicals.  The cleansing brush did ok.  It did remove some of the dry skin on my face (which I tend to get when the weather turns cold).  The brush itself is only about 2 and half inches long and has what seems to be two vibrating settings (hi and low??), but honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell a huge difference between the two.  The cleansing head is made from rubber (not sharp bristles like other systems have), so I think that helped not to irritate my sensitive skin too badly.  After a couple of uses, I find that yes, it cleans and does remove dead, dry skin from my face, and it did not irritate my sensitive skin as much as other products I have tried, but I am just not overly \\&quot;wow\\&quot;ed by it.  I think I can get the same effect using a good scrub cleanser.</li>
    <li> Okay, it&#x27;s bad enough that I received this product without the cleanser included. I only had the little battery-operated wand thing to assess. Maybe the fresh effects cleanser is decent. Who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the wand! Okay, first, imagine one of those rubber pet-hair removal wands \\&quot;Honey I Shrunk the Kids\\&quot;-sized-down. That&#x27;s what the head of this wand thing is, except it&#x27;s triangular. The battery power works a lot like the low-end Oral B battery-operated toothbrushes work (except less effectively): a small button to turn it on, a small button to turn it off. When you turn the wand on, the handle buzzes and vibrates, but the \\&quot;brushes\\&quot; do absolutely nothing. What, are we supposed to believe that bit of vibration is doing something cosmic for our skin? The action is achieved by rubbing the brush end back and forth over your skin, and you don&#x27;t need the battery gizmo to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, the actual material the wand head is made of DOES exfoliate well (so I gave it an extra star), and the ergonomics of the thing is decent (but could be even better sans battery compartment). But, heavens, the whole battery-powered wand thing is a complete fail. I think Olay needs to take this one back to the drawing board and come up with a lower-priced, manually operated version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been quite happy with my complexion. I tend to have oily skin with occasional dry patches. And just as bad, if not worse, my pores are a little larger than I&#x27;d like. I usually switch between two types of cleaners--[[ASIN:B0009EILHG Biore Pore Perfect Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser, Cools &amp; Clears , 6.7 fl oz (198 ml)]] and [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz]]. I know that there are more expensive products out there, but none have proven themselves in the past to be much more effective than these two. The Olay Fresh Effects Kit seemed to me like it might be an effective means to deal with my skin issues. My test kit came only with the battery-poweed brush, though, so I used it with the Biore Pore Perfect Cleanser with it. I figured that using my normal cleaner with the brush would give me a feel for whether the brush itself made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is like a silicone material; it&#x27;s not an actual brush with bristles. So it massages your skin, but it doesn&#x27;t scrub. Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be as good for my skin, but I was a little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get a scrubbing action from it. I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned so much as it gave me a gentle face massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I really liked about the brush was that a small amount of cleanser really went a long way. I got by with using probably half as much as I normally use. But that brush head is really small, so it also probably took me at least 4 or 5 times as long to wash my face as normal. On the one hand, that was a good thing, it gave the cleanser time to settle in and do its job and it forced me to be really thorough. On the other hand, it took at least 4 or 5 minutes as long to wash my face! I&#x27;ve got kids and a job, and I just don&#x27;t have the luxury of that much extra time in the morning. Especially since the difference between using the battery powered brush and a simple washcloth was negligible in terms of results. Sure, immediately afterusing the brush my skin looked kind of glowing and my pores minimized, but that effect only lasted for a few minutes, then things settled back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps with the full kit I might have seen better results, but I just can&#x27;t do 14.99 for a single container of cleanser.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product but i was actually disappointed in it. Ive been using it for a little over a week now and i see no difference. It even broke me out a little bit. I would not recommend this product. The only bright side is your face feels a little smoother after you use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products most of my adult life, just as my mother did before me. I&#x27;ve known their products to be high-quality yet affordable, and the fact that my 45-year-old skin has very few fine lines is a testament to how well Olay skin care products work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this little &#x27;cleansing system&#x27; is an appalling addition to an otherwise respectable, excellent product line. While the thing claims to massage your skin, and the addition of a battery makes it *seem* like the thing would vibrate, it doesn&#x27;t do anything more than your own hands can do while washing your face. Exfoliate? I don&#x27;t think so -- the rubber nubs on the thing bend away at first contact with the skin. Your washcloth would work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the cleanser at all. It wasn&#x27;t included in the box, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it could overcome the ineffectiveness of the little gadget in the box.</li>
    <li> love it, it controlled my oily skin during the day. Recommend it for those who have oily skin. I do wish the brush would rotate around instead of vibrating.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Olay Fresh Effects Va Va Vivid from Influenster.com and so far I&#x27;m pretty pleased. I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for the past week and can feel a difference. My face feels clean and as I&#x27;m cleansing I can see my everyday make up disappear. This is the first power cleansing system I have used so I&#x27;m not sure how it stacks up to other brands but the convenient size and shape makes it great for traveling. The triangle shape makes it easy to get the sides of my nose and face so I can concentrate on any areas on my face that are having problems. The shine minimizing cleanser works well so far, after I was my face I noticed it wasn&#x27;t as shiny. I have acne prone skin so keeping thing clean is very important for me, the rubber bristles on this makes that very easy to do. I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t make my normal cleanser foam up but it works great at getting off my makeup. I would love to see how well the Va Va Vivid and Make Up Removal wipes can take off the Olay Fresh Effects BB cream!</li>
    <li> I love this product! The cleansing brush really make the cleanser lather up and it is like a massage for your face!</li>
    <li> I really do enjoy this product. Before i started using it, my problem with my face was that my forehead and my chin looked like it was scaly. Even after washing and scrubing, it felt like it looked ugly. After using the brush with the face product, i started to notice a difference. my skin felt smoother and after putting on make up, i did not see those &#x27;scales&#x27; anymore. I must also mention i had acne on my chin, and slowly, but surely it seems to be going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the brush with my own facewash and it seems to do the trick too. i stopped using the product after 2 days because i dont have oily skin or shine. my face is dry right now, so i did not want to bother with it. so i use the brush much more often, with my own facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;invest in the brush! haha</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster through my VoxBox to try out, which is wonderful. I already own the Olay Pro X cleansing brush that I LOVE so this was a change for me. Not sure that I&#x27;m too fond of the rubber bristles because I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s really cleaning my skin whereas the rotating Pro X brush does. I also received the shine on cleanser and I actually noticed that my skin was very oily at the end of the day, thought it was strange and then I remembered that I used the new face wash that morning. It&#x27;s okay, but I prefer the ProX brush for a deep clean feel.</li>
    <li> I do love this product. The powered brush cleans really well &amp; the cleanser does keep the shine away! My face feels so clean &amp; smooth after using it. I definitely will try other products.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s amazing and so invigorating for your skin. Very refreshing and makes my skin so amazing! :) I def recommend this to anyone needing a good cleansing system. Please feel free to check out my youtube channel [...] and or my blog [...] I do beauty blogs and beauty videos! Thanks</li>
    <li> The face wash actually helps control my oil.</li>
    <li> I am a huge skin care nut and have two Clarisonics for both of my homes.  I travel a lot for work and I wanted something that can fit in my overnight computer roller bag that gives some extra cleansing ability - my expectation is pretty low, just something better than manual cleansing using my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the low expectation, this product is a huge let down - it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than extreme weak microvibration, almost like a buzz but nothing more.  No matter what I do, I cannot get my foaming cleanser to foam on my face.  The head is made of silicone coated rubber&#x27;ish material, so they are big and not like normal brush bristles.  There is simply not enough of them to create foam when you massage this on my skin in circular motions.  You will have to use your hand directly if you want your cleanser to foam.  Needless to say, my skin didn&#x27;t look clean after a minute (as recommended) nor did it feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at the unit with disappointment, I suddenly realize that I&#x27;ve seen this poor design before - Oral-B Hummingbird Floss.  Yup, P&amp;G, which owns the Oral-B brand, decided to recoup its investment on that failure by coming up with a new attachment for face cleansing under the Olay brand.  A bad idea and bad design, no matter how you package it and spin it, is still a failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is totally a needless waste of money for something that doesn&#x27;t work - it&#x27;s no more than an effort from P&amp;G to reuse another bad idea and an attempt to sell more batteries for its Duracell division.  You can buy a $2 facial cleansing brush and it will be far more effective than this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2-11-2103:  I was notified on Olay Comm Mgr&#x27;s comment on my review, so I called P&amp;G using the number listed.  As expected, it&#x27;s a general support number for Olay and the agent on the phone doesn&#x27;t know what to do with my call.  It was totally a needless phone call, and this got me even more irritated.  I wanted to see if the \\&quot;400%better clean\\&quot; than \\&quot;basic cleansing\\&quot; claim is as bad as I believe it is, so I did another experiment.  I smeared some kitchen grease on the back of my left hand and attempted to use this brush to clean my hand and it did not remove the smear but made my hand really red.  I then reapply some more grease and use my right hand fingers to massage the same liquid cleanser and the grease smear was gone in 2-3 seconds.  Therefore, I standby my feedback that this power cleaning system is completely useless, period.</li>
    <li> I use this Day &amp; Night for almost 3 weeks now and I can tell that this product makes your face squeaky clean and it smells great.The brush it didn&#x27;t do anything aside from vibrating it onto your skin. The bristle was kinda hard and it doesn&#x27;t really circulate. Overall, I don&#x27;t think that it is really working for my skin though lately i have been getting these pimples, blackheads here and there and its annoying coz its painful too. &#x3D;( so, I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m going to try this again. By the way I received this Olay Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING. I&#x27;m so glad I got this -- it makes my skin feel absolutely amazing! It&#x27;s so small and compact, I can throw it in my purse for \\&quot;on the go\\&quot; cleaning. I can&#x27;t say good enough things about this product. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay fresh effects va-va-vivid cleansing system sense march 1, the day I got it. It&#x27;s made my face feel fresh and soft. I love how it&#x27;s small and portable. The unique shape of the cleanser gets all the hard to reach places on my face. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time making sure around my nose and piercing were clean. With this I can get around my face no problem as well as making sure my piercings are staying clean too. The cleansing solution that comes with it is very nice. It doesn&#x27;t smell, and it&#x27;s not harsh on my skin. I have very sensitive skin. So when I use something that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or get a rash after using it, is a winner in my book. The cleansing system costs 12.99 which compared to other cleansing systems is a really great price. To purchase a full size of the fresh effects shine shine go away that comes with the cleanser is only 6.99 and that&#x27;s for a 5oz. The one that comes in the kit is only 0.68oz. I do plan on purchasing the full size. I&#x27;m also going to look into get the lotion. Cause rite now I&#x27;ve just been using my cetephil lotion after I use the cleansing system.</li>
    <li> This product is so cool and effective. The gentle vibrations are not rough at all (actually quite soothing) and leaves your face feeling smooth and clean. I am one who suffers with oily skin, so this is definitely a product I&#x27;ll be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This face cleanser really is smooth on your face and the vibrating hand tool is gentle. My face is really oily and very shiny especially on mt T-zone. I have been using this face cleanser for about two weeks and I have seen a big improvement on my face and once I rinse my face it feels so smooth and I am now less oily.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Olay Fresh Effects Powered Contour Cleansing System!  I use the system twice a day all over my face.  First when I wake up then again right before I go to bed.  Before I used this system I had acne on my chin then would get a few break outs here and there on my cheeks.  I am SO glad to say that my face has really cleared up since using this system!  My skin is also extremely soft and smells good too!  This kit is a must have!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This is the first shine reducing product that I actually like.  Either the product irritates my skin, is too drying, or flat out doesn&#x27;t work but after using this system over just a few days I can totally see the difference.  With super oily skin, by the end of the day my face is shiny &amp; my make up just looks....bleh.  But with this system I was impressed with the lasting no-shine effect &amp; that my make up looked great because of this.  Really, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> I received this fresh effects system complimentary from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this system would definitely be the brush. It&#x27;s tiny, portable, cute, light-weight and easy to use. The brushes are rubber but that makes them more supple and easier to manage around the contours of the face. It&#x27;s great for your T-zone or around areas of the nose. It creates this nice frothy lather and leaves your skin super soft. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it has reduced the visibility of my pores. I love this system! I&#x27;m eager to try out other products from the Fresh Effects line! I really recommend to anyone looking for a cleansing system that&#x27;s affordable, readily available and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and I have seen quite a change in how my skin looks which is much better. I have dry skin and before using this system whenever I cleansed my face I would have ashy spots after I dry it now I don&#x27;t I have a soft smooth texture that has a nice glow to it. The design of the brush is amazing it gets around my nose which has been a problem spot for me in the past. It is easy to use and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> This is such a great buy, for a little over $10 you get a small bottle of face wash and a little cleaning device that helps you do the cleaning. After using this I&#x27;ve noticed my pores getting smaller. Whats great about this is, it isn&#x27;t too harsh on your face. I use it day and night and I&#x27;m just loving this device.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean your face well enough, and the cleaning product often gets stuck in cleansing bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Its not worth the money and it doesn&#x27;t give any kind of real lather.</li>
    <li> okay i received this olay fresh effects complimentary from Influenster! &amp; I just tried it, it works amazing, my skin gets oily specially when its hot outside. so i can&#x27;t wait to try it when my face is really oily. but it comes with a battery the facial cleaner and the facial wash.</li>
    <li> I had got to try Olay Fresh Effects complimentary from Inflenster and I was so excited to try it. I first tried it that first night because I wanted to see if my face was oily the next morning. Well to my surprise it was not! It was still as soft as the night before when I was finished using it. The brush is not made of a harsh material so it doesn&#x27;t hurt or isn&#x27;t rough on the skin. It&#x27;s the perfect size to get in the all the corners. I absolutely love it there is not on thing I would chance. Just a future idea for the cleanser .. an acne/oil prone cleanser maybe? Love this product though highly recommend to someone that is thinking of trying it!</li>
    <li> Love the little brush, it vibrates and get my face super clean. Leaving it feeling soft and ready for make-up, without the Shine!</li>
    <li> i love it ! its so great at removing the whole days worth of dirt on my face! plus it easily removes my makeup and helps my acne!</li>
    <li> It leaves my face extra clean and super soft! Thanks to Influenster for letting me try this amazing product. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems with my skin, with it being dry mostly... Plus a lot of redness on my face, I was so excited to try this especially with the little massaging brush! The first time I used this I loved the way the cleanser smelled! It smells amazing! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and I&#x27;m never shy to try new things that might just be the one to work on my skin! After using this, my skin was SO SO soft! It really felt so clean! That&#x27;s honestly something I&#x27;ve never felt after using a skincare product before! The soft bristles on the brush are so nice on my skin, I don&#x27;t scrub, I just let it massage my face and clean while it&#x27;s pampering my skin! I probably shouldn&#x27;t have done it, but I kept touching my face after I was done! Lol. It really got me hooked on Olay products! I really want to own this whole line! I even told my sisters about it, so they are interested too! I never really noticed a difference in my skin before, but I really do now and I have to say I&#x27;m really excited! This product is awesome! My face hasn&#x27;t been dry and I have no shine on my face!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of problems with having dry skin after showering and this doesn&#x27;t leave my problem areas flaky and dry.I&#x27;m really happy with the results I&#x27;ve gotten with it and have noticed how much nicer my skin looks after I use it. I will be getting using this again.</li>
    <li> I received this cleansing system free from Influenster.com for testing purposes. I had begun using the Clarisonic Mia 2 around Christmas, so all of my reactions to this Olay product were in comparison to the other, more expensive system.&lt;br /&gt;I will start with the cons of the Olay Va-Va-Vivid system: 1. The bristles are rubber, so they are a little more rough on the face than some of the softer bristles on other brushes. 2. The brush is battery-powered, not re-chargeable. 3. There is no beeping timer to tell you when to move from on section of your face to another. 3. The brush is pretty small compared to others. 4. The head is not removable/replaceable, and there is only one type of brush head.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the positives! 1. The PRICE is about 1/10th of the cost of the Clarisonic! If you are looking to try out a vibrating facial cleansing brush, I would definitely try this one before spending more money on something else! 2. The rubber bristles actually seem to trap less dirt than other bristles, so this brush may be more sanitary. 3. As far as I can tell, the vibration of this brush works just as well as the more expensive ones to get my face clean. It feels great, and gets my face feeling soft and squeaky clean! It is also a nice little \\&quot;wake-up\\&quot; in the morning. 4. The cleanser that comes with the set is nice! It really does seem to keep my face from getting shiny throughout the day. 5. The triangle shape of the brush head fits into the crevices around my nose and gets close to my hairline very easily! I actually like this shape better than the bulky round ones on other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this cleansing system! Since I began using vibrating brushes (3 months ago), my skin has completely changed! I have had combination skin, with oily spots and dry spots, for about 10 years. Now, my skin is never oily, and it looks more clear and even-toned than ever! I have had maybe 1 small breakout since I started using these types of cleansingsystems. The pores on my nose and chin are more clear, and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I received the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid ! Powered Contour Cleansing System 1 for free from Influenster. This new Fresh Effects system is wonderful . The brush is small and triangular shaped and the bristles are made of rubber so it get&#x27;s to every spot on my face . My face feels so smooth and refreshed every time I use this system. I would try more products from the Fresh Effects Collection.</li>
    <li> I just finished using Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects Va-va-vivid and I&#x27;ve had a great experience. My skin feels super smooth and soft. I don&#x27;t see anything in my pores. I will definitely include this in my beauty regime. My voxbox came with Shine, shine, go away but I would definitely like to try all of the Fresh Effects cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> This product is seriously amazon. It leaves your skin so clean and soft. And honestly it&#x27;s more fun than washing your face with plain face wash. The tool makes me feel more comfortable that it&#x27;s really getting the dirt out. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have to say I was kind of iffy about the new Olay Fresh Effects but I had to give it a try. So I followed the directions inspected everything and went to town. I have to say this was the best smelling facial cleanser very pleasent.  I expected the usual foul smelling but effective solution but it was the total opposite. It lathered nicely and is an interesting silver color which I also didn&#x27;t expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to the vibrating brissel wand yeah again no expectations here..what can a vibrating brissel wand do? Well number one it gives you an awesome facial massage and two it works in the cleanser to help well cleanse. Over all I am very happy with this product! After rinsing, my face was so smooth and dare I say it? Pretty damn clean! So all you skeptics out there give it a try!</li>
    <li> I received the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va Vivid system, complimentary, from Influenster in the Sweet Heart Voxbox to try and review and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  I LOVE it!  It makes my skin look fresh with a beautiful glow.  I&#x27;ve always had terrible trouble with my skin being too dry and dull but this changes it. It doesn&#x27;t break me out or dry out my skin.  My sensitive skin loves this product! Thank you, Olay, for making this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Olay has out done themselves with this one! I have combinations skin; it gets dry very quickly but is oily at the same time. My skin is also rather sensitive and this product is not too harsh on my skin and still gets the job done of making my skin smooth while getting rid of the oil in my T-Zone. Over all this product is great! Only problem I have with this is that I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks and I am almost out of the product and need to go buy another tube, hopefully I don&#x27;t have to repurchase the whole set just to get the tube.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product free from Influenster I was beyond excited to try it. I&#x27;m always skeptical about purchasing new skin care products without testing them first! My skin is very sensitive and this product left me feeling smooth and refreshed! A product that removes oil without drying my skin, fantastic! I already can see a noticeable improvement in my skin. I plan on purchasing this product again! A+</li>
    <li> I received the Va-Va-Vidvid! Powered Contour Cleansing System Kit from Influenster free of charge. I was very surprised at how much I ended up loving the face wash. I have acne prone, combination skin that gets very oily in the t-zone, especially in the southern heat. I like to use the face wash with my Clarisonic Mia in the morning to wash my face before applying makeup. The cleanser foams nicely and washes away leaving my face feeling clean but not tight. I can&#x27;t comment on how well it removes makeup since I use a separate cleaner for that. On the days I use this cleaner I notice that my foundation doesn&#x27;t oxidize into a orange tint by the end of the day and I can go without blotting my face at least three hours later than I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the contour brush that comes in the kit. I hated it. Like I said before, I use a Clarisonic Mia so the vibrating tool doesn&#x27;t even compare. I do like that the triangular shape fits nicely in the nose contours, helping the cleanser reach spots that might have been missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely repurchase the face wash, but not the tool.</li>
    <li> I got this product in my influenster voxbox and i loved it. It makes my face feel so clean and I feel the power brush really working, it gets my face cleaner than just using a face wash. The face was says it minimizes shine, and it really does. This is a great product and a great price, it is definitely worth a try. The face wash works great and the power brush it a must have.</li>
    <li> I got to try this out complementary from Influenster and I am so glad I did! I love it! Don&#x27;t let the silver color of the cleanser and the size of the brush turn you off. I love how precise the triangle brush is, I can&#x27;t even imagine how awkward it must be to use one of those more expensive brushes with the giant heads! Whenever I use this cleanser my skin feels refreshed and ultra clean without feeling striped or overly dry! And I think it really does help reduce shine during the day vs another cleanser! I want to try out the Satin Lotion or the BB Cream in the line next!</li>
    <li> I think the Olay Fresh Effects cleaning system is fantastic. My face feels so clean after using it. My favorite feature is definitely that the scrub brush bristles are made from rubber, that way they aren&#x27;t too scratchy on the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I received the Olay Fres Effects Powered Contour Cleaning System in my Sweetheart voxbox recently. I have been using it every day since I received it and I love it. It cleansed my face very well, it did break me out, but I only got two small pimples on my chin, which isn&#x27;t bad. I never break out, but I believe it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job by removing all of the impurities of my skin that isn&#x27;t visible to the naked eye. It also left my face feeling soft and smooth. The wash it comes with has a nice fresh smell and I love using it everyday. I am really happy with this product and will buy the full size once I run out of the cleansing cream.</li>
    <li> As someone with sensitive skin who has probably tried just about everything, I was a bit skeptical when I got this Fresh Effects set complimentary from Influenster.  Lately, I&#x27;ve been pretty set on using some sort of exfoliating cleanser and moisturizer combo and keeping it simple because my face gets a lot of build up if I use much more.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with Va-Va-Vivid.  The cleansing brush exfoliates, but isn&#x27;t so harsh that you feel attacked (which is how I feel about other electric cleansers).  It&#x27;s gentle and actually pretty soothing, while still cleaning off all the excess skin and buildup that I get throughout the day.  The shine-free cleanser is pretty awesome too and helps with excess oil. I usually still add in my usual cleanser for some added action because the cleanser is pretty mild, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I got this product complimentary from Influenster.com to test out. Given the price I might not have tried it otherwise. It&#x27;s brush is tiny, which I like because it goes around my t-zone pretty good. The bristles are rubber and don&#x27;t move too fast. I think it cleans my face pretty well. This is a good tool to use to clean your face. The only con I have is that its really not meant to clean off eye make-up. Since its a motorized tool I understand why though. Overall  I like it and would recommened it to others to give it a shot.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve wanted a clarisonic for a long time, but this works pretty well! I really like how it lathers with the brush, and that it is waterproof!</li>
    <li> I loved using this product! It is super simpe to use. It comes with a battery already installed so no fluttering around to find a battery. It left my face feeling soft and clean! The smell is really good as well. I recommend this!</li>
    <li> Got the product from Influenster, and it was amazing. I dont have any breakouts! The vibrating thing almost make it feel like I was shaving my face, but it kept my face clean!</li>
    <li> I love this product. After using it it really left my  skin feeling squeaky clean! I would definately buy it again!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I recommend it. It leaves your skin feeling soft and clean and it takes away all the oil on your face. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Realllllllllllly awesome product! The very first time i used this, i had no idea what to expect, so i washed my face first with my usual product, then followed up with this. after using this Olay kit, i found that my usual cleanser wasnt getting my faced as clean as i thought! This stuff is great with removing make up and oil from pores, and it leaves my skin feeling tight and refreshed! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive the Sweetheart VoxBox from Influenster which featured this product and let me tell you, I love it! First of all, this powered cleanser is so much cheaper than others that you see in drugstores yet it does the same thing. I really feel extra fresh after using it, versus using my hands. And the Cleanser! Oh my, it not only cleanses your face but it smells so good! Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to find something to help control my acne, I can&#x27;t say yet that this helps to get rid of it, but it definitely helps to prevent breakouts. Overall I love this product and I will definitely be repurchasing in the future!</li>
    <li> My face is always oily and I cannot tell you how many products I have gone through to try to find one that works. I don&#x27;t think I have to look anymore because the Olay Fresh Effects keeps my face feeling fresh and oil free and it feels AMAZING! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the newest and most interesting product that i have ever tried. It&#x27;s an exclusively new way of cleaning my face, my skin felt so fresh and clean. All it takes is one time and you will fall in love with it. Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid Powered Contoured Cleansing System Kit is amazing . The first time i used it, i was excited to try it out. I applied it to my face and used the powered cleanser brush, it moves smoothly; almost like a perfect fit to my face. Once finished, i looked in the mirror and immediately noticed the difference. No makeup residue was left on my face, it was on my brush. I noticed how my face was bright, that fresh clean feeling. This Olay product really does live up to it&#x27;s expectations. THANKS @OLAY FRESH EFFECTS AND @INFLUESTER for this amazing opportunity. I obtained it complimentary by my @Influenster Sweetheart Voxbox.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great for my normal skin type. I would recommend it for daily use on all occasions! The brush is gentle and soothing.</li>
    <li> I just recently tried this project out and im not going to lie i dont usually use many facial cleansing products but i surely love this one my face felt fresh and i have this natural glow coming out something that people have really noticed i recommend this product to just about anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product it really does keep me feeling fresh! It also feels great and clean and smells amazing! Definitely recommend to get a clean, fresh face after a long day!</li>
    <li> This is so awesome, It works beautifully. I absolutely LOVE the cleansing brush, its like a mini facial. It makes my skin feel so clean and refreshed! And Shine, Shine, Go Away! Makes the shine go :)!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I received it through Influenster for testing purposes and have fallen in love with it since. It gently vibrates over your skin for a maximum clean. My face feels great and it doesn&#x27;t dry out. I&#x27;m definitely purchasing this from now on.. By the way, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I did enjoy this product the first few times using it. It does an excellent job scrubbing for face and cleaning it. My skin has been breaking out recently and it did help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have extremely sensitive skin, and rosacea. So while this cleaned my face, it also really irritated it. I have read elsewhere that products with scrubbing electronic cleaners can make your rosacea act up. I do believe this is a good product, I would just use caution if you also have rosacea, or sensitive skin. If you do not, I think you would find this very useful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this cleanser! After just one use my face already felt 10 times cleaner than ever before.  I have used countless cleansers, even high dollar ones, ans this is by far my favorite</li>
    <li> I really love the concept of the product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t have the best ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the wand, it&#x27;s the perfect size and shape for your face and the movement isn&#x27;t too rough or too soft so it actually feels like it&#x27;s doing something! It leaves my face feeling refreshed and awesome, like I just had a facial.</li>
    <li> Received this product in the Sweatheart voxbox from influenster. I absolutely love this stuff leaves your face feeling so clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin this product is the absolute best! I have the most sensitive skin and this product is a miracle :) must buy!</li>
    <li> I love the brush for this and the cleanser smells awesome.  The only problem I had was that it was too drying for my very sensitive skin.  So I kept the brush and will try another cleanser and gave the cleanser to my roomie, who loves it!</li>
    <li> I was able to try Olay Fresh Effects thanks to influenster.com. I have never tried a battery powered face brush cleaning system before, so I wasn&#x27;t really sure how much better it would be than manually cleaning my face with a loofah or a wash cloth and facial soap. I was really surprised at how strong the vibrations of this little face brush were. The cleanser has a light, clean and refreshing scent and lathers very well. The directions stated: \\&quot;Splash your face. Dispense a small amount of product into hands. Add water work into a lather, adding more water if necessary. Massage gently onto face and neck. Rise thoroughly for a deeply refreshing cleansing experience. AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES\\&quot;. I used the system in the shower so I splashed my face with water and squeezed a small amount of cleanser on the Powered Brush and used it to lather in a circular motion. I used the system everyday for over a month on my face, neck, and shoulders and I seen a difference in the cleanliness of my skin since I started to use this system instead of my normal routine. The only thing that I would change about the system is that I believe that for the price the cleanser should come in a bigger size, 20 mL just wasn&#x27;t enough product for me.</li>
    <li> i have received this product from influenster. This product have made my face less oily than the other products i&#x27;ve used. i recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This face wash smells great and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much!  I didn&#x27;t care much for the face scrubber though!</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster, to start out with. I was super excited, because I always wanted to try a fancy vibrating face cleanser but they&#x27;re so pricy! I used it right away and multiple times throughout the next few weeks.  I really did like it, it did clean my face and make it feel smooth. Plus it just felt cool! BUTTTTT it also dried my face out something crazy. \\&quot;BUT IT&#x27;S TO REMOVE OIL, IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO DRY YOUR FACE OUT IDIOT\\&quot; Um, yes. I realize this, BUT I also realize that I&#x27;ve used other products that remove oil but don&#x27;t leave your face feeling like you soaked it in alcohol then dipped it in snow before standing in 50 mph winds! I had to put lotion on after every use, which kinda defeats the purpose. I think I may try a different kind/brand of face wash with the little tool, because that tool does work! Plus it&#x27;s the cheapest out there, that are name brand that I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample through influenster in sweetheart voxbox. I have been using it since, I absolutely love it! I have a naturally oily t-zone and work in a very dirty environment, I feel like my skin has been much less shiny and looks much cleaner! I love the feel of the vibrating face brush, it makes me feel as though it is getting all the dirt and dead skin off.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in my sweethearts voxbox from Influenster. Its not only a cleanser but I can say its also a face massager. The brush is an amazing edition with the cleanser as it helps exfoliate my face and makes it much softer and less oily. The first time I noticed the brush was hard on my face but one technique that helps me is warm water. Wash the brush with warm water first as it makes it much softer and pour some warm water on your face too. This way your skin is also welcoming of the cleanser brush and the brush also becomes soft so its an amazing feeling. I like to massage my face with this brush for at least 5 minutes as the vibration is really relaxing and it cleanses all your pores. I have been using Olay products from a long time but had never used this so thanks to Influenster for sending this to me and giving me the opportunity to try it out.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. It dulled out the shiny parts of my t zone and all the while buffed off most of my dry skin. Definitely a must try :] plus the bristles on the brush are really soft so it feels like a little massage !</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great new product! The shape of the brush is probably the best part because it really allows you to get in the little spaces on your face (i.e. the sides of your nose). The cleanser left my face feel extremely clean!</li>
    <li> this product was awesome! it not only smelled great but its also great in taking the shine away off your face. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is looking to buy it!</li>
    <li> I like the feel of my face when I am done. It feels fresh and soft. It tickles a little around the nose but otherwise it is great!</li>
    <li> I received the cleansing system complimentarily from Influenster, and I&#x27;ve never been so happy with a product! I had a Neutrogena Wave for a while, and this is just so much better. I have never before had my skin be literally squeaky clean. I have really sensitive skin, and both the formula and the powered unit are soft and gentle enough that I&#x27;ve had no problems. And it gets my face so clean! I love feeling like every bit of dirt, oil, and makeup is gone from my skin!</li>
    <li> My nose is so oily and he rest of my face is so dry and this is the only thing that solves both problems! I use it every other day. It smells amazing and feels really good</li>
    <li> The Olay Fresh Effects Va Va Vivid Power Contour Cleansing System comes with a cleanser and a vibrating brush. Its pretty cool and it exfoliates really well. The cleanser is great for oily skin because it controls shine. Definitely a product you should check out!</li>
    <li> I have dry very sensitive skin and this left my face feeling so soft and clean! The vibrating cleaning brush is awesome and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, I love the triangle shape its perfect for getting on the sides of my nose, under my eye, and hairline. I definitely recommend this to everyone with any skin type! I love it. Plain and simple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product and was not overly impressed by it. But it wasn&#x27;t bad. It Didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for my face.</li>
    <li> I received an Olay Fresh Va-Va-Vivid complimentary from Influenster. The product is great and compact. Since you can take it in the shower, that&#x27;s where I leave mine. It smells great and is definitely my favorite facial cleanser. My skin is very &amp;#34;shiny,&amp;#34; and after using the product, I don&#x27;t think it lessens the shine as much as other products I&#x27;ve tried, but as a cleanser, it is one of the best. I love most of Olay&#x27;s products, and will definitely try others.</li>
    <li> By far the best face products I&#x27;ve used. I have acne prone skin so I like the fact that it minimizes shine, since I have oily skin because of my acne. Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, locks in moisture, it feels wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t dry out skin at all, but leaves skin sift like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I don&#x27;t like the scent to much though, but it works wonders. Removes oil, dirt, skin feels fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received \\&quot;fresh effects\\&quot; products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, these are all my honest opinions.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer:I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product!When i run out I will defiently buy new batteries and a full size of the Shine,Shine Go away .This cleanses my skin so nicely and leaves it smooth and smelling great.I love the brush though since this a product most importantly for the T zone and nose area The brush shape is perfect for those places.I would definetly love to try out other products of the collection.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Influenster, I got the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid! Powered Contour Cleansing System. The scent of the facial wash is perfect and it gives your face a lovely revitalizing massage. The only problem I had was it made my skin feel tight for a while after. Overall, I recommend this product to everyone of all skin types!</li>
    <li> I got Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid -- Shine, Shine Go Away compementary in my Influenster Sweetheart Voxbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush was a little weird shaped. But, I figured, they had a reason for that-- and they really do. The shape helps get the areas that are hard to reach with normal means (That little space underneath your eyes but  right  THERE at your nose, being one of them.) The triangle fits perfectly in that area. I have NEVER felt a deeper clean there, omg!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it can be a little hard to turn off. I had to try to turn it off three times before it finally did.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;d love to try another product from this collection.</li>
    <li> Olay Fresh Effects {Va-Va-Vivid!} Powered Contour Cleansing System: $12.99&lt;br /&gt;  So this triangle shape cleaner is interesting, I don&#x27;t know that I would have purchased this but I&#x27;m so happy that it was sent! Its obviously not the Clarisonic but for the price its worth it. At first it doesn&#x27;t look too impressive but after using it twice a day for almost a week i think its pretty good. I don&#x27;t think it gets too deep but it defiantly takes of more makeup even after i scrub my face with regular cleanser. I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Fresh Effects {Shine, Shine Go Away} $6.99 full price 5oz&lt;br /&gt;  The instructions say after putting water on your face and the brush to put a dab on the brush and have at it!! I like it, smells nice, seems like it would be a decent price for the amount. It claims to reduce pores (I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference... yet) and keep shine away. I personally have more struggles with dry skin rather than shine so I&#x27;m not sure whether this works for that or not. I do like this and will repurchase when its empty</li>
    <li> This will clean your face but it won&#x27;t dry it out, it&#x27;s gentle and effective! It&#x27;s worth the buy for sure :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks and the results have truly blown me away! My skin has never looked so good! I would definitely recommend this to EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, it left my face feeling clean and fresh but not anything special especially for the cost.  I suggest sticking to your regular face wash!</li>
    <li> I received the cleansing system from Influenster to test. I really like the cleanser. It smells good and makes my face feel cleaner and smoother after use. I like to use the brush for the harder to reach places, the triangle shape is very useful. I use my clarisonic primarily, but sometimes I will finish with the Olay brush around my nose. For the price, this is a very good option. I will definitely purchase the cleanser again!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this product. I have terrible shine, especially living in an extremely humid area, so I was really excited to receive this product. Unfortunately, I also break out if I dont use face wash with acne medication.&lt;br /&gt;pros: portable. small, made me face feel smooth&lt;br /&gt;cons: couldn&#x27;t use it with my normal face wash, didn&#x27;t feel like I was washing my face throughly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t need acne medication, or can find one as dense as the face wash that comes with it this is the perfect product. If you&#x27;re like me and you need a specific face wash? maybe not the best choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to making my own facial scrubs so this product didn&#x27;t \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot; me. I didn&#x27;t like the cleanser that came in the kit but I think if you like vibrating facial tools, you&#x27;ll probably like this. The vibrations are strong but the brush is very gentle. My face felt softer after using it but it didn&#x27;t feel any different than it normally does. I would recommend it for those who love beauty tools but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to keep your face feel fresh and opening your pores. The cream leaves your skin feel soft all day received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Makes my skin feel so fresh and actually clean!! I recommend it definitely! I love the tool it gets your face more clean. I honestly use it everyday.</li>
    <li> It gets my face clean without stripping my face &amp; leaving it feeling dry &amp; stretched out, but it doesn&#x27;t leave too much oil either. It just feels clean and moisturized and awesome.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good face cleanser forever. None of them have ever worked as well as the Olay fresh effects though. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!! I use it everysingle day!! it works great with my combo skin type! its small enough that i take it when i travel! i use the brush with all my face cleansers and the soap that comes with it really helps on my greasy face days!! If you are looking for a deep clean this is what your looking for!! i was so happy that i received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster</li>
    <li> This product is great! I especially love the scrub brush. I was wanting the clerasonic but I have no interest in it now.</li>
    <li> When I got this product from Influenster as a complimentary product in my VoxBox,I was really excited. Currently, I am a devoted Proactive user and it is rather pricey, so looking for a good product that works well and is cheap, I&#x27;ll take. But this did not do it for me. Although it is a shine minimizing cleanser, I don&#x27;t think it is. I was greasy within an hour! The brush is really good though! It cleans really well and gets in the contours of my face, relieving dirt from my pores!</li>
    <li> I love this product, at first I was a little hesitant because I have used other products and they do not work, but using Olay Fresh Effects help my skin feel smooth and cleanse.</li>
    <li> I received a trial box complementary and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month. The shape of the brush reaches spots that round brushes can&#x27;t and the rounded bristles are gentle on my skin. The shine free cleanser really keeps you shine free all day. I would definitely recommend this product and I think it&#x27;s a great beginners tool to having beautiful clean skin.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary Olay Get Fresh cleansing system to test from Influenster and love it! The directions are so simple and can be found on the box. This cleansing system would be great for anyone who is looking for a new cleansing system! I have always just used my hands and water or a wash cloth but now that I have used the brush in this system, I know I will never go back. My skin is super smooth. Because of my great experience with this cleansing system, I have just replaced my usual body wash with Olay bar soap and fell in love with that too! The only downside I experienced is that my skin felt super sensitive for about 10-15 minutes after using the product. I imagine that is because my face has never had a battery operated brush on it before! If you are looking for a new cleansing system, I would definitely recommend trying this Va-Va-Vivid product. I know I would like to try more products from that line.</li>
    <li> this is a great product, my face is oily and I am a person who had great skin until giving birth to my two children. I get acne and my skin becomes super oily and if I even go outside for a second it starts breaking out and I turn all red. this product helps my skin by making it feek so refresh and cool, and I hardly have a break out. thank you for making such a great product.</li>
    <li> This is good product. It is relatively inexpensive compared to some of the other systems on the market and it gets the job done. The cleanser smells great and the vibrating brush feels so amazing against your face. My only complaint is that the brush is a tad smaller than I imagined or would have liked. There are definitely better products out there, but if you&#x27;re in a pinch, this is a really fun product to have.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed how after using this product my face felt fresh and clean. I have used other types of scrubbers and face cleaners like this and I didn&#x27;t like how it left my face feeling, but I really like how Olay leaves me feeling refreshed and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I got this free in a voxbox from influenster and I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the product. I didn&#x27;t really understand how it could work and I&#x27;m still not sure about the glorified \\&quot;vibrator\\&quot; but I think that it works. My face always feels smoother and softer after using it, so it must do something! The only thing I&#x27;m not sure of is the price, the rest of the product is great though, I recommend trying it out!</li>
    <li> I loved the tool a lot, I use with my old face wash. the face wash that came with it just doesn&#x27;t really do anything good or bad for my skin.  (Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster)</li>
    <li> The cleansing system isn&#x27;t as bulky or daunting as some other system and is small enough to travel with. It doesn&#x27;t need to be charged and only uses an AAA battery. Its plastic-like bristles are soft and gentle enough to not irritate skin but effective enough to do a deep clean. As for the cleanser, I&#x27;m not sure if I loved it. While it did clean as well as other cleansers I&#x27;ve used, it was hard to rinse away. I actually spent more time trying to rinse it off than I did actually cleaning my face.

    <li> I love this product for a cute travel friend rather than taking my Clarisonic! Not a big fan of the facial cleanser itself, but the cleansing system is great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this system! I had the opportunity to try it for free thanks to Influenster, and I&#x27;m so glad I was able to, because I assumed it was a gimmick before I tried it and I wouldn&#x27;t have gone to purchase it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Va-Va-Vida is so gentle on my skin, but it cleans my face way better than I can with just my hands. It leaves my face SO SMOOTH and I feel refreshed after using it. It also works really well to clean around my nose and hairline. I like to use it on my nose before using a Biore Pore Strip. I think it really helps loosen the gunk in my pores and helps make the strip more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has had less breakouts since I started using this system. I do have sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t create any problems for me. I use it three or four times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser that is included is a mini size, which is great for travel. It is silvery in color and has a fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I find that it really cuts down on shine in my t-zone area. A little bit goes a long way. I will repurchase the cleanser in the full size when I run out of the mini, I also will check out more products in the Olay Fresh Effects line.</li>
    <li> I love the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid! powered contour cleaning system. My favorite part is the powered cleansing tool. I have mildly acne prone skin, so I need to use a cleanser that targets acne, so I have been using the cleansing tool with a different cleanser, but the kit is worth it just for the cleansing tool. It&#x27;s soft, doesn&#x27;t hurt on your skin, and cleans really well. I got to try this for free from Influenster, and now the cleansing tool has become part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I recieved this cleaning system complimentary from Influenster! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;And it works like a dream I have went and bought 2 more just because its amazing and really does work.</li>
    <li> I  absolutely  loved  this  product. I  have  really  sensitive  skin  and  it  was  very  gentle. It  gives you a  smooth  and  squeaky  clean face.This  is highly  recommended.</li>
    <li> So my boyfriend and I tried out this product, and well...as cute as it is, and as much as I wanted to really feel/see improvement, I didn&#x27;t. It was very gentle on the face, but maybe it was too gentle. I really did enjoy the concept of it, but it did nothing for my acne.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. And there is so much to say about it! 1) It is mini, perfect for traveling. 2) The shape of the cleansing brush works so well with the contours of your face. 3) The brush vibrates giving your face a great massage without it being too rough. 4) The cleanser not only smells great but actually helps to control shine!&lt;br /&gt;5) Together, the brush and the cleanser has kept my face looking and feeling fresh and clean. I haven&#x27;t broken out at all, the bumps I used to have around my chin have cleared dramatically, I haven&#x27;t seen as many blackheads on my nose as before, my once super oily face is now more controlled. It is the perfect cleansing system if you don&#x27;t want to spend tons of money! I definitely think I have found my new cleansing system for keeps!</li>
    <li> This product is great. Especially if you are looking for a good cleansing brush. It is more for the college student and/or person on a budget. Screw the Clairisonic &amp; spending $150 to $200! I would definitely try it!</li>
    <li> i got this item for free from INFLUENSTER! and i looove it! i have something similar from a more expensive brand but this one really compares well, and its much more affordable!i loved it and would totally purchase this again and again!</li>
    <li> I love the brush and will use it for other products, but the cleanser isn&#x27;t right for my skin type. I have dry skin, and this product made my skin drier.</li>
    <li> I really do love my new facial vibrating brush and cleanser. It smells great and does wonders to my face! Good job Olay!! You got it righ!!</li>
    <li> I was able to sample this product complementary through Influenster.com. I love it! It leaves me skin feeling fresh and clear. After 3 weeks of using it every day, I have noticed that my skin is clearer and has been breakout free.</li>
    <li> it leaves me skin feeling nice an i love it so far !  i would deff use this and purchase this again &#x3D;].</li>
    <li> I received this in my influenster VoxBox and it is sooooo nice! I didn&#x27;t think I would like it considering that it was so small and it doesn&#x27;t seem to vibrate that much....but in combination with the shine control cleanser it is amazing! I usually have to scrub my face to remove makeup, but not with this. It simply comes right off.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Cleanses your pores super well and leaves your skin feeling fresh, as well as being exfoliating! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I received Olay Fresh Effects in my Influenster Sweetheart VoxBox, and let me tell you I LOVE it! From the first time I tried Olay Fresh Effects, it left my skin glowing, and pores were noticeably smaller. I also like that the face lotion is silver, I&#x27;ve never seen that before.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what makes it a stand out product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s compact and light, therefore portable. It&#x27;s roughly the size of a disposable razor, though a negligible bit bulkier. Heck, it made it into my travel kit within a week of receiving it.&lt;br /&gt;2) It works off 1 AAA battery (first one comes pre-loaded), which minimizes the need for multiple charging accessories.&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s not harsh. The rubber tips are gentle, do not irritate the skin, and provide a firm massage &amp; cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;4) Easy maintenance - again, it&#x27;s basically rubber and plastic, so this pocket-sized powerhouse is easy to clean and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always feel refreshed and awake after using this, even without the accompanying Shine Shine Go Away Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find it&#x27;s not suiting you, try switching back to your regular cleanser before you give up on the product. Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently to different face washes and such, so maybe it&#x27;s the Shine Shine Go Away that&#x27;s not suiting you, not the VVV-system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Influenster for letting me try out this amazing product.</li>
    <li> this product works great, although i do reccomend that you use your usal facewash with the tool, if you have sensetive skin, i broke out after 2 usages.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this set and a few other products in my Influenster Voxbox. I&#x27;m a BIG skincare girl who really doesn&#x27;t like to spend much of my own money on stuff (being a broke college student is hard). I&#x27;ve been blessed with pretty clear skin (only occasional breakouts between my brows and the occasional whitehead here and there) but it is EXTREMELY dry. On the first day of getting my Voxbox, this was the first thing I tried out. I don&#x27;t own any fancy skincare systems (since I don&#x27;t really need it), like the clarisonic but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;ve never wanted to try one. But I was definitely not willing to splash out $150+ for one. This is pretty good if you have pretty okay skin. Since I have dry skin, I stopped using the cleanser after the first use. I really didn&#x27;t like the way that it refused to lather (I feel like it wasn&#x27;t getting anything clean). So the cleanser is a dud in my book since it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin. On the contrary, I do really like the vibrating thing. It lets me really cleanse with my own cleanser. And I can use it in the shower or just over the sink since it&#x27;s waterproof. The only thing I would complain about is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as gentle as can be. The bristles are actually harder than I though they&#x27;d be. But this can be a good thing too because it really helps exfoliate the dead skin cells off (which is good for a dry skin girl like me) but since it gets you so clean, you&#x27;re left with really polished, shiny skin (which I&#x27;m not a big fan of but makeup usually solves that issue and being too clean shouldn&#x27;t be an issue anyway). Overall, I do think that the vibrating brush is worth the money in itself even without the cleanser. I can&#x27;t really say much for the cleanser itself though since it really wasn&#x27;t for me. It&#x27;s not the clarisonic system (probably) but it is pretty good for what you pay for.</li>
    <li> So when it comes to the girly things in life such as moisturizing the face I am normally out.  I wash my face in the shower and then I&#x27;m done. However after using this little to and how easy,simple,quick, and relaxing this is I can do my daily moisturize and not worry about it taking up time. It&#x27;s a quick wash/rinse. But with a little face massage in between. This little toys first perfectly in your fingers so you don&#x27;t apply to much pressure and it&#x27;s just so simple. I say try it out.</li>
    <li> A fun product but not the equivalent to a day at the spa. ,I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to olay&#x27;s new thingy but I imagine they are all about the same. I got this product as a part of influenster.com promotional vox box. I did however find other uses for a small vibrating toy. For 12 bucks it can be used in the shower and internally. This product beats the 50 dollar ones you see at adam and eve dot com. If you are looking for portable pocket fun then look no further.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every available cleaning brush there is, with the exception of the super high-end models. While I have liked quite a few of the brushes, I never felt that they perfectly reached all of the areas on my face that I would have liked. Cue the Olay Va-Va-Vivid system. The triangular brush is perfect for getting to all of the tiny crevices on your face that oil tends to get trapped, like around your nose. It is also small enough to fit into you T-Zone without getting cleanser in your eyes, and a great size to throw into a travel back for taking on vacation! While I did like the effect that the Shine, Shine, Go Away cleanser had on my skin, I am very particular about the cleansers I use on my face. If the Shine, Shine, Go Away cleanser had been organic I would have been a much happier camper. That being said, the cleansing brush is to die for. Go grab one; you will thank me for it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, my face feels so clean and refreshed afterward. The face wash has a nice scent and is very gentle on my skin. I like to use mine in the shower.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;i Loved the way my skin felt after it. it didnt feel dried. when smiling my skin felt very soft and flexible., it didnt break. it had the right amount of cleanser and moisturizer. i  love the vibrating brush, it took the dried skin of my face very softly. i the fact that it was rubber bristles and not nor synthetic brush hair made it very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;the shape of the brush head was perfect. it followed the contours of the face. Also the amount of foam that the cleanser and brush made was perfect, and the aroma was very pleasing.</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster..and at I had never heard of it but always loved the other Olay products so I was really excited. I loved the brush and felt that it really cleansed my skin without being too rough. I use the brush once a week to get a nice deep clean. I will definitely buy Olay fresh effects in the future!!</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin &amp; this hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation, it has however made my skin feel clean :) It does kind of have a scent, which might not be good for some people, but it works great for me and the cleansing brush is nice to use :)</li>
    <li> I was so surprised to see this product in my sweetheart voxbox! It&#x27;s a great size for travelling, and a perfect product for those that are unsure if they want to spend an astronomical amount of money on a Clarisonic yet. I loved the shape of the brush, because I was able to get into smaller areas around my nose etc. That my normal cleansing brush wouldn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already bought a replacement of the cleanser, which keeps my skin pretty much shine free throughout nannying! Great new product.</li>
    <li> Received this free for product testing from influenster, wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. The powered cleansing brush kind of massages skin and is built to reach those weird little side-of-nose crannies, and exfoliates gently, as opposed to similar products I&#x27;d previously used that seem to just be a powersander for your face. Before this I was on a pretty hefty anti-acne cleanser/lots of moisturizer to help the skin dried out from cleanser, but I&#x27;ve found switching back and forth this in the mornings/anti-acne at night is actually working better for my skin, plus the massage-y feeling of the va-va-vivid is really nice for washing that sleepy feeling away too.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best face cleaners I have used in a while. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and softer. I also like how it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight like other face cleaners do. I received this complimentary from Influenster</li>
    <li> I LOVED the powered brush! The Olay worked well, but I have very sensitive skin, so I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it. However, I do still use the brush with my current facewash.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the Olay Fresh Effects at first but was pleasantly surprised. It went above and beyond what I thought it would be. I was interested in a similar product that was way more expensive. But got this for the price. It suds up really well and makes my face feel super clean after. I have combination skin and it didn&#x27;t dry out my dry areas and didn&#x27;t make my oily areas more oily. It was a perfect balance. Makes my face fresh and my complection clear.</li>
    <li> This product is great for travel and if you are looking for an alternative to the other pricier brands that offer a cleaning system, I would say this is worth a try.  It&#x27;s has a great massaging action and your face will thank you afterwards.</li>
    <li> if you have very sensitive skin dont use this. Otherwise the brush helps exfoliate your skin when used with other cleansers and helps remove dirt.</li>
    <li> So I have a love hate relationship with this product. I really like the triangular cleansing tool that comes with it. It really does contour to your face and the brissels are more of a rubbery feel not a brush so its does not feel harsh. I like a product that cleans all my makeup at once, eye makeup and face makeup. This does very well with the face makeup as the little cleansing brush kinda smudges it away but the cleanser does not do well on taking off eye makeup like mascara.I do not notice shine after using this but I do not have extremly shiny skin so I would not be able to see the difference anyways. The cleanser smells really good and you can always use other cleansers with the brush if you run out of it.</li>
    <li> I had wanted to try this before I received it in my Influenster Vox Box to review. When I got it, I was actually surprised that the system wasn&#x27;t as soft as I had expected, the bristles are actually hard. After the first time I used it though, I was in love! My face actually feels \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; after using the cleanser and the system. The bristles actually weren&#x27;t harsh on my face or as rough as I thought they would be. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone! I have combination skin that tends to get oily and this really did the trick!</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes this product. It&#x27;s a little smaller than expected. But, I think it&#x27;s great for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old with fair, very sensitive skin and a slightly oily t-zone. I was hoping that this cleansing system would work as an exfoliant and help remove flaky winter skin. The first observation that I made is that it has a vibrating pad of rubber bristles as oppossed to the typical bristles found on a facial brush. I assumed this would be for a less abrasive cleaning, however I found that it&#x27;s not effective in removing makeup, it just moved the foundation around on my face. So, I began using it in the morning before applying makeup and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin with the deep clean feeling I was hoping for. I feel that this cleansing wand is a step up from using my hands to wash my face, but a step down from using a rotating facial brush like the Olay Pro-X brush (which I happen to like a lot). This product is a great, non-abrasive tool for tween to teenage girls who aren&#x27;t using it to remove makeup but to keep their skin looking fresh. For women looking for a more thorough cleaning, I recommend the Olay Pro-X cleaning system.</li>
    <li> First of all... know this is a vibrator. It&#x27;s a little, vibrating pad that produces a gentle, soft vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses it every morning to wash her face -- She says that it feels like a deeper clean than simply washing with her hands. The device cleans easily, and is water-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a sturdy little machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 months later: She still likes and uses it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going through some of the worst acne breakouts of my life. I purchased this little device along with some of the other fresh effects products just looking to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instantly I noticed a difference in my skin after using it for the first time. Yes it is small, yes it&#x27;s bristles are rubber... But it&#x27;s perfect for getting deep into all the creases and edges of my face and because its bristles are rubber it is easy to keep clean. Every morning and every night my skin has felt like it has just received a facial at a spa. The shine free wash that usually comes with this product is not even all that good. It&#x27;s alright. But I just ended up finding other face washes that I like and using them instead.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has cleared up a lot now and I recommend this product to anyone just wanting something inexpensive and new.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that fancy Olay pro-x thinga majiggy is nice but this works just fine for me and is way less money. :)</li>
    <li> Nice cleanser, but REALLY like the way the brush gets rid of blackheads</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had a cleansing brush that she&#x27;d picked up from South Korea (where having perfect skin is practically a religion) and after giving hers a shot and seeing how much it benefited her skin I decided I wanted to go grab my own. There are so so so many products on the market, and the price range was well...impressive. So I was feeling a bit overwhelmed when I ran into this little set in the cvs near my work place. I bought it on impulse, not sure how I&#x27;d like it, considering the price was so much lower than other brushes I&#x27;d seen. Let me tell you, I am SO happy with this purchase. Within the very first use my skin felt truly truly clean, and within the last few days my skin has become baby soft. Needless to say I&#x27;m impressed. Like some of the other reviews, I also agree that the cleanser itself isn&#x27;t all that amazing. Pretty run of the mill. But it does reduce shine, like it says it will, so I appreciate that. I also use the oil cleansing system after I wash my face with this, so that stops my skin from getting overly dry or irritated like I&#x27;ve seen some people mention. Otherwise, I&#x27;d recommend a thick moisturizing face cream after use if you plan on using this daily. Overall, I&#x27;m in love with the product. It&#x27;s small, which I love because I travel a lot and I can take it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Good job Olay, you have yet to let me down, keep it up :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you pay for.  Not a good or useful product. You&#x27;d achieve the same results without the cleansing brush, by just washing your face. The exfoliating brush just vibrates on your face.  The bristles are huge and plastic and don&#x27;t exfoliate or cleanse your skin, just kinda squish about... Save yourself some $$ and forgo this product.</li>
    <li> Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid! Powered Contour Cleansing System 1 Kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this review is only on the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid! Powered Contour Cleansing Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;right out of the box First impression of cleansing brush:  cute, modern, portable, easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small, take/use almost anywhere kind of micro facial cleansing convienance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just twist the bottom and pull -- the brush head separates from the handle revealing a battery holder/cartridge. Insert one AAA battery into cartridge, slide back together and twist again.  Good to go, as they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place small amount of favorite facial cleansing soap on brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two tiny, conveniently located, buttons:  top is on, bottom is off.  There is only one speed.  Brush head vibrates, but does not otherwise spin or move around. Sort of like a sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse T-Zone, hairline, around nose.  No need to press down, as the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid! Powered Contour Cleansing Brush&#x27;s soft rubber tips just seem to effortlessly glide over the designated areas.  I didn&#x27;t find a need to stay on one particular area very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When finished, I just rinse my face with clean water, moisturize -- and continue with whatever routine follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush rinses clean, and stores easily.  That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay just put the Fun back into cleaning the \\&quot;T-Zone\\&quot;!  &#x27;nuf said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid! Powered Contour Cleansing System, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;side note:  I&#x27;ve also reviewed [[ASIN:B009GEUPPG Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! Satin Finish Lotion]], and given it 5 Stars! :)</li>
    <li> Original rating UPGRADED from 1 STAR to 4 STAR based on the OLAY Team&#x27;s DETAILED follow-up and communication. The OLAY Team requested details and responded in kind via Twitter, email and in this forum. Standing behind a product and addressing concerns makes for better customer satisfaction and loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the Contour Cleansing System...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small AAA-battery powered vibrating tool with soft tiny plastic fingered brush shaped to deep clean in the nooks and crannies usually missed with my Olay Pro-X Cleansing System. The triangular shape of the contour brush is better suited for my oily T-zone, hair line, and nose. I use this in addition, NOT a replacement, to my Olay Pro-X Cleansing System. No hassles of getting my hair tangled in the bristles...in a pinch I&#x27;ve used it as THE facial cleansing tool with good results. It&#x27;s safe for use in the shower but don&#x27;t submerge it in water and expect it to function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shine, Shine Go Away cleanser with it&#x27;s deep cleaning action and hints of green apple freshness cleaned well without parching my skin.  I like the option of using other cleansers. This flexibility permits use of cleansers for specific skincare needs. This tool&#x27;s tiny massaging fingers help my serum and moisturizer penetrate deeply and my skin feel wonderfully cleansed and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit does what it says it does effectively. I also like that it&#x27;s a small, easily portable travel facial cleansing tool and something to get the tweens in my extended family to CLEAN their entire faces rather than their current \\&quot;splash and dash\\&quot; acne promoting efforts. Just as the doctors encourage washing the hands for 20 seconds with cleanser and water for effective germ killing, getting the tweens in the habit for BOTH hands and face is important too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another tool to encourage us to focus the time and energy to care for ourselves; something Olay has done for years.&lt;br /&gt;After Olay stumbled, it came back to win me over and treat me as a valued customer. Hooray, Olay...5 STARS for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************************************************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this Fresh Effects Cleansing System I thought the kit had been tampered with because the cleanser and battery were missing. I was very disappointed in Olay, that&#x27;s NOT the way they usually conduct business. I called the 800 number listed on the box and the associate was clueless about the next steps to remedy the situation, which was an even bigger disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happily use my [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]] and wanted this as an add-on. Comparing the level of professionalism that usually accompanies Olay products, the support for the Va-Va-Vivid Cleansing System Kit missed the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****************************************************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/7/2013&lt;br /&gt;* Contacted Olay via 1.800.285.5170 Identified myself as a product reviewer that received an incomplete Cleansing System Kit.

    <li> I bought this at my local Walmart. I was actually not looking to switch up from my usual cleanser, but I love trying new products and I am glad I did. First off, I was a bit concerned at the size of the cleanser. I must say, a little goes a long way. It lathers up really well and leaves my skin refreshed and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Va-Va-Vivid for a week now, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m actually washing my face everyday now or because of the electronic brush, but my skin looks brighter, feels softer, and feels cleaner. I do think that by using this brush, it really does help dig deeper than using your fingers would. The brush is soft, and glides easily. Some face washes leave a residuey feeling after washing, but this really feels like your face is 100% clean. I would recommend this to any one looking for an acne fighter, or just a simple daily wash routine. (*I received this kit for free from Influenster.com but this review is based 100% off of my real opinion)</li>
    <li> While it is not the best out there it is worth the try to get the brush which you can use with any face cleanser. While I like the Olay Get fresh and it makes my face soft, I find that when I use it often, my face seems ashy.  I guess this is to get you to buy the moisturiser.  I love the brush though. Im not sure if it deep cleans, seems as if it just vibrates on my face.</li>
    <li> this product is ok. it was smaller then i thought witch was no big deal but the brisles are ruber and the kinda hurt my face a little but besides that its great! makes my face feel super sparkly clean!</li>
    <li> This is a power packed little wand! From the moment I used this product I was impressed! This got all my makeup that was left on my face from makeup remover. Perfect clean face feeling and I&#x27;m excited for that! Will purchase again and again and even for my friends! LOVE!</li>
    <li> Just got this and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s great travel size and it made my skin GLOW. I will def be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I&#x27;ve been using it every single night and it leaves my face fresh and feeling great!</li>
    <li> awesome product! it works just as good as my clarasonic but so much more affordable. i would deffinstly recommend it</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. I was given a sample of it, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to think. But I have to say, I&#x27;m loving it. My face has never been so smooth. The vibrating brushes are like a mini face massage. My face felt fresh and clean the entire day.</li>
    <li> I like how it vibrates i like the little brush but personally not a big fan of the cleanser. kinda dries my skin out and the color is silver and kinda weirds me out but with a different cleanser i will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> This makes my face look and feel amazing. I used to feel like washing my face was a chore but the tool helps so much and the effect that it has on my skin has made me not miss a day since I got it</li>
    <li> i am sooo in love with the olay fresh effects collection!!.. not only goes it work great.. it feels ur face soft..its smells great..n plus it looks super cool (the product inside comes out silver) this is my new go to cleanser and i will be trying other products from this collection! thank you Influenster for letting me try this product out for free!</li>
    <li> Smells good, leaves my skin soft and reduces oil in just one wash. Helps my face stay and feel fresh all day long</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have issues with feeling oily near the end of the day but since I have started using the Shine Go Away cleanser I haven&#x27;t had that problem! I also love the cleansing tool that comes with it - it makes washing your face fun. Using the tool I find myself being able to use less cleanser as well which is a money saver. I would recommend this to anyone who has slightly oily-oily skin.</li>
    <li> I got this product courtesy of Influenster and am so glad I did! I love using the little brush to wash my face, I feel like I get a more efficient clean. I do think the shine on my face has gone down also so I like the wash as well. I also really like that you can use it in the shower. That&#x27;s a plus for me! 4 stars because I like it and would probably use it again, but not sure I&#x27;m head over heels in love with it.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product through the Sweetheart VoxBox program from Influenster. Since I was sent this complimentary for testing purposes I was more than happy to give it a chance. I had already purchased the Shine, Shine Go Away cleanser that comes with it a few days before and I was very happy with that. Its very refreshing and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel very dry as other cleansers have in the past. What I like about using the cleanser in combination with the brush is that it does give the skin a deeper cleaning. Also, the triangle shape of the brush is perfect for getting around the nose area. The only bad thing I could say is I don&#x27;t like holding the vibrating brush in my hand for too long because my hand starts to feel weird but maybe that&#x27;s just me. Overall I would say its an awesome product at a great price and it does just what you would expect it to.</li>
    <li> I really like the brush that comes with the kit. It has various size rubber bristles and the upside is that it is easy to clean. I was not too keen on the face wash that came with it, so I switched it and it works great. The face wash left my skin feeling a little dry. The brush does a great job of removing makeup and cleaning it is so easy. I also received this product complimentary from Infuenster</li>
    <li> Got this product courtesy of Influenster in their sweetheart voxbox a couple weeks ago and have been using it on a daily basis since.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it leaves my skin after every wash and i love seeing all my makeup come off with it. My skin is very sensitive and im suprised that this product didnt irritate it or leave it dry. Its literally a mini facial every day.&lt;br /&gt;Id definitly recommend this to anyone, and have already purchased a new full size cleanser to continue using it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++++</li>
    <li> I love how the cleanser feels. It leaves my face feeling very smooth. My face does get oily a lot in my T-zone area. And I do notice a difference when I use Va-va-vivid. I have recommended it to my sister who also has oily skin. Glad they came out with this product. I am also using their face lotion which feels like a gel and I use as primer for my makeup!</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster. LEt me just say I love this simple system and how clean it leave my face feeling. I love the triangle head it allows for easy cleaning of nose and hairline. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this system is the buttons are a little temperamental at times.  I would love to try everything else that comes from this line. I simply love it.</li>
    <li> This product will your face feeling great. No left over residue. The brush system is amazing. Easy to clean, the soap smells fresh</li>
    <li> I really like this product, i got it in my influenster voxbx and it has worked wonders, my face is not a oily and shiny as it used to be. The only con is that the buttons are fairly small but other than that its great</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good face cleaner like this that wasn&#x27;t too expensive. This is perfect! So glad that I got to use it complementary from Influenster! Can&#x27;t wait to share it</li>
    <li> i feel so fresh and clean when i use this product! it really works, and better than other face washing brands! its a little harsh at first but i totally love it!</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster for review, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now. I absolutely love it. The shape of the brush makes it really easy to clean the contours of your face, especially around your nose. The cleanser works really well, and makes your face really clean. I have dry skin and was worried that this would dry me out, but it doesn&#x27;t. It also gets rid of the oil on my forehead. I&#x27;m dying to try more of the products from this line!</li>
    <li> I loved this product! I received it through Influenster and was excited to use it. My pores felt invigorated and my face was very clean afterwards. The cleaning brush left my face exfoliated and it helped remove some difficult eye makeup. My favorite part about the product was the smell! It smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but I liked the {Shine, Shine Go Away!} Shine Minimizing Cleanser just because it&#x27;s metallic silver haha, who wouldn&#x27;t!  I dose a good job cleaning my face but I find it drys on my face when I try and use the brush with it.  I&#x27;m just spoiled with my clarisonic I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;I do however like using the brush to message my moisturizer in, it&#x27;s not just a brush it vibrates, the bristles are actually rubber so they don&#x27;t absorb the cream, the head is in a triangle shape making it easy to reach around the eyes, nose ect. it&#x27;s also small enough to not take up loads of room in your travel bag!</li>
    <li> First of i have to say this product changed my life i LOVE IT didnt know i wasnt cleaning my face good enough with my hands!This brush is made of a soft rubber it is not a typical brush. The small rubber triangle brush. I really like the shape as you can get in around your nose and really feel like you got a deep cleaning. I like the very small size of the unit helps you to be very gentle around sensitive areas of the face. It didn&#x27;t come with any more details than what are on the box. A MUST HAVE TO ME!</li>
    <li> I just recently recieved this item and when I went to use it I just about fell out of my chair! The cleanser you put onto the brush is SILVER, not the usual white or clear color you see in most cleansers. As little as this machine is, this thinks WORKS great. Plus its easy to bring with you to travel and very easy to use. I am almost out of the cleanser!</li>
    <li> Olay fresh effects is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin has made a complete turn around. I&#x27;m not breaking out much anymore and my face is so soft</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster. olay fresh effects {va-va-vivid} powered contoured cleaning system: This Little gadget is amazing! I used it last night before I went to bed and this morning. My face is as soft as a babys bottom! It really does deep clean to remove all that crud that builds up on a face.</li>
    <li> Immediately after opening my Influenster Voxbox, I ran to my bathroom to cleanse my face with this new Olay product. The brush is pretty small, which I love, and I feel like it helps any cleanser get really deep into the skin. I first used it with the Olay Shine, Shine Go Away! cleanser, and it made my skin feel SO SMOOTH AND SOFT. I loved it! The next day though I found that I was starting to break out, so I stopped using it. This is my skin&#x27;s personal reaction to the product, so don&#x27;t let that stop you from trying it! It did help my skin reduce shine. I&#x27;ve been using the brush though with another acne cleanser and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> When I first got the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid! Powered Contour Cleansing System I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I had seen similar products before with giant price tags, and I had tried one once that dried out my skin too much. When I first started using it my skin felt so clean and impossibly soft! I absolutely love this product it is gentle on my sensitive skin but it leaves my skin feeling refreshed! absolute must try!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Olay products and it does not stop with their new Fresh Effects line.  I absolutely love the Va-Va-Vivid Powered Contour Cleansing System kit!  Super powerful and great size, perfect for travel.  The triangular shape is great getting the area around your nose.  Affordable and easily available.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A really good product. It did exactly what it said it would do. I had no shine after using this. My skin felt great, and I will continue to use this. The only thing is that the vibration was a little rough, so if you have sensitive skin you should think about it. But overall it is a great match for me!!</li>
    <li> Excited to get this.. but.. opened it up, and wow its so small i thought it was a barbie doll toy.. very disappointed. Ive use it and dont really.do much :(</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new system to clean my face before bed, when I received this complimentary from Influenster. I&#x27;m really impressed with how much it&#x27;s helped to clear up my skin. The rubber bristles are perfect for removing dirt, but not too rough to tear up my skin. It comes with their shine minimizing cleanser, and I was happy with how my skin looked after only a few days of using it. I went out and bought another container, plus a container of their exfoliating cleanser. I&#x27;m very happy with both the price and quality of the product.</li>
    <li> The Olay Fresh effects Va-Va-Vivid cleasing system is wonderful!! Growing up i always had dry skin but in the past few years it&#x27;s gone from dry to very oily!! not knowing how to adapt to this drastic change I tried so many different products. getting to try this one was the answer to my oil problems. The shine shine go away wash was my saving grace. The wash kept my face matte the entire day without drying it out completely. Not only did the contour brush hit my face in all the spots but it did it easily no fumbling or poking myself simple its shape got every nook and cranny. The perfectly shaped brush felt good on my face not too hard and not too soft more like a massage that I look forward to! I am in love with this system. Dont just listen to me ramble try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I love this product it cleans my face and makes it soft best of all it low cost. its better than most high end product too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;d heard so much about this line and it turned out to be worth it! I also this that since there is a cleansing system people who can&#x27;t afford a clarisonic will love this product and a little bit goes a long way</li>
    <li> The contour cleaning system really gets down into the pores and cleans really really well.  I have really oily skin so the shine control cleanser helped a little bit but the brush is really awesome! I still have to use an oil mattifier to keep everything under control but it does help with the shine.  If you&#x27;re prone to acne like me it does upset it some so make sure you are keeping up with your acne control cleanser to with it. I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.  Olay has great products and I can&#x27;t wait to try out more.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample to try out from Influenster.  It leaves your face feeling soft and clean, without irritating it. The brush has rubber bristles, and is small and triangular so it is perfect for getting into corners and smaller areas on your face.</li>
    <li> The Olay Fresh Effects brush is unique in it&#x27;s triangle-shaped head. Like an ultrasonic toothbrush (think Sonicare), this brush vibrates very, very fast when you push the on top circle. It is battery operated, and the battery is included and already installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is angled, so you are never pushing the brush directly into your skin. Instead, the pressure of your hand is distributed throughout the head, resulting in an even cleansing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head has blunt plastic \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; instead of sharp, stiff bristles, like other facial brushes. They are stiffer than a toothbrush, but less stiff than a hairbrush. They have a soft give to them, which I enjoyed. If you want that scratching, abrasion sensation, just use this brush with a scrub cleanser. The white plastic fingers are also easier to keep clean than bristles, which tend to trap or absorb dirt deep within the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two sizes of fingers in the head of the brush. There are smaller ones and then wide ones. The series of wide ones are arranged in two circles within the triangular head. The smaller ones fill in within and without the wider finger circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The triangular shape of the whole head was great for maneuvering the angles of my face, along the sides of my nose, and along my chin especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, I immediately noticed a softness and brightness to my skin. I used it with a Clinique cleanser and was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all the other Vine reviewers, I did not receive the cleanser as part of my package, so I am basing my review on the brush alone.</li>
    <li> I was soo excited to get this. I thought it would be a great addition to my cleansing regimen. Well I was sorely wrong! The bristles on it are rubber, not brush bristles. When you turn it on it vibrates something fierce and when you put it on your face, it is rough and doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly at all. It hurt my face to use it and left my skin red. I don&#x27;t know how Olay even put their name on this product. Did they even test it before putting it on the market?? Such a disappointment!</li>
    <li> I found this hand held face scrubber obnoxious and more vibrating that soothing. I wanted something that made me feel pampered and not all jiggled to pieces.  There was no way to regulate the desired amount of vibration just simply on or off.  I didn&#x27;t receive the cleanser so your guess is as good as mine.  I have used the Olay moisturizers for years until I recently cut back to a cheaper yet still effective product.  I think I&#x27;ll pack it with my first aid kit and use it to scrub grit out of scraped up knees or for other down and dirty cleaning experiences.</li>
    <li> I expected this product to be a much smaller version of the Clarisonic brush I now use, and that it would be good for travel. But this didn&#x27;t seem like a \\&quot;brush\\&quot; to me at all. . .the bristles are a soft plastic material which felt very harsh on my face. Probably won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about receiving this product. I have seen commercials for products that were similar to this one, but a lot more expensive. I was really surprised at how small this was when I opened the package. I thought it was going to be a lot larger, but I actually really like how small it is. The small size makes it easy to hold. The triangle shape of the head makes this an optical tool for getting into the areas around your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint with the product is the nodules that are on the head of the product. I thought that they were going to be bristles like you would see on an electric toothbrush, but instead they are little rubber nodules which I feel are a little too rough on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of this product makes it look like it comes with a bottle of cleansers, but it does not (and it also does not state that this is included anywhere in the product description or on the box).</li>
    <li> I love this product. i received this product complimentary from Influenster in their Sweetheart Voxbox.&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited to try it and i must say that this is my new favorite facial cleanser. i use it twice a day and my face is clearing up and is super soft! i am very pleased with this product and i highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I previously had the other Olay brand face massager/washer and I LOVED it. Then I received a complimentary one via influenster, and its just as good! I use it almost every day..its not too harsh on my extremely sensitive skin. I love how small and compact it is, its definitely something that you can travel with and it wont take up very much space at all. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product blew me away!&lt;br /&gt;The unique shape of the brush deep cleans in hard-to-reach places. Its just the right size and the unique shape gets perfectly into every contour of your face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the ProActiv Brush...and I would choose the Olay one anyday!&lt;br /&gt;I even went out and bought more in this new line by Olay.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy from this line in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely suggest buying this!!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to an expensive Clarisonic. I use this in my T-zone and it works great! You only need a super small amount, and you can use your own cleanser after running out of the Olay one. Love it, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> i love the way this cleansing system makes my skin feel fresh and clean after i use it. i have combination skin and its very sensitive and i can use this product everyday and it doesnt irritate my skin at all. i received the product complimentary from influenster but i assure you this is my own honest opinion on the product. i love it and use it 2 times a day and my skin has never looked more healthy,radiant, and shine free.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product I have been using it for about two weeks now and have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin. I have combination oily skin and this cleansing system has done wonders for me!! The best part is the battery powered brush is safe to use in the shower as well although it can&#x27;t be submerged in water so perfect for those who are busy and on the run in the morning just put a small amount of product on the cleansing brush, wash for a minute then rinse off wala!! Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, it worked great. It is also a great size for traveling which I do a lot so this is a perfect tool that doesn&#x27;t take up to much space in my bag</li>
    <li> I recieved a complementary Va-Va-Vida product sample from Influenster! This product was so simple to use and showed great results. The bristles on the vibrating angle brush help get down into pores and helps remove even the toughest of make-up. The Not so Shine serum let my face feeling clean after a long day of work and the gym. Definitly would recommend these items!</li>
    <li> I got this thru the mail to try for free thru Influenster. I was so excited to try it cuz I had just seen it in Wal-mart for $12.99. When I open the box to finally try it, I was surprised at how small it was. The contour brush could fit in the palm of my hand and the cleanser that came with it was a tad bit taller the brush. I just knew that it wasn&#x27;t going to turn out how I hoped it would. But to my surprise, it did. The brush bristles are like rubber silicone type material and you can use it everyday because it doesn&#x27;t have the harshness of a regular bristle brush. The tri-tip brush makes it easy to get in those har to reach places, unlike the round brush. I am still amazed about that. And its gets all the dirt, sweat, make up, whatever your face faces out of those stubborn cervices. The cleanser I had was Shine, Shine Go Away and gets ready of the oily skin problem that I have. I use it everyday when I wake it and my face feels so soft and refresh after I do it. I feel like my face is untouchable when I start my day. you may thank I&#x27;m dramatic, but I&#x27;m not. I love this stuff. And I know you will too. Be sure to get the cleanser that is right for you.</li>
    <li> I love Olay Fresh Effects and wish I could have the whole line. It is maintaining my acne and my face feels so smooth afterwards. I will purpose more of these products in the future for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster for testing and review.</li>
    <li> i recieved this product via influenster and i love it. It&#x27;s a cheaper alternative to the clarisonic and i actually think this might be a little bit better than paying $100+ for a vibration face tool. I love this and I&#x27;m glad i received it. definatly check it out people! :)</li>
    <li> Received this kit in an Influenster VoxBox and was pleasantly surprised at how awesome the product works. I&#x27;ve never used a system like this before and really like the deep clean feeling you get. My face does normally get shiny throughout the day and this cleansing system seems to actually work at controlling it. And it smells great too!</li>
    <li> This stuff seriously makes the shine go away.. i dont know about preventing the pimples ever since i started using it ive had deep painful pimples could be just me idk i still use the product</li>
    <li> I think this is an amazing product. It leaves your face feeling soft and clean. I also like the way it smells. I think va-va-vivid did a great job and is an amazing company. I would love to keep trying more of their products. This is the best facial cleaner I&#x27;ve tried yet! I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> Fresh Effects is a great product! The cleaning tool cleanses excellently, and can reach the hard to get places (t zone). The facial cleanser is gentle and smells SO GOOD! I have always used moisturizer after cleaning my face due to my face drying out. It&#x27;s NOT the case with this stuff! I can go without moisturizer because It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dried ou!</li>
    <li> I love the brush that comes in the kit it is amazing it has definitely helped me keep my skin clear. I use the wash on certain spots that get oily and it helps too. I use the brush with cetaphil and my skin is amazing. Im so glad i was able to use this product. i would definitely recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for something new to help with my combination skin. I recently got this Olay fresh effects and am so so so in love with it. The little cleanser is super powerful but is soft enough to not hurt your skin. The cleanser is mild, does not make me break out and leaves my skin feeling so soft! I usually use it at night and when I wake up in the morning my skin is still so soft! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product.  i use this almost ALL the time. it defenetily has improved my skin 100 percent! and i will so happy and willing to try more OLAY products. i also want to disclose that i received the Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid Powered Contour Cleansing System. I have tried several different face cleaners and this one by far is my favorite. It leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshing! I cant wait to try other products from the collection.&lt;br /&gt;I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster!</li>
    <li> i am an esthetician so i am used to using high line products. this product is good but not for my skin type. it dried it out but I moisturize everyday so its an easy fix. it clears my blackheads on my nose very well. the brush isnt very nice on the face but you cant be too picky with the price. I did receive this as a complementary gift from Influenster.</li>
    <li> While my face has never been exactly \\&quot;shiny\\&quot;, I LOVE this cleansing system.  The powered cleansing brush was immensely helpful when removing haunt makeup, while still being gentle on my face.  in the past, to get any airbrushed makeup off my face, I would have to scrub my face raw.  This kit allowed me to get the majority of the makeup off, so I pretty much just wiped the remainder off my face.  And I love the way my face feels after using it!</li>
    <li> This product leaves your face feeling so smooth! I love it! It gets rid of all of the unnecessary shine. The vibrating scrubber makes your face feel so good! You can really feel the difference compared to just regular washing. I totally recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I works really well. The vibrating power brush cleans deep into skin and gets in to the hard to reach places.  My skin feels so fresh!&lt;br /&gt;I want to try out the rest of the line! (the bb cream, the moisturizer, and the exfoliating scrub!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster to test out. This is my honest view of the product.</li>
    <li> I have a Clarisonic and the first question I had was this a nice cheaper alternative. I&#x27;ve been testing this for a couple of weeks now and the answer is most definitely no. But it&#x27;s still pretty nice in it&#x27;s own right. My skin did feel cleaner than when I just use my hands, but it&#x27;s also much more exfoliating than if you use your hands. The small size was nice for really cleaning smaller areas, like around my nose and it is great for traveling. My only big complaint with this is that the rubber/silicone bristles are just too harsh for every day use. I have pretty sensitive skin but this was actually kind of painful to use. The cleanser was basic, nothing special. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d repurchase either, as I&#x27;ve used much better (granted, more expensive) alternatives but I&#x27;d say check it out if you are on a budget.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! My face after cleaning feels amazing and so soft and clean. I really love that the bristles are rubber and soft it really makes you feel like its doing the job and cleaning away your make-up. My  husband ever tried it and thought it was awesome as well. Definitely give it a try!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I LOVE this system! It works great for my skin and rinses clean. It make my face feel clean with no dryness. I use this daily now.</li>
    <li> This tool makes washing my face more fun. It gets those tiny nooks for a full clean effect! I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between using this and using my hands but its neat! I recieved Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is totally worth it just for the battery-operated vibrating cleansing brush.  The triangular brush truly exfoliates my skin getting all the rough hard to reach places.  It really clears out my pores and leaves my skin extremely smooth.  For such a low price the brush really does work!! I also love how small and compact it is. It is great for traveling and storing.  The shine shine go away cleanser is supposed to eliminate excess oil and shine on my face.  I have combination face and a pretty oily T zone throughout the day.  The cleanser felt really fresh and great right after using it.. not tight and uncomfortable at all.  But about six hours into my day I was a little oily still.  The cleanser was alright and I would continue using it, but was not amazing by any means.  It is effective and alright.  For about $14 I would say this system is a pretty good buy.  I would like to try other products in this line and would repurchase this product.  I was given this product to test and review by Influenster.</li>
    <li> The cleasing brush works great and does make me feel like I&#x27;m getting a good deep clean when I wash my face. The face wash on the other hand doesn&#x27;t quite work with my combination skin. It leaves a sort of residue feeling on my face that makes if still feel oily on my t zone but it dries out my temple area and cheeks :(</li>
    <li> I was really excited about receiving this product. I have seen commercials for products that were similar to this one, but a lot more expensive. I was really surprised at how small this was when I opened the package. I thought it was going to be a lot larger, but I actually really like how small it is. The small size makes it easy to hold. Thank you influenster for letting me experince this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Oil of Olay Fresh Effects Cleaning System! I feel so refreshed once I clean my face. The system is able to clean much better than I ever could manually.</li>
    <li> I have always just used the acne pads when I need to wash my face, but the Olay Fresh Effects have turned me into an all out face washer- every other day! The cleanser works great, and you just need a tiny bit so the bottle lasts for a really long time. I love the brush, it has a triangle shape which makes it really helpful for getting into the small lines of your face. I have a dry face, but this cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry it out further so I will be using Olay Fresh Effects for a long time! I received Olay Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster to review the product!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. the way the brush is gets deep into your pores, not over them pushing dirt back in. It actually gets dirt out! Seems impossible? Try it. You won&#x27;t regret it when your face stops breaking out. If there&#x27;s not dirt, theres no breakouts. You won&#x27;t regret it!I recieved Olay Fresh Effects from Influenster as a brand tester. A+</li>
    <li> The powered contour cleansing brush truly makes my skin feel cleaner than it ever has. I have enjoyed using this product both in the morning and the evening. The cleanser that comes with the system is also great, and I will be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this, but I&#x27;m really impressed. The triangle-shaped head gets into all the contours of my face. I like that it&#x27;s made of rubber and isn&#x27;t a brush- it exfoliates without feeling harsh. I love the cleanser, too! It makes my skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> The brush head has rubber bristles. Vibrations move bristles scratching against skin. Claims to leave skin \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; and \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot; or something like that. Doesn&#x27;t work at all! Terrible product, don&#x27;t recommend wasting money or time. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Not a morning I wake up so crash and so clean!!! I  received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> This awesome little cleansing system is fantastic! I&#x27;ve been wanting to get something similar for a while now, but with the crazy price tag attached to most of them, there was no way that I could afford it! So when I received this system complimentary from Influenster I was stoked to test it out! Needless to say I have not been disappointed. One other review that I just read bashed this system because it doesn&#x27;t lather up the cleanser when you put it on the brush; I found this to be true, but there is a simple solution to this. I find it to be much easier to lather up the face wash with your hands, and then use the brush to scrub the wash around your face. You&#x27;d be surprised at how well those little rubber bristles clean your face! I used it just the other night and was shocked at all the dead skin cells I saw on the bristles! After using the system (which can be used with any face wash of your choosing)your skin feels incredibly smooth and clean, like you just had a facial. I really need to start using this system more often to see if I can achieve improvement in my acne, like other reviewers have seen!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from Influenster and loved using it. The product is cleansing, gentle, and absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin. Leaves you with a fresh glow...</li>
    <li> This product makes me skin super soft and it mademy face feel like it was actually clean. I will definitly re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Influenster.com, I received this in one of their coveted \\&quot;VoxBoxes\\&quot; to sample. I was a bit skeptical at first, as my skin is unusually sensitive. When cleaning my face, I used a bar of soap and that is it. Thankfully, my skin does fine without a smorgasbord of products. However, I was excited when it came with a contouring tool, so I had to give it a shot. Ladies, I&#x27;m telling you, I did not regret it one bit. It was like a mini-massage for my face. The scent is not overbearing and the cleanser is not thick. It is a lightweight product for your face that will not overwhelm your skin. After washing to product off, my face felt so soft and refreshed. I have been using the product for several weeks now, every other night, and I have not had any issues with breaking out or dryness of the skin. Give this product a shot if you are not especially fond of slathering a bunch of different products on your face. This tool and cleanser does the job of many!</li>
    <li> Received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster. I found it helpful as a exfoliator that doesn&#x27;t scratch up my face. Left my face smooth and made my (minimal) make up easy to apply. Downside: the battery doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I Thought this product was ify I liked the smell and how clean my face was afterwords but it got bright red and hurt from the vibration and the tool. It did help with my acne!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and I like it. It makes my face feel good. I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Pros: Great vibrating power, triangle brush to clean the nose, small and portable, takes one AAA battery, inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not rechargeable, only lasts about a month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about Olay Fresh Effects since a few other people have been curious. Fresh Effects is actually a whole line, but I am most interested in their cleansing system. It comes with a vibrating wand, akin to the Olay Pro X system and the Clarisonic. However, there are a few differences that you should pay attention to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay Pro X has a soft bristle brush head that spins and uses two double A batteries. It only comes in one model and in my experience the spinning brush head is kind of scary and makes it unusable for more than a few days a week. It&#x27;s about $25 for the device and the heads do have to replace. However, since it&#x27;s not as popular as the Clarisonic you can&#x27;t just waltz into a Sephora and get replacements for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarisonic is my holy grail. A lot of people swear by this. Like the Pro X system it will clean your skin more throughly than using your hands. However, it&#x27;s a bit on the pricy range, about $80-120 dollars depending on if you get it on sale. There are several models that you can get, but I currently on the Mia. This device is rechargeable (from any country without a converter), waterproof, and the bristle brush does not spin. The whole device vibrates for a timed one minute. The brush is a lot softer than those offered by the Pro X system. The power on the vibrations is fairly decent. The downside is that replacement heads cost about $20 and you have to replace them every three months with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid cleansing system. It is a lot smaller than the Clarisonic and therefore it is a lot more portable. It&#x27;s also more affordable, a cleansing system costs about $12. From my experience a wand should last you about a month if you clean it well. However, the brush head is made of a soft plastic and not a bristle. It&#x27;s triangular shaped, which gets into your nose area well, but it might take a bit more work to cover your whole face.The head does not rotate, but it does vibrate. For it&#x27;s size it packs quite a powerful punch. It suds up my face wash very well. I&#x27;ve been using it with the Shine-Go-Away that came with the set and I&#x27;m loving it. It takes one AAA battery and I don&#x27;t suggest using this device regularly in the shower since I&#x27;m not sure how waterproof it is. The best part about this whole thing is that it is very portable. I used to hate carrying my Clarisonic with me on short trips since it&#x27;s bulky and semi-heavy. However, this wand is super light and super small. It&#x27;s effective! This makes it great for away trips. I just toss it into my makeup bag and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
    <li> love how clean it makes me feel. and skin isnt so dried out. one of the best brands ive used so far</li>
    <li> I really Like this product I tried it out thanks to influenster and  I really like the cleansing tool. Not a big fan of the cleansing liquid that came with it. I didnt remove or keep off the oil from my face. But I like to use the tool to remove the extra makeup of my face at the end of the night.</li>
    <li> I am very methodical with my skincare routine and I&#x27;m a creature of habit. But, when I received the Olay Fresh Effects powered contour cleansing system from Influsenter I decided to give it a try. The brush is mini and the thing essentially just vibrates but it is amazing. After the first time using it your skin feels so fresh and new. It is truly feels like you have new skin. My fiance who has really dry skin used it and is hooked. I had to buy myself a new one just because he was using it more than me. I highly recommend this product to be added to any skin care routine.</li>
    <li> omg i love this product so much it makes my skin so soft i have not stopped using it its the most amazing product i have ever used my face always feels so soft after i use it</li>
    <li> I received this for free thanks to influenster. I was so exctied to see this in my mail that i couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I LOVE the contour brush, it&#x27;s small but packs a punch, my skin felt so clean. unfortunately the cleanser over dried my skin (I have normal type skin) so I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating as a whole. If i&#x27;m just rating the brush then it&#x27;s a definite 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This has become an everyday essential ever since I was introduced to it. It is very affordable and it works great. My face feels clean and fresh. I can really see the difference between my old cleanser and this. It really does remove your make up more than any other product I have used in the past. I ran out of the cleanser and ran to get another one.I received the product courtesy of Influenster.</li>
    <li> As soon as I saw this product I recognized the Oral B Hummingbird I bought over a decade ago. They did make a nice change to the product: a dedicated off button, so rather than continuously holding the single button in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position like needed for the Hummingbird, you can simply turn it on and then off.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so as a face brush, this thing sucks. The bristles are exactly the same as what you find on those pet hair lifting brushes such as The FURemover sold at BB&amp;B. They are much too thick and don&#x27;t move enough to actually *do* anything useful to your skin. They do not help to create a lather, nor do they actually exfoliate anything, as evidenced by the user who experimented with makeup on her hands/arms. The head is actually a good size to use on the temples and alongside the nose, but since it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;true\\&quot; brush, it still fails. If only Clarisonic would take a hint on size from this model. So yeah, failing grade for washing faces with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;BUT...&lt;br /&gt;As with the Hummingbird, when I realized it was a major let-down in its designated role I quickly decided since it vibrates, it&#x27;s pretty obvious (at least to me... Oh please, like I&#x27;m the only person who sizes up the pleasure potential of any vibrating object) what it would be better used for. Just pop that stupid brush head off, and you&#x27;re left with something of a hollow nub as your contact point. It&#x27;s probably best applied over a layer of underwear.... This thing is *insanely* powerful for running on a single AAA battery! I love it. I actually think this performs better than the classic Pocket Rocket style toys I have always used as my go-to vibe. I am actually going to buy a few of these as backup. The Hummingbird goes for crazy money on ye-olde-auction-site, I can just see the same thing happening to this within a year or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the face wash it comes with is very pleasantly-scented (I really love it) and actually makes my sensitive-flaky-yet-also-oily skin feel good when I&#x27;m done rinsing. I just don&#x27;t bother using the brush with the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face brush: F-&lt;br /&gt;Sex toy: A+</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use the cleanser, but i love the brush and the fact that I can use it with my other cleansers. It really does deep clean your face like no other.</li>
    <li> I saw the TV commercial for Olay Fresh Effects &amp; I just thought had to try it.  When I finally got it in the mail though, it was huge disappointment.  A little bitty .68 oz tube of cleanser &amp; an even smaller \\&quot;power brush\\&quot;(I agree with a previous reviewing that it is the revamping of the Oral-B hummingbird flosser).  Although the cleanser works just fine, but I wish there was a little more, the power brush is not exactly what it says.  It is not a brush, but a grouping of rubber tips, more like a massager.  It never really works the cleanser up into a later, but it does feel pretty nice.  I was expecting more of an exfoilating wand, which it is not.  Had I known the size &amp; actual performance before purchasing it, I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it &amp; I wish I had went to take a look at it in the store before purchasing.  Lesson learned on buying something off of a TV commercial!</li>
    <li> Broke first time I used it. I generally love olay products, but this was a waste.  Very diappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order the product from here, but I picked mine up at Target for around $12.&lt;br /&gt;I had read all the reviews on here before I went out and purchased it, and so many had said such good things about it that I decided I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Well, now it&#x27;s my turn.&lt;br /&gt;I love this system. The \\&quot;Shine Shine Go Away\\&quot; cleanser it comes with is ok, I like it just fine, although I don&#x27;t use it on its own so I don&#x27;t know how well it would work by itself. It comes in a pretty small little tube, but a little bit goes a long way.  It smells nice; clean and fresh. Lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;I use it first to strip the oil and dirt from my face before I go onto using my normal cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty oily skin in my t-zone area, and larger than I would like pores on either side of my nose and underneath my eyes. I will say that since I&#x27;ve been using this (going on about 2 weeks now) my pores have shrunk considerably, and I&#x27;m VERY happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;The powered brush is pretty small, perfect for traveling. It takes 1 AAA battery, but the kit comes with one for you, which was nice. The bristles are rubber, but they do an excellent job at getting down into the pores and getting rid of all the dirt and makeup that your remover doesn&#x27;t get off. I don&#x27;t mind that the bristles are rubber since that seems to make it easier to keep clean, and I don&#x27;t need to run out and get a replacement head like some of the other brushes require. The vibration from the brush isn&#x27;t too intense, but it feels nice on the face, it&#x27;s not at all irritating. At least not to me.&lt;br /&gt;I use mine every morning as well as every night, but if you have sensitive skin, I might use it every other day or night because I can see where this may end up causing some irritation. I don&#x27;t have major breakouts, but I do feel like this little system has helped keep those breakouts that I DO have to a minimum. My face feels smooth and clean everytime I use it, like I&#x27;ve had a mini facial.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase the cleanser it came with again when I run out, but I&#x27;ll definetly continue to use the brush with other cleansers I use normally.&lt;br /&gt;So, so happy I gave this a shot.</li>
    <li> So here I was thinking this would be such a great alternative to proactive and that it would help me clean my face back up with a nice powering cleanse. However, it was far from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st: I got the box and it was so tiny, did not realize that the brush would be so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd: The brush is terrible! It is not a soft bristle brush like I expected, and it does not clean anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd: The formula is not cleansing at all. Once I use it, it does not foam up and my face does not feel clean. I understand that I have oily skin but this is an oil free item that feels like it actually has oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just not impressed. I think its time for me to switch from Olay products once and for all. I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought the Olay Va-Va-Vivid cleansing system and I was very disappointed. I was shocked at how small the brush was at first glance, but tried it regardless. The brush itself is useless, the rubberized texture didn&#x27;t do anything but bend when it met with my face and didn&#x27;t lather the cleanser as well as I had hoped.  Even after I was done using it, I still had blackehads and felt as though my face was dirty.  I would not recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the Olay cream cleanser, and their products as a whole, but I was seriously disappointed with my $10+ purchase.  When I got the box, I thought that it was about the same size as the other cleansing systems that are available now.  This smaller than palm sized cleansing brush was ridiculous! The bristles were made of rubber/plastic, and was for me hash on my face. I&#x27;m not sure if it was a reaction due to my latex allergy (rubber falls into that category), or what, but I would buy the cream, just not the cleasing brush.  Hard lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I like this product but they are a lot smaller that I thought they would be. However, the triangle shaped nozzle was very good for getting around my nose and in corners.</li>
    <li> To give an accurate review for the vibrating brush I am using my own cleanser that I know causes no irritation to my skin. This brush is made of a soft rubber it is not a typical brush. The small rubber triangle brush vibrates so fast you can feel it but not really see it moving. I really like the shape as you can get in around your nose and really feel like you got a deep cleaning. I like the very small size of the unit helps you to be very gentle around sensitive areas of the face. It didn&#x27;t come with any more details than what are on the box. My big caution to you would be you really don&#x27;t need to apply any pressure to the face with this brush or it could feel irritating. When I was done with the 60 second clean and then rinsed my face felt very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the Olay Pro series spinning brush and the two together make a good set. It was nice that the battery is already installed in the unit so it is out of the box ready to go. I like the product and will make it a part of my daily facial cleaning.</li>
    <li> I was so hoping to try this out, as I LOVE my Olay Pro X...but this wasn&#x27;t what I got, lol.  I got a moisturizer instead, which is a lightweight, perfect for day use moisturizer.  I love Olay products!  I really can&#x27;t wait to get a chance to try this one out!</li>
    <li> When I received this and opened the box for the first time, my impression was \\&quot;Is this it?\\&quot;  The brush is quite small at about half the length of a toothbrush with the triangular brush head being not much bigger than a quarter.  The brushes aren&#x27;t bristles but more like tiny rubbery spines about 1/4\\&quot; long.  The vibration is minimal and there is only one speed.  To say the least, I was underwhelmed.  But, I had agreed to review the product so I gave it a try.  At first, the vibration is more like just a tickle and it really doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is happening but as you move it over your face in circles, you really do start feeling a tingling. I used my regular cleanser with this since my sample did not come with a cleanser.  After rinsing, my face looked clean and my skin looked really good, almost glowing.  I&#x27;ve continued to use this once or twice a day for the past couple of weeks and I really like it.  The shape of the brush does make it easy to really get to every angle of your face, especially around your nose and eyes.  I guess the vibration causes a massaging effect from the bristles which brings more circulation to your skin because my face always looks so fresh and alive after I wash with it.  It may not look like much but this Va-Va-Vivid is my new favorite skin care item.</li>
    <li> This little scrubber brush didn&#x27;t do any damage to my skin. It also didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in how clean my face was after use. The bendy bristles and vibration were supposed to clean my T-Zone better, making the skin cleaner and more vibrant. Looked the same as always to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually with facial gadgets like this one, the box would contain a sample size cleanser to show the power of the entire system working together. Olay chose not to include this and I find that disappointing. Not completely wowed by the brush, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m driven to go out and purchase their specialty cleanser just to find it as unexciting as this. They did include the required battery though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good cleanser massaged into the face with firm fingertips does the job just as well, if not better.</li>
    <li> I tried this free from Influenster and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I use this everyday and it really works. It helps to exfoliate your skin and provides a really deep clean. Try it out for yourself! I&#x27;m going to be trying the rest of the products in the line ASAP.</li>
    <li> I received my Olay Fresh Effects {Va-Va-Vivid!} Powered Contour Cleansing System for free from Influenster for reviewing purposes and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! For starters, the Shine Minimizing Cleanser smells great! I love how the unique triangular design of the scrubbing brush makes it easy for me to get that deep clean in hard to reach places without getting any soap in your eyes. We can&#x27;t forget about the vibrating brush that helps bring out the softness in your face. I have never felt my face feel so smooth and soft! I promise you will NOT be disappointed!! This product is wonderful and I can&#x27;t wait to try out some more of Olay&#x27;s awesome products!! Maybe even some [[ASIN:B009GEUOZ2 Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream! Skin Perfecting Tinted Moisturizer With Sunscreen -Light To Medium 2.5 Fl Oz]]</li>
    <li> I received this duo combo from Influenster and I love it. For the price compared to other powered cleansers this is great. I like how it is triangular shaped instead of circular because I do feel that it helps to clean in those spaces that aren&#x27;t obvious like your hairline, nose area, T-zone, and where ever else makeup, dirt, and oils hide. I would love to try some of their other products like the S&#x27;wipes or Exfoliating Cleanser from Olay.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product that i received complimentary from Influenster.  Made my face really soft and feel clean. I definetely want to try out other products from Olay Fresh Effects.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using the product, its very refreshing and the vibrating brushes feels like it is getting deeper into my pores to clean and leave feeling fresh. This is also helping to reduce the size of my pores and I can see that after a week of using, The only downside is that it takes a little longer to use than just normal face wash that you rub on your face. But I highly recommend this product! And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and this works amazing on my skin. It leaves a soft powdered Irish finish that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product.  I received Olay Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster and will definitely be buying more.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week and I love the way my face feels after using it. This product has helped reduce the oiliness of my skin and has made it feel smoother.</li>
    <li> This product had a creamy, rich lather that smells great and has kept my skin fresh and clean! The powered brush is the best part because the triangle shape perfectly contours to your face! I also really enjoy that it can be used in the shower so it is not an extra step in my daily routine!  [...]</li>
    <li> Feels great and smells amazing! It really cleans all of the dirt away! Love love love love love it!! Great product.</li>
    <li> Made my skin really smooth!  I definitely felt the brush cleaning deep! I really love it! Definitely worth buying this product!</li>
    <li> I was lucky to receive this product free of charge from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;Oh am I so glad to have tried this out. I loved it! I got it and used right away since I was going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I woke up the next morning and was surprised to see my skin and how it wasn&#x27;t oily. Shine is definitely away!&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and doesn&#x27;t have that soapy smell, yet a really nice fresh fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the idol but great cleansing brush. It has rubber and it is very small. A nice design and love the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line it is amazing, get it!  I will definitely be purchasing the bigger Shine Shine version once my this once runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid kit  complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing face product if you are looking for something that isn&#x27;t over priced and will be effective. It removes shine and leaves your face feeling extremely smooth. My face has never been as smooth as after I used this the first time. The triangle shape of the brush also helps you get into areas that you can&#x27;t always get to as well and can be used with your other face products. I am extremely satisfied with the product and have noticed a reduction in the blemish on my face, some of which I was struggle with for many years, like small blackheads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
    <li> I really love this! It makes your skin feel super soft and amazing! I&#x27;ve never used a clarisonic but I&#x27;m sure this would be an affordable dupe. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> im so impressed with this little work of art! it left my face looking so white!! and thats a good thing because it means it got rid of all the dirt, it being so little is very convenient also! for the price, its deffinately the best automatic cleanser out there. i recieved this in my influenster box and it is by far my FAVORITE item ive ever received from influenster voxboxes!&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER- I received this complimentary from Influenster. these are my HONEST OPINIONS-Marilynn Aguilar</li>
    <li> This cleansing system is so awesome. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two weeks now and in that time it has cleared up my skin completely!! I love the cleanser because it cleans but doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry. The cleansing brush is perfect its so cute and the bristles really get down into your pores and gets your face really clean. The best thing about it is you can use the brush with other face washes also.</li>
    <li> this produnctkeeps my face fresh 24/7 plus after removing my make up with wipes I noticed that I still had make uo onmy face when I used this. it reakky cleans your face.</li>
    <li> I got this item for free from Influenster to try out, and I have to say, i&#x27;m so glad I received it. The face wash smells amazing! It&#x27;s intended to reduce shine and obviously clean your face, so if you&#x27;re looking for something to help with acne, I wouldn&#x27;t try the face wash. The little vibrating brush is gentle yet efficient. I definitely feel the difference when I&#x27;m exfoliating with that brush. I definitely recommend it. I use it the vibrating brush with an acne fighting face wash such as the Clean and Clear Deep Pore Cleansing face wash or my St.Ives Apricot Scrub for an extreme exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! The brush is amazing and easy to use! It also helps get deep into pores!</li>
    <li> While I was lucky enough to get this product completely free through the Sweetheart Vox Box from Influenster many weren&#x27;t. Never fear though, this is a great product and it is at a fantastic price point for all that it does for the user. I have quite large pores and am always looking for something to keep my combination skin at bay. This does the trick. I love the fact that it is under $15 for this product and it does just as well as the $100 competitor (at least in my book) I can&#x27;t afford a Clairsonic and other competitor products but those looking for something along those lines but they don&#x27;t have a large budget should count their lucky stars and say thanks to Olay for coming up with a great system that is called The Olay Fresh Effects VA-VA-VIVID!</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was strange to wash your face with an almost silver colored cleaner, but I got over it. Thought... hmm another crappy battery powered gimmick. Nope! This thing alone cleared my acne. Doesn&#x27;t say anywhere that the brush exfoliates but it really does! It may be too harsh for your skin unless you do this gently if you have sensitive skin. I really needed all that cleansing and scrubbing. The scent is fresh but can be strong for some people. Really worth a try. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, oh well, at least you tried.</li>
    <li> It comes with a Shine Shine Go Away face cleanser and a Powered Contour Cleaning System.  I used this product for 5 days in the shower, which was impressive that the Powered Contour Cleaning System was able to go in the shower.  It takes one AA battery and the vibration of the brush is great, its not too strong but it definitely is enough to work! It dried my skin out, but i think that was the point, because it was to prevent shine during the day.  But since it is still cold outside i had to moisturizer after it because my skin was so dry.  I think that if you have oily skin this would be the perfect product for you! i have dry skin when its cold, to combination skin, so it wasn&#x27;t right for me in the winter. I will probably go back to using it again in the middle of the summer when i need more shine control!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i thought this was a good product, it clearly does what it is supposed to do. I will re-purchase it in the middle of the summer to use and help with shine control when its hot outside and i don&#x27;t need as much moisture!</li>
    <li> I am not particularly a fan of this product.  Although I enjoy how easy it makes the process of deep cleansing, it resembled other olay cleansing products I have used.  It didn&#x27;t necessarily leave my face feeling dry and tight, but it did not leave my face feeling moisturized.  I still had to apply moisturizer to feel soothed.  It also left my skin feeling like there was a film of some kind on it.  When I would get the soap on my lips, they would stick together after I got out of the shower.  However, this product used in conjunction with a moisturizer as well as a different cleanser for every day use may be just what my skin needs.  I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from Influenster.com to try out. And I am loving this product! I use it in the shower every morning. The brush does a great job at getting into the corners of my nose and the bristles are soft and gentle on my skin. I used it before going to the gym and afterwards my skin was still looking great! I have seen a reduction in the size of my pores and a lot less oil in general. I will be repurchasing this product for sure!</li>
    <li> I really liked this kit but my Clarisonic still reigns supreme. The cleanser however is out of this world &amp; I plan to purchase it in a full size!</li>
    <li> I love using this machine. It&#x27;s great for really getting your face clean. The bristles are soft and gentle, yet powerful enough to get the job done. The vibrations massage your face to help you feel refreshed. My only complaint is that the face wash provided felt like it dried out my skin. Luckily though, you can apply the face wash that you are most comfortable with instead of having to buy replacement pads.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleansing system, I use it in conjunction with my regular face wash, and I love the way the it smells. I really like the way the cleansing tool makes my face feel after the wash. It is more gentle on my skin then a normal bristled brush (being that the bristles on this tool are rubber). The shape of the tool does really make cleansing easier.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I could tell a HUGE difference in the softness of my skin! The brush is small enough to get all the corners of my face and the vibrations are perfects for loosening all the dirt up. The triangular shape makes it really easy to get right up near my hairline and on/under my nose. My face just feels clean after I use it. Definitely would recommend this product to anyone who has a hard time cleaning their face thoroughly</li>
    <li> So, I don&#x27;t have bad acne, but since I&#x27;ve been using this I DON&#x27;T AT ALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It comes with a small tube, and a face masssage thing that you just put a little dab of the stuff on and did I mention IT VIBRATES!? Yeah so while some people wash with a cloth, or their hands, I&#x27;ll be over here getting a free massage and looking awesome! It only takes a small amount on the brush, and the rubber bristles are very soft. My whole face is clean within minutes  It gets rid of that nasty oil we sometimes get from day to day interactions. (It&#x27;s normal :P) In any case, I personally like to use it in the shower. It&#x27;s waterproof, but just don&#x27;t submerge it completely. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> When I first received it free from Influenster,I was a bit upset at how small it was. I did not think that it would get anywhere close to cleaning my skin. The bristles were rubber and not like an actual brush. The vibrations were a little weird just because I did not see how that would help at all, seeing as on the box it tells you to do circle motions when applying it to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the good side, I have some oily skin and this product made me face look so much healthier. I loved how I did not have to worry about my face looking so oily. I also like how a little dab goes a long way. Also the small brush makes it easier to hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as acne, I haven&#x27;t seen a change. Just minimized the shin from oil.</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster and I really enjoyed using the product. Olay Fresh Effect Va-Va-Vivid leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I love the cleanser, even with out the brush, but the brush just takes it out of this world. It is a great shape (even good at getting all around your nose!) and it is a very gentle but EFFECTIVE clean! It is great for oily or acne prone skin! Just take a chance and try it, I really think that you will also fall in love with the product! (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. I got my in my Influenster VoxBox. It worked great. I have very sensitive skin and I break out easily when I switch products. However I did get very red right after using the product but i quickly faded and i was shine free all day!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.It really works &amp; for the price its awesome!!I say give this product a try!!You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry area and this cleansing system not only rid my skin of all the dirt but actually puts moisture back! My skin has never felt more smooth and soft and it amazes me how this set really works! I didn&#x27;t expect much when I first received this from Influenster but boy was I wrong! Can&#x27;t wait to try out more products from Olay!</li>
    <li> Got this product complementary from influenster and I want to try other products considering this is better than what I used before!</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t anything not to like about this product! I love the scent, I love the way it makes my face feel, I even love the color of the cleaning stuff (it looks like a metallica purple!) My face feels so soft after using this and it really cleans my usually oily face. I will be using this a lot in the future.</li>
    <li> This cleansing system is great. Love the vibrating tool. Feels like it gets deeper into my skin like it should. The pore minimizing cream is just the right texture. Since I have used this product my skin feels fresher and more hydrated. I absolutely love this. I recommend everyone try it. :)</li>
    <li> I really did not expect to like this product! But I liked how smooth my face felt afterwards. I also like how small the device is and the cleaner does not stink like some!</li>
    <li> I have always debated on whether or not to get the clarisonic and although I have never tried it i would not spend the money on it when I have this product and it works great! I received mine in my influenster voxbox and have been in love with it ever since! I would strongly suggest this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but I guess it will be good to take on trips.  Other than that, it&#x27;s not a bad brush.  I have the Pro X, and I really like it.  Had I known about the size I would have bought another Pro X brush</li>
    <li> Was expecting more after reading the hype about this.  I liked the product in general but its not something i would repurchase.  the little electric vibrating brush is cool but i find it quite hard on my skin and the amount of product in the tube is less that i imagined.</li>
    <li> Okay you can tell a huge difference from using tour hand and using the brush. This gave me a way deeper clean and the Shine Shine Go Away cleanser left my face feeling soooo soft and hydrated I didnt even want to put mosturizer on because thats how good it felt. The only con is if you use a cleanser with beads in it, it really wont come out the brush, it&#x27;ll get stuck in there</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I opened the box in search of the cleanser and found none.  I used another Olay cleanser that I love for my skin.  If I put it on the scrubber first, it would get lost up in the bristles.  It was best to apply to my skin first, but then after rubbing the cleanser around on my face to distribute it, I&#x27;d pretty much washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles do a very mild vibrating massage that feels pleasant and I&#x27;d guess that like any type of massage, there&#x27;s some health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I could try the cleanser that&#x27;s shown on the box, I&#x27;d think more highly of the device.&lt;br /&gt; I have to be honest and say that I&#x27;m not all that impressed.</li>
    <li> Like others I was under the impression that this came with a cleansing product as well as the tool.  That was a little disappointing but I really enjoyed using the tool.  The triangle shape really allows you to get into every nook and carry of your face.  The brush is very soft and gentle.  It came with a battery so that was a plus!  I love when products are ready to use right out of the box.  This tool feels like you are giving your self a min facial with each use.  Perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I have had several facials in the past.  The gal who does them has told me that aside from feeling good, the massage of a facial helps to break up old tissue and encourage new tissue to move forward, giving the face a firmer more youthful look.  It helps to plump up your skin.  So while this little facial cleaning brush is not the top of the line it does help you to remember to get those cells rejuvinating.  The little plastic bristles don&#x27;t seem to trap dirt like some of the other softer bristle face brushes I&#x27;ve seen.  I was disappointed that there was no cleaner in the box, I was pretty sure that the box stated one brush, battery, cleanser.  overall for the price this can help you to keep those cells moving and alert, making you look more alert.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for the power of a clarisonic or the other expensive brushes, you won&#x27;t find it here. But don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying this, it&#x27;s a fantastic brush! The cleanser foams nicely and the brush moves smooth on my face and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. And the fact that it&#x27;s small is great for getting your whole face and neck. I got it during a great amazon sale and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This brush is an absolute WONDER!!! for several reasons:  (please note that I have not bought this from this seller but a retail store)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It delivers a pulse that is better than any clarisonic that I have used, and is amazing for daily facial massage, especially gentle non-abrasive cleansing, as my skin can only handle my clarisonic every 3 days at best. The bristles are a soft rubber, which helps to stimulate the skin below the surface without excessive exfoliation, which is perfect for sensitive skin like mine on an every-day basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this brush with an essential oil blend after cleansing to help circulate, to remove puffiness around my eyes in the mornings and to help my sinuses in the winter. It&#x27;s tingly, but it delivers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave off a star because the cleanser is absolute crap...sorry Olay, but its true. I will be &amp;#34;donating&amp;#34; the cleanser to whoever wants to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that they NEVER discontinue this brush, and hope that they sell it separately so that we can pair it with cleansers that work with our skin type, and at the same reasonable price. ( I have tried the other olay brushes and they spin my skin raw)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to receive this item, so the seller info will be updated.  I have not had the best experience with amazon sellers, no matter how many stars, and will let you all know if these are factory rejects that were expedited to the masses because of defects, or any other reasons that these are now discounted...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, buy them for yourself and see for yourself!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially on my face, and I&#x27;m always a little hesitant to try new products geared towards skin care. Well, this is one I&#x27;m glad I tried out!! The Powered Contour brush is small, but amazing things come in small packages, this product is no exception. I love the way the rubber brushes clean my face, a clean I can feel AND see. And you only have to use a small amount of cleanser for it to do the job. My face has never felt better! This will be my number one face cleanser!!</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster! First reaction taking it out the package was the size of the brush, and how portable it is! Can stick it in your purse for a quck pick me up after a work out etc. I just actually gone done trying it out for the first time! I loved it! It was simple to use, and the sleek design is a bonus! When I squeezed out the stuff from the tube, I was shocked it was a silver color! Wasn&#x27;t expecting that, but that&#x27;s what makes it unique! I turned on the brush and went going on my face! It felt amazing and very refreshing! After I was done, my face feels so fresh and clean! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have extremely indecisive skin. One day it&#x27;s dry and flaky, other days its extremely oily! I loved this product. Not only was the brush soft enough that it didn&#x27;t hurt my skin, but it was rough enough to get all of the dirt out! My face felt extremely clean after my first use!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I bought a new face primer a few weeks ago and it made my face break out sooo bad! I have other facial cleansers I tried but they didn&#x27;t really do the job. So I got this and OMG within 3 days my face has cleared up a lot! Right after I use it my face feels so clean and I can see that my pores are cleaner. I wear makeup everyday so this thing really helps. The power brush is the perfect size too it gets right into the areas I need it the most.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with an Olay product. I received the Fresh Effects kit complimentary from Influenster. I love the powered brush! It&#x27;s shape allows you to reach every single area of your face and it leaves your skin soft and super clean. I really like the face wash too! I noticed I didn&#x27;t have oily skin in the middle of the day, as I usually do when I use other cleansers.    [...]</li>
    <li> I love the new Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid! Powered Contour Cleansing System, it makes my dry scaly but oily face feel very smooth and refreshed, it helps even out my facial texture, I would definitely try another product from Olay, it has brought me over from Neutrogena, I will recommend this product to anyone of all different types of skins. I received my product compliments of Influenster SweetHeart VoxBox.</li>
    <li> Among the amazing things I received complimentary from influenster in my voxbox, was the va va vivid facial cleansing system and the shine be gone facial cleansing product. I absolutely love it. It makes your skin very soft and shone free. The cleansing system can be used with a number of different Olay cleansers to specifically target your problem areas. Definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find something I dislike about this system. The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are rubber so you get a good exfoliater without irritating the skin. The cleansers are amazing. No drying, no shiny oily skin. The moisturizer feels like silk without that nasty greasy feeling and I&#x27;ve switched from Garniers BB Cream over to Olay. I love BB cream as I don&#x27;t like using foundation. Garnier worked good, but was still thick enough to feel like a foundation and that it was just laying on top of my skin. Olays BB Cream was light with great coverage and it feels like I&#x27;m wearing nothing while gives my skin a flawless look. Definitely LOVE this line of products.</li>
    <li> This product met all my expectations and I was very please. I don&#x27;t use face washes or cleansers to get rid of acne, when I break out nothing really helps it just needs to be left alone. But I do buy face washes and cleansers to keep my face clean and refreshed. The face wash is nice and soft , it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily or leave it dry. My favorite is the cleanser , to me the triangle shape gets to all the different angles and corners of my face. It gets all the oil, dirt and left over makeup that my makeup wipes don&#x27;t get and I dont know if this is true but the vibration of the cleanser make me feel like its lifting of dead skin as well as just cleaning it and my face just feels soft after and i love it.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best facial cleansers I have ever used or heard of and for a great low price. The battery powered cleansing brush makes your skin feel as if you had just gotten a facial and is extremely gentle. Not only this but about three days later, not only me but the people around me had noticed that my skin had cleared up a lot and was so soft. It gave my face a new glow and I am extremely glad I have found a perfect product thats cheaper but works like the most expensive facial treatment.</li>
    <li> The brush leaves your skin feeling clean but the cleanser is for oily skin and I have dry skin so I wish it came with another option.</li>
    <li> For the past 8 years, I have had terrible, acne-prone skin. Left me with acne scars and ugly pores. This lovely little product has cleared them up! It&#x27;s a little, buzzing miracle. You just put some of the cleaner on the brush, water your face, water the brush a bit, then scrub, scrub, scrub. The brush seems to be more to help spread the cleaner better- not so much to grab the dirt off your face. Which is quite alright with me. It leaves your skin smooth, glowing, and not shining. Will buy! {I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.}</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!! I was very skeptical at first but it has definitely earned its keep and will be on my shopping list each month! It cleans like no other product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I have always been weary of powered face scrubbers, but after trying the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va Vivid! Powered Contour Cleansing System, I&#x27;m not sure I will go back to regular face washing. My face feels fantastic and so clean after I use it! I got this free from Influenster, and am SO glad I did!</li>
    <li> I gave this five stars because I am obsessed. My skin has cleared up, is less oily and my skin is BRIGHTER. I LOVE this system. I am so excited to use it (and it&#x27;s enjoyable as well). I actually had a skin rash and for whatever reason, using the Va-Va-Vivid cleared up the rash as well as any clogged oil or imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan and won&#x27;t buy anything else for a LONG while.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love product! Influenster sent this to me complimentary to try out and I am so glad they did!&lt;br /&gt;I used it the second I received it in the mail. It was easy to use and gave me instant results. It made me look perky and awake, minimized my pores, and got rid of any sort of shine I had. I can not wait to try their other products from this line, such as the &amp;#34;Olay Fresh Effects Bead Me Up! Exfoliating Cleanser&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have always had t- zone and break out issues around my hair line. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of products and pretty much only stick to the organic products now (i&#x27;ve had a couple of skin burning/frying issues a time to two, no but really, I have)- thanks benzoyl peroxide). So getting into a skincare routine has always been almost a bit scary. I just do what I need to do to get by and clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after using this product, I actually WANT to spend time with a routine. This product not only cleaned my face, but actually cleared up the small break outs I have around my hairline and helped alleviate the frustrating oily t- zone area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so simple to use, can be used in the shower, and doesn&#x27;t take any time at all. I love the scrubbing tool, it feels amazing on my skin, too, and the cleaning product itself smells great and so refreshing! Totally will recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small and compact which makes it perfect for travel, and makes me skin so alive! I&#x27;m always on the go between working long hours and life, so if i am running late its perfect for a quick face wash before i start my shift</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have extrmely high expectations for this product because it seemed very similar to a Clarisonic, and my thinking was anything that costs $11.99 but can be compared to a Clarisonic, must be a horrible product. I was absolutely wrong. This product is so good! The very first time I used it on my face, my face looked instantly clearer. I have some minor blackhead issues on my nose and whiteheads near my chin but after using the shine minimizer cleanser and the powered massage thing (not really sure what the proper name is), those areas looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall use of this product is extremely easy. There&#x27;s no way someone can mess up the directions. And I think you could even use any cleanser with the powered massager, not only the shine cleanser that it comes with. That is obviously a plus because it&#x27;s nice when products don&#x27;t have specific requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really liked the vibrating affect. The vibrations seemed to have brought blood flow to my face which immediately brightened my skin and made it much more lively. To be honest, I just used it and I can&#x27;t stop looking at my skin. I&#x27;m serious. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has minor skin issues, I don&#x27;t know if it would perform as well for someone with acne or other skin conditions. But for a young person who just wants to achieve the fresh-faced look, this is the product to use. Don&#x27;t spend $150 on a Clarisonic because it&#x27;s not worth it. I have a Clarisonic and I&#x27;m a bit upset knowing that I bought it and now I found a product that performs just as well.</li>
    <li> I received this set complementary from Influenster for testing purposes. I immediately fell in love with it! The cleanser leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean and the scrubber is awesome! I love how it vibrates on my skin. I can really feel it cleaning my pores.</li>
    <li> I received products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Fresh Effects {Va-Va-Vivid!} Powered Contour Cleansing System: Similar to Neutrogena Wave. Smaller version of Olay Professional ProX. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product!!! Pores appeared smaller after one use. Face feels cleaner. I work at Walmart and that place is really dusty. My face feels dull after washing with soap and water. This product has brightened and softened my skin. Five stars!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Fresh Effects {Shine, Shine Go Away!} Shine Minimizing Cleanser: My face is very oily. No matter what kind of skincare regimen or products I use. Anything I buy never seems to work. I will admit I have never used Olay products and I think that&#x27;s the problem. I noticed a difference. My face is less shiny. Five stars!!!!!</li>
    <li> The first day I used this my face didn&#x27;t get oily until mid-day, by a week later it took until the evening to even start! My pores look smaller and the brush really gets blackhead out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> I love the way this works. My face feels so much cleaner and smoother after I use it. The only negative thing I found was that, I have sensitive skin and a lot of facial cleansers/washers cause me to break out, this one gave me 3 new small pimples and a big mamma jamma one on my forehead. But I really do love how it works and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have super sensitive skin...I&#x27;ll probably end up using it again even if I do break out from it a little.</li>
    <li> I was one of those lucky kids in high school who had perfect skin. I can count on one hand the number of breakouts I had before I graduated (and by breakouts, I mean a single zit). My college years weren&#x27;t so lucky, though. I started experiencing breakouts for the first time in my life and I had no idea how to handle them. It wasn&#x27;t until this past Christmas that I discovered face cleaning brushes. I&#x27;ve been using Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and have been really pleased with the results. When I saw Olay Fresh Effects {Va-Va-Vivid!} Powered Contour Cleaning System, I was anxious to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Effects is a lot different from Pro-X - it&#x27;s smaller, more intense (as its description states, it &amp;#34;packs some punch&amp;#34;), and has a triangle brush head instead of a round one. The bristles are also a lot stronger - they&#x27;re a silicone/rubber material that will make this brush a lot more durable. The packaging leads me to believe it&#x27;s geared toward a younger market, which makes sense with the intensity of this brush&#x27;s vibrations. Fresh Effects is powered by 1 AAA battery (included) and can be used in the shower, but not submerged in water. This makes it so much easier to integrate into your regular routine. It would fare well for traveling since it&#x27;s so compact (smaller than my hand!). I&#x27;m actually considering putting it in my gym back to use after my workouts since it gives such a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleansing System comes with Olay Fresh Effects {Shine, Shine Go Away!} Shine Minimizing Cleanser ($6.99 for a full size). It&#x27;s as powerful as a mask, but works as a cleanser to deep clean and reduce the appearance of pores. It left my face feeling tight, like I had just done a face mask, which I thought was impressive. I like it so far, but I think you&#x27;d be safe to use the Fresh Effects cleaning brush with the face wash of your choosing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a price tag of only $12.99, I HIGHLY recommend the Olay Fresh Effects {Va-Va-Vivid!} Powered Contour Cleaning System. It&#x27;s a great way to scrub off the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I received Olay Fresh Effects {Va-Va-Vivid!} Powered Contour Cleaning System and Olay Fresh Effects {Shine, Shine Go Away!} Shine Minimizing Cleanser for free from Influenster.]</li>
    <li> I love this! It works great, and it&#x27;s not nearly as expensive as many of the face washing systems out there. :)</li>
    <li> I love this little gadget. The only reason I give it a 4/5 is because of the cleanser. I wish the little kit came with cleansers for different skin types. I love how the triangle shaped head can get around all the corners of my face, especially the nose area. It leaves my skin refreshed and gently exfoliated. Definitely telling my friends!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good! I already love Olay products for my face But now that I have this I think I will never turn to anything else. My skin is clean and not dry but not oily either. It is the perfect cleansing system!!</li>
    <li> I have acne-prone, combination skin. I&#x27;ve been using this at night for about 2 weeks now and I can see an improvement in my skin. The oily spots aren&#x27;t as oily and the dry patches aren&#x27;t there but I still get the occasional pimples...</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product it left my face smooth and clean,felt like I was fresh out of the shower lol weird i know but it felt like that I swear. The only thing i really didnt like though was how i had to add a bit more than i should in order for it to actually feel like its working.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to find out that I would be getting this product for free to test from influenster. I immediately wanted to try it out. The cleaning system is made out of rubber instead of bristles like most are. It is a bit rough on the cold winter blown skin so I am saving it for the summer time after a long day of work. I like the face wash and I think it smells quite nice. I am a stickler for keeping to the same products over and over again. I like it but I am still not convinced if it is something I would purchase in the future but who knows. Its possible.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! My faces ALWAYS feels refreshed and smooth and squeaky clean soon after using it. After receiving it from Influnester.com, I haven&#x27;t washed my face any other way every night! I wear foundation makeup which sometimes can still be left on my face after a normal hand wash, but the vibrating powered cleanser helped to get rid of every inch of makeup left on my face. The cleanser helps with my shine and even oil control on my face! The triangle shape helped get all the little corners around my nose and the vibration flet like a great facial on my face. i loved this product and HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice love it leaves your face feeling good love how the brush massages your face and keeps your skin shine free, wish they had a moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I received this free from @Influenster for Testing purposes and it is simply AMAZING!  @OlayFreshEffects is doing it right!  #FreshEffects</li>
    <li> Let me say this, I really don&#x27;t have a facial routine. I usually wash it with a face wash and then put a moisturizer on, but with this product, I wish I did more! I actually look forward to using this. It definitely makes my face feel nice and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging definitely matches the name of the product. It is so bright and vivid! It definitely catches my eye, and it&#x27;s easy to spot when looking at similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the brush is a triangle, and with this shape it definitely gets the contours of your nose, and it&#x27;s great for your hairline! You&#x27;re supposed to use it on your T-Zone, but I decided to test it out on my entire face. It is just incredible, my skin has never felt so soft. I am absolutely in love with this product, and I&#x27;m definitely interested in purchasing it again when needed. Better yet, I would definitely be interested in trying another product from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the on and off buttons seem to be a little touchy, but with the amazing results from this product, I don&#x27;t even mind.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! Leaves me oil free as it claims throughout the day. Comes with a great cleansing powered brush head that compares in strength to my clarisonic. It is the perfect size for travel or to have at hand in your purse for those moments you spend the night unexpectedly and want a good clean. Makes me feel refreshed when I use it at night and day! I only use the brush at night though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for about three weeks after receiving it complementary from Influenster. I absolutely love it! It keeps my face softer and smoother than regular face washes. I also love that you can use it in the shower. Its unique shape helps to get to the space around your nose, which is always my most problem area. I can&#x27;t wait to try out their other cleansers.</li>
    <li> I love this system! The actual face wash definitely gives my face a beautiful clean feeling, but isn&#x27;t too harsh for my sensitive skin. The system is incredible! I love how it vibrates, giving a mini-massage to the face! It lathers up the wash well too, and is easy to maneuver to get the whole face. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this package through the influenster program.and it is the item that stood out the most to me. I love how easy it is to carry around, and how simple it is to use and clean the brush. After using it along with the olay cleaner that it came with, my face feels squeaky clean but still soft.</li>
    <li> It is a triangular shaped soft brush that vibrates to help vibrate your pores clean and reaches hard places like between your eyes and nose. The shine minimizing cleanser that came with it smelled great but my skin is very sensitive to new products and it is impossible to tell whether I broke out the next day because of this cleanser or just because I am prone to breaking out. The brush itself is nice to use and I see myself using it with my regular face wash. For those of you that regularly use a face wash with acne medication in it (salicylic acid), I would not recommend using these face washes as they do not have that in the ingredient list. I also did not see a difference in the amount of shine I have throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Powerful yet gentle.  This product cleans away any product or dirt from your face in an aggressive yet gentle way.  I love the built in motor that helps exfoliate and clean skin.  The shape of the cleanser tool also helps to reach every corner of your face, especially around your nose.  The cleanser itself also smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> When I received this in my Sweetheart box, I was worried that the included Shine Minimizing cleanser would be too stripping on my skin which is quite dry (and thus naturally shine-free) during the winter. However, I&#x27;m happy to report that it did no such thing! My skin feels very balanced and hydrated after cleansing with the Shine Minimizing cleanser. No irritation either!&lt;br /&gt;The included powered facial brush is really nice. I didn&#x27;t think that it would make much difference because it vibrates rather than the brush head it&#x27;s self actually rotating. Boy, was I wrong. Using the powered brush really does make my face not only feel more clean but it also imparts a lovely rosy glow that makes me look more radiant and awake. My skin seems more smooth after using it and my moisturizer glides right on afterwards, absorbing better and being more effective in the process. It also really keeps the pores on my nose much clearer than manual washing. I like it a lot and can&#x27;t wait to try it out with different scrubs for exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised by Olay Fresh Effect&#x27;s Cleansing System. It&#x27;s gentle but very effective and I&#x27;m grateful to have it. If you&#x27;re looking to try out a little facial brush but not wanting shell out money for the big guns (like Clarisonic) this might be something to look into.</li>
    <li> This olay product is great! I use it every other day. It leaves my skin feeling soft even a day or two after! Its awesome. The cleaner works so well on my skin. I have nothing bad to say, the olay fresh effects is perfect for anyone trying to have good, clean skin.</li>
    <li> This product is great! My skin felt smoother and soft after only one use. I like the triangle shape and found it easy to use. I also like that it is light weight. Feels nice and gentle on my sensitive skin. *Received for free free from Influenster. However thoughts are my own honest opinion*</li>
    <li> I was initially excited about getting  Olay Fresh Effects (Va-Va-Vivid) Powered Contour Cleansing System in my VoxBox. The vibrating cleaner was nice and I could even use it in the shower! Unfortunately, after the first use, the skin on my face felt tight and after a few days I have a major breakout. I have never had acne-maybe one or two zits at a time maybe once every few months. And here I was with seven (SEVEN!) gross red zits on my face. Definitely not a product for me. I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Influenster.com sent me this to try for free. I love it. I use it every day. It really cleans your face well, and it feels good. I really want to try their makeup removing wipes. I love this line of products. Try it. It is cheaper than most face-cleaning tools, and in my opinion, works better!</li>
    <li> (I received a complimentary system from Influenster and Olay to write this review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have plenty of cleansers that I&#x27;m currently working my way through, I have to admit I was surprised by how much I liked this one. It smells fantastic!!! I really mean that, as I love fruit-scented anything and this is not too overwhelming. As for the brush, I&#x27;m ambivalent about it. Sure, if you leave it on your face and move it in circles long enough your face will feel tighter when you&#x27;re done (most people associate that feeling with the dirt/dead skin being mostly gone) but if you don&#x27;t have the 15 minutes to wait for that feeling, then perhaps something else would be better for you. I really think it needs more of a \\&quot;swivel\\&quot; brush head, as it only really vibrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the cleanser, would purchase again! Not so sure if I recommend the brush.</li>
    <li> i recieved this products to test from influenster and im in love after my first use my skin was softer and less dry and since useing it i have not had anymore breakout which is a huge plus</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this product. It is small, which I personally love. I think that it is travel friendly, and doesn&#x27;t take up very much room in my bathroom. The rubber bristles really clean my face and deep clean in such a way that reduces the size of my pores. It&#x27;s small size makes it easy to get into the small areas around my nose and cleans that sometimes neglected area like a breeze.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product to those with oily, and dry skin alike.</li>
    <li> I seriously LOVE this product! I use to use Clinique which gets expensive after a while, because it&#x27;s a 3 set and runs about $30-$40 each time it needs replaced! Olay Fresh Effects is very budget friendly averaging at about $9.99! I was given the Shine Shine Go Away Cleaner. My face tends to shine towards the later part of the day, with the oils pushing through my skin. This worked wonders! By the end of the day, my face still felt so fresh and clean :) I didn&#x27;t have noticable shine spots on my forehead anymore :) ! I plan to purchase the other cleaning products they have for this wand, as it is budget friendly and a quick clean! The directions read to wet your face, put a dime amount on the wand and move the wand in circular directions on your face for about 2-3 minutes ! Rinse and FEEL CLEAN :) Super easy and fast face wash for morning in night when you are in a rush! I definitely recommend this product to anyone :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer* I received this products from Influenster for testing purposes only! Thank you Influenster for a great program and the opportunity to test these products!</li>
    <li> This product is great it helps to make ur face feel very clean and soft after just the first use, i would definitely recommend  this product to other people, because am sure that it will work just as well as it did for me .</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster and I got to say, it&#x27;s awesome. The vibration is gentle and the cleanser smells good. The tool is battery operated and seems like it is easy enough to change. You can even take it in the shower, which is when I use it. Since I started using it, I have noticed the number of blackheads on my nose going away, like they&#x27;re being vibrated out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I def. recommend getting this. :)</li>
    <li> The triangle shape of this product is perfect for your face! It isn&#x27;t huge like some facial cleansing products. it is absolutely the right size not to big, not to small. It is also very reasonably priced. I definitely recommend this product to a friend who hasn&#x27;t found that perfect facial cleansing product yet!</li>
    <li> So i use a clarasonic mia with philosophy&#x27;s purity face cleansner on a daily basic and thats been working for me for the past two years. I have very sensitive skin and need a product that will be good for that. So I tried this product out because i received it free of charge from influenster for reviewing purposes and it&#x27;s definitely not horrible. I would say it doesn&#x27;t get my face as clean as the clarasonic does but it will do the job if you don&#x27;t want to bring the clarisonic on a trip with you being that this is cheaper and easier to replace if lost. It definitely gets the nooks right by my nose which is great. i would recommend this to someone looks to try it out its different for everyones skin so find what works for you.</li>
    <li> I got this complimentary from Influester and I LOVE it so much. It exfoliates and deep cleans my face at the same time. The Shine Shine Go Away actually keeps my face shine free for a long time. I use it before I put on my makeup to help with my oily skin. Good purchase. I just wish it was rechargeable and not battery operated</li>
    <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t too soft and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking into buying it!</li>
    <li> I use it when I shower, towards the end of my shower when my pores are open. It makes my face sooo smooth and it&#x27;s clearing up my skin. It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic, I would totally recommend it for anyone with problem skin or for someone just looking for a mini-facial when they shower.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!! it removes the makeup that i thought my maekup remover took care of. Within a week the small bumps on my forehead have decreased and smoothed out. as far as the oily skin,,,a big decrease in shiny skin. I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster and since then I have repurchased the face wash. the vibration from the bristles it like giving my face a massage every morning and night.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It feels like my face is being massaged by tiny angels. The triangular shape of the the cleanser really gets into the corners around my nose.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing system. It does not cost as much as other power brushes for cleansing your face, but works very well for the price. Before I got this product, my face used to be very oily by mid-afternoon. Now that I use this system every morning and night, my face is a lot less oily. I also see a reduction in the size of the pores on my face. I would recommend this system if you are looking for an affordable cleansing system that is easy to use. I got this free from Influenster and I would be happy to try the other products in this line next time I go to Target.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and I instantly found it interesting! I love exfoliating and removing dead dull skin cells can improve the texture of your skin! I struggle with acne prone skin and I purchased lots of facial scrubs/exfoliators and I have to say this stacks up pretty well! The brush doesn&#x27;t scratch your face neither did I break out from the cleanser. I like that if you do have your own facial cleanser you can use your own with this brush! I would definitely recommend this product for students, student athletes and people who travel often. The only thing I find a little unsatisfying about this product is that the brush is very small. I takes a while to cleanse my entire face with the brush but If you don&#x27;t mind being thorough with your cleansing that won&#x27;t be an issue for you! I like this product and would repurchase with my own money! I was lucky enough to try this product complimentary through Influenster!</li>
    <li> I received this free from influenster and it really does clean your face really well. And the face wash works well at keeping face oils from surfacing. When I wash my face at night, by the time morning comes I sometimes have oils on my forehead, but not after using this!!</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! The size makes it portable and easy to store, and every time I use it my fave feels so fresh and clean! Also, I LOVE the fact that you can use any cleanser you want with it if you want something different that day. No pre-measured cleansing pads here! You get to pick what and how much you use. Very happy with this product! :)</li>
    <li> I am honestly not much of a face wash person because I have sensitive skin. I was able to try Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid and loved it! It was gentle on my face and left it feeling smooth and soft! The triangle shaped brush was easily able to get into the touch to reach places (sides of my nose) without being harsh. I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I got the contouring cleansing system courtesy of influenster. When I first saw it, I won&#x27;t like, I was a little taken aback by the brush. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would do anything or if I would like it. But after trying it out, I found that I liked it surprisingly well. It was gentle but I felt that my face received good stimulation. I shared it with my mom and she felt the same. Thanks Olay!</li>
    <li> I like the clean feeling after I use the vibrating brush.  It definitely is &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  All my friends rave about their cleansing systems which are $100+.  I don&#x27;t mind using this one and spending only $12. I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have oily skin and wanted to try the little scrubby tool. I love it! The little scrubby thing does make my face a bit red right after I use it. Since I don&#x27;t have oily skin I can&#x27;t exactly say if that would work for someone who does have oily skin.  But it did seem to make my skin even less oily then it is. But I really did love this, it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample to test for influenster.com. I have to say I was weary at first because of the rubber bristles but it&#x27;s AMAZING. I use it every morning with the wash given because it not only leaves my face shine-free and refreshed but it helps wake me up in the morning. I like using it with other face washes as well, it;s very versatile and doesn&#x27;t leave you limited (:</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster as part of my 2013 vox box gift, and I have to say it works pretty well. At first the brush shocked me because it has rubber bristles and I didn&#x27;t expect it to do much. But I tried it along with the cleanser and they are really good! the system leaves your face feeling squeaky clean, so I suggest using a moisturizer afterwards and I would also say this product is more for people with oily or combination skin. Maybe even for those with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin, but not so much for those with dry skin. Those with dry skin can still benefit from the brush, I would just suggest paring it with a different more moisturizing cleanser. Over all, I love it! the brush feels great and I gladly welcome it into my skin care collection. I would definitely love to try more products from the collection.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to receive this complimentary from Influenster because I do not have any type of cleaning brush or appliance and this fit the bill nicely. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, but I personally love everything about it. The vibrating brush feels great when you are using it, so the minute of use flies by. It has soft little plastic-y bristles that are not stiff or uncomfortable at all. It claims to be able to easily glide over the contours of the face and it really does. It just kinda glides over the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pore cleanser works great, smells amazing, and leaves my skin feeling soft, not dry or stiff at all. Only a little bit is needed to produce a rich lather. Did I mention it smells SOOO good?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does It Work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the ultimate question: Does it work as it was intended to? YES! It actually did cut down on the shininess I sometimes get on my forehead by the end of day, it minimized the appearance of my pores, and made my nose look better after the very first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I Buy It?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES! I think I&#x27;m hooked on this and going forward, I would definitely buy the cleanser as well because I think they work great together.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved the Va-Va-Vivid from Olay Fresh Effects. I received the FULL size item(s) to try absolutely FREE from Influenster in my Valentines VoxBox. I must say it was one of the items I REALLY looked forward to trying.I must say it has won me over! I will continue to buy this item for myself as well as other family members and friends so they can try it to. I was expecting it to do what other facial cleansers and stuff have done in the past and make me break out or have a reaction to it but it didn&#x27;t. It has actually helped my skin out TREMENDOUSLY! Thanks Olay for making this amazing product!</li>
    <li> this product cleans my face so well! I don&#x27;t use anything but this brush and it works amazing for cleaning out dirt and oil from my pores! Highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this! The cleanser produced a great lather paired with the small vibrations of the cleansing brush, gave the feeling of a home spa treatment! After trying this a few times, I could see and feel the difference on my face. No more oily skin for me!</li>
    <li> I really love how this product gives my face spa-like treatment every morning! My skin is loving it&#x27;s daily massage from the vibrating applicator! This product leaves my skin so fresh! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> The Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid Powered Contour Cleansing System is absolutely amazing. It cleanses perfectly and leaves your skin fresh and clean but never dry. Definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s non-abrasive and feels so soothing on the skin. I can&#x27;t believe I never found it before, but now that I have it, it fits right into my schedule. I have combination skin, or something of the sort. It isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave it dry right after. All I could ask for, really.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think of this product after I received it in an Influenster VoxBox to review, but I really liked it! The Contoured device is something I had to get used to since the vibration is a little different, but the deep clean was great! I liked the face wash as well, especially since I have oily skin! None of my other deep cleaning devices get into my nose ares that well, so I&#x27;m really happy with this product overall!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now, and I am beyond happy with it.  I also have a Clarisonic cleansing system, and while I love using that, I may love this more.  It is a fraction of the price of a Clarisonic and works just as well if not better.  The rubber bristles are soft enough for delicate skin, but definitely do their job.  The design of the head gets into hard to reach spots that the round brush of the Clarisonic wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to reach into.  It feels great on the skin and leaves it feeling super soft and clean.  The Shine Shine Go Away cleanser is super awesome as well.  I was a bit shocked to see it&#x27;s silver metallic color, however it almost makes the product more fun to use.  It smells great and works! I will continue to purchase it. I highly recommend this for anyone, and definitely give it a try if you own something similar to the Clarisonic, it will open your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find more information and also purchase at [...]&lt;br /&gt;(I did receive this product complimentary through Influenster, but all opinions are my own.)</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I love how clear my skin started becoming after using the cleanser and exfoliator together. I noticed that when I combined the brush with other cleansers, I didn&#x27;t get the same amazing results so I definitely think this is a great pair. I will warn those with dry skin. It&#x27;s job is to take the shine away and I noticed that my cheeks started to become drier due to me using this everyday. I am careful about when I use this but the summer is approaching so I&#x27;m sure this will come in handy again.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great little gadget for cleaning on the go. The cleanser is silver, which I find weird but it seems to work well. I still prefer my Clarisonic, since I think that cleanses better, but this has been a good experiment. It&#x27;s worked great to keep my skin clear while traveling.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The mini vibrating scrubber is great if you didn&#x27;t want to dish out 30+ dollars for a big one from Ulta or something like that. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I found this item for less in a store near me, but oh well.</li>
    <li> The kit which I received contained only the brush, not the cleanser. Perhaps, in combination, the assessment I could make would be positive, but it is difficult to judge the brush purely on its own merits. It did have an exfoliant effect, but I noticed nothing outstanding or notable.</li>
    <li> From the description of this product, I was expecting something that worked better than the average cleansing brush on the t-zone, nose and chin areas. Unfortunately, I found this brush to be cumbersome, somewhat uncomfortable to use and inevitably ineffective. The entire brush vibrates, but the rubber bristles themselves don&#x27;t move or rotate as with Oil of Olay&#x27;s Cleansing Brush so I didn&#x27;t find it to work well at cleansing. The awkward shape didn&#x27;t work well in the places it was said to, like the corner of the nose and face. I find a cleansing pad (like a Buf-Puf) to be far easier (not to mention much cheaper) to use. The liquid cleanser didn&#x27;t come with the product so I had to use another brand, but I doubt that would affect my opinion because the brush design just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser, and YES it is great at shine control. I reccomend it to those fellow oily skin friends. It made skin look and feel soo refreshed ALL day long!!</li>
    <li> I loved it! I have oily skin but the cleanser definitely reduce the shine.The cleanser is great for the summer months or if you live in hot climates. The cleansing brush is great if you like to put on heavy foundation and have trouble completely wiping it off your face. I like to use the cleansing brush twice a week, sometimes with a scrub. The vibration of the brush makes it feel like a massage. After using it, my skin feels smoother. I received Fresh Effects complimentary of Influenster but this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I got a complimentary full-sized sample of the Olay Fresh Effects from Influenster. I love the smell of the cleanser. It is so fresh and citrus-y for me. I also like the massaging brush. After using the cleanser and massaging brush, I felt the skin on my face become tighter and felt softer.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin feel and look so clean! i love it. The brush makes the cleansing process more effective.</li>
    <li> One of the best skin cares I have tried. Make my face feel healthy and clean!! I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in a complimentary VoxBox from Influenster. This product is awesome. It curves to you face and it makes it so much easier to make sure your whole face is clean. You actually feel the product cleaning your skin and its amazing. The device is so easy to clean as opposed to similar products that often have the cleanser you use build up in the bristles. I really love the cleanser as well, my typical very shiny and oily skin is prevented when using the shine cleanser that is included in the kit. I really just love this product. I am also quite interested in trying some of their other cleansers with the contour system.</li>
    <li> Olay Fresh Effects cleans much deeper than normal facewash. It removed additional makeup that makeup remover and facial cleanser do not. I noticed a big change in my skin right away, it is much smoother and it unclogged pores. I like that it is small and easy to store. I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore the little electric brush for washing my face. It fits into all the nooks on my face just perfectly. I also love that it&#x27;s not too harsh on my face which is what I was afraid of.</li>
    <li> Got this free from  Influenster.com and i LOVE IT. It really works on my dry skin annd leaves it feeling fresh all day!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find the Va-Va-Vivid product to work on my skin because it was just vibrating and it didn&#x27;t seem to work well with the cleaner it came with. The cleansing head was pretty rough on the skin and it seemed like it was stretching out the skin on my face and it just didn&#x27;t seem or feel like it was cleaning my face at all. it seems more of like it was dragging and pulling it from left to right. The packaging was awesome and I was definitely looking forward to using the product but after using it for a while, it is not a product I liked or found effective on my skin. Just because this product didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t be willing to give other products in the collection a try. I would love to try some of the moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week, but I am very pleased with the results. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and still have acne breakouts and oily skin. I&#x27;m surprised that this has seemed to show improvement in my skin. Plus, it feels great, and I feel like I am getting more of the makeup off my face at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;brush&#x27; is really more &#x27;vibrating&#x27; than scrubbing. Kind of like getting a facial massage. It tingles, but does not scratch. Is is small, and fits in your hand nicely. Plus, the ingenious shape of the brush really gets in hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product. I think I&#x27;m going to have check other products in this line.</li>
    <li> This product did improve the appearance of my skin a little bit but I thought it was way too hyped up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Clarisonic brush for a couple years now, but I received the Olay Fresh Effects cleansing system complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I would say that it works slightly better than just using hands for face cleansing, but the rubber head doesn&#x27;t slough off dead skin as well as a bristled brush. However, for the extremely reasonable price, it may be worth your investment.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. The Cleaning System has little rubbery bristles on it, and it&#x27;s battery operated and it sort of vibrates on your face? I was terrified of this, because I have really sensitive skin and I was like, \\&quot;There is NO WAY that this is going to not make me break out atrociously.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, it did not make me break out atrociously. I used this for a few days, and also used the Cleaning System with my regular face wash a few times, and both times my face has been left SO clean looking and SO soft feeling and I&#x27;m completely sold on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is my face is so soft, I keep touching it. Whoops.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was surprised by how pleased I was. It didn&#x27;t eliminate the shine completely but washing with the brush was surprisingly pleasant. I do recommend trying this product!</li>
    <li> The tiny little face brush has a triangular head and rubber-like nubbins. The battery operated brush doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power as I ran it over my face and tried to scrub. I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the rubber on my face and it didn&#x27;t seem to do much to cleanse or feel stimulated. I like the pro-x brush much better [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]]</li>
    <li> I think that this is a wonderful product. I love the concept. It is supposed to be a cheap alternative to the other high end cleansing devices out there. I unfortunately have not had the chance to use these higher end products so I cannot make the comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved the Va-Va-Vivid through a program called Influenster VoxBox and I think I would pay $$ to purchase it of my own money. The bristles are a bit stiff for my sensitive skin, I would love a sensitive skin option to be available. I liked that it comes with a mini facial cleanser so that you can experience the entire thing without spending even more money.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is small and highly portable. It fits nicely into your hand and the triangle bristle head is interesting.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good product and I would recommend it to a friend with less sensitive skin than I.</li>
    <li> I received the Olay Fresh Effects cleansing system free to review in my Influenster Sweetheart Voxbox and I fell in love. The triangular brush made it easy to clean in the corners  of your face and the contoured brush moved easily over cheeks and forehead. This system left my face fresh, smooth and luminous. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product left my face feeling smooth and refreshed. The places I had a hard time getting before became easy. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking at these types of products for a while now, but have been really wary of trying them.  The vibrating brush has a nice design and seems very powerful. After using, my face didn&#x27;t feel much different, but there were some red spots. Overall, the Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid! Powered Contour Cleansing System was a product that I enjoyed trying, but not one that I would probably use again.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product, I thought a few things:  it would be bigger, it was a real brush, and it would work instantly on its own.  I was wrong on all three counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the size.  When I opened the box, the brush was about half the size that I expected it to be.  I decided it was cute and worth trying anyway, and its small size proved easier to maneuver around my face.  Reality beats expectation here :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the brush itself.  I was worried, before I opened it and saw that it was rubber, that it might be too stiff on my face.  I didn&#x27;t want to make my face all red, so I was pleased with the rubber texture before I even turned it on to use on my face.  It was a little weird at first, but something I quickly got used to.  A little extra time was necessary to make up for the lack of bristles that could reach each pore, but my face felt clean after about two minutes of use.  I don&#x27;t really have any complaints or excitement here--it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, even if it takes an extra minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser:  love it.  There&#x27;s almost no scent, but it feels fresh--the \\&quot;fresh effects\\&quot; branding is perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t lather like I&#x27;m used to as quickly as they say it should when I use the brush, but it does work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was this a good idea on its own?  ....Probably not.  While it didn&#x27;t scrape the skin off my face, it did leave my cheeks and forehead very dried-out.  I ended up needing a moisturizer, which I should have realized in advance.  (They do say on the package to use it with their moisturizer, and I now understand why.  It is COMPLETELY necessary.)  So that ends up being a little extra expense, but my face is now smooth and happy after several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after the first use, but my previous cleanser (which will not be named) was more expensive, without a brush included--I took it as a good sign that this at least equalled that one, and figured I had gotten a good deal, butI was really indifferent.  A few days later, I don&#x27;t think you could pay me to switch back.  My face feels so much lighter and smoother, and my friends actually asked what I was doing differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this?  Absolutely.  In fact, I have.  Several times.</li>
    <li> This is the first cleaning brush system I ever got. My face felt really good as if I spent a few minutes in the shower with my clean and clear facial scrub. The vibrations of the brush did make my face feel better. With all that being I got this for free in a voxbox and now I&#x27;m ready to buy a clairosonic  brush.</li>
    <li> I wanted this cleansing kit for a couple weeks since I first saw it at the store. First off the packaging is unlike any other Olay packaging, it&#x27;s colorful and attention grabbing and louder than most of their other products, I&#x27;m guessing to draw in a younger crowd but it drew me in the second I saw it. I ended up getting the cleansing system courtesy of a website called influenster.com free to try and fell in love even more. The package comes with a small tool that&#x27;s amazing for traveling because of its size with a  vibrating triangle shaped head that&#x27;s perfect for your t-zone and contouring around your hair. The bristles are a soft chili one so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re scraping off your face. I love how it feels on my face its soft and vibrates just enough, I can&#x27;t feel my brain rattling in my head but I do feel it deep cleaning. The best part about it is it comes with a sample of their new Olay fresh effects shine control cleanser it&#x27;s the best thing ever. First off its an awesome silver color which I was immediately intrigued. I don&#x27;t think it has too much of a scent at all but it&#x27;s definitely not bad and it lathers so nice I can really feel it deep cleaning. The first time I used it was at night and the next day I woke up much more oily than normal so I was a little worried but I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for about a week straight now and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference. My makeup stays on better and I blot a lot less during the day and its been making my skin break out much less because I&#x27;m less oily. I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this and it&#x27;s only about $15 much less than most cleansing systems like the clairsonic which is over $100. This is my holy grail face washing system</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about trying a new facial cleanser since I&#x27;m prone to acne but I&#x27;m glad I did.  With the first use of Olay Fresh Effects&#x27; Va-Va-Vivid cleansing system it made  my skin feeling clean, refreshed and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Facial Cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: Creamy&lt;br /&gt;Color: Silver&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Light fresh floral + cucumber scent (which I really love)&lt;br /&gt;The Brush:&lt;br /&gt;It has a unique triangular shape that vibrates and is perfect for hard-to-reach places like the side of your nose. The bristles were made out of plastic and wasn&#x27;t really soft like Clarisonic. It would&#x27;ve been nice if the bristles were softer and thinner. It only uses 1 AAA Battery and is very easy to operate. One button for ON and a separate bottom for OFF.</li>
    <li> With the little vibrating brush. I like to use both on its own and with the brush. Cuts thought makeup like no ones business. So fresh and so clean clean</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW this has got to be the best product ever!!! ok not ever but its definitely up on my list... I have oily skin and can say that the cleansing lotion alone is awesome for oily skin but not only that after using the system my face has gotten better I have not broken out and def think for the price it is a must have!</li>
    <li> I used the Fresh Effects this morning after my shower. I have to say this product was the most exciting out of my box. Here lately I&#x27;ve had some serious oil build up and black heads on my face. Probably due to stress (mother of 5, 2 with special needs) but none the less it&#x27;s been a big problem for me because my face is usually flawless. After using this, my face was silky smooth and even now at 7PM my face is still silky smooth and feels so refreshed. I&#x27;ll be using this every morning and as soon as I run out, I&#x27;ll be purchasing. I recommend this to everyone who has oily skin or who wears a lot of makeup. Thanks to Influenster for letting me try this product out!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this doing any good because I naturally have pretty good skin. I was very pleasantly surprised when I dried off my face and it felt so soft and rejuvinated! Love this product!</li>
    <li> This was my first ever facial cleaner tool I&#x27;ve ever used so I havent got much to compare it too. I did like the feeling of how clean my face felt and it was like a massage for it as well. I&#x27;d reccommend it to anyone who has small breakouts.</li>
    <li> Great product. My husband stole this from me, he loves it too! The price is great. Leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> I loved it. this was my first time trying a new method for clearing acne. SO far its going great. Thanks to Influenster.com i got to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Again its a great product haven&#x27;t used it a lot but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week but the \\&quot;effects\\&quot; are AWESOME! I have visible results and the power in this tiny thing is amazing! I&#x27;m super impressed and I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is!</li>
    <li> i just cant say enough about this new olay fresh effects product  i love the way it makes my skin feel so nice and clean yet it is gentle for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I really and truly love this. The triangular shape of the brush is so much better than other brand&#x27;s round ones. I can get into every crease around my nose and eyes without any problems. The cleanser left my face feeling remarkably soft and clean feeling without irritating my sensitive skin! I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Effects complimentary from Influenster. I really like it. The brush is amazing at reaching those places that are hard to reach like the side of the nose. The Shine, Shine Go Away cleanser is pretty awesome. I love how clean and soft my face is. The brush is battery operated and it creates awesome vibrations that clean the face better.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Right away I noticed results. It made my skin feel refreshed and silky. This is a must to buy!</li>
    <li> The Olay Fresh Effects Cleansing System is ahhh-mazing. The Shine Control cleanser paired with the brush makes my skin extremely soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for the past week and a half and notice a huge difference in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> oh my goodness! i used the product this morning and a little goes a long way my face was clean of any residue and makeup i really recommend this product the rubbber bristles on the vibrating brush and not harsh they are very gentle to the skin</li>
    <li> Firstly, I want to thank Influenster for letting me try this for FREE in the Sweetheart VoxBox! When I first took this cleansing system out my first thought was, &#x27;Wow! Why is this thing so tiny!&#x27; Only about 4 inches! Wowee did that tiny size fool me! What this basically is, is a facial cleansing brush that vibrates. It simply runs on a AAA battery which is awesome instead of those cell batteries that are oh so expensive. The brush cannot be submerged in water, but it can be used in the shower! That in itself is a huge plus for me! I put about a pea sized dot of the cleanser in the middle of the brush. That tiny, tiny amount was MORE than enough for my entire face! The smell of the cleanser is one of the best &#x27;beauty product&#x27; items that I&#x27;ve smelled! It is fresh and clean scented, but not over powering! With the system you only get a .68 FL OZ tube, which will last quite some time since you don&#x27;t need much. A full sized tube (5 oz.) retails for $6.99 in the store. Now, the cleanser is called &#x27;Shine, Shine Go Away. Well...I didn&#x27;t really notice my face less shiny, but my skin was sooooo soft and clean feeling it was unbelievable! Not to mention, my face smelled so good for hours after use! I would recommend this product to anybody!</li>
    <li> OMG, it is awesome!! The Olay Fresh Effects is just simply great. I was fortunate enough to get this in the Sweetheart boxvox from Influenster.com. I have been using it for about a week now and it is great! I use it every night before I go to sleep. It gets the shine off my face and does not dry up my skin. It works wonders for my skin. I highly recommend it! :D</li>
    <li> I love the little massager brush that comes in this kit. It makes it easy for me to wash my face at night. I usually wait tell I take a shower which is not every day. But with this kit I can wash my face every day. And my skin is loving the wash to. I have kinda sensitive skin and my skin dose not seem to have trouble with this wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a less coverage BB Cream for make up and useually have to use concealer in lots of areas, but not lately. This is definitely gonna be my new go to face care system. I absolutely LOVE it right now.</li>
    <li> At first I found using the scrubber to be ticklish. The vibration of it takes some getting used to. The cleanser smells nice, and afterward my face literally squeaked it was so clean. I&#x27;ve used it each night for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve had no redness or breakouts related to it- which worried me at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the scrubber is a neat gimmick, but I haven&#x27;t had any results to suggest its a better or deeper clean than any other exfoliating product.</li>
    <li> it leaves your face so fresh &amp; smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;i diffently recommend it to people who suffer from an oily face!</li>
    <li> I must start off by saying that I was not expecting this product to be any different from other facial cleansers, but boy was I wrong!!!! This thing has been AMAZING! I used to be a biore user but since Influenster sent me this to test out I had to give it a try. I am absolutely in love now. It cleans deep down into your pores to keep you from breaking out more as well as makes your face feel refreshed! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Olay Fresh Effects Cleansing System is a great buy to keep your skin clean from dirt and makeup. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and even makes your makeup look better, smoother and more blended after you use the cleaning system. Great price for the effects you get.&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT you will LIKE IT</li>
    <li> I tried this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes...&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty skeptical about this product. I will purchase more product for&lt;br /&gt;my brush. At first, I thought I had a \\&quot;trial\\&quot; size, and when I went to see&lt;br /&gt;the product at walmart, i saw it was the original size. It has helped with my \\&quot;occasional\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;breakouts. I do noticed I have less breakouts since I have started using this.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, but the only thing I do not like as far as everything goes, is&lt;br /&gt;that a lot of product seems to be left over on the bottom, so i&#x27;m having to squeeze&lt;br /&gt;it out of the brush. I wash my face and once I&#x27;m done, I see some product left.&lt;br /&gt;other than that, it&#x27;s great !</li>
    <li> Typically when I use a cleanser meant to absorb oil/create a matte finish, etc. it can leave my skin way too dry and create flakes (which is even more annoying than being too oily!) But not this product. I love the little scrubber that comes with it, it feels good on my face, cleans my face well, and is easy to clean itself. It feels like a mini spa in my hand.</li>
    <li> First, I was amazed to see that this product came with a pre-installed battery. Second, this product was very self explanatory and the direction sheet was easy to read and follow. The product itself cleaned my face very well without using harsh materials or any ill effects. It left my face feeling clean and non-greasy. I was overall very impressed and will continue use of this product.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing!  DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMATIC SKIN? IF SO THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU!!    The Olay Fresh Effects Va-va Vivid help deep cleanse your skin and help prevent shine!  It smells great!  It&#x27;s Affordable .  Good For Sensitive Skin.  It is an all around great product and I highly Recommend it!  [...]</li>
    <li> At first I did not think I was going to like this as much as my clarasonic but I do, the shape of it, is just so much better because it really fits around your nose really well. After using this my skin feels so soft and refreshed. I love it.</li>
    <li> I received Olay Fresh Effects from Influenster.com and I&#x27;ve been trying it out for a week, and so far I love it! It leaves my face soft and smooth and you can really tell that it cleans your face entirely!</li>
    <li> I seriously loved this product. The brush feels amazing and makes your skin very smooth. The cleanser is also good. I don&#x27;t use it alone, I use other cleansers as well. I don&#x27;t really think that it has made my skin less shiny or anything but i would definitely repurchase both of these. It&#x27;s also a very good choice for someone who can&#x27;t afford a clarisonic.</li>
    <li> RRRRRRRRRRRRRrecived this product from Influenster and I fell in love with it. It does what it says and leaves my face feeling clean. The brush itself is also easy to clean and the fact that it is small and easy to store is to</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous when I seen the brush, but the shape is really good for getting around your nose area. The cleanser creates a nice lather and has a nice fresh smell. I feel it really gets all the dead skin cells off for a really deep clean.</li>
    <li> I am completely head over heels over this skin care products. I started with the Va-Va-Vivid! Cleansing System Kit and I loved it so much I went to buy the full size of the Shine, Shine Go Away! My next products from the Fresh Effects line was the S&#x27;Wipe Out! wipes. I have not had any reactions to these products as when you start a new line of skin care. These are meant to be used by younger skin and not like other Olay products that are focused and wrinkles and anti-aging. I am so happy with my skin now and feels fresh and young. I love the way the cleansing system is in a triangular shape because it can easily reach into every contour of your face like around the nose, lips, eyes, and hairline.</li>
    <li> I love Olay® Fresh Effects {Va-Va-Vivid!} Powered Contour Cleansing System! My skin looks super vibrant after cleansing my face with this product - its almost unbelievable! I love using it just before going out - hello, instant glow! And if I&#x27;m in a rush, I&#x27;ll even take it into the shower with me (be sure not to submerge the device). I definitely plan to buy other products from this collection in the future. I wrote a full review of this product here: [...]</li>
    <li> I received Olay Fresh Effects from Influenster and I was beyond glad that I was chosen.  I really like the brand and I really care care about my skin and how I look and feel.  I probably pay more attention than most people, but I feel that it is worth it!  The main benefits are that the way the brush is designed, it moves around the contours of your face flawlessly and also all of the bad stuff like dirt, oil, and micro debris is removed to give your skin the most clean and clear image.  I think that this product is easy to use and delivers great results!</li>
    <li> Alright! I&#x27;ve had a few weeks to play with my Va-Va-Vivid #olaygetfresh @fresheffects provided to me by @influenster in my #sweetheartvoxbox! I think it&#x27;s a great thing to keep with you post gym/workout, quick morning wash, or post beach/pool/etc... Makeup free/minimal make up day out! The top right is size comparison with a paper mate flair pen. It&#x27;s small enough to toss in a beach/gym/weekend bag or purse! I loved the that the rubbery bristles were soft enough to clean without leaving your skin feeling dry. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it to remove makeup, it didn&#x27;t feel like a deep clean post makeup cleanse but without makeup cleanse it felt nice, do I dare say fresh? 😁It lightly vibrates giving you a relaxing massaging cleanse and the small triangular shape makes it easy to move around the T-zone. It came with a shine minimizing cleanser called Shine, Shine Go Away! It was a grey pearly color and it smells great! I didn&#x27;t see a difference in shine but it did smell great during and even a little after washing my face. It didn&#x27;t really have a lather to it which is okay with me but I did feel like I had to use a little more cleanser than I normally use. This retails for about $15. Pros: light, fresh cleanse. Easy to clean. Compact. Safe for daily use, does NOT leave face feeling dry post use. And it&#x27;s a great price! Cons: not really for a deep clean if you wear a moderate or more amount of makeup. No carrying case/lid for travel carry. Thanks again @influenstervoxbox!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received Olay Fresh Effects Va-Va-Vivid! complimentary from Influenster. It is an okay cleaning system. I like how it easily glides on my face. I &#x27;ve used some other systems before but they were too harsh on my face, even paintfull sometimes. However Olay Fresh Effects is very gentle and helps me cleans area around my nose very effectively due to the fact that the brush is triangular shape. This system doesn&#x27;t do anything extraordinary, however am looking forward to using it each day.</li>
    <li> I just moved from Texas to California and my skin hates it. I&#x27;ve tried everything lately to stop the breakouts. Nothing worked until I tried this. My skin looks and feels so much better. It&#x27;s so soft! I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this product, but it&#x27;s a life saver.</li>
    <li> Since getting the Olay Fresh Effects Cleansing System from Influenster to try, I have used it almost every day! There is a huge difference in my skin. I can tell that it definitely gets much deeper in my pores!</li>
    <li> I recieved Olay Fresh Effects Oil Control from Influenster free to try. It comes with a little vibrating scrub. Overall I don&#x27;t know if the scrub did much for helping clean my face. It was fun to use thought. I really like Olay products but for my acne prone face this didn&#x27;t do much to control oil on my face.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes in the sweetheart vox box.I got the va va vivid powered contour cleansing system. I did enjoy the powered contour cleanser I appreciated that Olay included the battery so it was ready for use. The cleanser itself is a silver gray color, think of the color of a cavity filling. The actual \\&quot;machine\\&quot; is able to get into all of the contours of your face and it helps make a nice lather on your face. The smell of the product is a lot like the zest bars, and it was like getting a mini facial massage. My skin isn&#x27;t what i&#x27;d call sensitive but it was a little red after using but i imagine it was just from the cleanser bristles because it went away after a few minutes of rinsing and drying. The feel of this after you&#x27;re done is refreshing, you don&#x27;t feel like your face it tight or dried out like with other cleansers. You feel clean but not squeaky, however if you have oily skin i&#x27;d be a little wary, i have an oily t-zone and i found that after a few hours my t-zone had more oil production than usual. If you have skin that&#x27;s on the normal to dry side i&#x27;d say give this product a try</li>
    <li> I love the fresh clean feeling it leaves my face after rinsing. My face is left baby soft! I am in love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Va-va-vivid for about a little over a month now and absolutely love it!  It truly leaves my face feeling very clean but doesn&#x27;t leave that tight and dry feeling.  I suffer from acne breakouts frequently and I have noticed a definite reduction in the severity and frequency of my breakouts.  I love the way it reaches to all areas of my face, especially around my nose without getting into my eyes .  The vibrations make it feel like getting a mini facial every time I use it, which is every day!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the way it works and I am so happy I was given the opportunity to try it by Influenster!</li>
    <li> First off, I would like to thank Influenster because they sent me this product for free to test out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with my experience with this product. There were a few kinks here and there, but overall, I was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying that I have a somewhat dry skin type. I say somewhat because while I do not have flakes or large pores on my skin, it is generally tight feeling even if I put on a moisturizer after. The cleanser itself is wonderful- it cleans your skin extremely well. However, if you have severe dry skin I do not recommend on purchasing the cleanser because it will really dry your skin out.  I do realize that it is not an option with this product- the cleanser already comes with the device. But for future reference, this cleanser does not work well with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is amazing! It is gentle and really gets down to the pores. My skin felt refreshed after I used it. Like a new slate.....ready to get dirty again. But then again it&#x27;s ok if it gets dirty again because I have this lovely contraption to clean it :D I looked forward to using this. It massaged my skin, cleaned it, and I did not have to worry if I missed a spot or if I cleaned my skin well enough. I even used it with my other facial cleaners and it worked just as great! I highly recommend. I was sure to follow up with my moisturizers though, because since it gets down to your pores it will suck all the oil out (again, same with the cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell this is great for people with oily skin, or combo skin, or even \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin (if that even really exists). I highly recommend this wonderful device and you will not be disappointed! At least I hope you wont because that&#x27;s no fun &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This little brush is wonderful and worked beautifully for about a month, then the brush head fell off one morning -- and the next morning, and the next. I had to hold it on while I used it, which was awkward as the brush head sleeve is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to stop using it... am thinking about trying to repair it with some fancy glue...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I wash my face in the shower: maybe this brush is not waterproof?!!)</li>
    <li> I really like the compact design of this brush, easy to pack up for travel. I also can appreciate the silicon brissles, as they are easy to keep sanitized. I have seen a notable difference with my pores and my skin feels tighter. I don&#x27;t LOVE the wash that comes with, but the brush work great with my go to favorite cleanser too.</li>
    <li> I got this in my 2013 sweetheart vox box and I love it it makes my skin soft and smooth and refreshed after I use this deffinitly recommend this product for everyone</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product out. It seemed awesome, plus the starter kit is kind of expensive, but Influenster sent me one to test out for myself! The first few days of using this it made my skin super soft and it smells great. After the first few days though, it made my skin SO dry. I feel like they are doing this on purpose just so you have to purchase their moisturizer as well. It was annoying. Overall, it&#x27;s not really that great and I will stick my regular Neutrogena skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Works as I expected! Love how small it is for travel! It can fit in the palm of my hand!  My face feels clean and fresh after each use!</li>
    <li> I was dissappointed with this cleaning system.  The actual cleaning unit is very small, with the handle a little thicker than a toothbrush and about two inches long.  The cleaning head is a small triangle, and has flexible plastic bristles.  The triangular shape does allow you to get into corners (like around your nose), but the plastic bristles do not create much lather with soap (at least not as effectively as nylon bristled brushes do).  There are also not very many bristles on the head.  The head just vibrates and I&#x27;m not sure it is any more effective than just using a washcloth.  Just one more thing to replace batteries in and clutter up the shower.  I don&#x27;t see myself using this again.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to get this. I thought it would be the perfect little brush for my face. Well let me tell you, its terrible!!! Hard rubber bristles that do not glide freely over the face. This thing vibrates soo hard &amp; is very rough on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t help to foam up your cleanser in the least. All it does is hurt the skin and it made my face bright red. There is no way that this brush can be beneficial to anybody&#x27;s skin! I do not have a clue how Olay could even put this thing on the market.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous reviewer; this product is a waste of money.  The &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; is made of rubber and there is not enough power to make the rubber head clean your face.  The product I received had obviously been purchased at an outlet store and came wrapped in the outlet store plastic bag.  Not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome. It really helps stop the shine on my face when I use the shine shine go away cleanser. This product is portable and really easy to travel with. It also is very easy to clean. It is definitely now part of my daily face cleansing routine. Thank you influenster for sending me this product. It has changed my skin for the better!! I would not pass up this product!</li>
    <li> love this product and it keeps the shine awayyy!!!! love that the brush is mall enough to get into the corners of your face</li>
    <li> Great to use for everyday and the gym! I highly suggest switching whatever you use and use this. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I have super oily skin and am prone to stress breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using this system daily for a couple weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The bristles are gentle but strong enough to really give a good scrub. The cleanser leaves skin feeling fresh and reduces the oily skin appearance all day, even after applying makeup. All around I&#x27;m thoroughly satisfied!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders honestly.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve always had troubled skin and the the soft rubber bristles on the brushes contour and get such a deep cleanse to my face that I saw a difference within the first couple times I&#x27;ve used it. The soft bristles and slow vibration to the brush massages the skin leaving you feeling like u just had an expensive facial.&lt;br /&gt;  Would recommend it to anyone even if you have perfect skin. Since this worked out so well I&#x27;m dying to try out the other products on the line and see how they work. ^^</li>
    <li> The cleanser and the brush were both amazing. I have alot of dry patches on my skin and I could feel a difference while I was using the products. It&#x27;s well worth the money and I think it&#x27;s the best facial cleanser duo of 2013. This was the first product I tried from the Va-Va-Vivid collection, which was complimentary from Influenster and I will definitely be trying more products from the collection.</li>
    <li> Feels great on your face. It really massages your face and you can feel it deep cleaning your face. It leaves your face feeling so soft and smooth. Overall an amazing product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty great. I have always had a hard time finding face washes that dries my face out or leaves me flaky. Olay Fresh Effects leaves my face feeling rejuvenated and fantastic after a long days work. If you have problems with facial products I would recommend trying this. I never thought I would use a brush, thought it was a waste of time and didn&#x27;t do much, but I am so glad I have this a shot.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this new play fresh effects line I recieved free from Influenster. I no longer can see myself washing my face any other way. It really does feel like it gets deep into your pores.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic system to keep your skin feeling smooth.  The bristles of the brush really clean deeply and, with the help of cleanser, leaves your face feeling fresh.  My favorite part was that my face did not feel too dried out after I used it.  My only suggestion would be to always use the powered brush when you use the cleanser, as it did not seem to work as well as a stand-alone cleansing product.</li>
    <li> I was sent it for testing purpose from influenster and it&#x27;s great I use it everyday and it&#x27;s so small it&#x27;s great for travel and works in the smallest place the cleanser itself and smells good I so love it</li>
    <li> Use this every day in my shower and it is amazing - gets in all the small places! The smell of the scrub is heaven and the vibration of the brush is so relaxing! A must! Just with the bottle of scrub was larger.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It has little rubbery bristles on the head that vibrate to give your face the cleanest feeling! I started using it over two weeks ago and my complexion is noticeably clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally have a moderately clear complexion with a few break outs around my forehead and  chin. This product was able to make the few zits that I had go away and it even kept me zit free during graduate school finals! ( A very stressful time indeed). I also like the triangle shape of the head because you can maneuver it around your face to get tiny spots (like the upper lip), as well as the more broad places (like your forehead and cheeks). The micro vibrations of the head, unlike the normal wash cloth method,n allow the soap to lather up and provide a nice fresh feeling that takes make up off easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another cool thing about this product is that it is small and compact. I was able to take it with me on my trip to California and it didn&#x27;t take up any space in my carry on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and I am so thankful that I was selected for the February VoxBox product test from influenster so I could try this product as a complementary trial. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Olay Fresh Effects is great! The package includes a vibrating brush and oil-free face wash- when used in cognition- it works beautifully! The brush has rounded, plastic bristles and is on the smaller side, but it works great to help clean out your pores. All you have to do is rinse your face before applying the oil-free cleanser, and scrub using the vibrating brush. While the oil-free wash works amazingly on its own, the brush enhances the skin-cleansing impact. It is very portable, perfect for travel, and is generally reliable. My only complaint is that all that powers the scrubber is a single, AAA battery, meaning that sometimes the facial scrubber feels a bit underpowered when it is pressed against your skin. Otherwise, this product is easily one of the best on the market. Absolutely recommended!</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to use this product. I just place a dime sized amount of cleanser onto the applicator and splash a tiny bit of water, turn it on, and start gliding it all over my face. Besides the fact its easy to use, it also does a really good job at cleansing my skin by taking off my foundation at the end of the night. Love this thing!</li>
    <li> The Shine Shine Go Away works alright. It works better if your face doesn&#x27;t produce a lot oil. I am opposite of that, and I was hoping that this product could help some more or less. Of course, it only works for so long. It does leave your face feeling smooth and clean. Overall, Olay isn&#x27;t a bad product at all. It&#x27;s just the device that&#x27;s giving the bad reviews.</li>
    <li> I loved this it definitley left my face feeling spick n span clean i have very oily skin and it didn not irritate my skin at all...i highly recommend this to all women. Must try at least once!</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to powered face washing system but having relatively clean/dry skin I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $200+ for a different/older system. I got this item from Influenster and I loved it! My face has never felt so clean and I cannot wait to use this every day. This was perfect for my skin and I will be using this product. It wasn&#x27;t too harsh for my delicate skin but provided adequate cleaning.</li>
    <li> When I saw the Olay Fresh Effects {Va-Va-Vivid!} Powered Contour Cleansing System I was very skeptical on using it because it reminded me of the Clarisonic brush. However, the packaging made me want to try it! It looks so chic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubbery bristles on the triangle brush aren&#x27;t as soft compared to other brush cleansing systems I&#x27;ve tried. Surprisingly this small brush is very powerful! It was a pleasant massage on my skin and believe it or not, it alleviated my sinus pressure headaches! Yes, I&#x27;m serious!&lt;br /&gt;It also does fit the contours of your face, which was a pleasant surprise! NO MORE WETTING MY HAIRLINE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{Shine, Shine Go Away} Shine Minimizing Cleanser has a metallic silver color to it, the smell is divine. I don&#x27;t know why but it reminds me of Irish Spring, a feminine/fresh version of it. I used a pea size on my brush and it did a great job on lathering my whole face and leaving my skin oil free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using items separate from each other and it didn&#x27;t work as great as when I used the products TOGETHER. For instance, when I used a different cleanser with the brush it didn&#x27;t clean as well and when I used the OLAY cleanser on it&#x27;s own, I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it when I had a full face of makeup on and it did an amazing job at removing everything. I didn&#x27;t try it on my eyes obviously, I&#x27;m only talking about the face area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cleanser so much I went to buy a bigger version just as a backup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My video review: [...]</li>
    <li> This product had me skeptical at first, but after trying it, I was hooked! I usually have problem skin, combination oily-dry. Olay Fresh Effects left me with soft, shine-free, yet glowing skin! No greasy feeling. I always expect good quality from Olay and I was yet again impressed. I will most likely be re-purchasing as soon as I need to restock!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using anything with batteries to clean my face, and I love it! It&#x27;s a lot of fun, and I feel fresher and cleaner than when just using a washcloth. The cleanser itself it really rich and thick, and it feels almost like a face mask instead of a lightweight cleanser. However, I think because of that it does an extremely good job moisturizing, instead of drying out my skin as many other face washes will. I haven&#x27;t seen long term improvements in my skin just yet (besides that it seems to be less dry), but more consistant use would probably change that. My only qualm is that you have to really make an effort to clean out the bristles, otherwise the dirt and grime just sits at the bottom of the scrubber. It isn&#x27;t difficult, but it takes a little bit of effort. I really like this product and will continue using it!</li>
    <li> This product goes the extra mile to get your face clean. I used this maybe 3 times in a week and saw results. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the brush or the cleanser or the combo of both but i love it. The brush is so small it fits right into your toothbrush holder. My face was smoother and my complexion was brighter</li>
    <li> The tool&#x27;s rubber bristles may not FEEL like they are doing much because they feel like a good massage, but it gets any gross dry skin off and leaves me feeling an actual deep clean. Definitely worth the money to use it every now and then to brighten up your face, not sure I would recommend it for every day use.</li>
    <li> So I got this product in my Influenster VoxBox and lemme tell you, this thing works wonders! It comes with this litte tube of face wash, the face wash itself help get rid of my problem acne. I have these big blotches of scaring and pimples on my jaw line that never go away. The face wash helped all that. The clarisonic brush is fairly small but works like a charm. I love the little rubber bristles it has. All in all, I have to say, I&#x27;m really satisfied and I&#x27;m definitely going to buy the other face washes they have.</li>
    <li> This system included:&lt;br /&gt;* {Va-Va-Vivid!} Powered Contour Cleansing System&lt;br /&gt;* {Shine, Shine Go Away!} Shine Minimizing Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small cleanser takes one AAA battery and is water resistant . I use mine in the shower. The triangle shaped head makes it easy to get in between and around your eyes and in the creases of your nose. At $12.99, it&#x27;s priced low enough for the average teenager. I feel like the bright colors and the cute names for these products are catering towards that crowd. That doesn&#x27;t mean an adult can&#x27;t use this system though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just throw it out there right now that this is not a replacement for the Olay Pro-X (which I am very much liking) or the Clarisonic. This is meant to clean 400% better than just using your hand. So keep that in mind when you are comparing. I almost made the mistake of thinking this system wasn&#x27;t good but then I realized that it does hold up to its claims.  The head is not removable and the bristles are made of rubber. The Shine Shine Go Away cleanser is a creamy cleanser that does not foam. It seems to be just fine but I don&#x27;t see myself going out and buying it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend purchasing this? Yes...and no. If you are looking for something that will clean your face way better than your own hands, then by all means, go buy this system! I can absolutely tell the difference. However, it is nothing compared to my Olay Pro-X. Then again, the Pro-X is priced at over double, ringing in at $29.99. Another point I must make is the Pro-X rotates rather than vibrates, it has replaceable heads, and two different speeds. I&#x27;d say invest your money in a Pro-X. If your teenager is wanting to get in on the vibrating face action, go grab them a Va-Va-Vivid.</li>
    <li> I dont really use too many fancy tools when cleaning my face. When I recieved my kit I was excitied to see what it was all about. The first time I used it, it made my face feel fresh and smooth. It was like a nice mini facial.&lt;br /&gt;I stop using this for a couple of days and got some breakouts. So I am using it again to get rid of them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking at this set at target and actually bought the related moisturizer first but was lucky enough to get this product for free, compliments of influenster. I&#x27;d been in the market for something like this for a while and was considering a clarisonic (usually in the $100+ range) and this was a great surprise. The cleanser is thick but not too thick and makes your face feel clean after washing (clean but not sahara dry or too tight) and the vibrating brush feels like it gets into every pore. Seeing as I have recently gotten huge pores, this product is a miracle for me. I&#x27;m hooked on this line now and I like the fact that it is budget skincare without skimping on the actual care. Overall, if you have oily or combination skin, I recommend you give this a try. It&#x27;s $12-15 so much less of a gamble that going for the clarisonic without ever trying this brush/cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love the cleaning product leaves my skin feeling so fresh and soft!! A little goes a loan way and foams up nicely! I have combination skin and it isn&#x27;t over drying or too oily!</li>
    <li> I received this cleansing system complementary from Influenster, and I absolutely love it! The rubber bristles are do a good job of scrubbing the grime off of my face, yet they are still gentle enough for my sensitive skin! The triangular brush head allows me to scrub all around my nose, which can&#x27;t be said about many facial brushes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this system. I received it complimentary of Influenster.com a couple weeks ago and it is now my go-to product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a prescription acne face wash, and use that on the cleansing brush instead of the moisturizer that comes with it (I don&#x27;t want to risk a break out). Before using the brush, I would still get cysts even with my prescription - I assume because it was not penetrating my skin properly. Now, I haven&#x27;t had a zit in WEEKS since I started using this. I also have combination oily-dry skin, and since moving to Texas, the dry part has extrapolated and it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep the dry skin off my face with my fingers alone. I swear, the cleansing brush does an amazing job at sloughing off the dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has NEVER felt cleaner or smoother. I never rave over products, but the life of my face has been changed with this system. I would recommend this to anyone and would love to try other products in the Va-Va Vivid! collection.</li>
    <li> Olay is a trusted brand that has been around for years! I remember watching my Granny when I was a little girl putting her Olay lotion on before bed. I love Olay and and I especially enjoy the Olay Fresh Effects! I love the packaging and the way it makes me look and feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The triangular shaped brush is great for the hard to reach cleaning areas that are in need of a good clean! This brush has what it takes and it&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use, I can use it with other cleansers. It lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t take but a dime sized amount of the \\&quot;shine shine go away cleanser.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very inexpensive and available where I shop. I like knowing its 400% better cleaning than any other brand or product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product that will keep shine away but moisturizer and help minimize pores is a go go for me!!!</li>
    <li> I had tried this product because it was sent complimentary from Influenster. But based on reviews, I would&#x27;ve bought this regardless. Because I wear makeup every day for work, washing it off is a hassle at night. This kit with the brush allows me to clean off any dirt and makeup off my face, leaving it flawless. You might think that it&#x27;s not working too well because the cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather much but you can definitely see the results of a cleaner face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m terrible about making sure I find time to wash my face extremely thoroughly, especially now that I have a baby, but this product makes it simple and makes my face feel so fabulous afterwards!</li>
    <li> I just love this Va-Va-Vivid freash effects!!! its like getting a message on your face! and its nice and small where you can hold it easy in your hands and pack it anywhere! I will be buying more of the Cleanser too!!</li>
    <li> I love it it&#x27;s so easy to use and easy to get into hard corners like the nose area t-zone :) i love it it&#x27;s awesome and leaves your skin so soft and moisturized :)</li>
    <li> This little brush is handy, easy to store, easy to clean, easy to get to all the corners of your face and creases clean!! I noticed my skin was so soft and cleana fter using this product! The cleanser is a silver sparkly color and it&#x27;s awesome!! Afterwards, my face feels like it&#x27;s taken a fresh breath of air!! Thank you to influenster for sending this product for me to review!!</li>
    <li> i received this Olay Fresh Effects product complimentary from Influenster [...] and let me just say- WOW! the little scrubber thing is so light and compact perfect for travel or to throw in your gym bag and the face wash it came with smells incredibly delicious and FRESH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; because my skin isnt very oily, i dont feel the need to use these two products everyday but when my face does fell gross, believe me, it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im almost finished with the tube of face wash it came with but i already bought myself a full size!</li>
    <li> Best system for a great clean face!  The vibrating cleanser gets deep into pores and the triangle shape is perfect for on the sides of nose and t zone. The cleanser is moisturizing and makes skin flawless. Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. The first night I used it, I did not like it. I did not notice a difference on my face. Second night, same thing. As I kept using it, I noticed my face kept getting smoother and smoother. Now, if I don&#x27;t use it, I can tell a big difference. My face is less shiny and my make-up goes on a lot smoother. This stuff really works.</li>
    <li> I really do like and enjoy this product, however, having very dry skin during the winter season it does dry out my skin after use. So in other words if you have combination to oily skin this is a fabulous product!! You will feel like you have a brand new face that feels super soft and brand new!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product was when my face was really dull and oily. I have been out all day so my makeup was definitely not perfect anymore and with an oily/combination skin it didn&#x27;t help that I didn&#x27;t get the chance to refresh my makeup. I couldn&#x27;t wait to take off my makeup and test this product out! I used this kit in the shower and didn&#x27;t have any problems with it getting wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unique brush, shape of a triangle, is perfect to get into hard to reach areas. I have other brush sets that are circular that is really difficult to get into the little crevices of your face but with this kit I didn&#x27;t. After the shower my face felt refreshed and cleansed.</li>
    <li> Great face wash system. I thought the vibrating washer was pretty cool and it feels really good to use. Didn&#x27;t dry my face out as much as other systems like proactive.</li>
    <li> I think I could give this product an \\&quot;A\\&quot; just for the cleansing brush. I love how it feels against my skin and just how effective it really is. The cleanser is good too and probably has a bit more value than most other cleaners, but nothing extraordinary.</li>
    <li> I was very pretty impressed with this product. It worked very well and left my face feeling clear, clean, and refreshed. Excellent product that I will now implement into my regular routine!</li>
    <li> The face wash is nice, the scrubber is the best part. It really helped my face feel clean. The wash has a nice scent, but my skin is very sensitive and it irritated my skin. I won&#x27;t use the cleanser again, but I will use the scrubber.</li>
    <li> This product was given to me by influenster to try out and I absolutely love it. It leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean will recommend and its a must have beauty product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells amazing and it leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Plus, it makes my skin super soft! I really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i bought this product thinking it would make my break outs disappear it has done nothing of the sort it has a poor design water gets inside and all over the product makes me wonder how  you can possibly keep it dry and you can&#x27;t feel the vibration on your face at all, i&#x27;ve had mine for two months and its already broken.</li>
