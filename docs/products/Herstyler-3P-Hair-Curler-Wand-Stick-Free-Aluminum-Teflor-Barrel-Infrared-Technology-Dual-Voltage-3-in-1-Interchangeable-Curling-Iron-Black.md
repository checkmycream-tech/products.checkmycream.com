<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I burned the crap out of my arm the first time I used it.  It is awkward to use.  However, when I can take the time to do it right the curls do last longer than any other curling iron I have used. My fine hair usually only holds curls for a few hours, this curling iron makes curls that last a whole day or longer.</li>
    <li> this culring wand is amazing it heats up fast the curls are so pretty and it&#x27;s easy to do and it;s at a great price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Works well. The heating is even and daughter loves it</li>
    <li> I tried the wand and it warms up super fast,but the packaging was to crammed. I had trouble trying to get all the pieces out. When I finally got everything out (since I was being super careful) I noticed that one of the wands was scratched :( I&#x27;m still upset about it, and I worry that will make it stop working as well, faster than it should.</li>
    <li> This was the best hair tool I have ever purchased. I have extremely straight hair that never holds a curl and this was like magic! It curls my hair perfectly, quickly and it lasts for days. Highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Best product. Lovvvvvve it.  Would definitely recommend to friends and family.  Thank you a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> The Herstyle 3 piece set is the real thing! There is not one difference from the ones in the mall. Except that they are A LOT cheaper on Amazon. The set comes with a glove too and the shipping was fast as well! The set has the herstyle tag on the cord. I compared the tag to my straightener that I had bought from Herstlye in the mall and it&#x27;s an EXACT match. So is the logo on the tin and the curler itself. Inside, there was even a warranty paper packet that was from herstyler.com. I can promise everyone who is looking to buy this set that it is AUTHENTIC! I have every product from the kiosk in the mall and I took a chance on buying this set for a cheaper price on Amazon. I know everything about these these products. I have everything from there except a mini straightener because I see no use for one. Don&#x27;t hesitate. This is an amazing deal. I even contacted planet stuff and asked if it was authentic. They gave me their word that it was and asked that I give them a chance. I was NOT disappointed. They heat up really fast and curl within a short period of time. I hope my review helps. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I bought the HERSTYLER about a year and a half ago for occasional use (updo&#x27;s and light styling of my wavy/frizzy hair). I was looking for something that was not outrageously expensive and had the versatility of interchangeable barrels. Overall it was a great little curling system while it lasted, but the largest barrel no longer heats up and the medium barrel heats up sometimes (if I twist it and jiggle it). I think this is just one of those \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; situations. The PRO&#x27;s: inexpensive, long cord, long lasting curls/waves, two heat settings (I use low), comes with 3 sizes.  The CON&#x27;s: short lifespan, barrels get stuck sometimes, BURNS! (came with a glove but I have two scars on both wrists from when I was getting used to this clamp-less type of iron. Safe technique takes a little practice).</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on my hair because I loved the curls she had and I LA-LA-LA-LOVE IT! It gives you those nice loose natural appearing curls without looking too \\&quot;Shirley Temple\\&quot; You must take a section of hair twist it with two fingers then wrap your hair around the barrel. For the piece that is cone shaped start with the widest end where you want your curl to start. I have very soft, straight hair that can rarely keep a curl and feel dirty if I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily (I know its bad!) but when I woke up the next day my hair was still wavy and \\&quot;messy-ish\\&quot; it looked funky but nice enough for me to go to work at my office which is a professional business setting. So just to re-iterate I LA LA LA LOVE this and have ordered it can&#x27;t wait to get it!!!! If you don&#x27;t know how to use it I suggest you go to your hairstylist and ask her to show you how to use it.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great tool unfortunately I really don&#x27;t like that it does not have a temperature gauge it has setting 1 and setting 2. As far as results the curls/waves did not stay all night. Using glove it also akward maybe I just need to get the hang of it</li>
    <li> I love this curler! It is a great value. I love that I can change the size of my curls. When I first started using it, I did burn myself a couple times.... So when you first get used to it, I would recommend wearing a jacket or a long sleeve shirt... I haven&#x27;t had problems since.</li>
    <li> I tried doing my hair curly with a flat iron and a normal clip hair curler, but i just never got the results i wanted. I found out about this clipless curling iron and decided to order it without trying it before. I was surprised how easy it is to use and how great the results came out. Just be careful and use your glove!! I love love love my hair now!!</li>
    <li> the herstyler curling wand is great! i have really curly, kind of frizzy hair and i can let me hair dry naturally, put some frizz taming serum in it, seperate my hair and curl it perfectly with the herstyler. it&#x27;s great and the different size barrells are AWESOME! i definately reccommend it if you want to do your hair for a special occasion or just switch it up from all the way straight or all the way curly. it&#x27;s a little time consuming if you do your whole head...take me about 30 minutes but i have really long, pretty thick hair. anyways...its great, you should buy it!</li>
    <li> This heat stick is awesome! The two different heat levels and the three different sized irons make it extremely versatile. I can use it on my thick hair and on my daughters fine hair. Be careful because it does get very hot and the glove is a must when you&#x27;re using it. I would recommend this for older girls because of the high heat levels and risk of getting burned if you aren&#x27;t very experienced in curling hair.</li>
    <li> I have been debating for about 6 months weather to get a herstyler or not. I finally got one and I wish I had gotten it 6 months ago. This curling iron is AMAZING! I have medium to thick long hair (23 inches) and I can curl my hair in 10 minutes. Yes, 10 minutes and it looks like I spent 30 min to an hour on it. My curls last all day and I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of hairspray to get them to last. I actually don&#x27;t have to use much hairspray at all. I have a daughter that has very thin hair and curls only last a few hours in her hair. I curled her hair with the hairstyler and was amazed that her curls lasted all day. If you are thinking about getting this curling iron I highly recommend it. I have never written a review about a product but I love my herstyler so much I just had to.  It is so fast and easy and the result is large beautiful curls that look like you had your hair professionally done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic and have long, naturally curly hair that is very fine and lacks volume but is also super, super frizzy. I wanted something to give some life to my curls after I read some tips about curling curly hair for the best results -- I would have NEVER thought of that. Anyway, I mentioned it to my boyfriend and he gave me this as a gift a few months ago and it is really one of the best gifts I have ever received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times and the result is noticeably smoother, shinier hair with gorgeous flowing curls that actually look like what you&#x27;ve probably always wanted your curls to look like. I usually use either the smallest attachment or the largest. The largest creates a curly/wavy look that is very trendy/stylish and the smallest creates lots of little curls for a bouncy, fun look. Honestly, the first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice my hair looked. Before using it I apply a bit of anti-frizz serum and let my hair air dry, and when I&#x27;m done I spray lightly with anti-frizz hair spray. The curls last all day and through the next day this way. The whole process never takes me more than half an hour and I have A LOT of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality and packaging are also very nice. I like that it comes in a big can that I can just store everything in and ago, it&#x27;s perfect for travel. The glove included is great and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s saved me from several burns so far. I would say overall it&#x27;s almost the kind of quality you&#x27;d expect to see in a salon curling iron, not at all like the ones you get at the drugstore for 20 bucks that feel like they&#x27;re about to fall apart in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t recommend this enough to other curly haired girls, and for the price it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> Its better if u buy the ones on the stores because. There cheaper and saves u money and they work as good and also the glove doesn&#x27;t work .your get burn!!!</li>
    <li> i bought this in july of 2010 and i love this curler, i usually use the medium sized one, i find thea ot works beteer when your ready to let go of the hair. grab the wand with your hand with the hair on it and slide the hair off the wand into cour hand, keep it in the roll in your hand and let it cool and set in your hand(:</li>
    <li> This is my second Herstyler and I love them! Works great and holds a curl like nobody&#x27;s business..I just hope this one last longer than a year!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased these wands. It works perfectly and has lasted me a very long time! Heats up quick. I have no problems with the wand.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time in the past with regular curling irons and trying to use my straighteners to get the curl/wavy look. It either took me forever to do myself or I had to enlist someone elses help; With the Herstyler, I got my desired look in 10 minutes all by myself! It was recommended to me by a friend and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Use the glove it comes with because it does, as does your hair, get HOT. I burned myself twice the first time I used it, probably user error, but once I got the hang of it, it was smooth sailing! Great buy! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a fast and easy curler!</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve always curled my hair with my straightener and this was so much easier.  AND-I am stationed in Germany right now, it only took ONE WEEK from the day I ordered it to get all the way here.  My husband and I were both SHOCKED!  Nothing gets here that fast!  My only suggestion would be to wear the glove and a long sleeve shirt until you get the hang of it.  I burned my arm trying to fix my hair at first.  But I love it!!</li>
    <li> The HerStyler Ceramic curling iron set is a God-send.  I absolutely love it!  I have fine, straight hair and I&#x27;ve always needed to curl it to avoid it looking limp and lifeless.  I&#x27;ve owned so many curling irons over the years and have always run into the same problem.  My hair is long and regular curling irons only seem to curl the end of the hair that&#x27;s first rolled around the wand, whereas the remainder of the hair barely gets a wave.  With the Herstyler, you&#x27;re able to wrap the entire length of hair around the wand itself and hold it in place for a few seconds and, viola!, the entire strand is curled from head to base.  It looks and feels wonderful to have a full head of curly hair.  It appears as though I have thicker hair as well.  I also enjoy the fact that even when I sleep on my curls overnight, the next day they&#x27;re still quite curly.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who: 1)has long hair and wants each strand to be fully curled and 2)for those who want a thicker looking mane.  The price is extremely reasonable as it comes with 3 different size wands for different size curls.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s friend had bought this identical iron at a kiosk in the mall for a small fortune.  After my 13 year old daughter tried it, she put it on her Christmas list as the \\&quot;Big Ticket\\&quot; item, because she knew it cost way over $100 at the mall.  I was so happy to find it online through Amazon for $55.00.  It arrived quickly and came just as the picture described, along with the heat golve, which was not in the picture.  It works grea!  She and her friends all used it at the New Years party we had, coming down stairs with different styles and varieties of curls.  GREAT PRODUCT &amp; great service!!</li>
    <li> Mine just arrived today and so far I love it. I&#x27;m hoping it doesn&#x27;t mess up within a few days like I seen in some reviews, but as for now, everything works fine and it makes very very pretty curls.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and daughter. They both have long hair. The styles they come up with with all the different attachments is amazing. This is such a versatile product and the end result is very professional!  My wife doesn&#x27;t get to use it as much due to the fact that my daughter always seems to have it. (Perhaps I&#x27;ll need to order a second one for the little lady.)  I have never seen a ceramic curling iron this quality in this price range. It is very difficult to find.  While my family and I really like this product, I must be fair and say this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand because the first one lasted only 16 months and then quit working.  I hope this one will give us longer service. We&#x27;ve had much less interesting curling irons that seemed to last forever so I was surprised when this went belly-up quicker than I think it should.  BUT-it is such a neat styling product and my daughter really missed not having it that I knew it was worth a second chance. I think you&#x27;ll like it too!</li>
    <li> Received product very quickly....it&#x27;s a Christmas gift for my daughter, we will see how she rates it after she uses it.  :)</li>
    <li> Today I finally received my Herstyler 3p set.Everything works fine. The tube that it came in was a little banged up though :/. My only concern is that I think that I need to return it , because the buttons to release the rods isn&#x27;t working.I really want to be able to use all of the pieces . If you have any suggestions could you help me?</li>
    <li> This curling iron heats up quickly and works well.  Although it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, it is simple in design and only takes a few minutes to learn how to use.  It seems to be sturdy in construction too.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron cause it was suppose to be the same at the mall.  When i saw it previewed the demonstrator said that it didnt get hot.   and made the curling look super easy.   I love the iron and my curls stay in even living in Texas, which is very different for me.   I used to curl my hair with a basic curling iron and the curls would fall as soon as i opened the door.  With this curling rod, my curls stay in my hair threw wind, and sleeping on them. I dont use ANY product on my hair, just curl and go and it holds.   My only disappointment is that it gets SO HOT!   I&#x27;ve burned my arm so bad its scared.  I use the glove but still get burned. I have small children so how hot it gets really scares me.   If i buy again i would go with lizo milano or jose eber, but i  dont know if they get hot neither.   good curling iron though</li>
    <li> Well, this item is really great. It works, but there are two neg. things about this protect. I have a very hard time switching the wands to one another. They should have made the buttons easier. The second problem is...the gloves sucks. The glove is way to big and it&#x27;s not completely heat proof. (lol) But other than that...it does its job and makes really nice curls. It&#x27;s takes a lot of practice and patients to get the curls right though. :)</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t came with any instructions,I don&#x27;t know how to used I return the product.</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron a lot and the price was great.  I&#x27;d never pay 200 dollars for any curling iron so I&#x27;m glad i found it at 50.  The packaging tin was all beat up by the time I got it so I was worried that I was gonna get what I pay for.  The iron works great and it is HOT HOT so be careful.  That glove works only but not as well as I would want.</li>
    <li> I tried this curling iron at the mall and am very glad to find this product on Amazon a LOT cheaper!  Shipping was super quick and I received mine in less than a week.  I almost purchased this product at the Brea Mall but walked away because I needed time to think about it.  I swear the salesman practically threw a fit.      I&#x27;m Asian with straight hair down to almost my waist.  I was pleasantly surprised how the curls held up and how light the curling iron was (compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past).  I&#x27;ve used the 3/4 inch attachment so far. I am considering buying the serum to prevent damage and dryness as I will be using this curling iron a lot.</li>
    <li> I have long (waist-length), thick, curly hair, and have never been able to use a curling iron to create defined curls.  My hair has tight curls, and can look messy, and I have always wanted to be able to use a curling iron to create loose curls or waves. However, after trying several curling irons, I have never found one that will keep a curl in my hair.  The curl just falls flat.  I recently tried the herstyler 3p at a friends house, and was amazed that I got exactly the curl that I wanted, and it lasted for days! It is also great that it has the three different sized barrels to create different sized curls, although the barrels are a bit difficult to change.  That is my only complaint about the product, but since I will primarily be using the largest barrel, that is not a problem for me.   If you need help using the herstyler, I would suggest searching herstyler 3p into youtube. There are tons of video tutorials.  I am so happy that I purchased this product, and I would recommend it to anyone! : )</li>
    <li> This curler gets soooo hot very fast. It works great, the curls stay for a while. The only thing is that I wish the tip of the barrel wouldn&#x27;t heat up because when I touched my neck accidentally after letting go of the curl I had a burn mark for a week! and it hurt sooo badly! so be very careful!!! and keep this away from kids! I also burnt my finger, so use the heat glove, it helps.</li>
    <li> **UPDATED REVIEW**  Six years later and I am still loving this set! I can&#x27;t believe it still works the same as it did the first day I used it. You will not regret buying this product! I&#x27;ve seen so many companies try to sell it for $90-200. That&#x27;s insane! Save your buck and get this super affordable hair tool. In the span of 6 years, I&#x27;ve never had to buy anything to curl my hair. This is truly the one.  -------------------------------------------------------- I love this product!!! The price is the greatest part plus the results it gives you.  I absolutley love it. I promise you, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product. It&#x27;s lightweight and it heats up on less than a minute. Best curling iron ever.</li>
    <li> Highly reccommended!!  My hair has never in my life held curl for more than 20 minutes, no matter how long I toast it with a regular iron or how much styling product I use.  I have very long heair and have used this iron five or six times now for everything from a &#x27;rock star hair&#x27; photo shoot in 40 mph winds to a daytime &#x27;boho&#x27; wavy look and my curls hold perfectly all day, even in humidity, and usually still look great the next morning too!  The even better thing is that I don&#x27;t have to use any product except two pumps of the HerStyler hair serum, which smells great and is completely weightless and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.  This is also a time-saver, it only takes 30 minutes to perfectly curl my hair, as opposed to an hour or more with other irons or hot rollers. Don&#x27;t be discouraged by how tricky it will seem for the first fifteen minutes, you&#x27;ll find out which way to hold the iron that works best for you and it will be great!  The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get five stars is because the medium sized rod in the set arrived broken, which I didn&#x27;t discover until after the return period because I typically only use the largest one :-(  Still, I&#x27;ll use this for my wedding to ensure all-day lovely locks, and will use it until it wears out...at which point I&#x27;ll probably buy another one!</li>
    <li> The product was just as described. Very fast shipping! ordered it Tuesday &amp; it came Thursday! Had a couple questions, sent an email and was replied immediately! Recommended seller! Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for use on my 7 yr old daughter&#x27;s board straight hair. It works! It does take getting used to, and the glove is a must have!  I have also used on my wavy hair and it was beautiful. I forsee using this product alot between the two of us.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this curler, particularly if you want to be able to create big, loose curls, medium curls, or tight ringlets.  In a way, you&#x27;re getting 3 curling irons for the price.  The mechanism by which you change the barrels is fairly simple and this iron heats up fast, and gets quite hot!  I would recommend it for older customers (perhaps young adult and above).  It&#x27;s a bit trickier to operate than the traditional clamping curling iron, and you may sustain burns if you aren&#x27;t careful, especially if (like me) you prefer not to use a glove when curling your hair.  However, it makes up for that small inconvenience by being much more flexible in use than the traditional curling iron.  There&#x27;s a reason that professional stylists use curling wands!  They&#x27;re great and can be used in many different ways.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this curler and how awesome it was but I didn&#x27;t believe it until I used it myself. That was all it took and I HAD to get this. This curling wand is amazing! Turns out great curls that last for 2 days. I don&#x27;t even have to hairspray the curls for them to stay in. This is absolutely my favorite hair styling tool I&#x27;ve ever had! I would recommend it to anyone. One note, watch out - it&#x27;s HOT. Burned myself twice before I started using the glove. So glad it comes with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! So far it is the best curling iron I ever bought and i love it It works so fast, i dont even need to put hairspray to keep the curls. I have straight hair and its hard to keep it curled even with hairspray but with this 3p curling iron its a different story. Great product definitively recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curler!  It is very easy to get beautiful curls!  I am no good at curlers or curling irons but this product is so easy to get professional looking curls.  The curls are beautiful and last more than a day!  I love how I can make waves with the big one and tight curls with the small!    Downside is WEAR the glove, I burned my hand when I did not wear it the glove helps!  Also I was sad that there was no instruction book, I think they need to include one in a new product as mine was!  That was my only complaint otherwise it was a 5 star product! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> this product came in great condition and very quickly.  we have enjoyed this product!</li>
    <li> Just got the herstyler today. Its really hard for me to change out the barrels, but otherwise it works great! I curled all my hair in less than 30 mins on the first setting. I&#x27;ve never had the patience to curl my hair with regular hair curlers so I really recommend this curler. It also helps to curl/work with hair when its dirty. Have fun!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this curler. I have attempted to curl my hair for years with other curling irons, and my hair never stayed curled and never curled the way I wanted it to with these other curlers. The herstyler gets very hot, which allows my hair to stay curled all day, and it even stays curled the next day after I have slept on it. There are two heat settings, and I only use the lowest setting (trying not to fry my hair)...and my hair still looks amazing. I have long hair so sometimes it is hard to fit it all on the curling stick, but after a little practice it is easy. And I would recommend wearing the heat resistant glove, because I got a pretty bad burn the first time I tried curling my hair without it. I definitely recommend this product...you can give your hair loose waves, long curls, and Taylor Swift curls if you use the thinnest attachment (it comes with three different attachment sizes). Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> When I recieved this item, the box was slightly damaged. However, the curling iron was just fine. I wasted $50 on this product because I dont know how to use it and there are no instructions. It is sitting in the drawer collecting dust!</li>
    <li> My thirteen year old daughter wanted this curling iron from a kiosk at the mall.  I found the same item on Amazon for literally hundreds less.  The curling iron at the mall retailed for [...].  It is exactly the same curling iron.  She loves it!  I saw a review before buying it that said the release button to change the sizes of the curling iron was difficult to push.  It is stiff but completely do-able.  I fully recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I paid almost $200 for this same 3 piece iron at a Herstyler kiosk in the mall during Christmas.  Boy was I ripped off on the price.  It included the glove but no stand.  It heats rapidly and curls fast and easy.  I love it.  I would also recommend the serum and spray, they are both great items also.</li>
    <li> This curling iron produces beautiful curls, that lasts for days, as other reviews have said. I have been using Bb Does It All spray as recommended by a couple gals on YouTube demoing this curler. Beware, you will receive a bad burn if you are not extremely careful where your aiming the tip of this curler. I have really long hair and burnt my shoulder and wrist my first time. The glove could be thicker, thinking about looking around for a better quality glove. If anybody knows of such a glove I would love to here from you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this curling iron it makes natural looking waves without making them hard or crispy. The curls are soft and last more than a day. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my sister and she loves it.  After using it just once she called me to say she had curl for days and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it again.  I love the fact that it has 3 barrel sizes so that she can alternate the style and so does she.</li>
    <li> I have been TRYING to do the taylor swift curls for over a year now and never been successful.  That is until this curling iron :)  I cannot describe how much  I utterly love it, it had me at the first curl!! Litterally 5 second for each curl, it stays in ALL DAY LONG!! Now I am that girl who HATES hairspray and with this I DONT NEED ANY!!!! AHHHHH BUY ITTTTT</li>
    <li> The iron works GREAT!  It gets very hot, but I can&#x27;t section my hair with the gloves on and always get burned without a glove.  I have a hard time getting my ends curled.  They need something like silicone fingertip covers... like the rubber finger covers quilters use (?rubber thimbles).  Also, I&#x27;m used to an iron with auto shut-off (turns off if it&#x27;s not being used for a while), so I find that I forget to turn it off way too often.</li>
    <li> This Herstyler 3p ceramic curler iron set is THE BEST I found so far.   I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I have tried many different curling irons.  I used it for a wedding Hairstyle Trial and I love the fact it features 3 sizes.   Plus, it&#x27;s fast and effective. I highly recommend it!!   Professional results in less time!!(Great Price)Thanx!</li>
    <li> I love to wear beachy waves in my hair and this iron set is absolutely perfect. Before I got this set, I was wrapping my hair around the outside of a cheap curling iron. This iron set really does make my hair look more shiney, smoother and the waves are more consistent. Interchanging the 3 different irons was a little bit tricky at first, but after doing it a couple times I have no problems. The glove it comes with is very useful, but do not forget that you still should take every precaution to NOT TOUCH this iron. Unless you can do your hair with oven mits on, do not expect a thin glove to totally protect you. I would have given this iron set 5 starts, however the first one I received stopped working after 5 minutes of use. This second one appears to work perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this curling iron for 3 years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I use it 2-3 times per month on average. Sometimes more if I have time. Still really pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about buying this product without having ever tried it, but I went out on a limb and I&#x27;m happy I did. Not only could it curl my thick, long hair that can almost never hold a curl, but also my friends hair that is incredibly fine. It heats up impeccably fast and curls fast also. At first its a little tough to switch the pieces but it gets easier the more you do it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t come with any guides so you may want to watch a video about how to use it on youtube. I would recommend this curling iron to anyone in search of the perfect curl.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gone a day without using this product since I brought it home - it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic for curling my clip-in extensions as well as my hair, SO easy to use, and the 3 separate barrels allow for a multitude of looks. The dealer I purchased through offers a LIFETIME full warranty (i paid a little more than average, and am happy to have done so as I have dealt with this company before and they stand by their warranty - they will fully replace no matter how old and for ANY reason). Love this - NO COMPLAINT!!! the perfect set of curling tongs!  btw - mine came with a glove but NOT with the holder. I&#x27;m ok with that, would rather have the glove! If you are buying a kit without the glove - FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, BUY THE GLOVE!!!  I couldn&#x27;t use the product without it.</li>
    <li> It burned my fingers a few times but that&#x27;s my own stupidity, but note that it does get a little close to your fingers to do it right.  Nicely made product.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and I must say that it works great. It heats up quickly and works well. The delivery was quick I received mine within two days which is a plus. I totally recommend it if you have hard to curl hair.</li>
    <li> Well, I must say that this product does its job: my hair curled and was still wavy the next day -- however, it was terribly terribly dry to the point of burned -- I bought this product because a saleperson in the mall stopped me and used a similar [but wayyy more expensive] product on my hair -- the curler she used did not burn my hair like this one did -- I would recommend being careful and trying it out on a inconspicuous piece of hair before you do your whole head.  My mom took this to her job and a coworker tried it out on several people and they said it worked great.    Some reviewers mentioned they had problems with switching the attachments, but I had no problem with this.      Also, be very careful, as others have said, this thing gets HOT and you WILL burn yourself with even the slightest slip-up.</li>
    <li> Great product... came NEW just like advertised...Told my hairdresser about the product and he would like to purchase some for his salon now..</li>
    <li> This curling iron is amazing.  It has a bit of a learning curve but the curls turn out beautifully with a little practice.  I&#x27;ve used all three barrel sizes on mine, my sister and my niece&#x27;s hair.  It makes our hair shiner and the curls last way longer then traditional curling irons.    My only complaint is the glove, a thicker material would work better.  The glove provided is essential but the heat still travels through it rather quickly and I have to avoid singeing my fingers.    I would recommend this to anyone that curls their hair.  It can give all sorts of different size curls and is very quick.  I&#x27;ve used it for loose curls and tight curls and they always look spectacular.    If you need help learning how to use it there are good tutorials on youtube.</li>
    <li> I almost payed $200 for this exact same set at the mall.  I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t!  I love it! It is easy to use and works great. I have naturally wavy hair, but it&#x27;s not consistant, there are some parts that are straighter, so I use the big one to touch up the top layer of my hair and anywhere else that needs it. It only takes me a few minutes, it looks geat and it stays for days. I highly reccomend it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months ago and it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I waited forever, litterally, for it to heat up, but my skin was hotter than it.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t heat up at all...I tried everything.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> This curling is great!  It makes great curls that hold.  It is a little weird to get use to at first but once you get the hang of it it is easy.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, be sure to wear the glove though cause it&#x27;s incredibly hot if it touches the skin. Besides that it works great!</li>
    <li> The Herstyler ceramic curling iron curls hair within seconds, but gets really hot and when I began using it, I burnt my skin on several occasions, even with using the glove. If I continue to use it, I&#x27;m sure the condition of my hair will be very poor, not mentioning the burns I&#x27;ve gotton so far!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as an alternative to the Enzo Milano which I couln&#x27;t justify spending that money.  I received this product very fast and was excited to use it.  Only problem, it didn&#x27;t get hot.  At all.  I had to take it apart and put it back together each time to get it to heat up.  Then when it would heat up it didn&#x27;t get hot.  I was \\&quot;Warm\\&quot; and that is an exaggeration.  I could put my whole hand around it and it didn&#x27;t even slight burn and would not curl my hair because it was practically cold.</li>
    <li> this is a realy good curling iron. i really like it but there  is one thing that i dont like about it and that is that it does not come with instructions. i didnt know how to use it at first so i had to look at videos ob youtube but oter than that this is a really good product. another thing that i like about its is that it heats up almost instantly which i really like and you dont have to leave your hair as long in the curling iron!</li>
    <li> My Daughters and I love it!!! I stink at curling hair but after only a little practice I was able to to do a good job with this product. There are NO instructions, so watching the YOUTUBE videos for herstyler products really helps!! I have waist length hair so I really liked the largest attachment. My daughter has a lot of layers so she found the smallest to work best for her. To switch the attachments, you have to squeeze both buttons and pull--not the easiest. This product does not come with a stand as shown in the picture but does have a little foot to lift it off the counter. We use silicone heat mats under it for extra protection on the counter. A word of caution USE THE GLOVE and be careful not to touch your skin with it!!! It gets super hot!!! My teenage daughter and I both got burned from from our arms touching it. I still think it is a great product just be careful--not for kids.</li>
    <li> This is a cool way to curl your hair.  The only thing that stinks is your hand gets hot even tho they give you a speical glove and the ends sometimes dont come out right.  Otherwise it was easy to use,  your hair doesnt get stuck on it and they have different size.</li>
    <li> Never was able to use my hair is normally easy to curl I use a Revlon 2&amp;#34; curls last all day but not with this.</li>
    <li> I paid $49.99 and got free Amazon Prime shipping.....this is one product I have bought from Amazon that is worth at least double that.  It heats IMMEDIATELY and the cord is EXTREMELY long, which is a huge plus.  The process of curling the hair couldn&#x27;t be easier, just twist, hold and let go.  Came packaged in a really cool tin tube with three interchangeable barrels and, even though the description said it wasn&#x27;t included, it even came with the heat resistant glove.  I&#x27;ve read reviews/seen them on YouTube of people saying you don&#x27;t need the glove but YOU DO!  You can buy them at your local Sally Beauty Supply for only $6 if yours doesn&#x27;t come with one.  It was a happy surprise that the package included one, what a value!  It&#x27;s like $50 for three curling irons and a glove.  BOTTOM LINE:  Just buy it.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this item but I&#x27;m glad I did.  I have never had much luck with using the regular clamp style curling irons, but I can actually make better curls with this one.  Also, I am African American with 4C hair, no relaxer and about 2 inches past my shoulders. After I flat iron my hair this makes beautiful, soft, longlasting curls.  I&#x27;m amazed and very pleased with my purchase.  P.S.  I&#x27;m especially pleased with the innovative design that gives you 3 different sizes in one iron, (mine didn&#x27;t come with the stand as pictured).  Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Herstyler 3P, where have you been my whole life?! I had previously tried curling irons, hot rollers, sponge rollers, velcro rollers  and to my dismay I struggled to get great looking curls or waves. With these curling rods, curls are now effortless! Each curl is perfect in 5 seconds and your look is done after 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this. I was worried about getting something like this on Amazon. It&#x27;s great quality. I have super straight hair, but it works so well on it. The curl actually holds. I like the different sizes.</li>
    <li> It did not last long!! Was very disappointed after a few months it doesn&#x27;t heat up anymore not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> Works great and is so much easier to use than a regular curling iron. I was never able to curl my hair before, but now I can quickly and easily. I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Bought the product two days ago. Went to use it this morning. The indicator light came on but it does not heat up. I haven&#x27;t even used it yet and it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> So sorry to give out a one star but it was one of my daughter&#x27;s main presents and she couldn&#x27;t wait to use it but it didn&#x27;t work and we had to send it back to get a refund. Still waiting on refund then I&#x27;ll need to place another order for a new one. I&#x27;m just not sure that I&#x27;ll be ordering the same curler. The packaging was impressive and the curler looked great if it had only worked.</li>
    <li> Great Curler, and I got it on time!! It works great. The only down side is that I wish it came with an instructional video, showing wha type of curls and how you can make the curler work in the way you want it to</li>
    <li> PURCHASED FOR THE WIFE AND SHE LOVES IT, SHE USES IT ALL THE TIME, AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT TOO.....</li>
    <li> The herstyler is amazing,exactly what I was looking for! The product was perfect, and was shipped right away, I got it within 3 days. Great!</li>
    <li> Got it right when it said it would be here and was in a nice container that neatly contained everything. I have long, straight hair.. so it&#x27;s super hard to keep the curl in all day. I had curly hair all day and even when I woke up it was still curly and really pretty. Yes I had to put some curling product in my hair when it was damp, but I didn&#x27;t need a lot for the curl to stay in. Also, I would suggest getting Heat Protection spray/gel to put in your hair when it&#x27;s damp. It will help protect your hair from the intense heat, which it is INTENSE. I wear a playful, going out during the day curl.. then I have a night, special occasion curl. It&#x27;s truly amazing and completely worth it!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product because the price was much less than a similar curling iron my sister had purchased at a kiosk in the mall. I must say that I was greatly impressed by the quality of this product and the timeliness of the delivery. My only complaint is that it did not come with directions so I had to go on YouTube to find out how to use it. But once we figured it out, both my daughter and I have used this product and WE LOVE IT! The curls last all day. We would highly recommend this product to anyone considering it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but you have to practice a lot!  you can get burned if you don&#x27;t know how to use it.  Once you got it, its very easy and fast, and you have a very cool look.</li>
    <li> So my niece went to vegas for a week and bouth an Amkia hair curler at the Herstyler kiosk. BIG MISTAKE. She comes back to our house and tells us that the middle barrel isn&#x27;t working. So, being her Uncle, I thougt I&#x27;d help her out and get her another one. First we called the Amika HQ in New York...No answer...? Suspicious. So naturally, we called Laura, who sold my niece the curling iron and assured her it was break-proof. Hah. After maybe hours of her telling us it&#x27;s not my fault-you bought it, and I&#x27;ll call back in 10 minutes (and never calling back) we asked her to get her manager. By now it was 3 days before my niece was to leave for South Africa. So we FINALLY reached the manager, Joe. He handled the problem with uncertainty at first, saying I don&#x27;t know what to tell you...blah..blah..blah. But when I stepped in and told him that my niece paid 157$ for a piece of you machinery that was defective, it&#x27;s your mistake and you should fix it. So finally, he apologized (HUZZAH!) and said he&#x27;d send this 3 piece curler instead of the Amika one she bought. It does work better, but seems to be not as high tech as the other one. Long story short, after a week of harrasing Joe (my niece had left by then) and making sure he would be honest and sent us back a new one instead of taking our money and running, he came through. I think this whole ordeal was about 2 or 3 weeks long and cut into my holiday time. I am not very pleased with Herstyler&#x27;s customer service and probabaly will make sure there&#x27;s one near our house if my daughter want to purchase one.   All in all, good product-terrible customer service.</li>
    <li> We found this curler at the mall for 150.00 dollars.  It did an amazing job.  The curls last longer than the ordinary curl produced by our other hot tool irons and other curling tools.  My daughter searched Amazon and found it for soooo much cheaper for around 30.oo dollars.  I couldnot beleive it.  We ordered it and it arrived between three days.  That was fast.  It works great and came brand new in the box with all the curl sizes choices as well.  We love it!! and we love shopping on here.</li>
    <li> love this iron.  comes with a glove but for some reason I didn&#x27;t see it in the description.  So I bought another brands glove.  so now I have 2.  I work in a salon and I am the 1st one there to get one of these and the other stylist who have tried mine want to purchase it too.  i really like the interchangeable size rods.</li>
    <li> This curler wand has changed my life. I burned myself a few times but you get the hang of it after a few tries. It comes with heat resistant glove that I no longer use.  I always use the large barrel but i like that they include 2 smaller ones. The curls in my hair last up to three days! I will probably never go back to clap curling irons again.</li>
    <li> MUST BUY!!!!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a clamp-less curling iron for a long time and I saw a video on this one on YouTube and I loved the way it looked on the girl&#x27;s hair. I ordered it immediately and what a great price! When I ordered it, I put it on two day shipping cause I wanted it right then. I didn&#x27;t realize how hot the curling rod actually got, wow. I have a few burns marks on my hand but it&#x27;s completely worth it. My curls are so beautiful and last for like 2 days... crazy! This curling iron is so easy to use and cuts my normal curling time in half. The price is also wonderful, too. It&#x27;s so LEGIT!   Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> This curing iron is amazing.  I have very thick long hair and find that curling my hair with a normal curling iron doesn&#x27;t allow the curls to stay all day.  This curling iron not only curls fast but my curls last all day.</li>
    <li> When this curling iron arrived, it was missing one of the rods.  Unfortunately, the company would not just send the missing piece.  I had to return it, and then reorder it on Amazon.  I wish all exchanges/returns could be done through Amazon because that would be so much easier.  Having said that, my daughter absolutely loves this curling iron!  Many of her  friends have ordered it after seeing how nice it curls her hair.</li>
    <li> Curls will last forever! Purchased for each of my three daughters.</li>
    <li> love love love this product. use it all the time it gets super hot and works great on any hair type. only complaint it that it takes quiet a while to be shipped. but over all great product also heat resistant glove does nothing.</li>
    <li> This is one very nice and hot iron. I shouldn&#x27;t say one because it comes with 3 barrels in all. When I say it gets hot I mean really hot and I&#x27;ve only had it on the first setting I can&#x27;t imagine setting it on the highest setting. The first day I got it I began playing with it. I&#x27;m not used to curling my hair as I have not done it for many years. Anyway out of the box it heats up within 60 seconds. Being a bit unorganized it took me a few times to figure out the direction to curl my hair. Because of this I do wish the set came with some minor instructions. I looked it up on youtube and watched videos on how to use the iron correctly. In the mall this set sells for 250.00, I got it on Amazon for 58.00. I think I got a fantastic deal on a great set and very happy with my purchase. I recommend this to anyone not wanting to get a perm. After watching the videos it only took me minutes to do my hair and I have very long hair.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine and straight hair.  Usually, after using a curling iron, my hair is straight again in a matter of hours.  This is the only curling iron that has ever worked for me.  The curls stay in for days.  It comes with a glove because the rod gets so hot, which was hard to use at first, but now I use it so often I don&#x27;t need the glove anymore.  I only use the largest attachment because the smaller ones make curls that are too tight.  The largest one creates perfect curls/waves in my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this! I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the actual product, for only 50$, but i figured I would give it a shot. 3 different size curling irons is worth that! It keeps my hair curly for days! With a little hairspray, I love the medium sized one the most but I&#x27;m sure once my hair gets a little longer I will be using all three. Worth the money, youwould pay about 20 per curling iron at walmart! I will update if I run into any problems but I think it&#x27;s going to work out just fine! The only reason I gave 4 and not 5 is because it came with no instructions and I&#x27;m not completely sure if 1 or 2 is the high setting for heat :) guess I could google it.</li>
    <li> It works great, however the description is wrong.  It DOES come with a glove.  Dont&#x27; make the mistake I did an buy another one seperately.  There are lots of videos on youtube to show you how to use it.</li>
    <li> The item itself was good.  However, it only came with two of the three curling wands, so we have to return it or get the missing wand.</li>
    <li> I received mine a couple hours ago . the Led light came on but the wand never heated. i even tried changing the barrels ...  let it sit on for about 45 minutes . It never heated . not even a little bit. I know Herstyler to be an awesome brand , i&#x27;m a stylist and i&#x27;ve got a flat iron from them that i&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon and use every day for about two years now. I&#x27;ll be sending it back ASAP. i&#x27;m veryyy dissapointed . :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair that NEVER NEVER EVER holds a style, much less a curl for more than an hour. I have tried curlers, pin curls, curling irons (always with the \\&quot;hook\\&quot; at the end of the curl), you name it. I found this on YouTube by accident and thought for the price, it looked like it was worth a shot. All I can say is WOW-for the first time in my life I am able to not only curl my own hair quickly and easily, it HOLDS ALL DAY WITH NO PRODUCT IN MY HAIR. I do not know why, but I do know that others that have spend a lot more on other brands have had disappointing results even though the models were almost identical. I love the different barrels, but tend to use the largest barrel the most. It gives my hair big, soft, glamorous curls. Everyone in my office has ordered this, and it was money WELL spent. You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this!</li>
    <li> Awesome and not expensive  . Curls come out perfect and I love how you can change the barrel easily for different sized curls</li>
    <li> The Herstyler 3P does a great job curling my hair and produces soft curls that can stand alone or be blended into other hair.  However, I do miss having a clip to hold my hair and the glove that was included is not really heat resistant.  Although I have not burned my hand, I have learned to quickly gather my hair and curl it.  Also the heat register does not seem to be any different at 1 or 2.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been watching this product for months. After reading all the reviews I decided to go ahead and make the purchase and I love it. My curls last for at least 2-3 days before needing a retouch. And the cost is just amazing. I see them retail for $150 in my local mall so I know I got a great deal.</li>
    <li> I have shouder length hair super straight hair.  The Larger barrels do not bend it.  Small barrel curls it better than ANY curling iron I&#x27;ve ever tried, but very tight curls, not the loose waves I envisioned.   My daughter, with her longer hair, uses the bigger barrels, and it does a great job, making loose waves.   And very quick.  THAT&#x27;s the best thing--speed.  Neither of our curls really last into the next day.  Our barrels change fine.  Overall- best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned, but not as great as I imagined.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: After a few years of amazing service, zero issues, and a few burns, I lost my iron to the hell that is dance competition dressing rooms. It got tossed in the trash because of the odd container being mistaken for food. I didn&#x27;t think twice about ordering the same one over again--It&#x27;s consistently been amazing, the three sizes are handy and versatile, and everyone who uses it says it&#x27;s the best one they&#x27;ve tried. This time, it came in a nicer but less compact gift type box which I don&#x27;t mind, but will have to find a way to pack it (the tin cylinder was so suitcase convenient). Everything from my original review below still stands. My favorite beauty product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced this thing was made by aliens. That is the only explanation I could come up with as to why this curler differs so much from every other curler I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;first is the obvious design difference from a regular iron- no clampy thing! This did prove tricky at first, and I&#x27;ve burned my self pretty well a handful of times, but it&#x27;s my fault for not wearing the included glove. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the wrapping action, but it seems to me like this iron makes a curl A LOT quicker than a normal iron(typical iron for me was about twenty seconds a curl, this guy does it in about 6).&lt;br /&gt;Second is the fact that this is the ONLY curler that has managed to give me a lasting curl. I have typical &amp;#34;asian&amp;#34; straight hair that hates to do anything but be flat. I&#x27;m used to spending tons of time curling my hair only to have it fall flat within hours regardless of hairspray, mouse, and other product use. With the Herstyler, the curls literally last until I wash them out, even if it&#x27;s three days later WITHOUT using any products, not even hairspray. The curls are gorgeous and manageable, you can comb right through them and they still stay.&lt;br /&gt;Third, I LOVE that there are 3 interchangeable sizes. Each gives a unique size and texture which makes it easy to change up your look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely recommend!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!!!!!!! i get the girls i love., works best with hairspray and touch of gel, it&#x27;s a great deal, the only annoying thing is i have a small counter and the it has to be perfectly places on its stand or it will fall over</li>
    <li> I love my Herstyler.  This curling iron gives the perfect beach waves.  At first I did burn myself a few times but after getting the hang of it I don&#x27;t have any problems.  I truly believe that I will never go back to a curling iron with a handle.  I&#x27;m always out there looking for a new beauty product and I have found a good one in Herstyler. Love! Love! Love!</li>
    <li> I only have one issue with this product, it is very hard to switch sizes. I have to have my husband do it for me. It is not an easy click in, pop out method, but once I have the right size in I have no complaints what so ever.</li>
    <li> I saw a girl on you tube curl her hair with this product and I wanted to have it ever since. I ordered it on Friday, and it was at my house yesterday, Monday. I immediately opened the package and started to curl my hair. I have THE THICKEST hair ever! Also its below my mid back, and really straight. Usually I would spend about an hour and a half curling my hair with a traditional curling iron, and about an hour later it would be flat and straight. I CURLED MY HAIR IN 20-MINUTES WITH THE HERSTYLER!!!! and it looks soooo goooooddddd! It also holds the curl in for a long period of time, which is great because i don&#x27;t look like i just got out of the pool after doing my hair with the other iron. Fantastic product!    I recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have time to lolly gag in the morning about their hair and want results that last all day long. Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Pros: This product is great for ethnic hair.  I&#x27;m African w/ thick, medium course hair that goes to my mid-back.  The level of heat is strong enough to maintain my curls for the entire day.  (I use the higer setting #2, but level #1 is very hot as well, you probably should use level #1 if you have finer or thinner hair) Also, as the days pass, my curls get from tight-to loose-to wavy...which is great because I don&#x27;t have to touch up w/ heat like I used to w/ a regular curing iron. Since the wand gets pretty hot, I would strongly recommend usinig a heat protectant on your entire hair before using the wand. The wand attachments are ceramic, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your hair burning or frying if left too long on the wands.    Cons: The cons I would say is that there is no instruction booklet explaining how to detach the barrels and what are the range of heat w/ the two heat settings (setting 1 &amp; 2).  To find a tutorial on how to use the product, just go to youtube and search for Herstyler Wand Tutorials...that&#x27;s what I did...and I&#x27;m real comfortable to use this product now :-))  Also, this may just be me, but I feel the heat protectant glove does not really protect from heat as much as I would expect.  If you were the glove, you still can&#x27;t place your fingers on the barrel for more than just a few seconds.  Personally, I don&#x27;t use the glove, due to it limiting my control on the amount of hair I want to seperate and curl.  So if you choose not to wear the glove like I do, PLEASE make sure you are extra careful not to burn your wrist and arm as you&#x27;re curling your hair...it&#x27;s much easier to do then you think because the wand barrel is long...even a short time touching your skin can cause a serious burn!!!  Risk of burning your arm/wrist seems to be much greater when you&#x27;re tryinig to curl the hair at the back of your head.    Aside from that...this product is wonderful, I give a honest 5/5!  I don&#x27;t plan on using any of my metal-plated curling irons again!  Theshipper is pretty reliable.  I recived my product on a timely manner and the product arrived undamaged.  I&#x27;ve tested all three wands attachments and they all provide me with high level of heat and curl.    Also, the price online approx $54 (before shipping) is a much better deal then at the stands in the mall ($150 -$180 depending on how much of a \\&quot;discount\\&quot; the salesperson wants to give you).  If you are a stickler on price, then I strongly recomm getting the product at Amazon...Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. I got it 2 days after i ordered but it kept saying it will come in 19 days - really happy. It comes in this heat resistant tin canister so you can put it away if its still hot. When i curled my hair I was surprised how I could feel heat. the glove DOES  come with product so don&#x27;t order a different one. I loved how it curled and am very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This curling iron is a great product, the first time Isaw it was at the mall, I like it an got me one then looking around I saw this other piece, since I had seen a demostration at the mall, I did not hesitate and order it, very good price, shipping and product, love it I recomend it.</li>
    <li> It comes with a glove!  Wish it had told me that when I bought mine, so that I would not have wasted money on some. Love the curler the small rod is perfect for my 8 year olds hair.</li>
    <li> Whenever I see the kiosks in the mall and people trying to sell these, I want to tell them they can save $250 and buy from Amazon.  :)  Love this curling iron!  I have one of my own and just bought a 2nd for my sister.  I have long thick hair and this holds my curl without product.</li>
    <li> The herstyler curls my hair better than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried. I can use it and still have waves the next day. With other products, my hair hasn&#x27;t lasted longer than 4 hours. I&#x27;ve also used a CHI, Solia, hot rollers, and a couple of different Revlon curling irons. The herstyler heats up very quickly and I recommend it every chance I get!</li>
    <li> My hair does NOT hold a curl very easily. But with the herstyler it&#x27;s soo simple! I have really long, thick hair and it only takes about 20-30 minutes to curl my hair and it&#x27;s perfect curls! and it lasts 2-3 days!! i absolutely love it and i highly recommend it, especially if you think you hair won&#x27;t curl!</li>
    <li> I use this on occasions on my daughter&#x27;s medium length hair and the medium size barrel gives her super beautiful curls that can last more than one day. The curls are soft and long. But when I try using it on my own hair, for some reason it is almost impossible to create the same curls. My hair has an unruly wave/curl and is coarse. My daughter&#x27;s is pretty much straight, not too thick and not too thin, with a very slight wave that only forms around her face. I don&#x27;t know if hair texture may be the reason for the trouble I have curling my hair or if it&#x27;s just managing/using the iron on myself. Oh and the barrel at the highest setting BURNS! It gets super hot; I burned my arm trying to achieve the same curls on myself as the ones I can create on my daughter. I may just need more practice using it on myself.</li>
    <li> let me start off by saying i am completely pleased with this product. ever since i was little my hair was very hard to curl, and when i could get a curl in it, my hair never hold the curl for more than an hour. the curls i get with the herstyler last longer than the curls i got with my hair straightener, so i am very impressed. i&#x27;m also very happy with the service. i received my curling wand three days before the estimated delivery date, and i was dying to get this thing, so that made me a very happy girl. i love this compared to other curling wands because of the three different sized attachments. they&#x27;re not hard to change at all (i was worried about that aspect after reading some other reviews, but i haven&#x27;t had any problems with mine).&lt;br /&gt;basically, this is a very good deal, this is an amazing curling wand at an amazing price. i&#x27;m extremely happy with mine.</li>
    <li> This seller was bar far the most courteous i have ever dealt with. I will absolutely so business with them again!</li>
    <li> this is a&lt;br /&gt;mazing !</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZINGG!!! I LOVE IT. IT WORKS WELL WITH MY HAIR I DO SOMETIMES HAVE TO PUT PINS IN MY HAIR SO IT WILL COME OUT NICE ND CURLY BUT I DEFF DNT REGRET BUYINGG IT YAYY ME!:D</li>
    <li> my mom seems to really like this, she uses it often and i havent heard a complaint. and she likes that it came with a protective glove, i gave it a 4 cause i havent actually tried it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does exactly what it is intended to do, HOWEVER, for all the potential buyers, please beware that this product gets extremely HOT, and any contact with the skin will result in  bruising/burning, in the event that it does put aloe vera (directly from the plant, not gel) on it the affected area immediately. But once get the hang of this tool, you&#x27;ll be fine and will love it just as much as I do.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve had this wand.  The actual wand is great, love the curls it gets.  However you cannot travel with them.  My first one I had for a few years and then it completely broke when I put it in my suitcase.  So, I bought a new one in December.  Now I just traveled with it again and yup completely broken.</li>
    <li> When I got the tin can I thought, what a cute way to package this product! WRONG! I think someone screwed up because I got 4 attachments instead of 3, which meant that I literally had to saw the tube to get anything out. It took me OVER AN HOUR to remove the wand and attachments from this stupid tin tube! I was angry, until I used the herstyler...    It is an AMAZING curling wand. My hair is stick straight and silky smooth and never holds curls for more than a couple of hours, and these curls (plus some heavy duty hair spray) stay. I even had a full head of curly hair the entire next day, which never happens with a regular curling iron. It&#x27;s easy to use and I am an idiot when it comes to doing anything with my hair. This is a great investment, as soon as you can get it out of the tin!</li>
    <li> The Her Styler works so well. I have thick coarse curly hair and this tool smooths out and perfects my natural curl. And there&#x27;s 3 dofferent sizes for a tighter to loose curl. Whichever you&#x27;re feeling that day.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! although it makes my hair super frizzy  i have thick shoulder length hair  but i have only used it one time so far hopefully i can find some products to reduce the frizzys.... if anyone knows of anything to use let me know please</li>
    <li> My daughter has used each of the different heads. She just loves it. The u-tube video on how to change the heads easier helped. Great birthday gift, just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> I love the Herstyler 3p.  My hair is long, fine, and has never held curl well, but with the Herstyler and a touch of hairspray, it has held nice, smooth curls all day.  I used the largest barrel option, and was impressed with how quick and easy it was.  Definitely use the glove, because it gets extremely hot, even on the low setting!</li>
    <li> I will admit that I wasn&#x27;t sure if this could be true but it is. My hair is super fine and always straight... can&#x27;t hold curl at all. I tried this the other day before going to my girls night and surprising the curl lasted all day and night despite the fact that it was extremely windy outside all day and that I went dancing in really hot and crowded clubs that night. I woke up the next morning to find that the curls were STILL in. granted that weren&#x27;t as good as when I first put them in (obviously I had slept on them) but they still looked really good. I am soooo happy I bought this product, now I can actually have curls and not worry about how long they&#x27;ll stay in :) LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love Herstylers! I do theatre and my hair is a pain in the behind to curl, but this curling iron actually gets good results in a fraction of the time it takes to get nice results without my hair falling straight! I was amazed that the curls would stay for about 2 days or until you wash your hair! This product is a must have for anyone with hard to curl hair plus you don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray to get the curls to stay for a day!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters.  They both love it, and use it regularly.  They especially love the changeable barrels for different sized curls.</li>
    <li> I found it very difficult to use. Having to wear a glove to wrap your hair around the barrel very awkward. I returned the item. This is my first ever return to anythng from Amazon. Handled very quickly.</li>
    <li> This iron is fantastic.  The curls that form from it are natural and fast forming.  The barrels are a big difficult to change out, but I don&#x27;t change them often and prefer that they are snug (wouldn&#x27;t want a hot iron to fall on me!).</li>
    <li> Did not like it the curls were not that great  and it gets VERY hot i burned myself serveral times  and the glove doesn&#x27;t really protect my hand.</li>
    <li> So, I was looking for something easy to use without having a zillion curling irons all over my vanity.  If you&#x27;re looking for that sort of thing, this is for you!  I do have to say it&#x27;s kinda ackward to use and if you \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; touch yourself with it, be prepare to have a burn from H-E-double hockey sticks and a scar afterwords to match.  I would recommend however, speaking from experience, to wear long sleeves for the first couple of uses!!  Once you get enough practive though, or con a friend into helping, it really works well.  The glove that comes with it really does help with not burning your hands or fingers while curling your hair - it&#x27;s just not long enough to pull up your arm to protect it.      I would recommend (and have) this to anyone.  Happy Curling!!  :)</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good...but it didn&#x27;t curl my hair like I expected it would! I have only heard marvelous things about this product so I decided that if it could work on mostly everyone&#x27;s hair...it could work on mine! Well it curled pretty good for about thirty minutes then it fell! I heard many people say that their hair stayed curled ALL DAY LONG when they used this curling iron and I used this curling iron and a pound of hairspray and it still fell! :( I have very stubborn hair so it could work for people who don&#x27;t have \\&quot;baby fine\\&quot; hair like I do! It is a nice, good quality product but it didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got this, all of my friends had nothing but good to say about it.  I used it once, then the next time I tried to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t work.  I am in the process of returning it and will probably purchase another one in hopes that I just ended up with a lemon.  It was pretty dissappointing, but I&#x27;m really hoping I get a new one that will actually keep working.  I&#x27;m just upset because it&#x27;s not as cheap as when I bought it the first time.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for her 12th birthday and loves it!  It holds the curls all day long.  A friend of hers bought a $150 curling iron and it&#x27;s not as good as this one.  I would highly recommend this curling iron!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed, I knew how good the item was as a friend of mine has it.  Went to a shopping centre in London, found a similar one for £150, so went with this one.  The best aspect of this transaction was the speed at which it was delivered.  Given that it was being shipped from the US and I live in the UK - I am more than impressed!!! Recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good iron it heats up really well and it curls my hair really nice especially the thin wand!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a cheap nice curling iron. All of the reviews were amazing except a few. Finally my Herstlyer comes after two days of excitement and waiting.  I plug the curling iron in and come back 5 minutes later.I touch it, no heat AT ALL. Ten minutes later I come back still NO HEAT. I take the iron and plug it into 3 more outlets and even go to a different house to plug it in. Nothing works! Even when i tried to change the 3 heads still nothing works. SO DISAPOINTED! I can not believe I recommended this to my friend, I hope hers works! The same night I went onto Amazon to return this. Now, I can only get a refund even though I did NOTHING to break it and I did NOTHING at all they will not even let me exchange it! I went on at 9:25 and it says the UPS man will come not tomorrow but the next day because I didn&#x27;t file my complaint by 9:00! WHAT THE HECK! SO MAD! This might be a good product but it did not work for me, only a hassle!</li>
    <li> Great Styler! I bought this about a month ago. When I got it, I took it out of the box and tried it. I got super discouraged after two strands and put it back in the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I decided to give it another try. My hair looks AMAZING! This was only my second time trying it and it came out great, I love it! I didn&#x27;t use the glove, because it makes it kind of difficult to my hair. The glove is just a regular knit glove, not heat resistant or anything special. I did burn myself a couple of times, but I just have to learn how to maneuver around it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair falls below my shoulder, just above the back of my bra strap and I used the mid-sized barrel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it takes some getting used to, and I&#x27;m sure the more I use it the faster I&#x27;ll get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light, and kind feels like it&#x27;s cheap, but it did the job, we&#x27;ll see how it goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed my curling wand...it makes beautiful waves and curls....easy to use and fast! I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I got the product very fast, however the LED light was on but it did not heat up. I was very disappointed since I needed this product for an event. I am in the process of buying a new one to see if I get better luck.</li>
    <li> It curls perfectly , I love my curling styler soo much . I totally recommend this item !&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll fall inlove , I promise*</li>
    <li> Completely obsessed. Whenever I received this in the mail, I was a bit wary because of lack of CLEAR heat settings (you can only adjust the heat to high and low) and lack of an instruction manual. But, those are my only cons for this product. I didn&#x27;t even need the instruction manual, its pretty self explanatory. It heats up really quickly and stays hot during the time you use it. Typically, with other curling irons in the price range, they don&#x27;t get as hot and it takes forever to curl my hair. But,It was a breeze with this curler! The extension cord isn&#x27;t freakishly short, which makes it easy to use (not, too long either.) I would say, if you really need instructions, look up some demos of this curler on youtube. Other than that, this was 40 dollars well spent !</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and can&#x27;t believe how many compliments i get when i use this to curl my hair.  I bought two curling irons when i got this because i was scared of having to use the glove.  i used the other iron once when it came first and haven&#x27;t even looked at it since this came. i have never used the smaller barrels, but love the option.  I would recommend this product to ANYONE and say don&#x27;t be scared of the glove method, its way easier after getting used to it!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for for my wife. Transition was great. Wish all things were this easy and simple. Thanks</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use heat often but I must say nothing would ever hold its curl in my fine hair. Until... I tried this wand. If your life Iling for lasted nag curls either various sizes this is defiantly a great buy. Nice price too!</li>
    <li> I love the wand curler although packaging was horrible. The can was bent and the box falling to peices! But over all Iike the wand and excited to use it.</li>
    <li> Bought this yrs ago and they still get hot and does what I need it to do!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and your curls will look like it came out of a magazine. Love and recommend this product. My teenage daughter loves to use it and always gets compliments as the curls are flawless. Great investment.</li>
    <li> Great product great price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have lots of patients, but this does a great job! And the curls surprising last very long time, even without other hair products! I had to say this takes practice to master, but once you got it, is amazing. I get really long hair that pass my lower back, so if I put the effort to curl my hair, I want it really hold out. And this does. The curls looks really amazing, and I&#x27;m able to have the curls to hold by itself for 2-3 days (without hair product). My friend who&#x27;s a blonde loves it, and tried on me that it works! I&#x27;m Asian and Asian hair generally balance back to straight in no time, but my curls holds for at least 2 days. I love this curler! I actually left it at a hotel when I was traveling... then after a few months, realized I seriously love it so much that I had to replace it! And I&#x27;m really happy I did get it again, for it works wonders!  (btw, it comes with the heat resistant glove inside the metal can, so don&#x27;t buy extra!)</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter as it was a must have.  The product could have been shipped better to protect the storing tin that the curler comes in.  Not sure on the quality etc as this is a gift and she will not be opening it until Christmas Day.</li>
    <li> The curler is perfect! It gets super hot and makes really nice curls but make sure to Youtube a HOW TO USE VIDEO or something. I didnt turn it upside down when I used it at first and I burnt my arm pretty badly. Its been about 2 months and I still have a red mark, hopefully it will heal with time but other than that I think the curler is great! I was just being dumb!</li>
    <li> This was perfect! works great and was well worth the money</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, and leaves curls great for someone who has short hair! (: love all 3 sizes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen my girlfriend love anything (except *maybe* me) more than this curling wand. She will not stop talking about it, and now all of her girl friends want one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, listen up, this product is our secret weapon when it comes to buying our girlfriends gifts. Definitely recommended, it couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
    <li> This item does not work for long.  I&#x27;ve used it less than five times and the two larger wands no longer work.  Since I&#x27;m past 30 days, Amazon referred me to the manufacturer to pursue a replacement. What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because this product was reccommended to me by my niece and It performs just the way she said they would and even better. I love this product and will recommemed it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to take apart, put together, easy to use, and heats up quickly. And you get effortless curls :)</li>
    <li> Every girl needs this curling iron. It only took me a few minutes to get the hang of this curling wand. I use the largest barrel size for long waves, and I love it. It heats up really quickly and stays hot. Also, the power button slides, so you can&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while you&#x27;re using it. I highly recommend this item. Also, i used it to do my mom and sister&#x27;s hair, and it&#x27;s super easy to use on other people. Lastly, it takes me half the time to do my hair now, and the curls stay! Totally a keeper.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. It works really well and you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love!!! Finally got the curls I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;I tried a regular curling iron before this and the curls didn&#x27;t hold. I love this wand</li>
    <li> It works faster and curl stays in my hair much longer than a regular curling iron.  Glad I got it!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Does not pull my hair and it leaves great results.  I highly recommend this product.  And leaves a great shine</li>
    <li> Good price; good product!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in the time the seller specified &amp; product was as described.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and thin and this product is fantastic! No gel/mousse needed - just a dab of hairspray.</li>
    <li> Its amazing! I love it so much because its so fast. it does each curl in like 3 seconds. So high quality and good prize. recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> This product is EVERYTHING and more! Sorry I am like 7 months late on posting it but its just does wonders for your hair!! BUY it!!!</li>
    <li> If I could give it a a zero I would. Not for ethnic people at all. if you have fine thin hair you&#x27;ll love it. It shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as a product for all types of hair because it doesn&#x27;t work for ALL types of hair. Save your money! Get a higher voltage ceramic tool.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter said it works great.  The curls are lasting all day. She has been very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> The best wand curler I&#x27;ve ever owned. Gets very hot, curls in seconds and I love it. Amaze balls !!!</li>
    <li> Great hair tongs, does heat up well and the my hair will stay curled all day,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a total beauty queen but i will make an effort, try new things snd pur some time in. i have been curling my hair on and off for 10 years so know how to use a tong.  However I did find them very complicated to use- the glove helps but they are tricky to get the hair in to the right position and it easily slips off without a clamp.&lt;br /&gt;I have also burnt my neck with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that they take a lot of practice for you to work them properly. I have gone back to my old babylis pair with the clamp as I haven&#x27;t managed to get the right technique and in the morning I don&#x27;t have the time persist.  I do have a friend who&#x27;s much better at this and LOVES them.</li>
    <li> I love this curling rod set! The rods interchange easily! One thing that isn&#x27;t noted is that the set comes with a glove.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and this is what she has to say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes it; her curls stay put for a long time and leaves her hair very soft. The first couple of times she burnt her finger but then she managed to work around it.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact brand rod back in 2008 from my local mall for about 200 dollars with a 100 dollar discount. I used it for 4 plus years and so did my sisters, mom, and friends. It worked best out of all of theirs. The middle sized rod which we all used stopped working and I was so bummed but finding it on Amazon for 38 dollars is truly a steal. I have another rod that does not work nearly as good as this one and being able to change the temperature is hair changing. ha</li>
    <li> I really love this curling wand they work so good I have no regrets on buying this wand it was a good price and the cuality is really good am really happy with my purchace</li>
    <li> I bought  this after seeing it at the mall kiosk for $200 dollars! my daughter is in loooove with it and uses it every day. Each of the 3 sizes create a different look for her. Great product.</li>
    <li> Shipped much quicker than expected (only took 2 days standard shipping) came with a heat resistant glove to protect hand from burns, heated up great/evenly within 2 minutes and curled my hair very easily. (I have really fine hair/ not a lot of it so I tried the medium sized wand and it was perfect). Everytime I&#x27;ve used it my curls have lasted all day/night with no issues. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine bought a more expensive version of this \\&quot;no clip\\&quot; iron from a kiosk at the mall.  She loves it and her daughter&#x27;s hair always looks fantastic.  Unfortunately this product did not work for me at all.  I have natural wave in my hair and curling irons work well for me so I was surprised that this one left no curl at all.  I know better . . you get what you pay for. In my opinion, don&#x27;t waster your time or money with this iron.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money!!  SUPER EASY and FAST!!  This is the only thing that I have found so far that will curl both of my daughters&#x27; hair and that LASTS ALL DAY!!!  Recently used it for a Beauty Pageant and everyone there was asking how I did their hair.  It was perfect!!</li>
    <li> I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS! Already did actually,&lt;br /&gt;i was bummed however that i bought the glove separate cuz it didn&#x27;t specify that it contained a glove.&lt;br /&gt;low and behold a glove came with and now we have two. I guess i shouldn&#x27;t complain too much my daughter actually wears both when doing her hair and well if she ever loses one we still have a back up.&lt;br /&gt;SUPER PLEASED OTHERWISE....my daughter used all sizes and her hair always came out amazing!</li>
    <li> Honestly I bough this thinking it would work but sadly the wand wont even heat up&lt;br /&gt;causing the curls to not stay on I tried everything at first I thought it would be my hair because its straight but than my friend did my hair with her wand it the curls lasted all day perfect wand &amp;#62;:( I wounder if amazon offers REFUND &amp; they can keep the wand it doesn&#x27;t even work!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! I love the curls the it gives my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! And the price is great, compared to what it sells for from other sites. I have very long wavey/curly hair &amp; wanted to be able to enhance the curl. This product is very easy to use.  Simply section off your hair &amp; wrap the sections of hair around the curling rod, starting at the crown all the way to the end.  You must use the thermal glove, in order not to burn your hand &amp; do this correctly. Although this is a time consuming process, it is worth it, as the curls last for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. The price was great and I was surprised at how fast I received it. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever owned - it heats up very quickly, the barrels are easy to switch for changing the curl size, and the curls come out beautiful after only a few seconds.  The glove is not so great, it is better than nothing, but you can&#x27;t really use that hand for anything but holding the curl because it is bulky, and if it gets damp the glove will not work.  I would recommend this curling iron!</li>
    <li> I just received it today &amp; I had to use it right away on my hair. It was amazing would recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> works perfect, makes great curls, gets hot fast, watch your fingers thoe dont get burnt. definetly would recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron! Stays hot, easy to change barrels and a great price</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really fine blond hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well to being tamed.  It won&#x27;t be straightened and when I try to curl it, it falls within an hour.  Somehow this curling iron manages to curl my hair in a way that will stay all day.  The curls last until I wash my hair which is a result I&#x27;ve never been able to manage with any other tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it takes a little while to learn - it comes with a glove, but it&#x27;s too hard to use while wearing the glove, so I&#x27;ve had to get used to using it with my bare hands.  I&#x27;ve had a few good burns both on my hands and neck - it gets really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the medium and large barrels - the small barrel winds my hair so small and tight it looks bizarre.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product from a girl on Youtube. Her hair curled within seconds and when I tried it, it was TRUE &#x3D;) The 3 pieces are amazing!  It has two heat settings. 1 and 2. I use it on 1 and my hair is super long and thick so I wouldnt suggest you set it to 2. The barrel is long so all your hair will fit on it(another reason why I bought this too) The dislikes on this product is the stand. It tends to get stuck on my roots when I curl my hair and it tugs my curl out.  I still give this product 5/5 &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is such a fun way to curl your hair.  It took a little while to get the hang of it, but after I figured it out I can have nice soft waves or tight curls in a matter of no time.  This product is great quality and just super fun.  You will love it.</li>
    <li> The iron works pretty good. The one thing that I do not like is that it tells you in the description that the digital display tells you what temp the iron is at, well thats a lie, there is no digital display only off,1,and 2. Just thought I would share that with those of you who might think that it is like the remington iron which actually really does have a digital display.</li>
    <li> I had a difficult time using this iron without burning myself severly, It singed my hair even on low setting. My hair is fine &amp; it definantely is not a good idea to get this for fine hair. Maybe if I had someone doing my hair it would have been easier but doing it myself I found it too difficult to operate without the clamp to hold the hair!</li>
    <li> Loved how I got this product for a great price, the curls it gives you are amazing. The shipping was very fast. The only negative I have experienced is once in a while when I switch the barrels and one or the other wont heat up. I usually have to remove it and put it back on or push on it a little harder then it starts heating up. However, I still love it. Thats a compromise I&#x27;m willing to make especially with the price compared to others.</li>
    <li> Love it, my new favorite styling tool.  Still getting used to using it but get compliments on my curls all the time.</li>
    <li> Very misleading...&amp;#34;Herstyler 3P CERAMIC...&amp;#34; The barrels are actually coated with Teflon which will eventually strip off. Going right back! Very deceptive advertising.</li>
    <li> Love this product works wonderful I always use it such a good price too !!! A must have for a girl !!</li>
    <li> so so cheap. I use to work for one of the kiosks in the mall for this brand and this was I think like $300. This price is a steal, plus you get 3 different types of curls out of it.</li>
    <li> Love my Curler.  I have had it over a year and it still works amazing! Great product.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Does not curl as well as promised. Does not heat up high enough to get a curl hated it. I wish I could return it&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I actually like this product, gave me good curls. I would totally recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Did not turn on!! Went to the mall and bought an ikonic!! I get one year of them curling my hair for free and I took one home for 95.00 but at least I know it works!!</li>
    <li> Took forever to heat up at first. My daughter was freaking out cause she was doing her hair for a dance, but it finally heated up after about 3-4 minutes. Got really hot too, so we were relieved.</li>
    <li> i first came across the herstyler wand at a kiosk in the mall about 4 years ago and when they curled it they sprayed water on it and it didnt come out and pulled on it and everything didnt come. i didnt wash for a week to see if it would really stay in...and it did. and it probably would have stayed in longer if i didnt wash it after a week. I found this a few months ago and purhcased it and i curled my hair and an hour later all the curls fell. i was so disappointed and then i noticed my box says Teflon with negative ion technology...this is not what it says. It says tourmaline. i wanted tourmaline. but i did not get it. I might return it</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Comes in an awesome box to store it AND the three different sizes!  The curls last for DAYS!!  Absolutely more than I could have ever asked for.  Great price too!  FABULOUS!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Easy and fun to use!!  You can make a variety of curls with this curler... from tight to loose!  Stays in all day, you can even sleep on the curls and they last.  I&#x27;ve tested it on hair that has trouble curling with a regular iron and it worked fine!!  I highly rec. this product!!</li>
    <li> I have the kind of hair that holds a curl for a grand total of 5 minutes.  I bought this on whim and crossed my fingers it would work.  This curler takes more time (have to get used to the glove and learn how to form a nice ringlet) but it really really works.  My hair will hold the curl for over a day.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love my 3P, but more importantly I love that I bought it for less than half the asking price! It curls very nicely. I have thin hair so I don&#x27;t need to hold the wand for super long. The curls held well into the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only drawbacks were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I dislike the flimsy glove it came with. (Not the seller&#x27;s problem, but Herstyler could send a nicer glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The package came on time, but the can was just rolling around a big box. The seller should have used more bubble wrap to prevent that from happening. Luckily my wands were safe, but the can was a bit dented because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 4 stars for great price and quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;-Minus one for the way it came packaged</li>
    <li> I choose this rate because this is a very good product and is the only one that curls my hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this Herstyler - 3P because my previous curler iron from Herstyler, with only one barrel option broke. I loved that one so much and got all kinds of compliments on my hair all the time when I used it. Having broken that one, I went to go buy a new one and noticed they now have an iron with 3 different barrel sies &#x3D; 3 differnt size curls.   I love trying out differnt hair styles going from small curls, to medium, to large curls - depending on the occasion or if it&#x27;s daywear or evening! Buy this iron set and you will not be disappointed, especialy, if you like to change up your hair style from time to time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item since my sister owns it and always raves about it until I got it and... did not work :( I tried all three of the irons and nothing. I tried a different plug and nothing. So I had to return it. I wish it would have worked so I could see what all the hype was about and experience the nice curls. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I liked using the set.  It did the job for which I ordered it. I wasn&#x27;t happy enough with it to order it again.</li>
    <li> This curler works just perfect, my wife wanted something like this since long ago and all I continue to get is nothing but the great credit for finding this iron at an extremely fair price. Thanks a lot for being part of the conspiration to find it. In terms of functionality I think the conclusion is that this product is very awesome! It really does what is meant to do and the curls look great... oh and they last forever!</li>
    <li> This is my second one in 4 years! I love this.</li>
    <li> works so great i love the smallest one out the set i get the prettiest wave/curl pattern using this wand...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;watch my how to video with this wand.&lt;br /&gt;Youtube:TishHoney</li>
    <li> This gives me the curls I&#x27;ve always wanted, but it has it&#x27;s flaws. After using it a couple times and switching barrels it wouldn&#x27;t heat up. I had to wiggle the barrel around for a bit before it would heat again-so there&#x27;s some wiring issues with changing barrels.</li>
    <li> Best curler i ever owned. Id suggest to wear the thermal glove it comes with it i burned myself a few times.</li>
    <li> The only curling tool that will make my hair actually hold curl.  I&#x27;ve recommended to many of my friends!</li>
    <li> I only used this iron twice. The third time I attempted to cut it on, the LED displayed it was on but it wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all.&lt;br /&gt;I had read some reviews on here and saw comments on YouTube about the Herstyler&#x27;s dying after a while but I figured I&#x27;d at least get one year out of it. It curls wonderfully (I instantly fell in love with it), but it is very unreliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for Amazon, their customer service is so far the best I&#x27;ve seen. They give three different options to return your product, and all options are covered by them. They sent UPS to my house with a tracking label and had my money back in my account within two days. No complications at all, didn&#x27;t even have to make a phone call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do choose to take the chance and buy this, you&#x27;re probably much better off taking that chance with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just received this curling iron on Saturday and so far I absolutely love it! I was tired of the clamp curling irons (I never used the clamp part anyway), so I wanted to try one like this. I saw a great YouTube tutorial and the girl was using this Herstyler one, so that&#x27;s what made me decide on this one. I was a little worried when I saw the reviews about the curling iron not heating up, but hey you can always return it so I just gave it shot. So far so good! The curls are perfect and they&#x27;ve stayed this way for two days!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the larger piece so far, which is probably the one I&#x27;d use the most anyway. I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this product!</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron</li>
    <li> I love the curling wand work great with my hair</li>
    <li> I loved this product, it heated up fast, the curls lasted through the next day and hair was left healthy. Just a couple weeks ago I went to use the middle barrel size and it would not heat up, then a week later I went to use the biggest size, it heated up the first time, turned it on a little later and it would not heat up either. Now I have two barrels that will not heat up and am waiting for the smallest one to stop working. I will be contacting the seller to see if I can get a replacement or partial refund.</li>
    <li> I love my Hersylter 3p curling wand!!!! Super quick to heat up and to use &amp; my curls last all day!!!! Just have to be careful not to burn myself :/</li>
    <li> Gets hot pretty fast but it&#x27;s not the best product.</li>
    <li> Excelent product, i totally recommended</li>
    <li> i thought it was going to be a curling iron that actually grips the hair NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!! you actually have to have long enough hair to wrap around the barrel and hold (YEAH RIGHT CRAZY) and then so on and so forth &#x3D; to a great big HEAD ACHE !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the same product you find in the kiosk at the malls.  My daughters use this all the time and it works excellent!</li>
    <li> Tricky to use and gets VERY hot. Does the trick though</li>
    <li> Great irons, great price. Can&#x27;t go wrong with these plus the three size options are nice.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase... I tried looking for it in other places but did not find this deal. The product is awesome it gives you so many different looks. if you know or are very creative you will achive a fabulouse look for your everyday look or for that fun party all night look... I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I love my herstyler, I use it every time I go out and my hair lasts done until the next day, and I have really straight hair. The glove though is useless.</li>
    <li> Totally love this. You need to use glove otherwise ends will not curl and will look awkward plus you&#x27;re very likely to burn yourself.</li>
    <li> This was a requested gift for my daughter. She seemed happy to receive it and uses it daily.  Good value.</li>
    <li> This is our second purchase of this curling wand set. The first set was &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34;and not returned, but after 3 years, it was still working perfectly. I highly suggest this product. It&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> I have got to say I was skeptical about purchasing a clip less curling iron before I received this one but I am very impressed! I saw many tutorials on youtube about this her styler wand and i just had to try it. It came well packaged and on time and with no damage. I love this curling iron because it gives you bouncy-all day curls with out the creases and in less time! I also love that it comes with different sizes of wands so you can get any type of curls you want. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in July of last year. I absolutely have loved it but as of a few months ago the 2nd size barrel, the one I used mosr often, stopped working. Or maybe the handle itself doesn&#x27;t heat up as much as it used to. I am really sad and so I can only use the smallest one. I don&#x27;t think I have the papers it came with but I really want a replacement (comes with a one year warranty)! Is there any way I can still send it back and get a new one? This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made!</li>
    <li> My mid sized wand attachment did not work.</li>
    <li> I am very new to using the curling wand vs the curling iron. This curling wand heats up really fast. I like the that i can switch the size of the wand, even though its a bit tricky to remove each size top. it does curl your hair very fast. Im not impressed with the heat resistant glove that it comes with, very large size and bulky, but i hardly ever use the glove.So far i love this product.</li>
    <li> I got mine a few months ago and love it!  I love that it has 3 sizes, the curl lasts all day, and it all fits back in the can for storage!  The glove is handy at first but tventually you will be over it!  I paid about $42 including shipping on it and think it is worth much more!  I have curled several of my friend&#x27;s hair and they always love the outcome and I think it is faster than most other curling systems!I ordered a 2nd one for my friend because she loved it so much too!  Definately a must have!</li>
    <li> My daughter was really excited to get this curler set. It curled her hair beautifully but broke after only a few uses. Would not recommend. Too expensive to break so easily.</li>
    <li> The curling wand curls beautifully!!! I literally get my hair done in 5 minutes! The shipping was fast &amp; I purchased it from Amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> i bought one for my sisters birthday and when we tried it for the first time it did not heat up.  i switched out the barrels a fee times until one clicked perfectly and it began to heat up in no time. i bought one for myself after having use my sisters and it works perfectly!! i do not lile using the glove it only makes my hair staticky. i recommend watching youtube tutorials on how to brush out the waves out</li>
    <li> this curls excellent, and i love the 3 different size barrels.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair and it curls perfectly with this wand. I would categorize my hair as thin, but a lot of it (if that makes sense). I recommend this to everyone! Curls hold and even when they fall it still looks good bc of the way the are curled! You wont regret getting this</li>
    <li> Loved this! The three different sizes is my favorite part. My hair is pretty thin and its difficult to have long lasting curls but the middle sized one gives these beautiful curls that are tight, and because of my thin hair they open up and become these beachy waves that I&#x27;ve been trying to create. Anyways I would definitely recommend this to anyone searching for a good curling iron with a different variety of curls!</li>
    <li> I got this curling iron about a month ago and I absolutely love it curls last a very long time without having to put 10lbs of hairspray in it. Very easy to use once you get the hang of it and it does get very hot so use the glove until your comfortable with the curling iron. Great buy I would recommend to anyone looking for a good curling iron!</li>
    <li> the young lady who received this as a gift, relayed to me that the largest wand does not heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, the product is fine&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S8JB68/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> Well, I received the product VERY quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because out of the three barrel sizes only one worked! I kept switching them out hoping I would get just a little heat, and even after 10 minutes with each barrel... NOTHING! Usually I hesitate to ever give a bad rating, but this one was well deserving. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I will never buy a different curler. And when this one dies. I will buy another one just like it. Perfect ringlet curls every single time. And they last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER - You have to know what you&#x27;re doing. A wand is nothing like a curling iron. Don&#x27;t blame the product because you can&#x27;t work it correctly and you burn yourself every time....which will happen, I promise you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want different sized curls then you may not like this because in order to change sizes you have to wait for it to cool down, change the head, and then wait for it to warm up. But for one size at a time. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for six years and have never had a problem.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment.  Item as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this curling rod! Knowing that I wanted one, my husband got it for me and I am so glad he did! It curls in 10 secs and holds really well. I have really long hair so it weighs down but with this curler it holds a curl all day long with a little bit of light hair spray. I can curl my hair in 20 minutes! It use to take me close to an hour with a straightener. Be really careful though! While not paying attention to where the end was, I barely touched my leg with it and it gave me a 3rd degree burn. The glove is perfect. Ya it&#x27;s not going to block the heat completely but the point is to protect your hand so you don&#x27;t get burned  while wrapping and holding your hair around the rod, and that&#x27;s what it does. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them. It&#x27;s exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> Very cheap! This is not the original 3P that I had purchased from the mall! Mibe lasted me about 6 years. When I opened the package to this one I knew that it was a fake! It didn&#x27;t turn on, it was all made of cheap plastic. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Package came on time, the product itself takes a learning adjustment time.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this curling iron it works amazing exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Just get it! Ive tried plenty of curling irons, ending up with just ok curls and flat hair at the end of the day, but this product has ended my sad hair days ;)</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive the product and it actually worked wonderfully!  Ten minutes to get a head of curls isn&#x27;t too shabby.  The only problem is for some reason, the cord came apart from the rest of it.  Hopefully I just got a defective one and a replacement will last me much longer than for my two uses.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist/make-up artist/photographer and spend a lot of time using hair curlers! My hair is thick but the kind of hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, its really annoying, and most curlers have not been able to hold decent for me. The curlers I normally use are babyliss press and curl (also amazing but sooo time consuming!) and babyliss pro wand range. the curls that last the longest are the press and curl and using straighteners  in my hair... I have been after buying herstyler for ages now  but never got round to it, then it came to mind again the other day so i thought better now than never and let me tell you these curlers are something else!!! literally just amazing, these claim to be 200c and my babyliss are 220c but they are immensely hotter! i never burn myself usually so thought i was clever with these and burnt myself a few time so DO wear the glove, my only qualm is that it should have 2 gloves! don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these honestly and for the people who have said there&#x27;s were faulty etc..  everything electrical can be faulty just send them back and exchange for a new set!</li>
    <li> Yes i was one of those idiots that was douped into buying this flat iron from a kiosk at the mall. The orginal price the man told me was 169.99! I said no way....well as I kept telling him no each time the price dropped.  I am a person that does straighten her hair almost everyday and was in the market for a new one. So when he told me the price was 99.99. I took it. Well when I got it home and tried to do the nice curling feature he showed me, well needless to say it didnt curl. So I said ok well I bought a flat iron not a curling iron and proceeded to straighten my hair, it barely did that! Very disappointed! I went to look for the recipt to return it and of course the recipt says no returns. So now Im stuck with a 100 flat iron that doesnt work. And if you do a little reasearch you can find the same exact flat iron for as little as 35 dollars on some sites!</li>
    <li> Curling my hair is so much easier and faster now. It quickly heats up and gives me the curls that I&#x27;ve been looking for. I like how it comes with 3 different sizes. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> The item was recieved sooner than expected. Awesome curling wand, differnt styles and looks! Easy to use and works well. I have used it about 5 times and have loved it the same each time.</li>
    <li> It was awesome and I love it!!! Gives me those big waves when I wanna go for the beachie look or can also do the tight curls! I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for her 14th birthday, and she loves it she still has it has been well over a year and she says it still works amazingly!!!</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  I have always had a hard time getting my hair to stay curled - I have long, thick blond hair.  I can use the herstyler to curl my hair without using product and it will stay for several days depending on what attachment I use.  I like that it comes with the three different attachments so you can change up the look of the curls.  The glove it came with is very large and loose, but you can always use any other kind of glove - which I do find necessary to use to protect my fingers.  I recommend this to anyone who asks me how I got those great curls in my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the bigger barrel for my thick, long hair</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I have 3 friends that bought it and i loved it so much i had 2 buy 1 myself</li>
    <li> This product is just as it appears.  It heats up very hot and curls my hair perfectly.  I am so bad with curling irons, but this makes it so much easier to curl my hair because I wrap the strands around by hand.  It&#x27;s perfect for people like me haha.</li>
    <li> I was so excited that I bought 2.  The only complain I have is about the glove, even when you have it on you can burn your fingers and I always use it in the lowest heat.</li>
    <li> Everything works great. I had this product 5years ago and it still works so now I have 2curling wand sets. I actually had needed the smallest wand that&#x27;s why I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this curler for over 3 years now. It is high quality and always gives me perfect curls. It does include a glove, and three different sized barrels. I definitely recommend this to everyone! Amazing price for what you are getting. This curler does get extremely hot, but it has two different heat setting which is nice.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful and love to be able to change the the irons.</li>
    <li> I love it so much, it works great you have to use the glove otherwise you will burn yourself. The glove that it comes with is huge so it&#x27;s a little annoying while parting your hair but otherwise it is a great buy! I have ordered&lt;br /&gt;3 so far for my family and friends as gifts.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I must return this item. My daughter has long, thick, heavy hair which she curls quite often. Even after watching the video she was unable to style her hair the way she had been used to without difficulty.</li>
    <li> Was perfect for my daughter she really likes it</li>
    <li> great works amazing, takes a bit of getting used to but its awesome !</li>
    <li> This is my first time writing a review! This product is so good that I feel compelled to share! I&#x27;ve used all sorts of curling irons but never a clip-less. I love how you can achieve any type of curl. It takes a little getting used to but its worth it. I use Paul Mitchell \\&quot;Hot off the press\\&quot; as a heat protectant and it helped hold my curls. I really encourage those who are unsure to try it! I&#x27;m happy I bought it for a 1/3 of the price and everything arrived so quickly and in perfect condition. It even came with a heat protectant glove! I ended up buying another one because I had to keep switching hands and it was time consuming. Just buy it, practice a few times and you won&#x27;t ever use anything else. This seller was awesome!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for any size curls. Does not work too well on shorter hair, but if your hair is long you will have perfect curls just like the celebrities! :)</li>
    <li> I believe I purchased these a few years back and they still work perfectly</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my herstyler curler. I use it all the time and my curls remain fabulous! I have recommended this to all my friends and family,</li>
    <li> I guess I bought this product just to have because I have the flat irons.  I have not yet used this so I can&#x27;t say how it is, but it looks cool.  Right now I&#x27;m on a journey of not using heat on my hair until it gets back healthy.  You women understand what I&#x27;m saying right?</li>
    <li> Box was in perfect shape upon receipt.  Ordered 2 Herstylers and the containers that held the product were dented all over.  Too late to send back for Christmas so granddaughters will open dented tin cans.  The product itself was not damaged. I just feel as the damage to the cans were that way before ever shipped because the box was again in perfect shape.  They were supposed to be new so I expected un damaged products.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product. She used it the same day she opened it and it met her expectations. She likes all of the different sizes. The smallest barrel makes very small curls. We are very satisfied and grateful it came with a glove.</li>
    <li> I love it! I can make my curls have different styles and it curls better than a normal curling iron!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It got here early and turned out great!! so use it everyday, it&#x27;s so easy to use. My hair is done in like 30mins and I have long thick hair!! I would highly suggest this product!!</li>
    <li> recieved the curler within a week but product was shipped defected. wasted my time and money not purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
    <li> wiring on these iron can give out after a while.I have had bit for years and have had to by 3 different bases .</li>
    <li> Works really well. My only complaint would be to add some sort of cover on the tip for protection. The wand gets super hot!</li>
    <li> I bought the blow dryer for my granddaughter she found another brand so i did some research and the review on this blow dryer where really high so i took the chance and my granddaughter loves it says it is the best dryer it does all that she wanted and more.  Thank you the reviews helped out so much.  If she needs to get another blow dryer i will be buying this one for her again.  I have the flat Iron and it is the best!!!!!  would not trade it for nothing i have tried many, many things i have curly, frizzy hair and the Herstyler flat iron is great in fact i have a brand new on in case i need it, I can not be without this flat iron.  It use to take me 30-40 mins with other flat irons now it takes me 10 minutes tops and only have to go over my hair once instead of 5-6 times, butter for my hair.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you get these products.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s great and it does exactly what it says it would. My only complaint is that the screws come loose every so often and I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
    <li> I love this wand, it is truly magical. The curls are flawless with this wand. I&#x27;ve tried Conair and Remington products and nothing comes close.</li>
    <li> I really like my  curler iron ! Im from dominican republic and i just wanna say ... Thanks!  At the moment i dont have a bad coment about my product!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite styler</li>
    <li> GREAT SELLER, DAUGHTER LOVED IT...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. WOULD BUY FROM AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Product came a day earlier than I expected and it&#x27;s everything I wanted. My roommate paid $150 for her&#x27;s and was mad when she found out I got mine for $44!! GREAT BUY!!</li>
    <li> I love the middle size wand, its pretty much all I use, Love the beachy wave look this gives you! Makes your hair look FANTASTIC</li>
    <li> Awesome curler iron and the cheapest price I could find anywhere. Mine came with a glove also. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the deal I got on amazon. It was $38 and on herstyler website it&#x27;s $225. I thought that maybe the product was switched out or wouldn&#x27;t be the exact thing I ordered. But when I received it it was exactly the same as the website. Now let&#x27;s talk quality, AMAZING! I have hair that will barely hold a curl. Not only did it hold with no hairspray,  but it was still beach wavy the next day. Super easy to use (watched a few youtube videos first though). I am in love with it!!!</li>
    <li> Till this day one of my favorites</li>
    <li> I received this and one of the attachments was broken so it wouldn&#x27;t stay in the base.  I ended up using the other two attachments and they created nice, long-lasting curls.  Unfortunately, the curler worked for a good month and a half and then stopped heating.  Very disappointed since it has such great reviews and seemed like it had potential.</li>
    <li> The only thing that would hold curls in my hair. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. I would recommend this product. I Love it!</li>
    <li> The best hair wand curler ever! I have thick hair so this product does the job!</li>
    <li> Amazing does my hair in 15 mins tops ! I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Actually my granddaughter loves it!  She did her Christmas morning and her hair was beautiful!!  Do purchase a heat resistant glove and it is easy to use</li>
    <li> Well, this product is first of all an expensive item. I was awed by the price and most of all love the container that it came in.. I love this and we use it all the time now..</li>
    <li> Okay, that might be a bit dramatic, but I really really love this wand! I use the biggest iron (but the small ones will come in handy for my two little girls!). This wand gives my hair such a beautiful wave! It&#x27;s quick and easy. It takes me probably 15 minutes total to curl my entire head and I have long hair and a lot of it. Awesome product. I love that you can adjust the heat settings too.</li>
    <li> Great quality but broke</li>
    <li> The very first time I used it, it worked. The second time it did not. I tried several other outlets and that wasn&#x27;t the case! Since then it&#x27;s worked fine but I just never know when the next time will be.</li>
    <li> LOVE! LOVE! The attachments are easy to get on and off and so far the largest of the attachments is my favorite. Cord is long enough to reach around and honestly will buy another soon!</li>
    <li> The best curling wand out there! I always get so many compliments on my hair when I use it. I&#x27;ve gotten it as a gift for two of my friends who now use it daily!</li>
    <li> My friend is the one who told me about this product.  I would recommennd it to everyone.  My hair usually never holds a curl, but with this product, my curl stayed in all day.  Worth buying!</li>
    <li> I used the curling rod right away. I decided to switch to a different size rod and it didn&#x27;t work after I switched it. I tried multiple outlets and all three rods. None of them worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the curling rod with no problems. I got free shipping and the full amount back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned AT LEAST 10 different curling irons/wands since high school and this one is the absolute best! Keeps the curls in even the day after! I have long hair too (23inches) so the biggest barrel gives me the best loose curls I&#x27;ve ever had! DEFINATELY recommend this product!! And it&#x27;s affordable plus I got my in two days free shipping!!</li>
    <li> Several of my friends recommended this product, and I was not willing to spend the Mall retail price for something I didn&#x27;t know if I would use. When I saw the price of this set, I was sold and decided it was worth the attempt.  Not only does this product heat up very quickly, I can style my hair in about 15-20 minutes, when it would usually take me about 30-45! I have recommended this product to everyone, all my co-workers have bought it and love it too! I recommend using the heat styling glove as I have burned myself without it, and I also recommend looking up you tube videos for ideas! Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and smooth and has a very hard time holding curls. I tried this once and the curls lasted more than 2 days! It heats up in seconds and does exactly what it says. Since i&#x27;ve recieved it a few months ago i have used it many times without any problems. Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great curling iron set for a great price!</li>
    <li> From someone with pin straight hair, this wand works wonders! Great price, great item. It&#x27;s a win win situation. You can&#x27;t turn it down.</li>
    <li> Product worked well while it lasted.  Stopped heating up (even though the indicator light is on) after less than 2 months a now I am out of the return window.  Not real happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to curl my hair with the regular hair curler irons so I tried this clipless curler iron out and it works wonderful. I like the fact that i don&#x27;t have to deal with the clips. This product is awesome coming in different sizes of the irons.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the women in my home after they had seen one being used for a wedding. At first they were trying to figure out how to use it, then they figured it out. My step daughter uses it more than my wife. As far as I can tell, it suits their purpose. The delivery of the product was on time.</li>
    <li> Bought for my granddaughter and she loves it.  Has to make sure to wear the gloves because it does get hot..</li>
    <li> Curled my hair quite nicely- on the highest heat setting, but it did damage my hair. Lots of split ends, and yes I did use a heat protectant. Unfortunately, there are only two heat settings, and the lower heat setting really does not hold a curl too well. I suppose it does what it is meant to due, and for less than $15 how can you go wrong. Just wish there were multiple heat settings, or even information on the degrees of the heat settings. Oh well. *continues to curl and burn hair* lol</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!! 😃😃My curls came out lovely</li>
</ol>
