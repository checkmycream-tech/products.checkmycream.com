    <li> PRETTY COLOR, DOES NOT LAST LONG AT ALL</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping it would. Overall sexy flirty color, goes on smoothly and very moisturizing. Thank you! I will definitely order again :)</li>
    <li> color is good. Does not last as long as I thought it should. lipstick is hard to get up to use as it is dented in the middle and I must work to get it going up.</li>
    <li> I love Estée Lauder stuffs, and that&#x27;s is not the exception. This lipstick is soft and the color is really pigment. I bought it for a Christmas gift. Good purchase for cheap price, excellent deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of the Rubellite color lipsticks so that I&#x27;d have one for my purse and my make-up stand.  Love the color!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is exactly what l wanted. l paid a fraction of the cost compare to what you would pay in a stores like Macy&#x27;s or JC Penney&#x27;s. I love the way it last a long time on your lips</li>
