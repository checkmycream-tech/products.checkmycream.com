      <li>love this product!!!!!</li>
      <li>I still think it is a good product, but I&#x27;m not as impressed with it as I was a couple of years ago.</li>
      <li>I am a fair-skinned red-head and am always looking for great sun protection.</li>
      <li>I have used Elta Block SPF 32 successfully.</li>

      <li>Good sunscreen</li>
      <li>So, off course I love it!</li>
      <li>Love all their products, always reorder!</li>
      <li>So glad I found this!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best we&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>The very strong foul smell of the product was overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I was super excited about ordering this product because of all the great reviews.</li>
      <li>Chemical free, rubs in, amazing.</li>
      <li>or if you&#x27;re in water this is a pretty good sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I love the clean feel after I put it on.  </li>
      <li>I have had lots of pre cancerous spots and this is great coverage and light enough for my face.</li>

      <li>With that said, it has a mild but, noticeable product scent on first applying it.</li>
      <li>I loved it, but I decided to try other brands.  </li>
      <li>it is clear and free</li>
      <li>Thanks for  reading!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this before heading on out vacation because it leaves a pretty noticeable white film on your skin.</li>
      <li>Elta MD Pure is the opposite--we&#x27;re covered, it&#x27;s invisable and a delight to put on since it rubs right in, so</li>
      <li>Must be for aware to increase mositurizer use.</li>
      <li>you have to really rub it in.  </li>
      <li>Though I would much prefer a spray, this sunscreen did not irritate mine or my daughter&#x27;s skin once applied which is a pro.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought amazon had a reasonable price for the product when I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>I hope the higher SPF and the \\&quot;broad spectrum\\&quot; is accurate because that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
      <li>I just went back and ordered several more bottles for ourselves.</li>
      <li>If your normal,  you may not notice the scent.</li>
      <li>You should check out my www.sensorysolutions1.com blog especially the archive sections and pages first.</li>
      <li>It leaves a white cast on my face if I don&#x27;t cover it with makeup, but most of the time, I mix it with a little moisturizer and put it under my makeup.</li>
      <li>Seems to work great but is a little thick.  </li>
      <li>I have tried dozens of sunscreens, based on the EWG&#x27;s recommendations in their database, for myself and my two young children.</li>
      <li>If you like it comment, then tell all your sensitive skin, roscia, MCS, PSD, or ASD friends/family.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of white and thick, so put it on sparingly, but use it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would definitely recommend especially for those with sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks, and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
      <li>My bottle has no odor at all - good, bad or otherwise.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had to take a moment to edit my previous review.  Elta was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I thought amazon had a reasonable price for the product when I ordered it.  Neutragena and other drugstore brands made me break out and clogged my pores.  Elta seems to absorb, but has the strength I need out in the sun.  I loved it, but I decided to try other brands.  You have to be careful with Elta, because it does leave your skin white- you have to really rub it in.  What really bothered me was the sheen it left behind. I still think it is a good product, but I&#x27;m not as impressed with it as I was a couple of years ago.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of sunscreens, based on the EWG&#x27;s recommendations in their database, for myself and my two young children. This is by far the best we&#x27;ve found. It gets a #1 rating from EWG for not containing potenitally dangerous parabens and other chemicals, plus it has the highest SPF factor of the physical sunscreens. And the biggest bonus for me is that it goes on easily and rubs right in. We had been relying on Badger and California Baby, but they are so very sticky and just coat the skin and attract dirt and grime and honestly, I hated covering myself and the children with such thick stuff that would slide off into the creases and leave us so shiny and slick. We actually got burned using Badger a couple of times, either because we didn&#x27;t put it on thick enough, it slid off as we sweat, or I didn&#x27;t reapply properly. Elta MD Pure is the opposite--we&#x27;re covered, it&#x27;s invisable and a delight to put on since it rubs right in, so re-application isn&#x27;t such a PITA. It&#x27;s perfect for us. I just went back and ordered several more bottles for ourselves. So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks, and it seems to work pretty well. It leaves a white cast on my face if I don&#x27;t cover it with makeup, but most of the time, I mix it with a little moisturizer and put it under my makeup. It doesn&#x27;t react with the makeup, and I get even coverage with my liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, hope it works as advertised, so far so good.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen lotion ever</li>
    <li> excellent product; would buy it again</li>
    <li> Good sunscreen but does make your face look a little white.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen ever! Chemical free, rubs in, amazing. I have tried a lot f sunscreens and thus and vanicream are my faves.</li>
    <li> this is a good product in that it does what you want it to do. You will have to apply make up over it, but it works. It&#x27;s kind of white and thick, so put it on sparingly, but use it. It&#x27;s good coverage. I have Melasma and I use it all the time!</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen everyday!  I love the clean feel after I put it on.  It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel greasy.  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> Having eczema, this sunscreen was dermatologist recommended.  Though I would much prefer a spray, this sunscreen did not irritate mine or my daughter&#x27;s skin once applied which is a pro.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend especially for those with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Always looking for skin friendly sun-blocking products.  This products works well for blockage and has provided good protection spring.summer 2012.  Has taken some getting used to the drying effect on skin of this product.  Must be for aware to increase mositurizer use.</li>
    <li> I have Vitiligo and needed a physical sun block and this product does that. It goes on very white put as long as you rub it in it the white disappears. It can be drying to your skin so just I just shower when done for the day. I also have slot of dermatitis allergies and this product does not bother me it is clear and free</li>
    <li> I have used Elta Block SPF 32 successfully. When the Environmental Working Group rated EltaMD SPF 47 as the #1 sunscreen I ordered it. I applied it. The very strong foul smell of the product was overwhelming. It made me smell bad and it did not dissipate. I had to wash it off. I received a refund from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I wrote a letter and spoke on the phone with EltaMD telling them to make this. And even gave them ingredient guidance. So, off course I love it! With that said, it has a mild but, noticeable product scent on first applying it. But, nothing about this product bothers me. If your normal,  you may not notice the scent. But, I&#x27;m an aspie . So, I&#x27;m hypersensitive or alert to this sorta thing. You should check out my www.sensorysolutions1.com blog especially the archive sections and pages first. If you like it comment, then tell all your sensitive skin, roscia, MCS, PSD, or ASD friends/family. Thanks for  reading!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product after my dermatologist recommended it.  I have had lots of pre cancerous spots and this is great coverage and light enough for my face.</li>
    <li> love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> This goes on thick and white. As far as application, it&#x27;s the same as all the other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreens.  I hope the higher SPF and the \\&quot;broad spectrum\\&quot; is accurate because that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m still using it. My bottle has no odor at all - good, bad or otherwise.</li>
    <li> Love all their products, always reorder! IT doesn&#x27;t have chemicals in it so it is safe to use on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am a fair-skinned red-head and am always looking for great sun protection. I was super excited about ordering this product because of all the great reviews. I&#x27;m glad I tried this before heading on out vacation because it leaves a pretty noticeable white film on your skin. It&#x27;s not greasy, but it&#x27;s also not something I would want to use because of the chalky look.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great but is a little thick.  If you&#x27;re out exercising and sweating a lot or if you&#x27;re in water this is a pretty good sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, rubs in pretty easily. Very happy with the product.</li>
