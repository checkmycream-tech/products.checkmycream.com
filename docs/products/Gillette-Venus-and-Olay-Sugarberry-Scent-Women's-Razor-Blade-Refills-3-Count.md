      <li>The cartridges are easy to use and glide very easily for a clean shave.</li>
      <li>The scent smells wonderful while the cartridge is wet, but does not seem to linger once you&#x27;re done shaving.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great razor, and in general i love Gillette products.</li>
      <li>the olay always leaves my legs so silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this razor from BzzAgent, so I gave it to my daughter to try.  </li>
      <li>I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scented Razor for free by participating in a Buzzagent Campaign.</li>
      <li>You will be silky and smooth beyond your wildest dreams.</li>
      <li>These work so good through coarse leg and arm hair,and leaves everything smooth from the Olay</li>
      <li>I was surprised how much I liked the moisturizing bars on the razor.</li>
      <li>so much had to pick me up more.</li>
      <li>With this razor, the moisturizing bars really seemed to contribute to a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>it is worth it.</li>
      <li>the razor feel apart very easy only used it once</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t really last long but does smell good in the shower!</li>
      <li>However, she absolutely loves this razor!  </li>
      <li>Read first review.</li>
      <li>the second one was better.</li>
      <li>and the razor will not allow her to hurt herself and leaves her legs feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Loved the clean shave it gave me, it did seem to moisturize my skin a bit more than usual, but I still needed some lotion after shaving (I have very dry skin though, so that could be all it was).  </li>
      <li>My wife only utilizes Venus blades because of their long lasting quality, but with the Olay added, she states that they&#x27;re the best blades on the market.</li>
      <li>But even with all that, I do love this however long</li>
      <li>super soft.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin and these did irritate my skin at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why, but these work even better than the original Venus/Olay cartridges.  </li>
      <li>She said it makes shaving so much easier.  </li>
      <li>Also, she really likes the wall mount, so she has a place to hang it in her shower.  </li>
      <li>But the price is high, too high very often...</li>
      <li>i gave these cartridges four stars mainly because these are overly gooey.</li>
      <li>it lasts and it really does give a much better shave than a &#x27;plain&#x27; head.</li>
      <li>Favorite razor blades hands down!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it about four times so far and the bars on the top and bottom are wearing down already.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t have a strong &#x27;sugarberry&#x27; scent to it, which was fine by me because it was very subtle.  </li>
      <li>She is somewhat new to shaving and</li>
      <li>It has given her a really close shave and left her legs very moisturized.  </li>
      <li>With the original Venus/Olay, I would cut myself every other time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I swear my legs had never been this smooth with any other product!</li>
      <li>someone really put their thinking cap on here - no more wasted conditioner or wasted money for shaving cream and the scent is delicious!</li>
      <li>i like these cartridges but only after trying the second cartridge in the box because the first one didn&#x27;t last long especially the shave gel bar.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually not a big fan of razors that have shave gel bars due to them dissolving too fast.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m usually not a big fan of razors that have shave gel bars due to them dissolving too fast. I bought these when I was going on vacation and did not want to bother with shaving cream, and I was actually really pleased with these that I continued to use them after my vacation. I have super sensitive skin and these did irritate my skin at all. The sugarberry scent is really nice too. If you&#x27;re a fan of the Venus Embrace, I definitely recommend trying these.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this razor!  It is a bit pricey so 4 stars due to it&#x27;s price. This is just a refill.</li>
    <li> These are the only razors Blades I use. They work well and you don&#x27;t need to buy any shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Loved the clean shave it gave me, it did seem to moisturize my skin a bit more than usual, but I still needed some lotion after shaving (I have very dry skin though, so that could be all it was).  Didn&#x27;t have a strong &#x27;sugarberry&#x27; scent to it, which was fine by me because it was very subtle.  I&#x27;ve used it about four times so far and the bars on the top and bottom are wearing down already. I had the problem with a previous &#x27;self lathering&#x27; head from Gillette where the bars would break off before they were fully used up, thus making it just another razor.  It&#x27;s looking like that&#x27;s happening to this one too.  But even with all that, I do love this however long it lasts and it really does give a much better shave than a &#x27;plain&#x27; head.</li>
    <li> Great idea...someone really put their thinking cap on here - no more wasted conditioner or wasted money for shaving cream and the scent is delicious! Also, love that all cartridges are interchangeable with venus wands even if they are 5 years old...or so. lol.</li>
    <li> cant go wrong with razors lol. super soft. i love venus and olay so win win lol but why so expensive</li>
    <li> the razor feel apart very easy only used it once and it just feel apart not to happy with it</li>
    <li> i love this product. i hate using shaving cream and this allows me to skip it! the olay always leaves my legs so silky smooth.</li>
    <li> get i on subscribe and save and save 20% but its the best razor combo out there.  You will be silky and smooth beyond your wildest dreams.</li>
    <li> Works great, i love that i don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream. and it smells great :) i will buy again</li>
    <li> Read first review. Not a good razor. I have thin fine hair and this thing could not cute it. At all.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful and smelling so good , leaves the skin so moisturizing and perfect shaved. We have more space of time between each shave. I love it !</li>
    <li> I got the Razor free from Gillette to try,and they give me a 5 dollar off coupon ,so i loved it so much had to pick me up more.These work so good through coarse leg and arm hair,and leaves everything smooth from the Olay that&#x27;s in it you don&#x27;t even have to add anything extra,and it smells great!I also loved the holder that came with the razor stick to my bathroom shower so i know where my razor is every time...</li>
    <li> These cartridges are very good quality.  They give a very comfortable and smooth shave.  The scent smells wonderful while the cartridge is wet, but does not seem to linger once you&#x27;re done shaving.  That is not a problem for me because I use lotions afterward.  I purchase these regularly through the subscribe and save program.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great razor, and in general i love Gillette products. But the price is high, too high very often...</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve tried. It is expensive bu it is worth it. You can use it with or without shaving cream because it has that extra cream embedded with the razor. Fits any other Gillette Venus razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Sugarberry Scented Razor for free by participating in a Buzzagent Campaign. I loved the razor and smooth, silky legs that I had after using it. I was surprised how much I liked the moisturizing bars on the razor. In the past, I have had razors with the moisture bars that have &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; away after a use or two. They would dissolve into a gummy mess. With this razor, the moisturizing bars really seemed to contribute to a smooth shave. I also love the sugarberry scent. It makes me almost look forward to shaving!</li>
    <li> Very impressed! I received this razor to try for free and loved it!!!</li>
    <li> I love the strip, I love the 5 blade and I love that Gillette has paired up with Olay!  I don&#x27;t care if it is scented or not, doesn&#x27;t really last long but does smell good in the shower!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but these work even better than the original Venus/Olay cartridges.  I&#x27;m a curvy BBW and I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time carefully shaving my legs - I go as quickly as possible.  With these blades, I haven&#x27;t cut myself once.  With the original Venus/Olay, I would cut myself every other time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love them.</li>
    <li> i like these cartridges but only after trying the second cartridge in the box because the first one didn&#x27;t last long especially the shave gel bar. the second one was better. the scent is okay but a little too sugary and not a lot of berry. i gave these cartridges four stars mainly because these are overly gooey. would not recommend leaving these out after use because they ooze everywhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible to scrape or nick your leg with this razor.  My granddaughter loves them because she usually does her legs standing up in the shower (!!) and the razor will not allow her to hurt herself and leaves her legs feeling soft and smooth.  Great invention.</li>
    <li> Favorite razor blades hands down! I swear my legs had never been this smooth with any other product!</li>
    <li> The only razor I will use is the Venus and olay. The cartridges are easy to use and glide very easily for a clean shave.</li>
    <li> My wife only utilizes Venus blades because of their long lasting quality, but with the Olay added, she states that they&#x27;re the best blades on the market.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this razor from BzzAgent, so I gave it to my daughter to try.  She is somewhat new to shaving and the idea of 5 blades made me a little nervous.

Her only complaint is that the handle is a little slippery to hold onto when it&#x27;s wet.  I guess it&#x27;s just different that what she&#x27;s used to.  Also, she really likes the wall mount, so she has a place to hang it in her shower.  She&#x27;s definitely going to want this razor from now on, and this is the best price.</li>
