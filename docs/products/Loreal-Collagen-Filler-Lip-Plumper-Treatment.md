      <li>This lip plumper works better as a moisturizer than a lip plumper....</li>
      <li>No unnatural results or stinging lips, but a great moisturizing treatment that increases volume both instantly and over time.</li>
      <li>There are better moisturizers on the market,so that benefit alone doesn&#x27;t make this product worth the $$$.</li>

      <li>It was funny because my face is pretty tanned.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this, I noticed almost immediate results.  </li>
      <li>I cannot find it locally any more;  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the fast service.</li>
      <li>This helps anyone with vertical lip lines, really stops lipstick bleeding.  </li>
      <li>Did not really plump that much if any</li>
      <li>am a 73 year old woman and this is the only product that keeps my lipstic from smearing and overrunning my Lipstic into the lines and keeps my lips smoother!</li>
      <li>I really luv Loreal products, however this is not what I wanted or expected.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any real effects on my lips other than a sleeker feeling.  </li>

<li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real effects on my lips other than a sleeker feeling.  </li>
<li> Just colored the lips white and can&#x27;t feel that tickle sensation that other plumpers give went</li>
<li> Looks Like I was sent a Loreal item that was &amp;#34;previously returned&amp;#34;,  It was open, the Seal was broken, and ,item was sitting in a regular open plastic bag,  item looked like someone had opened it, used it, then sent it back .,&amp;#34;VERY</li>
<li> I expected at least some effect, but apparently no effects at all.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money in this product.</li>
<li> I ordered a few.</li>
<li> It does give some slight blurring to fine lines around the mouth, but isn&#x27;t terribly helpful with the naso-labial folds.  </li>
<li> Not sure this will work for me.  </li>
<li> The product just didn&#x27;t work, at least for me.  </li>
<li> one thing I disliked was that the product pack was teared apart which is quite awkward.</li>
<li> I was disgusted that an item in that horrible , damaged, defective, &amp;#34; unsanitary&amp;#34;, condition was sent out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not work for me. Not to many products of this kind work. Not worth the money.  Will return product.</li>
    <li> This helps anyone with vertical lip lines, really stops lipstick bleeding.  I cannot find it locally any more;  I hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued..</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any plumping but it is a great moisturizer and gives the lips a beautiful natural color. Maybe using it twice daily will give the plump effect. But it was not a bad purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I disliked was that the product pack was teared apart which is quite awkward.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I noticed almost immediate results.  It was funny because my face is pretty tanned.  I could see untanned lines, where the wrinkles had been, as soon as the skin plumped up.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a product worth having! Excellent description, perfect value, great for a variety of reasons! Have noticed great changes with daily use!</li>
    <li> I loved it and would like more send me the e-mail if it goes on special  star 5  it made a difference!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference. No results at all. Can&#x27;t believe it is from a famous brand L&#x27;Oreal. I expected at least some effect, but apparently no effects at all.</li>
    <li> Always worked on me and affordable too.</li>
    <li> I have used the product before - it works well and that is why I ordered more. Thanks for the fast service.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present and she is very happy.  Cannot find it in stores and this is the only lip product she likes.  Moisturizes and plumps lips as advertised.</li>
    <li> wife likes product, local stores stopped stocking this product</li>
    <li> Love it !  Great ! Met all expectations.</li>
    <li> Did not really plump that much if any</li>
    <li> The Price is great, the product is awesome and the quality is excellent!  Thank you!  Will buy again!  Easy Transaction!</li>
    <li> The product just didn&#x27;t work, at least for me.  I didn&#x27;t see any plumping of my lips; I wish I had and been able to write a great review.</li>
    <li> Really great product for the price, don&#x27;t know if the plumper part works so much, but both products are great for smoothing &amp; filling in lines!</li>
    <li> I used this product for quite some time, I run out of it and could not find it in the Stores anymore, so I ordered it on Line.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 73 year old woman and this is the only product that keeps my lipstic from smearing and overrunning my Lipstic into the lines and keeps my lips smoother!</li>
    <li> good for the lip I used all day I recommended this product  you can use  because is good for you lip</li>
    <li> I think that this is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> I really luv Loreal products, however this is not what I wanted or expected. Loreal has a collagen lip plumper in a single blue tub that is excellent. The product I received, is not the same product that appears on the web page.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE OF THIS PRODUCT PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW MUCH IT IS.  I WOULD LIKE TO ORDER SOME MORE IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT.  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Tubes were not sealed on the cardboard backing and there was no safety seals on the actual tubes and I didn&#x27;t want to use them</li>
    <li> This lip plumper works better as a moisturizer than a lip plumper....I didn&#x27;t notice any real effects on my lips other than a sleeker feeling.

    <li> I purchased this for my mom and she loved it so much after a week she made me order her 3 more!! No unnatural results or stinging lips, but a great moisturizing treatment that increases volume both instantly and over time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money in this product. Didn&amp;#34;t work for me. Just colored the lips white and can&#x27;t feel that tickle sensation that other plumpers give went you wear it.</li>
    <li> Not sure this will work for me.  Tho it did seem to make my lipliner go on smooth, it seemed to irritate my lips a bit over time.</li>
    <li> You can see results quickly. Can&#x27;t beat the price. I ordered a few. As soon as they run out, I&#x27;ll be placing another order.</li>
    <li> Looks Like I was sent a Loreal item that was &amp;#34;previously returned&amp;#34;,  It was open, the Seal was broken, and ,item was sitting in a regular open plastic bag,  item looked like someone had opened it, used it, then sent it back .,&amp;#34;VERY-UNSANITARY&amp;#34;. I was disgusted that an item in that horrible , damaged, defective, &amp;#34; unsanitary&amp;#34;, condition was sent out. Of course I returned item..</li>
