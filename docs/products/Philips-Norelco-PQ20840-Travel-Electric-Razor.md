<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these.  I get a new on every six months or so.  They give a very clean comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I somehow misplaced my older Philips battery-shaver after returning from a trip to London so bought this one. Excellent, close cut as you&#x27;d expect from a Philips shaver. Excellent battery-life, I use NiMH rechargeables and they last at least a month of daily shaves before needing a recharge.</li>
    <li> Great product! 5 stars!! Will be back again!!Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Its a good  item. Just that it would be nice id it had its own battery.</li>
    <li> Great travel razor for those who like Norelco rotary razors.</li>
    <li> excelente producto no hay quejas ni molestias perfecto</li>
    <li> work well... cheaper than those expensive electric razors... which i always end up dropping and breaking... lasts just as long.. I usually break them before they stop working on their own. Small enough that i keep on in the car just incase i am going somewhere and need to shave the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. It is easy to use, effective and inexpensive - what more could you want!</li>
    <li> A fantastic razor for the price.  Great for travel.  Easy to clean,  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great close shave and small enough to carry in my backpack.</li>
    <li> Very nice just like the old one just better</li>
    <li> I owned like the great grandfather version of this cuz it was using one that was formerly that was my dad&#x27;s. I loved it for i dunno like 7 years and then I lost it during my move. I was seriously sad. Im still sad actually. I bought this one as the replacement. Hopefully it&#x27;ll last me as long as the last one did. Im taking one star off because of the redesign. The old one used to be flat on top and flat on bottom. So you can easily store it in your medicine cabinet without it falling over. This new one is shaped weird. I dunno why they did that. But as far as how it shaves, same as before. Kicks ass</li>
    <li> Work great and good on battery</li>
    <li> I have it in my car and I can shave me there.</li>
    <li> Good shave; batteries last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years, and it works SO well. Lasts forever on a set of 2 AA batteries, and when the heads get dull (years), you can load a new set in (but honestly, you can also get another shaver for the same $$).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how smooth and quiet the rotary shavers are. They also seem to be better at getting the lay-down hairs in my beard. My buzzy shaver seems to like to leave the \\&quot;long grass\\&quot; lying around until I trim it to nubs by hand with scissors. So the rotary takes less time than the buzzer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little gem is WAY smaller than a 3-head rechargeable, and also I don&#x27;t have to carry a charging cord with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recall that mine came bundled with a long-gone 3-head shaver. I&#x27;ve recently heard that this small travel unit is no longer in production; I might pick up a spare....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Cost-effective and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is the best travel razer l&#x27;ve ever had, it&#x27;s almost the $100.00+ tip home one.</li>
    <li> I have had two previous versions each lasting over 7 years.  Gives a better shave than my $180. Phillishave .  I have one in my SUV and another in my travel bag</li>
    <li> Small and easy to use for a quick trim, especially if you don&#x27;t grow out hair very quickly. Uses two AA batteries and doesn&#x27;t require replacement often. I can&#x27;t even remember the last time I needed to replace it. Since ordering on June 1st. Saves me razors and money.</li>
    <li> For the price this shaver is great.  Battery last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, good as a travel unit.  Decent power.</li>
    <li> got this for my son in law for Christmas, he loves it thanks</li>
    <li> Perfect! Cheap and small! Great for traveling! I use it daily!</li>
    <li> Very useful device. I bought this because I travel frequently. It does the job pretty well. If you get unlucky and bend one of the covers, then it might prick into your skin, which is the only potential design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it lasts over a year, you rarely need to recharge it, and it gives you a relatively clean shave. I rebought this product again after losing my original one, so that tells you a lot.</li>
    <li> very portable. Nice clean.</li>
    <li> Very good product.loving it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for last minute touch ups ... if you see a spot you missed but for regular shaving invest in a better more expensive model.</li>
    <li> What else can you ask from a shaver this small and this price !&lt;br /&gt;It works perfect for what it is...  but not for daily use for sure .</li>
    <li> Great for 16 y/o&#x27;s cookie-duster</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re considering cost-effectiveness it&#x27;s a clear 5/5 stars because it works just as well as larger, more expensive trimmers I&#x27;ve owned. Surprisingly powerful enough to get through 2-3 days of stubble. If you compare to other trimmers without considering the price tag however, I&#x27;d said 4/5. It still causes pinching if you&#x27;re not careful and you still need to spend quite amount of time on the curves and nooks and crannies of your face to make sure you&#x27;re actually getting everything.</li>
    <li> Love this Razor.  Ups lost the first one and the seller overnighted me this one. I just shaved with it and I love it. No charging time, as it came with two batteries installed. Great razor and great seller.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted- something cheap to keep my hairy ears under control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed. This cuts better than my usual electric razor!</li>
    <li> Buy a real one.  This thing couldn&#x27;t take the fuzz off of a peach.</li>
    <li> got it for the military. started using it every day. best travel razor ive ever used. breaks down easily to clean and doesnt pull on hair unless battery is dying, but well, replace them.</li>
    <li> Goes through battery life very quickly</li>
    <li> If you have a beard and just shave your cheeks, this is perfect.  I removed one of the blades, so now I have an extra.  Excellent camping razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves well and it&#x27;s quiet. I have a couple of other brands of portable shavers as well, and they all have their good points. The only negative on this one is that cleaning it is picky work.</li>
    <li> It took about the same time as shaving with a traditional razor, minus the sloppy creams and risk of cutting yourself. Cleaning is easy as vacuuming the headpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely no cons to speak of.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted for travel and it shaves great, Also it can use HQ56 Lift &amp; Cut heads which will make it even better</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, good product, was exactly what I ordered, arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly, thanks</li>
    <li> Small but powerful shaver. Clean shave in less then half the time it takes me using a razor. Bought some rechargeable batteries and am using it every day.</li>
    <li> This is, quite simply, a great little shaver. It is every bit as good as the bigger, more expensive, (and heavier) deluxe Norelco models. Of course, you can shave faster with those bigger models, so I keep the big model at home, and travel with this little gem. It way exceeded my expectations for a close shave, and it is small, and weighs practically nothing.</li>
    <li> The price is good , you have to used battery&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco has long made AAA battery powered razors and most models give very close, smooth shaves.  This new model is no exception.  Whether for touch ups or daily shaving, this works very well without pulling.  Battery life is excellent.</li>
    <li> I just love it. Use it in my car and it made my life easier. :)</li>
    <li> Excellent fort the price and size. Keep in glove box and it does the job.</li>
    <li> This razor is more than what my husband expected, small, light weight, comfortable grip, easy to hold onto, and provides a nice clean, close shave.  Also purchased NiCad batteries and USB battery charger to make it totally portable.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for the performance anywhere.</li>
    <li> Decent shave for what you&#x27;re paying for. Always keep this in my flight bag for work.</li>
    <li> I had about 15~20 years old Phillips travel Razor, it is almost worn out, so I bought new one. New one works fine, however it is about 30% longer and larger here and there, compares to compact older model, so not fit in my travel Razor bag. Travel Razor should be compact in design.</li>
    <li> This is not the best shaver i&#x27;ve had but it is still a good price for it.  It dowsn&#x27;t have the sharpness I am looking for</li>
    <li> This portable shaver has a pretty small shaving area--could be larger. I would have liked a better cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> Good Vendor, good product. Came with batteries and has held charge for weeks.  I have not found it hard to clean.  Great little product.  Update 5/3/16: Had it over a year. Batteries last forever.  Still going strong. Awesome awesome awesome!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use travel case is a bonus</li>
    <li> very cheaply made. Broke after a coup[le of months</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great price,thanks</li>
    <li> Really nice little razor. A good buy for me, for sure.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son, who just started college, so he could carry it in his backpack.  I *especially* wanted this model because the one I have seen in person had a great little black zippered case to protect the shaver, and THIS shaver here says, very specifically:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in the box:&lt;br /&gt;  Philips Norelco Shaver 510&lt;br /&gt;  Protective Cap&lt;br /&gt;  Cleaning Brush&lt;br /&gt;  2 AA batteries&lt;br /&gt;  Travel Case&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See that?  &amp;#34;Travel Case&amp;#34;.  Well, there is NO case.  The shaver came in a blister pack, and there was no case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> A reasonably good shaver for a travel shaver.  It does what it should in giving a fast shave in a compact format.  It&#x27;s size is the strong point--light weight, easy to pack and does not add bulk (large shaver with charger) in packing for a trip.  I recommend it over foil head travel shavers.</li>
    <li> This little razor is &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34;, HOWEVER, I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;travel case&amp;#34; or that I couldn&#x27;t buy one as an accessory. I am happy with the razor itself, bearing in mind that it is not meant to be a regular razor.</li>
    <li> I have both Braun M-60B and PHILIPS PQ206 for 6 mo. After 4 shaves with the Braun I found that it did not shave as good as reviews stated.&lt;br /&gt;Now about the Philips, it gave me a very close shave, remember 4 shaves to do the test on a 2 day beard. So if you want a good shaver that will last, go with the Philips. Its quiet and easy on batteries to. I am picky about smooth shaves and The Philips wins hands down!&lt;br /&gt;..Go ahead get both, in the end you will leave the Braun closed.  Best Price is at you local WalleyWorld $12-13 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;..I am 69 years young and I use the Philips Every Day. however, I know the younger have to make Their Mistakes First.&lt;br /&gt;...It&#x27;s Simple  ..Get The Philips.</li>
    <li> Gives a satisfactory close shave, this is good for getting behind my jaw and my neck.</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly. Works just like my old travel Norelco.</li>
    <li> It is very portable and convenient to use. The product is same as the description in the shopping website. And it deliver very quick.</li>
    <li> Nice little shaver to keep in the car for 5pm.  It&#x27;s worth the price.  My suggestion is to make the protective cover a little tighter because it falls off easily.</li>
    <li> This little razor is perfect for trips that you can store in your bag and it has a clear plastic top so the blades don&#x27;t get damaged. And you dont have to worry about charging it because it runs off 2 AA batteries. This shaver was exactly what I was looking for and I can&#x27;t find a single complaint here</li>
    <li> Prefer over any other as my full time razor, at home or on the go!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Prefer over any other as my full time razor, at home or on the go!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great delivery, great razor</li>
    <li> excellent quality and price</li>
    <li> I have taken the shaver on several trips, 3 weeks of daily use on the same set of alkaline batteries and still running strong.  It gives a fairly fast and comfortable close shave.  However, the lack of a trimmer for sideburns is a big missing for extended travel.  Good for a weekend, but I will be taking my full size Braun shaver with trimmer to Europe.</li>
    <li> Came quick, small and works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time blade shaver. Recent surgery on my dominant hand left me unable to manipulate a razor for a period of time. Since I&#x27;m in a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; capacity, I couldn&#x27;t afford to look homeless when I met a client or a prospect. Not wanting to spend a ton of money on an electric shaver, I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, electric razors (I&#x27;ve had several over the years) cannot match a blade for a close shave. However, they&#x27;re good enough. Given the minimal amount I paid for this shaver, I&#x27;m pleased. In some cases I&#x27;ll need to shave twice a day, but for ordinary use or travel, it&#x27;s good enough. That&#x27;s all I expected, so I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I wanted as a cheap, compact, and adequately close shave. I do have &amp;#34;asian beard&amp;#34; though so YMMV The battery has lasted over 5 months and is still going strong with daily to every other day shaving.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Travel size runs on batteries.</li>
    <li> I genuinely love this shaver a lot compared to the one I had before. I was rolling with the Braun M90 Mobile Shaver for around 8 months. Then it disappeared with my luggage at the airport so needed to get a replacement. The M90 just did not work too well for me, I don&#x27;t know if it was the foil for it or what but it just did not appear to do a good job unless I had very little hair on my face or neck in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tested the Norelco 510 and they are serious about the close shave. It works exceptionally well and with more than a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I honestly wish I got this 8 months ago instead of the M90.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real complaint I have is it does not come with the precision side trimmer like the M90 has but that&#x27;s just nit picking. It costs less than the M90 and works 200% better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Cant beat it for price. Use as a back up and it is great</li>
    <li> I have to shave everyday.  Im in the military and needed something on the run.  Chews my face up, hurts and I only used it one time.  Will never ever ever use again.  Should have stuck with my old 12 dollar one.</li>
    <li> Nifty little shaver! It actually does shave pretty close, minus the skin irritation. My only minor gripe is that it feels like it could break fairly easily...so don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
    <li> Still functioning as of 07/28/2015. My first and forever electric razor.</li>
    <li> great little razor for travel or home.  batteries last surprising long.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have first one for over 15 years, it still working. and I dont like the 3 heads shaver, I like the two heads much more.</li>
    <li> The simple is the best. It is what i need.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Dad who has moderate to severe senile dementia.  He finds shaving too challenging now.  This thing is cheap yet it works brilliantly.  You just press it firmly to the face and in gives a close clean shave.  Dad seemed to love it and that is all I need to know.</li>
    <li> i HAVE BEEN USING THIS ELECTRIC SHAVER FOR ALMOST ONE YEAR NOW. iT IS REALLY GOOD AND MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER EXPENSIVE RAZOR SHAVER.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome little travel razor.</li>
    <li> Shaves as well as my 3 head Norelco electric shaver, but this doesn&#x27;t have hair trimmer.  Great price, and it includes batteries -I plan to use rechargeable Eneloop AA&#x27;s after these wear out. If you look up the replacement heads as described on the box, 2  replacement heads cost slightly more than the price of this shaver, so I am worried that people will just throw this away when it no longer cuts well.</li>
    <li> Great for a day or two away.</li>
    <li> Worthless.  Might work on a peach or a dainty woman&#x27;s fanny, but not a hillbilly&#x27;s, much less a beard!</li>
    <li> Works great, I keep it my car in case I missed a spot on the way to work, or if I get stuck in traffic on the weekends. Try using it in your car, the weird looks you&#x27;ll get from other drivers are worth the price by itself.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars for sure!! Very fast shipping and beautifully packaged! Great shaver!</li>
    <li> Used it as an everyday shaver for a year now.  Still gives a great shave.  It may be a bit slower to shave my face, but it give a complete and close shave as good or better than the triple head shavers.  You can&#x27;t beat this considering the price.</li>
    <li> i have been usign philips and norelco rasors since puberty. have tried other designs than rotating blades, but they damaged my skin by pullin long beard hair rather than cutting.  I was surprisingly amazed that this little rasor felt as comfortable as the old design philips rasors, however it is not as comfortable as the new high end ones nor as fast.  If one is ready to bide their time cutting their beard, this is a very good inexpensive rasor that could be used on a day to day basis, as long as the blade edges do not dull earlier.</li>
    <li> i was skeptical at the first because it for a gift but i make a good choice and my friend love it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great on longer stubble, a few days for me, but works great for a daily, particularly for travel. I keep it in my office in case I&#x27;m meeting a client late in the day or on short notice.</li>
    <li> works better than i expected</li>
    <li> The product is very convenient.  If I don&#x27;t want to mess with water,gel, razor, rinsing... then I can just use my Norelco razor.  It does a pretty good job, but it takes more than one swipe over each area.  It also burns a bit afterward.  Be careful not to press too hard, especially when shaving around the lip area or you will be cut and probably draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because of its size and convenience once in a while or when traveling!</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric razor in 50 plus years----pretty much always a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor knowing it was inexpensive so questioning what quality of shave it would give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of shave ----  not very, mostly stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I like it? Yes! I&#x27;m using it as I have travelled and this provides a pretty quick and nickless alternative to what I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is adequate and I will continue using.</li>
    <li> Good size and a decent shave, not as close as some other models.</li>
    <li> Looked at Consumer reports for the top 3 electric razors - this one was very inexpensive and was in the top 3- this one uses batteries - it&#x27;s a travel razor - my elderly father loves it..</li>
    <li> I dislike rechargeables.  The battery dies at inconvenient moments.  This razor needs two AA cells and its good for another week of hard work.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard hair, but this razor manage to cut it very well. Some bear on my neck is difficult to cut, but I have problem even with blades.</li>
    <li> but it should be design for electric charge</li>
    <li> I questioned how good this saw could be for about $12 but it is a very good little shaver.  Slower than my bigger one but travels well and shaves very close.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Well, worth the price!  It replaces the same Phillips portable electric razor that I purchased in 1991 in Holland at the Airport in Amsterdam. Have tried other portables over the years but none even come close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a world traveler, I use it all the time on  planes,  in taxies, on boats and other travel times to always look sharp for meeting people. I have a very heavy beard and get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow very early in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries last a long time. Fits in my pocket or briefcase for instant use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service but nothing new About that for Amazon thanks</li>
    <li> Good little shaver.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this Philips Norelco PQ208/40 Travel Electric razor for a one month trip to Europe. It worked flawlessly every day. It gave me a nice close shave and the two AA alkaline batteries lasted the entire month without evidence of weakening. I use a high end Norelco rechargable shaver as my every day shaver at home, and this Travel one shaves just as nicely (except with two heads instead of three it takes about 30 seconds longer for my shave). It is also nice and quiet. I bought this travel shaver because it is smaller and lighter than my regular electric shaver and I don&#x27;t have to worry about bringing the charger. I did bring two spare AA batteries, but didn&#x27;t need them. This is the perfect travel shaver and with the bargain price is a cut above.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it. Used every day for 6 weeks while traveling. Recommend flipping one battery when packing in case on/off switch accidentally activted. Otherwise, one set of batteries was all I needed.</li>
    <li> Norelco has been making this product for about sixty years. That&#x27;s how great it is.  EXCEPT.  It used to have a functional design so it could be stored upright on its end.  Now it is cutesy, roundish and curved such that it topples over of its own weight even when placed on the flat business end.  You can only store it flat on its back like a dead roach!</li>
    <li> Easy to pack, easy and quick to use. Amazing value.</li>
    <li> So I still haven&#x27;t decided on a new model corded/cordless rechargeable shaver. I bought the Panasonic wet/dry travel shaver and had high hopes for it but after a few months it started not cutting well and wasn&#x27;t to great to begin with, but was cheap. Read my other reviews to find it.&lt;br /&gt;  I wish I had seen this Norelco first. I have always loved rotaries and will never try a foil shaver again. First I have to say, I didn&#x27;t buy it here, as it is only $10 at W**M**T.&lt;br /&gt;  At first I thought the batteries that came with it were half dead, but with fresh batteries, I noticed it was still very quiet and I mistook this as a weak unit. It is however just nice and quiet.&lt;br /&gt; The shaver cuts my heavy beard very close and leaves my skin smooth. I use rechargeable AA batteries to run it and get a couple weeks of shaves before recharge. It&#x27;s easy to clean, just pop off the heads and rinse under water and let dry before putting back onto the body. I use the brush to clean the body after dumping out any cut whiskers. Do not rinse body under water, it&#x27;s not water proof. It comes with a semi hard zippered case and makes a very compact package.&lt;br /&gt; For the price I paid, it&#x27;s well worth it and pays for itself in soap and razors immediately.</li>
    <li> it very good if you had few mustache ,easy to clean, i will recommend for anyone who had few mustache</li>
    <li> i bought this for around $12 in November on Walmart.com. It&#x27;s still shaving pretty good. FYI replacement blades for this are the hq56 heads.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend so he can throw it in his gym bag. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Even though I think this is listed as a travel size, I bought it for my son who had just started shaving. We were worried about him using an actual razor. This seems to work great for him. He likes it. My husband even uses it from time to time!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave as much as your average guy because I like to grow my beard and I find it sexy and hot. Anyway, why this shaver if I won&#x27;t use it right? Well, there was this bet that involves me shaving my beard off....I lost.</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly well, and has kept up for years.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  He loves it.  This works better than the razor he has at home!</li>
    <li> Bought this and went on vacation for a week.  Was very pleased with this product, gave a clean shave.  A sideburn trimmer, like most electrics have, would be a nice add-on, but not having one is not a major drawback to me.  This razor is pretty basic, but it does what its supposed to do and is a very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Pretty good portable shaver, not exactly like the original but nearly as good. I use it regularly in my travels over several years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first electric razor and I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 weeks but I&#x27;m quite happy with it. It takes longer for me to shave than with a normal razor, but I feel the trade off of not being able to cut myself and no dealing with dull razor blades worth while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely good for travel.</li>
    <li> My husband does a fair amount of traveling and he LOVES this razor. Small and easy to pack and gives a nice close shave!</li>
    <li> I am a blade shaver, but this is a great backup.  This was a replacement after my previous one finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;.  Ironically, I am currently in a sling after shoulder surgery, and being able to use the Norelco keeps me groomed while I mend.</li>
    <li> You get an amazing close shave from this little jewel. I didn&#x27;t expect the quality for such a low price. My beard grows quite fast so I can use it later in the day for a quick touchup. Thank you Philips Norelco!</li>
    <li> bought when going through a family emergency for him. But then needed something for a girl. Bought this and it works so well for her. Quick legs and underarms. Smooth. Quick. And perfect. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband is in a nursing home, and after breaking four expensive razors, I decided to try this battery operated one. It works just as good,  and I don&#x27;t have to  pay a lot</li>
    <li> Great little razor.....and it shaves close.....loved it so much I bought another one!</li>
    <li> Compact, cuts as well as my  expensive electric shaver; so far, have had 30 shaves on 2 AA batteries and still going strong.</li>
    <li> exactly as described and delivered very promptly. i used this travel razor when traveling to my company headquarters and it worked out very well</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this product because it was relatively cheap. But lo and behold, it works just like any other electric razor. It&#x27;s quiet; it gives me a perfect smooth cut as a result. I guess big things can come in a small package like this. Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> It is kinda slow, but the shave is very smooth. Not recommended for pubes.</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves even better than any triple head from the same company. The sophisticated &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; don&#x27;t work any better! This one does a great job, not just for traveling, but for daily use.</li>
    <li> Better than expected, especially for the excellent price of this brand name. Also, nice and small (and self-sharpening), so good to keep handy in the car.</li>
    <li> More noisy than thought, returned it but had to pay postage.</li>
    <li> Much more compact than a full size Norelco but still a little large and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve tried smaller foil shavers and nothing compares to a Norelco for my beard.  This shaver is definitely worth it, performs well, and has AA x 2 batteries that are easily replaced.  They last a good long time though!</li>
    <li> Took it on a two week trip overseas.  It was clearly not as powerful as my Braun Series 5 home shaver, but is more than 1/2 the size, and much lighter.  Furthermore, it ran on batteries so I did not have to have a charger (nor converter).  Saving was adequate, and the original batteries lasted the entire trip.  So it was quite fine for trips.</li>
    <li> A small, easily controlled shaver you can put in your pocket and it runs on AA batteries.  No, you can&#x27;t &#x27;wash&#x27; it out but it&#x27;s relatively easy to clean and the time you take doing so will be compensated by the ease of use.  Oh, did I mention it cost less than $15!</li>
    <li> I actually blade shave but I use a small electric for touch up in some hard to get at areas.&lt;br /&gt;This is really, really nice!  Small, inexpensive, uses AA batteries and does a really great job.&lt;br /&gt;If needed, I could shave with just this little shaver.  Very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> Works as good as my 90:00 shaver. Wish it had the sideburn trimmer</li>
    <li> I liked it for shaving a light beard,but I doubt it would shave a heavy beard because lack of power.....</li>
    <li> it is tiny, handy and working well so far</li>
    <li> The price on Amazon is almost double that of Walmart and yes, its the exact same model, I had this on my Amazon wish list but ran across it at Wallyworld for $12.97, shaved with it and it works fantastic!! I figured if it wasn&#x27;t great I would use it for long hunting and fishing trips, no need, I will use it at home for typical use. I was looking to try something different from the gillete 5 blade hand razor because the refill 4 pack is $16.00, W. T. F.? this battery operated shaver will save me close to $300.00 a year!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add, as another reviewer wrote,, the majority of the time Amazon items are much, much cheaper than any where else but,, every once in a while they aren&#x27;t, I usually triple check if I&#x27;m not sure of the price....</li>
    <li> Battery lasts forever - its perfect for my intl travel - no messing with plugs and adaptors... I use it every day...&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely 100% would buy again..</li>
    <li> Very Good.......Excellent</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, takes a little time but quicker than a wet shave. Not a replacement for a safety razor and shave soap but useful for tidying up the whiskers in a speedy fashion between shaves.</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my dad. He is happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> It works fine, but wouldn&#x27;t use it on daily basis - safety-razor does it&#x27;s job better.&lt;br /&gt;But this &#x27;Travel Electric Razor&#x27; useful when you are not at home</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t grow that much hair and I didn&#x27;t want a $100 razor so I tried this out. Was a bit worried that it might be a little too cheap and therefore, junk, but it works great for me. Does the job as well as my dad $100 one</li>
    <li> bought this for my son and he loves it.. it works well and is very easy to carry around. Good</li>
    <li> I am a blade user and I bought this for short weekend trips. I love it because it works extremely well if you don&#x27;t try to rush your shave. Best of all, it runs on 2 AA batteries so you can use it anywhere. I still prefer shaving with a safety razor but this is a good substitute.</li>
    <li> This razor is small and easy to hold and quiet and effective.  My beard is not heavy, so that helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an emergency leg fuzzy fixer. The two heads work even better than the classic bar style electric shaver head. I had a three head Norelco that ended up chewing up my knees, but this one works smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cut me over body areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is quiet and the weight is decent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head pops off pretty easily, though, so be careful. Overall a great purchase at a decent price</li>
    <li> i am very pleased with the razor, gives me a close shave, easy to carry,good value for the price excellent</li>
    <li> Nice razor, small size great for travel, works almost as well as full size, I bought it for my teen aged son so a full sized razor wouldn&#x27;t be too overwhelming and he loves it  (he doesn&#x27;t need it everyday though so I don&#x27;t know how much life it has)</li>
    <li> Good blades, good power enough for the facial hair I get. Cleans my face up really nicely and in a shorter amount of time.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this shaver as the reviews were excellent- mostly all 4 and 5 star.  Upon usage, however, although it worked well for the short time I used it (before returning it).  It just didn&#x27;t get a close shave from it.  Otherwise it was fine.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not enough power! There are better products out there,  I bought a Remington bht-600. For $25 to replace this one.</li>
    <li> I had a very expensive electric razor and this modern inexpensive razor does just as good a job. The older I get the more I hate shaving, I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t go back to an electric razor years ago. I pull this thing out every other day and in just about three minutes I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s very easy to clean and since I use rechargeable batteries it&#x27;s inexpensive to run. With the cost of razors these days if this little gem lasts me more than a few months I&#x27;ll have gotten more than my money&#x27;s worth out of it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the quality seems okay and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t last much longer.</li>
    <li> I would actually use this instead of the regular one as it is very cheap and more effective in my opinion! The heads are large and work well.</li>
    <li> My husband is in the Army, so he has to shave everyday, sometimes twice a day.  He uses a blade about 75% of the time, but he uses this for touch ups in his 5 o&#x27;clock shadow gets too heavy or if he gets called in early and doesn&#x27;t have time to shave with a blade.  It&#x27;s small, light, easy to use, and easy to clean.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s hard to shave certain parts of his face like under his bottom and right under his nose.  It also doesn&#x27;t work very well if he has more than a day of growth.  He says he&#x27;d never be able to use it as his primary razor, but for touch ups and the occasional &amp;#34;running late shave in the car&amp;#34; day, it works great.  So I highly recommend it as long as you&#x27;re not going to expect it to do too much.</li>
    <li> Smaller than a regular Norelco, it is ideal for travel. Just be sure to carry extra batteries (AAA), as there is no real warning before the batteries are out. The unit is much cheaper than buying replacement heads, so I bought a couple of these to use instead of the regular shaver. It gets the job done, and is much more compact.</li>
    <li> perfect for on the go! and my favorite brand and model for electric razors!</li>
    <li> Excellent buy for the price!!!! I got this two days back for my father and he loved it, there was a cleaning brush along with it.&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect Travel Shaver, just replace two AA batteries and you are good to go and AA batteries are available everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Its very stylish in looks and very portable, the only -ve is that it&#x27;s not Waterproof which is OK for the price that you are paying for this product.&lt;br /&gt;+ve&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;IT does give a very close shave and its not noisy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would for sure recommend this to anyone who are thinking about quitting the Use and throw blades...Switch to this and you will love it.</li>
    <li> Id rather shave. This did not work after the second use. My hairs kept getting pulled. hurt like hell. this only works if you want to cut your hair that&#x27;s already short. Save your money and buy a more powerful one.</li>
    <li> I  got my first Norelco razor on my twelfth birthday ! Sense then I have tried several others but always end up with a Norelco twin , I tried  a triple head but that third cutter is always in the way . I consider more than two heads a waste of time and money !!! The reason I received that 1st one,  my bread started growing when I was 11.I used a safety razor to start with . Dad shaved with a straight razor then got one of the 1st Norelco&#x27;s ,he tried a Sunbeam 1st but didn&#x60;t like it . I tried his Sunbeam but when he got his Norelco I used it all the time . So they, Mon and Dad decided to get me one so I wasn&#x60;t using his all the time !!!! I guess He didn&#x60;t like me using his razor !!  That was 64 years ago so I think I have tested them enough !! This little Travel razor is about the same size as my 1st plug in one just a little different shape and not as heavy !!! I really like it and the shave lasts almost as long as a safety razor shave !! And my wife likes that !! And I don&#x60;t have to go to any lather etc. trouble .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!! Dave .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11</li>
    <li> Works great but the protective cap falls off very-easily and lets the screens get damaged, requiring that you buy new rotary blade and screen sets.  Tape works to keep the cap on but looks ugly and feels sticky.</li>
    <li> My fathers fav razor so far - but they dont last too long</li>
    <li> Always preferred the rotating heads, but my 3 heads uit is too bulky for the pack it in the overhead era.  Had a prior version of the bettery operated 2 head unit for over 15 years, but alsa it came to an end.  This one is a great replacement. Sizewise about the same, slightly lighter and definately a nice close shave. Batteries last well and fits into my small overnight toiletries bag.  I much prefer this to the vibrating foils</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for over 6 months now. It still shaves as close as when I first got it. I use it when I&#x27;m working at the fire station. It rivals the razor I have at home. A lot of value for a small amount of money.</li>
    <li> Great first razor ! Bought it for my son.</li>
    <li> Did not come a case. Disappointing.  Prefer the Braun brand better.</li>
    <li> Using every day Shaves close.</li>
    <li> just as advertised and just what I wanted at the price I wanted to price!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, clear shave&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning takes the most time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of Norelco products. I just didn&#x27;t want to spend a great deal of money. This is works and the batteries do last for quite a while.  Adendum: Although this little &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; shaver works, its shave falls short if you want a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shave. It will do in a pinch but not as a primary shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a great compact shaver.  I have always used Norelco shavers (I have one that is 20 years old and still runs perfectly) and this new one does not disappoint.  I do not like the triple head shavers because i have a beard and they are harder to use in tight spaces, so, this is just what I need,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who knows a good thing when I find it.  My previous travel shaver was a similar brand/model that lasted nearly 9 years but recently failed when the battery leaked.  It was my good fortune to find this updated model that works just as well as the former one, in fact I bought two!</li>
    <li> It is small, But does a great job; I have been testing it for over two weeks, Still on running on 2 double A batteries.</li>
    <li> I own the Panasonic ES3831 and Braun M60 travel razors and like them both.  Recently purchased the PQ208/40 to give it a try and in my experience it gives a comparably close shave to these other razors (if I shave with the Panasonic or Braun after shaving with the PQ208/40, almost no additional whiskers are removed),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PQ208/40 does take a significantly longer time to achieve comparably close shave, in part because of the need to oscillate over the skin for the dual heads to cover everything... roughly about twice as long for full day&#x27;s beard, touch ups might be shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the PQ208/40 is dramatically quieter -- giving off a low-pitch metallic whir rather than a loud electric motor buzz.  So the PQ208/40 may be much better suited to in the office or on-the-go touch ups, where you might like to make it less than obvious that you&#x27;re grabbing a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does not offer running water cleanup, by tapping the removable head canister and brushing or blowing out the razor cavity, the PQ208/40 cleans up as quickly and easily as the Panasonic and the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physically it&#x27;s about the same size as the Panasonc, which is bigger than the Braun.  It does have a travel lock on the switch and a cover which clips over the heads (clip could be a bit firmer to ensure cover does not come off btw).  Surface texture of much of &#x27;handle&#x27; area is, surprisingly, very smooth to the point of being a bit slippery if, say, your hand is wet, but this is not a major issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the dual rotary heads would seem to be a lot more durable than the foils in the other two razors.  So, all in all a very good option for a travel razor, imho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE @5 MONTHS (9/28/14):  Still can highly recommend this -- blades seem to have retained their sharpness; if I use it daily I replace batteries about every 2-3 weeks and it remains very easy to clean.  One other thing I&#x27;ve noticed for travel re battery life/&#x27;fail soft&#x27; -- if I&#x27;ve gone a bit too long on a set of batteries the shaver still gives a close shave, but it just takes longer.ve gone a bit too long on a set of batteries the shaver still gives a close shave, but it just takes longer.</li>
    <li> Am 83 years old and always used a Gillette razor. Price was reasonable so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it 3 times and very surprised how well it works. Only takes a few minutes and gives a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;Of course cleaning the razor per instructions takes longer than the shave but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;At this price could afford to buy a new one yearly.</li>
    <li> Even comes with two batteries and small cleaning brush. Works almost as well as my big Norelco Razor. Easy to hold and control on those facial curves around the chin and mouth. It works exactly as I had hoped and expected. Now I can get rid of my old poorly working travel razor.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user (over 30 years) of Norelco Phillips Electric shavers although for traveling I have always used a foil shaver mainly for it&#x27;s lightweight and compact design.  Since my latest travel shaver is about ready to give up, I started looking for a replacement and saw this Norelco model at a very reasonable price, I thought I&#x27;d check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one performs comparable to my 3 rotary blade home unit with lift and cut blades.  It is a lot quieter than my old foil shaver although it appears it will take up a bit more space on my toiletry bag.  The motor seems to be as powerful as a full sized version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit comes with a handsome black soft sided but rigid fitted zipper case which offers good protection for traveling.  It also comes complete with Alkaline AA batteries which I immediately replaced with disposable Lithium AAs.  A minor issue but like ALL of my other Norelcos, the plastic cover for the blade is rather flimsy.  You would think after all these years they can come up with a better design.  Typically the retainer tabs will break off and the cover will no longer stay in place.  From the looks of it, this will do the same thing in no time.  I hope I am mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is a great value!  A good quality product for less than $13 shipped.</li>
    <li> Very handy, inexpensive electric razor.  Runs on batteries, so if you travel you don&#x27;t have to worry about the difference in electricity.  So inexpensive, you don&#x27;t care if you loose it.  Gives a quality shave.</li>
    <li> Pro: Less expensive than a pack of Gillette razors. Now I can shave without shaving Gel and mostly without a mirror&lt;br /&gt;Con:extra expense of batteries</li>
    <li> Great razor, after four weeks I&#x27;m still on the original batteries.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00AEINQ9K Philips Norelco PQ208/40 Travel Electric Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver because I stupidly broke my Remington while trying to clean it. I saw shavers with much better reviews than for this Philips Norelco, but I couldn&#x27;t see spending the prices they demanded. Anyway, after trying this shaver--once was enough--I came back to Amazon looking for a shaver that would shave (this Norelco definitely doesn&#x27;t). Anyway, I had decided upon a $40+ Remington because it had NO one or two-star reviews, but I first tried once again to fix my broken Remington. This time I succeeded in fixing it, and now I&#x27;ll probably be using this Norelco for a paper weight. I might add that I&#x27;m seventy-six, and I have have owned many electric shavers in my life, but I never found a Norelco that was satisfactory. Remingtons yes, but Norelcos no. That may be simply a matter of personal preference, but that&#x27;s been my experience. Anyway, I was unable to get a good shave with this Philips Norelco. I might have, if I had persisted, but my face was starting to feel raw, so I didn&#x27;t want to continue.</li>
    <li> very convenient size, but seems a little underpowered compared to my previous Philips travel razor.  The lack of a trimmer is also missed.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for our trip to Europe. He says it works well. Not as good as his one at home but perfect for a space saving travel razor.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly, very quiet and leaves your skin smooth!</li>
    <li> I sent it back it would not shave close...just a toy.</li>
    <li> Along with the Braun M90, I also bought this shaver for my father to use when he travels since he has such thick beard growth overnight. He loves both and even requested me to buy  both again to gift to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great little compact electric razor, excellent quality materials and operation. If it were lighter, not quite so heavy, ie: used 2 AAA instead of 2 AA batteries, it would be perfect 5-star for carryon travel.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a while now and it actually is working very well. I use it when i&#x27;m running late to work to save some time. It does a pretty good job for a travel razor. i picked up a remington travel foil razor , and the Philips Norelco works much better. i also use rechargeable batteries 2900mah in it and they last for weeks with heavy use.</li>
    <li> Better than most full size razors I have owned.</li>
    <li> Though most people use electric razors for their faces, I prefer to shave my head with it.  I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with Remington foil razors, so decided to go an entirely different direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that many reviewers like this razor, so it may very well be good for facial hair.  However, it&#x27;s just not up to the task of shaving hair from one&#x27;s head.  The shaving process takes 30+ minutes and still leaves stubble that&#x27;s quite rough.  Additionally, the blades get clogged easily and need a thorough top to bottom cleaning every two days or so.  It&#x27;s not exactly what I was hoping for when I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this razor a good one?  I don&#x27;t know - the other reviewers seem to like it for facial hair.  However, if you&#x27;re thinking of using it to shave your head, I strongly recommend going elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I bought a Panasonic ES38331K ($13.98), Braun M90 ($18.79) and Philips Norelco PQ208/40 ($14.97) to replace a broken travel shaver. I shaved half my face with each shaver, making three pairwise comparisons over three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic had two advantages. It was the most energetic, sounding a lot more powerful. It also was the only wet/dry shaver of the three. But the shave on the Braun was smoother. The Braun also has a built-in trimmer that works well, and the cover is integrated into the design. The Norelco was too weak, not giving a good shave. It was so weak that I changed the batteries on it, thinking that maybe the batteries were depleted, but there was no improvement with fresh batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give the Braun M90 five stars, the Panasonic four stars and the Norelco one star. Either the Braun or the Panasonic will work well as a travel shaver. Don&#x27;t waste money on the Norelco.</li>
    <li> I recently had lymph nodes removed under my arm during cancer surgery and my oncologist told me that I would need to use an electric razor because any nicks could result in lympedema, swelleing of the arm. After looking in stores &amp; online, not wanting the straight shaver that looked like it would nick, I decided on this one because it looked like it would be gentle and it had decent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I nicked my self several times before I even realized what was happening. When I went for my next radiation treatment I had red blotches. They told me to just forget shaving at all. I was so disappointed in this shaver.</li>
    <li> This one is the best yet!  I&#x27;ve had 3 Phillips and one Panasonic with a foil comb.  The old Phillips battery razors aren&#x27;t used any more because I can&#x27;t get new cutters.  this unit is smaller - almost too small! - and works very well.  I will use it traveling and keep it in the glove-compartment of the car at home.  I like it because it takes regular batteries and doesn&#x27;t need to be re-charged which gets difficult sometimes in foreign countries.  I&#x27;m very glad I bought.  Another point - each of the Phillips razors have been less expensive than the previous one.  Phillips makes a good product.  If you buy a rotary-cutter razor like this one, you must expect it to not shave best until after four or five shaves, as it takes about that long for the cutters to lap themselves in.</li>
    <li> Best Razor I have ever owned. I have paid more for other inferior razors. I have had it for 2 weeks and I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2. One for home and 1 for my trailer because they are affordable.</li>
    <li> I have been a user of multiple PhiIlips shavers for many years. I had a Philips battery operated travel shaver for 10+ years. I bought this new model as the replacement. This model has many design flaws. First, the on/off button can easily be triggered. When I took it on my 1st trip, I put this device in my toiletry bag and when I reached my destination the new alkaline batteries was already flat. I have no choice but to remove the battery and store them separately whenever I took it for travel. This is troublesome. Then, the battery compartment cover can easily be popped open. This happened even when I hold the device to shave.  Third, when I am on he 3rd trip and took it out of my toiletry bag, the blades and housing popped off (you only remove the head when you do cleaning). I will throw this away and shop for another brand.  Amazon please don&#x27;t sell this product.</li>
    <li> Have been a Norelco user since 1957 and still have my travel electric razor from that era. Have purchased, used &amp; discarded several travel razors over time, then I found this one. This is so much better than the others. Never again to I use other brands!!</li>
    <li> I have it for about 1mo now and had it fall onto the floor and still working great and would recommend it again</li>
    <li> I have used Phillips Norelco razors for years and have never been dissatified with any of them and so with this&lt;br /&gt;product it exceeded my expecttations by a lot,would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> The same thing as I used before, with less noise, but with worse make. It is a good choice for regular cases.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, battery-operated, works extremely well. Nothing bad to say about this product. Perfect for travel or even general use if you wanted to.</li>
    <li> I bought it for travel, but now I use it daily. It shaves very close - even in the neck -painlessly and SO QUIETLY I can use it anywhere without anyone hearing it.</li>
    <li> This does really well for my husband small but works great!</li>
    <li> great little shaver no problems at all delivered on time well packed great!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome little shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty amazing little shaver that does a BETTER job than its expensive bigger brothers.  The battery life on this thing is pretty amazing, too.  I thought it would eat up batteries, but like the energizer bunny it keeps going-and-going-and going.  I&#x27;ve only replaced the batteries once after several months of use.  Probably shave on a average of two-three times a week on my way to work.  (Averaged with travel to work and travel away where I&#x27;m not using it because I&#x27;ve flown somewhere and its not in use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really no negatives.  I purchased it as a back-up to my Gillette Razor with umpteen billion blades if I forget to shave in the morning or was in a rush to work.  I find I use it for my main shaving needs and skip the shaving cream and razor - the shave is that close and I save time by shaving in the car versus at home.  Some may criticize me for driving and shaving, but in DC traffic, you&#x27;re not moving a lot of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, two big thumbs up for this amazing little shaver.  I have gone through larger bigger name brand shavers, but this little works better than those I&#x27;ve tried before.  I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some time to get the really close shave, but as I&#x27;m driving to work stuck in traffic I have ample time.</li>
    <li> Overseas travel creates power adaptor problems.  This product is just the right size for travel kit and batteries make power source irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This little shaver got good reviews.  They were not lying.  It works great and lasts a long time on two AA batteries.  I have used it every day for a month and it is still going.  I don&amp;#34;t think I will ever buy an expensive, fancy shaver again.  I think I will buy another one for my younger son.</li>
    <li> Shaves easily and without irritation and -- most importantly -- doesn&#x27;t leave a small patch of unharvested stubble like the portable foil razors do.</li>
    <li> There are many fancy electric shavers out there and I am sure they may suit folks with fancy stubble.  But if you are looking for something to knock the ugly off with minimal inconvenience this little gem is the best I have had.  If I need to fluff to make an impression I would probably use a razor but just for getting read for a regular work day this is the choice to make.  Unless your a fancy cat....then go pay a fancy price.  What are you doing looking at this?</li>
    <li> I used to get a ingrown hairs and irritation a lot with my traditional safety razor, even with shaving cream and moisturizer. I decided to switch to an electric razor and that has improved the situation. This razor is sooo easy to use. Pop in 2 batteries and buzz away. Pop the top to clear out the debris, and I typically just blow it for good measure. Been using it for months now with no issue.</li>
    <li> This small cordless electric shaver gives a nice close cut and I especially like the fact that it runs on two AA batteries. I use rechargeable batteries, so there is no problem with having to buy a lot of batteries. I keep one at home and one in my car.</li>
    <li> this little travel razor works as expected; good purchase for any trip to leave your good shaver home</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand the passionately favorable reviews on this.  It pretty much performs like a $15 razor.  As someone who is used to shaving with a blade, this doesn&#x27;t even come close.  I bought it to leave at the cabin and use while up there.  If i were to do it over again I&#x27;d get a slightly more expensive one that is rechargeable (the batteries don&#x27;t seem to last all that long).  That being said, I&#x27;d grow a beard before I&#x27;d spend $250 on a razor.</li>
    <li> I usually only have to shave twice a week. And it doesn&#x27;t really grow that thick. With that said this works perfect for me. But if I had a lot of facial hair I would need a better one.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave that close...</li>
    <li> The BEST erazor I have ever used! Use it every day. My $129 Norelco can&#x27;t deliver like this little guy can. No cuts, no irritation, no heat and runs off batteries. No downside. BUY THIS RAZOR! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a two-week camping trip to the big island of Hawaii. It worked flawlessly for the duration, and did as good a job as my regular shaver (which is also a Norelco). Having just two heads instead of three, it&#x27;s actually more pleasant to use. I can&#x27;t imagine this razor irritating anyone&#x27;s skin (especially when compared to a Remington).</li>
    <li> Using it daily for more than 2 months on 2 AA batteries. Still shaves great. And you don&#x27;t need a plug. Perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to except the little 1 inch trimmer/groomer razors. It isn&#x27;t very loud and is a close enough shave. It drains batteries pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t work well once the batteries start losing life.</li>
    <li> I had an old Phillips Norelco that finally quit on me. Instead of purchasing parts I bought a new one. It&#x27;s portable, it&#x27;s small and fits in the palm of my hand. I place it in the old pouch and off I go. It&#x27;s a great little tool. I love it</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Phillips rotary electric razors for years, and the PQ208/40 shaves me well and is small so ideal for travel.</li>
    <li> This razor works better than my corded razor at home that cost me 3 times as much!  Highly recommended, especially for travelling!</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver. I had an older model but the motor in one is much smoother and quieter. I would buy from  this seller again.</li>
    <li> Nice travel razor. The shave is surprisingly close, and it&#x27;s reasonably quiet. Takes up very little space in your bag. Not especially comfy WHILE you&#x27;re shaving, but no discomfort afterwards. Its power button&#x27;s placement can be a little inconvenient (i.e., resulting in some unplanned shutoffs), but it&#x27;s not a huge issue. A big bonus--two AA batteries last much much longer in it than expected.</li>
    <li> I bought it for its price. It&#x27;s worthy.</li>
    <li> We purchased this razor as a first razor for our son.  I figured small and simple would be the best bet for his first razor.  He loves it.  It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t pull, and is easy to clean.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a simple razor for travel, or for a first experience with a cost effective, well made razor.</li>
    <li> A good little travel razor.</li>
    <li> It works great for traveling</li>
    <li> This is a great travel razor.  It works as well as the larger Norelcos and is the perfect razor for traveling.  Since it was Amazon Prime, it came in two days as advertised.</li>
    <li> I used the razor just a few times, and it perform well. I have used other razors from Phillips Norelco before; they are well made and the rotary blade last a long time too. I expect the same performance out of this little traveler razor too.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item to try out for quick on the road shaves.&lt;br /&gt;The units is small and lightweight, measuring approximately 4x2-1/8x1-1/4.  All plastic construction except for the heads.&lt;br /&gt;Powered by 2 AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Based upon only use of less than a week, I have found that the unit operates pretty quiet and provides a decent close shave, although I do have to pass over the area more than once.  I experienced no razor burns but I have had an occasion where it seemed to pull hair rather than cut.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the plastic construction, I have no idea on durability or longivitiy.  This remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;Since power is provided by 2 AA batteries, shaving performance will probably be dependent upon battery power level at moment of  use.  Also, I am still gauging battery life based on frequency of use, this also remains to be seen.  Since I use exclusively rechargeable batteries, I await when the supplied batteries need to be replaced and see how the unit performs with rechargeables.&lt;br /&gt;The unit does disassemble for cleaning and does need a good clean after 2-3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am satisfied with the performance of this unit but am still up in the air regarding durability and longivity.</li>
    <li> This is my second PQ208.  The first one lasted for years and I look forward to another long product life.  I use this when I travel and in general the shave quality is equal or better than my expensive Braun.  The difficult choice will be when my Braun dies to just buy another Norelco.</li>
    <li> Size is good and the shave is really expectacular for an electric tiny appliance besides the price that is incredible.</li>
    <li> Good for what it advertised to do.  I take on mission trips where I may not have running water. Not an &amp;#34;aqua velva&amp;#34; smooth shave, but good enough. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> ...but I have been using it daily for more than 2 months on the original batteries and it is still going strong.  I was concerned and a bit disappointed when I received it, but am perfectly satisfied now.  I do think it should have been made clear in the descripton however, that it was battery powered and not rechargeable.  I replaced a Norelco three-blade rechargeable that i&#x27;d had for years with this one.  For the price I&#x27;m &amp;#34;Happy, Happy, Happy&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Fantastic little shaver.  I have always used Phillips shavers and with the difficulties of carry-on luggage I had switch to another brand for travel.  I was thrilled to find this diminutive shaver and even more thrilled that it works so well. The batter seems to last forever.  No more foil shavers for traveling!  If you are a Philips guy (girl?) this is the travel shaver for you!</li>
    <li> This shaver is one of the best that i purchased I love it and enjoy it,i can recommend this product. the best NORELCO.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine on an online auction site for $9.99; what a steal but I thought it came with a cord. I almost cancel my purchased until I found out what they sold for here. I was leary of it being battery operated like a toy and all. Was pleasantly surprised by the shave just about as good of shave as with the cheap disposable razors I have used for many years; disliked having to lather up and all the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure there are better electric shavers one can purchase but not at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a brush, batteries and nice leather like bag. Use replacement heads model HQ56&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m putting mine in my case for when I visit family. Small enough to even fit in a mans shirt pocket</li>
    <li> Perfect travel razor for my husband!</li>
    <li> Irritated my face to the point where I never wanted to use it again.</li>
    <li> I got this product from Amazon, about a month ago. It did not shave well the first time I used it and I got a terrible skin rash, which lasted days, instead. Therefore, I don&#x27;t plan to use it again. Unfortunately, I took too long to return it, so I&#x27;m just stuck with it. My bad--live and learn. I hope this will be helpful.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Does a good job on a camping weekend, Thanks!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS. I OWN AN OLD MODEL 108 THAT STILL WORKING SINCE 1995. THIS ONE IS MORE REFINED.</li>
    <li> I bought this for an additional unit that I keep in my desk.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I like using an electric razor with just two sets of blades. I find them easier to use on my face. This style has been around for several years and works quite well.</li>
    <li> I like the razor, I just wish it had a bit more power. It works well, I am just the impatient type I guess.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I think it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this kind of shaver for many years. it is small and reaches every angle of my face. close shave like many other new shavers and much lower price. I am using it every other day and the battery still is going on. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have had the first generation of Philips Travel Razor for 20 years by my girlfriend (now my wife).  It is so reliable and convenient, never had a problem. It found the latest generation and bought one to try. It is great with a little difference from the first generation. I bought another 4 and gave to my friends as gifts. Philips is great.</li>
    <li> Good little shaver for the price. Takes longer than a full size.</li>
    <li> I could not believe the quality and comfort of the shave from this tiny extremely quiet battery operated razor, the only thing I can say is Fantastic, especially the price.</li>
    <li> 1 to 10 (heaviest) my beard would be a 8 with a neck prone to ingrown hair.  This razor is perfect for evening touch ups and a morning shave in a clutch.  As mentioned in other reviews use light pressure when shaving and use the talc stick found here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Remington-SP5-Pre-Shave-Stick/dp/B002SO8IMS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1399169236&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;remington+face+saver4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the best shaver but the best $12 shaver.  But if you only need an occasional touch up it is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  The only thing lacking is a trimmer head.  I bought two - one for travel and one for home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries seem to last a good while.  Haven&#x27;t had to replace yet after travel and home use for a month, so I can&#x27;t say how long yet.</li>
    <li> I have several electric razors and this is the one I reach for every time.  I have bought two more for the car and the travel kit.  They are simply the best razor I own.</li>
    <li> Nice product. will buy again .</li>
    <li> This product is price cheap high quality and performance and practical I like it.. I recommend it to ppl who dont mind battery operated razor</li>
    <li> This Razor is the best and has never been the problem.</li>
    <li> This razor was a pleasant surprise.  It is designed well and is small enough to be packed is a suitcase or your briefcase. I was pleased that it provides a very close shave. It has only two rotating blades where my plug-in razor has three, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem at all. The only way I can get a closer shave is to use my Gillette Sensor blade, shaving against the grain, while taking a hot steamy shower. And that is not that much better than the closeness this razor provides.&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of replaceable batteries since it eliminates the problem of having to wait for a recharge when you least expected it and you don&#x27;t need to carry the charger cord and transformer with you when you travel. Carrying two extra AA batteries with you takes no extra room in your briefcase.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that the batteries might not last very long. It turns out I was worrying for no reason. The batteries that came in the shaver have lasted now for 8 weeks (56 shaves) and I&#x27;m guessing it will most likely go another week. After 4 or 5 weeks the motor sounds like it is running slow and I was tempted to change the batteries. I decided to continue until it actually stopped or began to pull as I shaved.  At 8 weeks it sounds like it is running very slow but in fact it still shaves just fine.&lt;br /&gt;The head cleans very well and very easily with a couple taps on the counter and blow into the head and into the razor while over the sink.  The head snaps into place and is released by a little button. The head cover also snaps into place, stays in place well enough to keep it from falling off in your suitcase, and it covers the head release button so that it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get pushed during travel.  And last but not least is the great price which includes a set of Philips batteries.</li>
    <li> Maybe a different perspective:  I had to go the hospital for 2 1/2 days. When I left, I saw a guy using a foil shaver to shave off his one-week old beard. It took him literally FOREVER. The Philips PQ208/40 by contrast handles long stubbles and in fact even a three-weeks old beard EXTREMELY well. No &#x27;biting&#x27;, no painful pulling of single hairs. For the daily shave the Philips takes longer (in comparison to a foil shaver), but nothing beats the rotary heads of a Philips shaver for a &#x27;vacation&#x27; beard.</li>
    <li> perfect to go to the hospital but not an everyday se. I prefer blades</li>
    <li> Works well. Nice and small.</li>
    <li> Amazing performance from a little ;super inexpensive Item.  Keep one in your desk drawer for emergencies--you will be pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t seem to be very powerful compared to the Braun travel units I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  I thought I&#x27;d try this and see how it compares to Braun but I&#x27;ll be switching back when this unit dies.  Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
    <li> Does a fair job for the size and price. I like it ok.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for last 12 years, have ordered the second one. very durable, portable .</li>
    <li> perfect works exactly as i needed it to</li>
    <li> super travel item - takes up minimum space, and does the job</li>
    <li> great for any type of hair. works perfect and gives a close shave look. the price and size of this thing are unbeatable. over all very satisfied with order and would recommend to others looking for  a great electric razor for a cheap price</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend who sometimes forgets to shave when he should have! He keeps it in his vehicle and it does a nice job in an emergency. Good product at a nice price.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is great for the price.  I have tried other electric shavers (the ones with the foil head and vibrating cutter) and haven&#x27;t liked any of them.  This small trimmer has greatly exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> bought this item for my husban and after seeing bad reviews about it i said what the hack i bought it and my husban loves it</li>
    <li> Handy little device at a startlingly good price. I recommend it to those who shave around a beard.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the money, my beard is light to medium and as long as I use this razor daily and spend a fair amount of time going over and over it does a decent job.  It is battery powered and the cutting heads rotate quite slowly so don&#x27;t expect to shave in a minute or two.  Don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this product again, I would probably spend the extra money and get a top end electric razor.</li>
    <li> Norelco Rotary razor still best  of them all and this battery powered is better than anyother rotary on the market including high priced electric or re-chargable&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The razor did not work for me.  I am not prone to razor burn, but after one use my face was on fire.  Despite the razor being inferior the customer service was great.  I emailed, and received a response right away providing a return authorization.  My account was credited the day the company received the razor.</li>
    <li> This litter razor has a big power. It works quite well though is small. So it deserves such a price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! This tiny shaver does a great job of getting a close cut and removing your five o&#x27; clock shadow with comfort. I&#x27;m seriously impressed by the quality and use of this shaver for how little I paid. $14.99 is a steal! Buy it now!</li>
    <li> It is so weak that I have to literally push it. I can&#x27;t believe Philips has this product.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money...I have two.  Works as well as my $90 Norelco Razor.</li>
    <li> Good product at least for those with a beard who only need an adjustment and not a thorough shave.</li>
    <li> Blades are very dull, wont shave good.....</li>
    <li> Great product for the price it&#x27;s untouchable left me a clean shave very close to a favor but without the irritation a razor gives perfect product</li>
    <li> Nice shave, very easy to use and shave clean</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a replacement to the Braun M90 which needed cutter block replacement after a year a half. It is less noisy than the Braun and gives a much closer shave. I wish I had gotten it first. It takes a little longer to shave than a single foil but I like the results and have less irritation. My came with a nice travel case.</li>
    <li> Top falls off by itself. Just too loose a fit</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave that good!</li>
    <li> convenient to use and great for travel.  if you want close shave, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This was purchased as a back up and travel razor.  It&#x27;s perfect; no complaints.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. Not the closest shave ever, but for the price and the size, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> Very good razor, nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this razor, can&#x27;t beat it for the price, but he tells me if he lets his beard get a little long it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I did not believe many of the reviews on here at first since I already had a portable electric razor that did not work. However, this razor works perfectly! It is an amazing razor that I would definitely recommend. If you need a cheap razor that works well, then I would suggest you to buy this.</li>
    <li> Got this razor to just use for a quick shave before work and was surprised to see it actually out performs my past electric razors that cost 10 times as much. It is very easy to empty and clean out and I love that it uses batteries so I don&#x27;t have to worry about plugging it in all the time or packing a charger when I travel.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t go as deep as my other $70 electric razor, but it&#x27;s a cheap buy, as a second razor to quickly grab or leave at someone&#x27;s house.</li>
    <li> Very and handy, works well.</li>
    <li> perfect travel razor for the field (Army).</li>
    <li> Bought this razor for travel, but liked it so well I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This razor performed well on a two week cruise, with the batteries running strong for two weeks.  It may have run adequately longer, but I changed out the batteries as a precautionary measure due to schedule demands.  A light touch produced almost as close a shave as irritating hard and firm strokes and much kinder to the skin.  I will use it for all travel in the future, as it takes little space, is easy to maintain and light to pack.  It did all I had hoped it would.</li>
    <li> Affordable and effective razor.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these small razors in about 1972.  I used it whenever I was away from line power-thousands of uses.  It still works fine except that I can not find new blades any more.  The new model looks much the same except it is fancier.  I hope I can still find new blades for it into the future--25 years would probably be enough.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend thinking it would be a great item for him to use on a regular basis. It just isn&#x27;t what we thought it would be. It&#x27;s kind of cheaply made. For the price and if you were to use it for only traveling it would be a great purchase. To use it on a daily basis I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Barely cuts at all. Weak</li>
    <li> Great little travel razor. Nothing fancy, but does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband before our vacation, and he loves it!  He has been pleasantly surprised by the close shave he gets, and it takes up much less room in the toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> works perfect. everything i expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for several months now, and use it every day for about four minutes per day.  I originally bought it to use as a travel shaver, but found that it shaves closer and more comfortably than my old $80 foil shaver, so replaced the foil shaver with this for every day use.  I use rechargeable AA Eneloops to power it, and pull them out to recharge them once per month, even though they are still running strong.  My smart charger tells me that they still have more than half their charge left after a month, so this shaver appears to be pretty efficient.  The only negatives I can think of are that the plastic shell that holds the cutting heads fits rather loosely on the body of the shaver and wobbles around a little, which gives it a bit of a cheap feeling.  It is also not waterproof, so those who like to shave in the shower will not be able to do so.  Those are small complaints though, and for the price and performance, this little shaver is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave. I&#x27;ve had them all. Other top brands. Big, small, waterproof, with bells and whistles. The fact is this model is the best of them. The batteries last ages. Very close shaves with never the risk of a cut. Easy to clean. Easy to store. Easy to change the batteries. I have several: One for the sports club bag, one for a country house.</li>
    <li> Just meh. It works but it seems like every time I use it, I have to make sure to put fresh batteries in it to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> I am not notice it need battery,but it is good</li>
    <li> Very good for the price convenient to keep at work.</li>
    <li> Decent shave.  Not as close as a Remington I I used to have....but then again the Remington gave me shaving burn.  Great quality at a ridiculously low price.</li>
    <li> great for frequent use. i don&#x27;t have that much facial hair than most people here though.</li>
    <li> Good little shaver, very effective.</li>
    <li> Handy, but not as good a shave as battery Panasonic</li>
    <li> Very good, although it is China, but the quality is good! Transport speed is also very fast, is recommended!</li>
    <li> So small and compact and uses AA batteries.  Perfect for travel and for home too. I used it everyday since I got it, not my years old one.</li>
    <li> Good to go my first electric razor soon up grade to a more powerful one but litte</li>
    <li> Good little razor, but not that close of a shave, easy to clean. Good battery life.</li>
    <li> bought these for my son and husband to keep in glove box of their truck!  for emergencies...sometimes you are running behind for work and couldn&#x27;t shave!  this razor runs off batteries!  no need to charge!  now might not be the most awesomest shave, but gets you by for the day!</li>
    <li> Got this little shaver for travel.  But it gives a great shave.  Using it now instead of my corded shaver.  Fits nicely in my hand.  Comes in a nice little zippered holder.  Would highly recommend this item,</li>
    <li> I am impressed. It is the small but efficient charger which takes pencil AA cell and shaves so clean. Battery longs last. One pair of cell may shave 9-10 times. Very handy and useful for everyday or travel use. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I found this to be exactly what I had expected.  A well made product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good benefits for your cost, portable!</li>
    <li> Had no idea that a battery razor could shave this close. Has completely exceeded what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and was told it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I picked this razor up a few days ago.  I know I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of days but so far it has been a fantastic purchase!  I had never used an electric razor before so I figured the low price-point of this one would be good to try.  I was very surprised!  Yeah, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close as my traditional razor, but it still works decently well.  And, I must say that my shaving experience was a lot more comfortable!  I didn&#x27;t have any tugging or pulling like I do with my traditional razor.  There are only a couple of downsides to this little thing.  Firstly, it can&#x27;t be used wet.  You can only use it dry. This isn&#x27;t a huge problem but it would have been nice if I could use it in the shower or something.  Second, it is overpriced here on Amazon (sorry Amazon!).  You can pick these up at your local Walmart for about $10 cheaper than here, which is a shame seeing that Amazon usually beats even Walmart pricing!  Overall, I&#x27;d say that if you want a good, cheap electric razor for travel, or if you want one just to try it out, like me, then I&#x27;d say go for it!  I&#x27;d recommend going to Walmart to pick this up seeing as you can get it for close to $12 bucks, and at that price, you can afford to take a risk!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my husband. It is really good quality and it works really well. Now my husband does not have to worry about shaving at any moment and getting pholiculitis</li>
    <li> Could be 4 stars but it did not have as long a service life as  the Panasonic ES3831K wet/dry Single Blade Travel Shaver (18.00 at Amazon w/ SS), but both are far superior to the Remington MSC-140 Men&#x27;s Titanium Travel Shaver (10.00 with SS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a heavy and fast growing beard and used these Travel Shavers for  shaving about 5 times a week, finding it cheaper than buying good Fusion type blades or new blades for a normal electric razor. The  Norelco  gives a good shave, but was only usable for about 3 months, while the  Panasonic gave me about 5 months IIFRC for about the same price and quality of shave, plus it is a wet or dry shaver (with me it was the latter).  These both work fine with cheap rechargeable AA  batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Men&#x27;s Titanium Travel Shaver could not come close on shaving or battery life, and does not work well using rechargeables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But thank Gd for good buys.</li>
    <li> It is best..although it is a travel razor....but I am using it everyday for trimming...</li>
    <li> First really usable travel razor I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver for the price, doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor but works very well</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S A GREAT RAZOR IT TRULY SHAVES GREAT WITH NO PROBLEM WHAT SO EVER!!!</li>
    <li> Works good! Not as good as my full&lt;br /&gt; size. The cutting heads must be of lower quality.  Great for travel.</li>
    <li> This razor gives me a much better shave than the 3 headed, pricey Norelco water proof one!  I love this little shaver and it is powered by AA batteries available EVERYWHERE!!!  Try iy, you&#x27;ll like it.  No electric is as good as a blade but this comes close and is more convenient!</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace my ancient Norelco travel shaver with one that was equally compact, and this one is perfect. As a test I used it exclusively for 2 weeks on the original batteries. Although it was a bit slower after 14 days, it was still going well enough that 2 or 3 days more was entirely possible. I changed the batteries anyway so that it will be ready for my next trip. Excellent product.  The only difficulty was registering it for warranty purposes. It came from one of Amazon&#x27;s Canadian suppliers and is not for sale in the US as far as Phillips is concerned. The Phillips rep was able to help me get it registered however plus an extra 6 month warranty!  Update 8/14/16: This little shaver continues to be one of the better purchases I&#x27;ve made for personal hygiene. I use it exclusively for travel, including camping, and it still gives a close, comfortable shave. I make a point of putting in fresh batteries before any extended trip, but I have yet to have to change batteries because they&#x27;ve run down. The longest vacation we&#x27;ve taken since I bought it was 3 weeks, and it was still working well the last morning I used it.  Incidentally, I have seen the reviews which marked it way down because it ran too slowly. I suggest that those shavers were defective and should have been replaced under warranty.</li>
    <li> Compact. shaves down to the bone and is lightweight. I just love and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is cheap and easy to use. There are two batteries inside and ready for use.</li>
    <li> the razor was under powered.  it took 20 minutes to get a good shave.</li>
    <li> A good bay. Does a good job. Not good as one of the large one&#x27;s but cuts well. Recommend an extra set of batteries. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> An amazingly good shaver.  I&#x27;ve had a number of electric shavers, and this is by far the best Ive tried.  I&#x27;ve even had other norelco shavers of very similar design, but somehow this one is better--shaves quicker, closer, and more comfortably.  The batteries seem to last forever (though my beard isn&#x27;t particularly heavy).  Before this I always ended up going back to using a blade after a few tries, but now I only use this one.  They recommend replacing the cutting heads about once a year, but the heads cost more than the shaver, so I&#x27;ll probably just buy a new one when the time comes--I hope they keep making these.</li>
    <li> Bought it for travel. Had one long ago. Doesn&#x27;t last forever but certainly helps during long pacific flight.</li>
    <li> Very good. Handy, light and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after two uses</li>
    <li> Cuts--leaving what feels like a ONE DAY&#x27;S GROWTH!  Accidentally, my original razor (same make, but earlier edition) got put into storage, so I needed to acquire this &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; which I really don&#x27;t think the quality was put into this one, like my first one has.  I won&#x27;t waste my money buying anything with the Philips Norelco brand name again!</li>
    <li> This replaces one my daughter bought for me over 10 years ago. I used it while in the hospital recently and plan to use it while traveling this summer. Small, easy to pack and a really good shaver. I&#x27;d recommend it to any guy that prefers to be really clean-shaven.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quieter than my previous razor ([[ASIN:B002TQ4AO0 Braun Mobile Shaver - M90 1 Count]]).&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life. I&#x27;ve gone a full month on one charge, using it every other day . However I don&#x27;t have very much facial hair, so you may see shorter battery life. On the other hand, I probably could&#x27;ve used for longer because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was actually slowing down or not so I just charged it to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;Consistently reaches hairs in difficult places (jaw line) that would have normally require several attempts with my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;Looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Razor burn is possible if too much pressure is applied when shaving.</li>
    <li> ideal, and affordable for the price! shaves closer than many higher priced razers!</li>
    <li> Great shaver for trimming.</li>
    <li> i used and feel very nice and soft the cut! totally recomended. tested and just fine, working and feels great</li>
    <li> Works great. Husband very pleased with it. Should have bought this first - the foil one I bought broke in a matter of days.</li>
    <li> I really wish this had the pop-out trimmer that my old Norelco 2-headed razor had.  Please come back with that old model!!&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise is works well and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Solid, simple shaver. Great price.</li>
    <li> This was a surprising find - a cheap but quite good electric razor. The shave is almost as close as a traditional razor and is incredibly cheap. I&#x27;m going to purchase another one just to have if this one ever breaks down. The only down side is the use of batteries. I have gotten about 2 months of shaving use before I have to replace them. I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is a very good razor. No cords tangled cords, noise isn&#x27;t too loud, and close shave. The best reason for choosing to use this type of shaver is that it only cuts close to the surface of the skin and not go deep like a multi-blade Mach5 that can leave you with cuts, rashes, and ingrown hair. It&#x27;s really uncomfortable dealing with ingrown hair. The result looks and feels like a pimple. With this model you may have to do multiple passes, and cutting longer hair may cause a snag or pull.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one for a couple of years and purchased an extra one to have alternative access.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!!  Inexpensive, works extremely well and the blade reservoir holds the shavings with absolutely no mess. Cleaning is simple and the shave is close to that of an actual razor.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
    <li> SERVICE WAS GOOD BUT I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR ..A CHEAP RAZOR ..THAT DOES NOT SHAVE VERY GOOD SO I CAN NOT COMPLAIN.... WISH I HAD GOT BETTER ONE..MY MISTAKE...I ONLY GAVE IT TWO STARS BECAUSE OF THE QUICK SERVICE.....COMPANY GOOD ..PRODUCT TERRIBLE</li>
    <li> Good product. As described.</li>
    <li> its just ok for the price&lt;br /&gt;but it takes long time to shave smooth and even the net result is not the best.&lt;br /&gt;but for 12 $ its fine</li>
    <li> A great little shaver.  It arrived with two AA batteries already installed.  It shaves reasonably close -- closer than other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used (I doubt if any electric razor can get as close as a blade).  I have a somewhat heavy beard but sensitive skin, and this razor does the job quickly and comfortably.  It&#x27;s very compact, light weight, easy to hold and use.  Not especially loud (don&#x27;t have to worry about disturbing your hotel neighbors in the morning).  It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, just remove the head and either blow the whiskers out or use the little brush that comes with it.  Hint -- I use a regular soda straw to rather forcefully blow the whiskers out, works like a charm and you don&#x27;t get them in your eyes.  I love not having to plug it up to a charger.  All in all, I&#x27;d highly recommend this shaver for anyone who wants a fast convenient shave, whether at home or on the road.</li>
    <li> Best Shaver Ever!! Have got Remingtons before and they tend to pull beard hair (Painfull sometimes) But this piece of wonder does its job WELL DONE</li>
    <li> Gives a decent shave for such an inexpensive shaver.</li>
    <li> Nice portable little razor.  Used several times and seems to be working well.  Great for traveling.  Compact yet efficient.</li>
    <li> As a 35 year user of  Philips products, I expected no less. I have been using the Philips Norelco tri-head electric razor for about 30 of those 35 years and had a Philips beard-trimmer before this one. After 5 years of that use, it was time to get a new one. The price was right, so how could I not acquire it?</li>
    <li> Had it for one month. So far very easy to use. I would say a 95% closer to a conventional shave. Of course, the longer your beard the more time and effort you&#x27;ll spend.</li>
    <li> Better than the $150 Norelco</li>
    <li> Shaves much better than the cheap razors I was using.  I use rechargeable batteries so after inital cost there is no ongoing battery cost.  I like not having a cord flopping around too.  Price of shaver was excellent.</li>
    <li> This a great product. Quality is excellent</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!&lt;br /&gt;I use this every 2-3 days and it works great and I hardly take 5 mins to finish shaving which used to take me longer earlier when I used to have a regular shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Saves me time in the morning when I get ready for office.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Battery stays on for long.</li>
    <li> No, just no. Multiple passes and never smooth.  Fail.  MSC 140 Titanium has this beat by far!</li>
    <li> I normally have  light growth facial hair,  had a two-day growth when I received the PQ208/40 and put it to the test right out of the box.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The PQ208/40 does as good a job on my face as my 3-head Norelco.  The zippered semi-hard container that comes with the razor will do a fine job of protecting the razor in my travel luggage, but there is no room in the container for the brush that comes with the razor.  I usually just close my eyes and blow the cuttings out of the head and drive area anyway, so no real need for the brush on a trip.  I like the fact that the PQ uses standard AA batteries so need to carry a charger cable or module.  The noise level is not an issue.  Since I can get away with shaving every other day, I have no idea how the PQ would work on a face that grows a heavy beard, but would recommend if for anyone with a light beard.</li>
    <li> great shaver. easy to use and light. great for traveling</li>
    <li> Works good as a travel rig but now know why they usually have 3 heads. Takes a bit more &amp;#34;mow&amp;#34; time but nicely sized so worth it for travel. Battery operated so no power chord needs to be packed.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried any electric razors before so I ordered the Norelco PQ208/40 (this one) and the Braun M90 at the same time so I could try both of them. The Braun M90 is a foil shaver and I personally found that one a lot more effective and much closer to the experience of shaving with a razor. With the Norelco you need to move it around in circular motions and I found that it irritated my skin a bit and it was difficult to consistently get all the hairs. Also the circular motion was difficult and especially irritating around my chin and jawline. Maybe this is a lot easier with one of the more expensive rotary shavers that has 3 flexible heads or something, but this particular guy really didn&#x27;t do it for me. When I&#x27;m going to use an electric razor I&#x27;ll stick with the Braun M90 for now.</li>
    <li> Worked well, and cheaper than buying blades for other razors.</li>
    <li> Works great for travel.  Silent run and yet powerful to do the job.  I&#x27;ll buy it again if the 1st one breaks down.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s practical and does what it says. I am very satisfied. I would like to know how to replace the blades on this model. Please advise.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Close,effortless shave.  Good battery Life. Nice Design.</li>
    <li> This razor is small, light and portable, while also delivering acceptable performance.  Power is from two AA batteries (included).  In theory the batteries should last a month, so far mine have performed for two weeks just fine.  The performance can&#x27;t match Norelco&#x27;s main shavers but for taking on a trip this is a great compromise between performance and size.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for use when I had to send my Remington in for warranty repair and for use when travelling in our travel trailer. It works so well that I would use it as my full-time razor.</li>
    <li> It worked great. I traveled overseas with it, and it kept me clean smooth, powered by two AA batteries. No adapters needed. Now, there are only two heads, so if you miss a day or two of shaving, heads have to work a lot harder to clean you up. Just shave every day.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the price. I have used it just as I got it, and I am impress. I gives me a close shave just the same like those 3 or more shaving wheel thing. It runs with a couple of AA batteries, but no issue for me. Note that I only been using this for a couple of times since I got it, meaning I don&#x27;t know how long this shaver will stay sharp, but if it keep me satisfied for a longer time, I will buy another one, though I&#x27;m not traveling person. Nice shaver case included too...</li>
    <li> Quality product in small handy form.</li>
    <li> I am surprised to see many good reviews for a dismal product. This is not even a decent shaver IMO. It is very weak and doesn&#x27;t contour with your face. Makes a lot of vibration but doesn&#x27;t shave. It is also very small, any man with big hands will have hard time to grasp this device. I sent mine back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in and out of the hospital a lot lately, and this is a great razor for my &amp;#34;go bag&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> it works well enough for what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It is small and compact for travel and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> My beard was too much for this razor. I tried shaving with it and it started pinching me all over the place. I could not even use it for one full shave. Do not buy if you have a goodly amount of facial hair.</li>
    <li> The greatest shaver for the price. Hard to clean since it is not water proof. But, it works very very well</li>
    <li> ok for quick touch ups only per my husband</li>
    <li> Not good for sesative faces...</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I use it everyday, and it is always close and comfortable.</li>
    <li> bought this from walmart for about $10.00 less, i was still overcharged because it worked a couple of times, thought i got a good deal, wrong! gave a good review, no sooner did i give a good review it just worked lousy, could have got a closer shave with a butter knife, can not understand the good reviews unless people like me saw good results the first couple of times, then gave a good review, tried to edit my walmart review, or take it away but i couldn&#x27;t, at least amazon lets you do that.</li>
    <li> Shaving takes a little longer than with a much more expensive full size razor. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have a beard so use it for trimming only. Sounds like it&#x27;s barely running yet it does a great job of cleaning off stubble.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy another one if and when this one dies.</li>
    <li> it give an amzing close shave</li>
    <li> Shaves well! Did not like the cheap glossy plastic battery cover.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as fast of a shave as the regular size razors, plus you have to do more turning and movement to get everything. But, this is small and portable. Great for taking on the go. My husband keeps this in his bag he takes to work so mornings when he didn&#x27;t get up early enough he can shave on his commute.</li>
    <li> I used it daily for 3-weeks while traveling through Japan, with no problems and no battery replacement.</li>
    <li> Not a great shave, but the battery life is better than Norelco led me to expect and it works very well as a travel razir,</li>
    <li> Just right for travel.  Great price</li>
    <li> I have kept a small razor like this in my truck for years and use it everyday. I&#x27;ve had a couple Braun&#x27;s, a Remington and now the Norelco. This Norelco has been the best of the bunch and use it to shave everyday on my way to work. I might wet shave once or twice a month but prefer this little aa battery unit for it&#x27;s close shave, convenience and low cost. Great buy and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Handy, Useful, works well. No complaint. I bought it for travelling. It serve the purpose well. The price is affordable.</li>
    <li> Looks fine but is not so easy to shave for my beard anyway is not so expensive for what it is...</li>
    <li> This shaver is for the mornings or afternoons that you forget to shave.  Just for missing that first day.  Any more than your 5 o&#x27;clock shadow or morning scruff and it will pull on your hair/skin (even with a new battery).  This is not to be used at a alternative to a quality shaver.  I keep in in the truck for when I look in the rear view mirror and realize I walked out of the house without shaving.  It is quick, clean, close shave but should only be used for that initial day growth.</li>
    <li> Great for travel, but I use it every day.  Much easier to use than the large and bulky 3-head models, especially when encountering tight spaces such as around a beard.  The two I ordered (because I could not find in stores) are my 4th and 5th.  Very smooth functioning razor.</li>
    <li> Norelco shavers have a reputation for quality and this unit is no different.  For the money, it can not be beat</li>
    <li> I finally gave up using razors for shaving. The hair on my face grows in every direction, so using razors, whether they&#x27;re straight edge, safety blades, multi-blades, etc, it&#x27;s impossible for me to get a close shave without the likelihood of getting ingrown hairs. I picked up one of these electric razors to eliminate the possibility of ingrown hairs and it&#x27;s working great for that purpose. The shave I get isn&#x27;t as close as a regular razor, but it&#x27;s close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries last quite a long time. 20 or so shaves with it and I still haven&#x27;t replaced them, though I would expect to soon. I like the fact that this uses AA batteries instead of a battery pack or internal battery because that means I don&#x27;t have to worry about finding a replacement battery pack or being forced to buy a new unit. The blades disassemble easily for cleaning or replacement. About the only thing you need to worry about breaking down on this thing is the motor and only time will tell on that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a pretty well made case for such a cheap razor. Everything about it, in fact, feels sturdy and well made. Philips didn&#x27;t cut many corners with this product. With the included AA batteries, it&#x27;s a wonder they&#x27;re even making any money on this. If you&#x27;re looking for good value on an electric razor, this is it.</li>
    <li> The razor does a real nice job.  It&#x27;s sleek and comfortable to use.  It&#x27;s great for touchups anytime.  A very good product for a very good price.</li>
    <li> Very good electric shaver especially for travel.</li>
    <li> Tugs on your face and is painful.  Only redeeming quality is the small size.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Kid doesnt care for it as his 1st electric.</li>
    <li> Perfect for light use.</li>
    <li> NIce lightweight unit.  My skind doesn&#x27;t respond very well with the circular motion of the blades, so have to work at it to shave off whiskers.  They prefer straight on cut, like a razor.</li>
    <li> This razor was perfect for our trip to Kenya.  Holds up well...compact...so glad to have it-quick shipment...as described...love it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Look just like the pics shown above</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and works perfectly well for the job. Easy to clean. Take batteries out when you travel though, or it might switch on in your bag.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel.  Could use it every day too if you wanted.</li>
    <li> Strong, powerful and just a little larger than my old travel shaver. Very close shave.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice design, but over time I&#x27;ve discovered it can be quite a source of razor burn, even with a very light touch.  The reason seems to be a motor that is not fast enough and causes tugging at the whiskers. Because of this I&#x27;ve dropped it to 2 stars.  No one needs razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Small, fits hand well.  Easy to hold, lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;* I love the two-head as opposed to 3-head systems.  For me it is far easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;* Very close job of shaving&lt;br /&gt;* Self-sharpening&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to clean.  Comes with a brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Severe razor burn, every time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self-sharpening blades are supposed to last a year of normal use (I&#x27;m sure that depends on the coarseness of one&#x27;s beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that Braun makes a &amp;#34;Pocket Shaver&amp;#34; using the new variegated foil-head style that does an equally good job of shaving, but without the razor burn... and has an advantage of a sideburn trimmer.  If not for the razor burn issue, this would be one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.  But there is a fine line between a close shave and shaving too close.  I prefer to retain the outer skin layers.</li>
    <li> Hate is too strong an emotion for me but I am very upset with this product- it gave a good shave but after six months it just broke down and quit spinning around and wouldn&#x27;t shave any more. Maybe I got a lemon.</li>
    <li> Keeps on ticking.  Don&#x27;t fully under stand self sharpening blades.  They have to go dull with time,. right?</li>
    <li> Great first razor for my son.  He is on the autism spectrum, and he  is very sensitive to loud noises and harsh things against his skin.  He did really well with this.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  Very much recommended.</li>
    <li> The top falls off too easily. I need to be careful when remove the cap and make sure the top stays.</li>
    <li> Works very well, easy to use and priced right.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent electric razor. It runs quietly, shaves very closely, is compact &amp; easy to carry, fits the hand nicely, and runs for weeks or months on just two AA batteries. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This unit is much better than the price reflects !</li>
    <li> GREAT little razor. My Dr. told me to get an electric razor, since I have terrible leg problems, like Cellulitis, and regular razors nick, and invite infection.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a few times to go over my legs to get them spanking cleanshaven, but I love the size, and the fact I do not need to plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping for lots of years use out of it.</li>
    <li> My son-in-law loves this razor.  He keeps it at the office for a quick shave.  It is compact and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Just try it out  its nice and light andwill travel good  its not as fast as other but it got a close shave</li>
    <li> bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts for hubby and son, so not sure yet if they will like them - christmas is a month away. They came quickly and look great.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for!!!</li>
    <li> I does the job, and it&#x27;s quick and easy to clean.  Not as close a shave as with my Schick with the blades and using Edge, but works for my puposes.</li>
    <li> I left my primary razor at home when I arrived on the beach for a week.  Oops. I got this for 12 dollars and some change at the place all the republicans say they hate but go to anyway--Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great.  I have a tough stubble and even my expensive Panasonic only gets about 80 per cent on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it drops to about 78 per cent with this little gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why it&#x27;s so expensive on amazon I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> We needed a razor for our upcoming camping trip.  This works fine.  It is not as good as one you would pay a lot for, but for the price it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, the best I ever bought, very smooth and long battery life, ideal for the home or as to departure, recommended</li>
    <li> The razor is compact and can be taken anywhere and is instantly rechargeable. It could be a little faster but for its purpose it is great!</li>
    <li> Works well and provides a close shave (for those who use electric razors).  Awesome for traveling.  I just got back from a week in Ireland and it performed flawlessly.  The original AA batteries (two of them) are still going strong.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, but it&#x27;s not a very close shave.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman who has always had light blonde peach fuzz on my face and am always looking for something that a) doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, b) that I can use without shaving cream and c) still gets rid of the fuzz. Just got this today and didn&#x27;t realize it comes with a little pouch that fits it perfectly! This is great for my travel and business trips. Very light and compact, not bulky or heavy. Came with batteries. I just tried it and it didn&#x27;t leave me with any dreaded red patches on my face, left my face smooth and still caught all the tiny blonde hairs that I always notice when the sun catches them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed with the value, style, design and how great my skin works and how well it performed. I&#x27;ll update this if anything changes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a travel razor and have since upgraded to rechargeable batteries and use it every day. I had Norelco triple head that replaced my old dual head rechargeable, never really liked the three head and it quit holding charge after a few years, my old dual head held charge for over ten years after i received it when my grandfather passed away and he used it for at least 4 years. This razor is compact, easy to use and clean, and does a fantastic job,....and for under $20 including the rechargeable batteries it&#x27;s quite a bargain, and the batteries can be replaced if they quit holding charge. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to try out a rotary razor without breaking the bank. While I had tried many foil electric razors in the past, none of them have ever really been able to get all the hairs off my face. Therefore, after struggling with the electric foil razors for a few days I would usually reverse to the tried and true non-electric razor. When I saw this razor on Amazon I thought I would give it a try for the price and I was not let down! Best shave I have ever had with an electric razor! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great to keep in car or briefcase in case you need a touch-up during the day.  Also have used it when needing to take unexpected trip.</li>
    <li> My beard need to be very short for this razor works. I bought and now it&#x27;s unusable</li>
    <li> Ideal for travelling. Nice &amp; compact.</li>
    <li> Works really well for a portable shaver, I use this as my primary actually.</li>
    <li> .......for the price, this shaver is impossible to beat.&lt;br /&gt;Well made, and most important, it provides a very close, comfortable shave. Comes complete with batteries, a cleaning brush and a very nice case, all for less than $15.!!!&lt;br /&gt;Bought this shaver for use in my RV to simplify one of my daily routines.&lt;br /&gt;Like it so much that I am considering purchasing another one to use at home.&lt;br /&gt;I used to shave with razor blades until my doctor advised me to switch to an electric razor when he put me on blood thinners.&lt;br /&gt;Now I do admit that the Norelco electric travel razor does not shave quite as close as a razor blade shaver, but the difference is not really that noticeable. And razor blades are getting to be very expensive!&lt;br /&gt;......all in all, I highly recommend this razor, and with the self sharpening blades you should get close, comfortable, daily shaves for a very long time!</li>
    <li> works great for the price</li>
    <li> This little razor is far superior to the old one; I had my other travel razor for 15 maybe 20 years and it was great HOWEVER this new travel razor is even better than the old one. It has a contour for the hand (although, it’s a tad slippery where the old one was not) making it more comfortable to hold and grip, it feels as though it has more power and I appreciate the new switch location. A value worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I bought one a while ago, and having it stashed away in the glovebox has been so handy - that I bought another one and gave it to my traveling son.</li>
    <li> I used to own an earlier model Norelco travel razor. I used it for about 20 years and gave it up only because I could not find replacements for the cutting heads. The older model was more expensive, being all metal. It also had some tendency to corrosion, to which the modern plastic is immune. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll carry this one for 20 years, but it&#x27;s great for camping or travel. It gives a quick, clean shave.</li>
    <li> Great price and very portable.</li>
    <li> works super well....very compact</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco PQ208/40 has performed as indicated.  The operation is smooth and for battery operation very good.  I had some surgery on face and could not use blade and cream.  This electric worked great and was gentle.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to shave, but when I do I use this razor. it is great to have on the road. it also made me look pretty awesome when I went to meet my girlfriends parents last week. thanks electric razor.</li>
    <li> Despite anything else to be said about this product, it&#x27;s a great item for a very low price. I&#x27;d say if &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; is generally true, in this case it&#x27;s more than I expected for less. Good shave if you follow the directions ( yes guys, directions). All rotary shavers need to be used in a specific pattern. This one is no exception.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for traveling. When trying it upon receiving it, the razor was so quiet and the cutter rotation seemed so slow that I thought that it couldn&#x27;t possibly be operating correctly. Wrong. The razor was indeed shaving my beard, cutting more closely and evenly than my older Braun 4700 series razor ever did. Being AA battery powered with only two cutting heads, it does take longer to shave with this razor than it does with a full-size rechargeable. Still, this little guy does get the job done, packs compactly, and operates nicely with the lithium batteries that I use to power it.  Oh yes, I do have a pretty light, somewhat sparse beard; don&#x27;t know how this razor might function regarding a thick, heavy fuzz face.</li>
    <li> this shaver made my life a little easier. I was using one that was given to me from Asia and ran out of the replacement head. So I ended up ordering this and was completely satisfied with the type of product philips has created. cannot wait to use this on the go....</li>
    <li> Fulfilled the expectations, it is a good product and it arrived in good condition. It is just as it appears in the photo</li>
    <li> Gets my face as clean as its big brother, and does so with two AA batteries.  Super for travel, because of its size, easy to use and efficient. MUCH more convenient than taking a safety razor along.</li>
    <li> The shave is closely enough.  The size is compact and easy to carry.  It is a good &amp;#34;looking good in a hurry&amp;#34; product.&lt;br /&gt;The one star I deduct here is I wish I could store the cleaning brush together the shaver.</li>
    <li> Love it. Does not get as close as a blade, but good enough. Shockingly good for the cheap price. I use it when I&#x27;m too lazy to shave. I keep it in the kitchen candy shave with it drinking my coffee.</li>
    <li> I have owned at least 5 other travel razors from many manufacturers. This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> seems to be a good solid norelco.  gave it as a gift so i will have to inquire as to how it does in the long run but my hunch is well.&lt;br /&gt;got to see it in action once, it ran smooth quiet and produced a clean shave with no trouble and did not seem at all under powered.  as a gift it was well received.</li>
    <li> It is very nice unit i relly like it&lt;br /&gt;Comparing by price its good&lt;br /&gt;It is very nice unit i relly like it&lt;br /&gt;Comparing by price its good</li>
    <li> When used properly razor cuts clean. Less irritation on the skin. I recommend for all who need a quick smooth clean cut.</li>
    <li> Works as well as my regular shaver.  Great little shaver!</li>
    <li> This razor is worthless. I read other shining reviews and decIded to give it a try because I get terrible razor burn. My entire neck has hairs that the razor will not cut, no matter how much I go over the areas.  The rest of my face has some spots it did not pick up either. Plus my razor burn is twice as bad as when I used disposable razors and double edged razors with hydro cortizone afterwards. Perhaps my hair is just too course for this product but i do not recommend it.  It&#x27;s cheap for a reason. Save your money for something better.</li>
    <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars is that altho it does shave pretty close, it gave me a pretty nasty rash the 3 times I used it, on my neck. Wasn&#x27;t prepared for that. I would up getting a full size electric shaver which does not do that, plus it has a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excellent If You Are Tricksy&lt;br /&gt;This works all right as is. But I put in some 3.7 volt rechargeable batteries. And now it is awesome! With a spare set of batteries it is easily more powerful than any Norelco I have owned. More Compact. Less Expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UltraFire 3.7V 14500 1200mAh Rechargable Li-Ion Batteries (4-count)&lt;br /&gt;by Ultrafire&lt;br /&gt;4 customer reviews&lt;br /&gt;List Price:  $22.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  $15.99 &amp; FREE Shipping on orders over $35.

This large triple-headed shaver was only powered by a single AA Ni-MH cell.I may not change the battery because it is glued and soldered in. With the better batteries this Norelco has thrice the power.</li>
    <li> Got it today&lt;br /&gt;Very nice</li>
    <li> Perfect first shaver for a young teenager. My almost-15 year old son was reluctant to shave his whiskers but this little device has been very handy in getting him going. Highly recommend for a newbee shaver. Now he even uses it from time to time without me asking him and he does a very good job. Good purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought a similar but higher end model, the HQ9080.    After purchasing it, it died on me at least 5 times. Each time it was sent to the service centre, I had to wait up to an hour to submit it and collect the claim. Philips promised to repair it each time but every time after a full cycle of use and charging, the shaver started acting up again. It would switch on by itself or just hang and die when charging. Seriously it was not funny anymore. I requested for a money back, a replacement or to change and top up for another model but was rejected with the same promise that it would not happen again.    On the last time it happen(4th or 5th time under the warranty period), they sent someone to collect it and instead of a replacement, did another repair again. When they called to ask me to collect the repaired set for the last time, I told them to just dispose of it. It just wasnt worth my while to go down to collect it anymore. I am now no longer a Philips user, shaver or other products wise.    [...]</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for camping works perfect as it takes batteries, not a charging system..  I fine this little shaver to fit my needs perfect glad I bought it.  Nice price point too..</li>
    <li> Not knocking the product because it works, quality construction, and accessories are good. However depending on your skin type, You may end up with serious ingrown hairs. after 10 seconds i couldn&#x27;t use anymore. beards hair became so sharp it was literally sticking me.</li>
    <li> Awesome little thing, works better than most 100 dollar razors.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a long time and had it in my emergency kit and never used it.  When we moved I pulled it out and much to my surprise it is a great little razor.  I have used many razors over the years and this little bugger does a nice job.  While it does not have a clipper on it, and it runs on double A batteries,  the shave is very close and comfortable.  I have a number of expensive razors and cheep ones I picked up along the way when I was traveling.  This one is now my number 1. razor.  I wish I had discovered this a several years ago.  I love the small size and the shave I get with it. No plugs and wires.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it.  I have for years 1970 something tried several high dollar norelco triple head razors.  None compare to this.  I keep one in my vehicle console and the bathroom for touchups.</li>
    <li> Best little travel shaver you ever want to have.</li>
    <li> Not the best travel razor out there, nor is it the worse.   Takes time to get a good shave from it as motor is so weak, two or three times longer than with my Panasonic travel razor, but the end results are good.</li>
    <li> Not great but will do for travel.</li>
    <li> Been using this little guy for the better part of 3 months now, and it sure does get the job done. Works just as good as my old triple head razor, except it&#x27;s super cheap! Cut is clean, but the only thing I would have to complain about is the battery life. You may find yourself changing the batteries more than frequently with this razor.</li>
    <li> The item was as offered and is perfect for its function. I love it and I have no doubts to recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great for travel love the size and function</li>
    <li> its avery good materal.smooth,fasst,clean,without nois and very smal in shape.i use it many time and its work great and saveower</li>
    <li> I wanted something small and portable.  There are days when I don&#x27;t feel like using a razor and wet soap, especially on a long haul flight or on a lazy weekend.  I find this device to be handy and good at getting a close shave.  It&#x27;s also something that you can leave in your car without the bulkiness.  It&#x27;s constructed well.  I haven&#x27;t dropped it yet though.  WIll probably make another purchase for gift.</li>
    <li> Very good. I bought because of a trip and met my expectations well. 2 ordinary batteries shaved for 20 days straight.</li>
    <li> Great little electric razor. I use it as my main razor and it works great. Easy to clean and sturdy (I have dropped it several times)</li>
    <li> Pretty decent shaver, but you have to go over areas multiple times to get all the hairs. Patchy job.</li>
    <li> really handy fits in my laptop bag. carry it around for a quick shave right before a meeting specially late afternoon. put in an energiser rechargeable battery and you have a really powerful small razor in your hands. not as close of a shave as you can expect from a razor but definitely comparable to other larger electric razors</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric shavers. This one was great except in the sensitive under jaw area. This was expected being my lack of experience. I was shocked at how close it cut. Nearly as well as my razor. Great for a quick dry shave. I clean it out with an air can used to clear out dust. Just like new every time</li>
    <li> Great quality obviously won&#x27;t shave a full grown beard but great for clean shaves</li>
    <li> I had one before and it does a great job</li>
    <li> I am a woman with excessive facial hair. Fortunately, it&#x27;s not a lot, and it&#x27;s blonde, so most people don&#x27;t notice it. But over the years, the hair on my chin, and around my lips has gotten increasingly frustrating to deal with. I will NOT wax, I loathe the pain and tedium of plucking with tweezers, and every depilatory I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t do jack squat. Eventually I was down to using hair-cutting scissors to continually trim the hair - when I realized the old wive&#x27;s tale about cut hair coming back in more coarse and thick, was just that, an old wive&#x27;s tale. But cutting them with scissors was its own challenge, because these obnoxious hairs are also very curly, and trying to get them down close to the root I would occasionally catch skin in the scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months back, I was looking at the reviews on a new hair-remover product, that supposedly worked on fine, thin facial hairs - and someone mentioning using this shaver, as an alternative. What a difference it has made. This simple little device is always in my purse, so if I&#x27;m out and about and I suddenly realize the hairs have gotten stupid again, I can quickly fix it in the car or a bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I&#x27;d rather find a way to make the hairs stay away for longer periods - or laser them off entirely - but this is such a better pain-free alternative to anything else I&#x27;ve done before. It take two AA batteries, has a little plastic cover over the heads, and fits discreetly in my purse. I noticed some reviews mention it has a weak motor - that may well be true, and so it may not be appropriate for men or women with a lot of coarse facial hair. I don&#x27;t have much experience with men&#x27;s electric shavers, to gauge it that way, and obviously women&#x27;s electric shavers aren&#x27;t a good comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for my little fine hairs, it works perfectly. My sister and I will even occasionally use it for our legs, if we are in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE::::::::::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just thought I&#x27;d toss additional comment out, since I happened to be perusing old reviews today. As of 6/14/2015, I still love this shaver. And my sister has now bought her own. It&#x27;s actually been incredibly helpful, because she&#x27;s had a major sciatica problem the last 6 months, and normal shaving of her legs has been nearly impossible. But this keeps her from feeling embarrassed in shorts, in addition to her own chin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My little shaver has been such a great find. It was the first small item to have its own pocket in my ThinkGeek Bag of Holding (a.k.a. my purse). At this point, I pull it out in traffic if the hairs on my chin are annoying the crap out of me - I&#x27;m so much less self-conscious of my facial hair, that now I don&#x27;t feel self-conscious using a shaver to deal with it. In the whole time I&#x27;ve had it, I use it fairly regularly and I&#x27;ve only had to change the batteries once. I haven&#x27;t yet had to look for replacement heads, since I only had my first tug of one hair a few weeks ago - just another reminder of why the EpiLady should&#x27;ve been qualified as a form of torture under the Geneva Convention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they don&#x27;t make replacement heads and the tugging continues, I&#x27;ll just buy another.

    <li> This little shaver is surprisingly a very close and comfortable shave for the money. Perfect for travel or to keep in your office desk drawer. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> stopped working after 32 days</li>
    <li> almost as good as my elec shaver</li>
    <li> Acceptable performance for the price.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. It&#x27;s not perfect, but is good. For the price, good buy.</li>
    <li> Works well and quickly. So far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I thought there is rechargable battery inside, unfortunately there is not.</li>
    <li> Its my first time to use this type of razor. I should have listen to other reviews that its shave is not that close compared to the foil electric razor. I bought this because its less noisy. If its time to replace it I&#x27;ll go back to foil even its noisy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked. I ordered this on a whim as a backup &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; I need it. I use a Gillette wet shave razor and have for the past 30 years. When I received this, I had not shaved for 3 days, so decided to put it to the test. The little thing passed the test, and while the shave isn&#x27;t 100% perfect, it&#x27;s pretty darn good! It gets a very close shave and about 97% perfection. For the price, it is really a great little shaver. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> First experience with electric razor I still prefer blade shaver but for shaving when in need of quick shave is great</li>
    <li> This razor is great for those times when a wet shave isn&#x27;t really practical (e.g. camping trips). It produces less irritation (and requires less concentration) than a disposable razor, though there is some tradeoff in terms of closeness of shave.</li>
    <li> Incredible value.  Cuts close.  Slower than the more expensive rigs.</li>
    <li> I liked it, small fit por small lugagge, I used when I travel, I combine 2 to 3 days with regular razor, not recomend for daily use.</li>
    <li> So far this product is great. Came in a timely fashion and the product seems very well-built. I must say that given its size, it&#x27;s probably hard to get a super close shave with thick hairs around the beard area. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that will just trim it short enough to not look scruffy, and on the go, then this product is for you.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head and it works perfectly. It works with 2 AA batteries that can get 5-6 head shaves that take 4-5 minutes from 2mm stubble to shaven. It includes a coupon to extend the warranty as well. I would like to know how long the interchangeable head will last until it needs replacement, manual says about a year but no info on estimated usage for this. The cover and interchangeable head fall easily since the snap that keeps them together isnt that strong so if it falls to the floor expect the thing to detach and fly in different directions. It is also very easy to clean but it will take detaching the head from motor and smacking it for a good while since the hair gets finely grinded. What I do it that i remove head to get most of hair out then clean with a few blasts of compressed air. It leaves the unit 99.8% clean and it most likely improves the product life.</li>
    <li> So, he has a big beard &amp; hates &#x27;time wasted in front of a mirror&#x27;, bit hasn&#x27;t been able to find a good electric to roam around with.&lt;br /&gt;Finally!!! This is great for his neck/cleaning up. No pulling, no fuse- straight forward shaver.</li>
    <li> For a razor costing less than $15, this one is great. I had one before for years that I bought in Amsterdam, essentially the same from Philips that I loved and it finally wore out and new razor blades were more expensive than the razor itself. Found this one at Amazon and it works as good. A nice close shave, so portable and quiet. Only thing it lacks is a trimmer but I can live with that for the week or two that I use it traveling.</li>
    <li> It works fine.  It&#x27;s fairly quiet. Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a blade, but somewhat more convenient.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect little shaver to stash in your shaving kit for travel.  No, its not as quick as my full-sized Norelco shaver, but it does a great job and uses standard AA batteries, so there&#x27;s no problem charging and keeping charged a shaver that is only used occasionally.  Plus, the price was right.  No regrets!</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelco electrics in the past and had high expectations for having a travel version -- as I travel internationally a whole lot.  This razor was so bad that it was uncomfortable to use.  Nothing like my previous Norelcos.  Nothing like any of the other electrics I have right now.  Bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news was that it was inexpensive.  So inexpensive that I decided it was worth the 20 bucks for the pleasure of dropping it into the trash with a big thump.  It came with some very nice AAA batteries, which I put into the razor I replaced it with.  Batteries good. Razor terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the otherwise glowing reviews associated with this product, maybe I just got a lemon, but I&#x27;m not rolling the dice again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I visualize the Norelco brand manager waking up at 3 AM screaming over this particular product and what it is doing to the Norelco brand.  Not good for business.</li>
    <li> A great gift for a visitor who forgot his.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday and batteries lasted months using for a quick shave to work almost daily. I blow off the blades daily after use and they seem just as sharp as when new....naturally sometimes hard to get all hairs on neck but doesn&#x27;t rip or pull!  Nice close shave for a little razor.  Blades used are the same as the bigger much more expensive units so blade care is necessary but for the price you might just buy a new one if the blades go bad...going strong!</li>
    <li> This is  good one, especially if you travel.  I use it when my wife and I travel from our home town to Dallas, this is about 160 miles away, it allows me to shave on the run.  Does a good job and you never run out of power with the AA batteries.  Keep some handy and you get a fantastic shave.</li>
    <li> Got tired of shaving cream and razors on long trips. Bought this and have used it on several. Works just fine for quick morning (or anytime) shave without lathering up.</li>
    <li> it really gets the job done, surprisingly close and easy to clean. for the price you definitely cant beat it.</li>
    <li> less than mediocre, doesn&#x27;t shave well at all</li>
    <li> Cheap and good quality</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave very closely and gets overheated; does not do a good job in reaching curved places on my neck. Thank goodness it was very cheap.</li>
    <li> It will remove hair, and for the price, there isn&#x27;t much to be upset about, but I have found it almost completely ineffective. Not good for coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Great for on the go and need quick shave. Uses two double A batteries which last a long time. Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> It is weak, meaning the batteries don&#x27;t last.  And it doesn&#x27;t shave legs or underarms well.  Legs still fairly hairy, and underarms were downright red and painful.  Disappointment.</li>
    <li> I like this for traveling and it seems to do a fair job on my face.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in my fellow Amazon reviewers for steering me wrong on this one.  You guys are usually spot on.  Bought it to avoid hauling shaving supplies on trips.  Lousy shave.  Takes a long time and not nearly worth the hassle.  Very low power even with fresh batteries.  You&#x27;re way better off buying a full size shaver and dealing with a little extra bulk or bringing a razor.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this razor.  I bought it to shave my legs because I hate shaving in the shower.  I like a very close shave, and definitely cannot get one with this razor.  I can get the hairs to a short enough stubble that allows me to wear shorts out of the house if I go over my legs multiple times, but that takes longer than running a little water in the tub and using a manual razor.  My husband used it on his face, and said that it did as good of a job as any other electric razor.  Due to that, the fact that it seems solidly made, and it using standard AA batteries that you&#x27;ll always be able to purchase is the reason I gave it three stars.  I guess that most men would probably like it fine, but it just doesn&#x27;t do what I want it to.  I have used a Remington 3 screen razor that did do a good job of giving a close shave for me (it had special batteries that eventually couldn&#x27;t be replaced).  I think that maybe I should have followed my gut in wanting to get a screened head razor instead.</li>
    <li> Gives a really close shave!</li>
    <li> I bought 1 and I bought another one after I&#x27;ve used it for a few months.  Nuff said : ).  This thing is small but powerful, very versatile.. shove it in your glove box or your bag when your travelling.  Batteries seem to last forever too!  Must be efficient I suppose.</li>
    <li> I use these while traveling for work, never any issues, great cordless shaver</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for a very long vacation so he didn&#x27;t have to bring his usual razor and possibly have something happen to it in the suitcase.  He already had a few travel razors but I saw this on amazon and bought it.  He said it is the best travel razor he ever used, and that it is so good, he could use it every day even at home.  It is just like a regular Norelco, which he uses.  Sturdy and with floating heads.  Comes with a zipped case and little brush.  This is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I Travel quite a bit and this does an excellent job. A couple passes and the shave is as close as anything else I&#x27;ve used before. When the batteries do eventually die, (i&#x27;m doing about one set of AA batteries a month), a fresh pair isn&#x27;t further than your local mart or gas station.</li>
    <li> Excellent, and very reasonable</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for a friend. He loves it. The small cordless size makes it great for him because he&#x27;s always on the road and staying in hotels. He said the shave was super close, and lasted an entire day or more.</li>
    <li> It works fine. Easy carry, easy use.</li>
    <li> Pretty solid. Only used once. Will update in the near future.</li>
    <li> I really like having this little guy handy for trips out of state or just to the gym when I know I won&#x27;t be going home and need to clean up the stubble. The case fits the razor perfectly, and it&#x27;s compact enough to take up almost no room at all in the bags I use. The product arrived as described and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco gave out abou a couple good decades of duty. I prefer 2 head electric over the 3 head and this was the best I could find. It is very small and would be convenient for travel. Unfortunately it is a little too small for my hands. I have trouble holding it and a lot of trouble cleaning the heads because of the size. It does shave well but I probably would not have bought it if I had realized how small it was. My fingers are simply too big and clumsy. Still was a decent buy. Not their fault I have bad fingers.</li>
    <li> The motor is a bit weak. It requires a lot of passes over and still leaves a stray hair here and there. I don&#x27;t know if this razor falls short or if my expectations were too high given the reviews.</li>
    <li> I have had several foil travel razors from another brand.  They were handy to have for travel and as a backup to my razor, but never shaved quite as close.  This razor does a great job.  It shaves just as close as my regular electric razor, if not closer.  Unfortunately with only two heads it is not as fast.  Overall  a good shave, great portability, exactly what I wanted out of a travel razor.  Oh, and it&#x27;s a breeze to clean.</li>
    <li> Good product especially with this kind of price. And, since it uses standard batteries, I don&#x27;t need charger. I can easily buy batteries from supermarket. Good for travelers for the form factor and weight.</li>
    <li> OMG !!! :)))  THIS LITTLESHAVER IS AMAZING !!! :)))  I&#x27;ve had $250 shavers in the past that didn&#x27;t come CLOSE to shaving this CLOSE !!! :)))  Great job Norelco, GREAT JOB !!! :)))  Also, it feels great in your hand and you cannot beat the price ! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 40-something year old woman that was looking for an inexpensive electric razor for my facial hair (chin, jaw, upper lip).  I hate any hair in those places but my razor was causing irritating little bumps.  I bought the Philips Norelco Travel Electric Razor a few months ago and love it.  I use it on my face dry with no problems.  It only takes a minute to make my face smooth.  I highly recommend this to the ladies.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor and uses it every day. I bought it in addition to his full-size razor for traveling but the full-size razor broke and he insists that this one is all he needs.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, which I&#x27;ve come to expect from Philips&#x27; products.  Great size.  Takes 2AA batteries.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a traveler razor for my dad. He liked it very much and said it&#x27;s very easy to use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Cheap, cheerful, AA-powered. I like those qualities, and I&#x27;m surprised by how well it works as a razor -- not as good as a blade, but great for a 30-second cheek-and-neck touch-up. (As I write this, I&#x27;m on a road trip, and have this razor along with me in the car. Perfect for that, and the reason I bought it.) Not sure yet how long the batteries included will last, but I&#x27;m not giving it much of a workout, since I have a slight beard and am touching up rather than entirely ensmoothifying my whole face. Note: It does *not* have (and I knew this going in) any edge-trimming capability. So if you want to keep your John Waters mustache in perfect trim, you&#x27;ll need a different tool.</li>
    <li> this travel razor,is perfect for me, because it make it easier for me to put this on my luggage and go. and the cut is perfect.the size is very nice.</li>
    <li> not a good shaver in my opinion. cloggs very easily, and hard to clean. does not give a close shave, and can even give you scratches when you are trying to close enough to take of the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no trimmer for moustaches included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Great little inexpensive razor.</li>
    <li> This thing cuts me and doesn&#x27;t really shave well.  I tried using it on my face only. I am not a terribly hairy person, but not a teen either.</li>
    <li> Not a super close shaver. In an emergency, it&#x27;s ok.  You should use a pre-shave liquid to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> this razor shave your face I do suggest taking a hot shower before you try to shave otherwise it&#x27;ll just rip your face open kinda just pulls out the hair.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  It is light, does a great job, and can take it with you on the go.  The only thing I do not like is that it is only battery powered (AA).  I thought it was going to be rechargeable.  So in the long run you will spend more money on batteries.  So, I&#x27;m looking for another re-chargeable one but for al low price.  I will keep this one for overnighters, weekend trips, things like that.</li>
    <li> Cons - it&#x27;s slow, especially if you are trying for a very close shave. Pros - works well, can give a very close shave if you press harder, works OK with longer hairs (this requires multiple passes). Up to an eighth of an inch stubble - OK with multiple passes, more forget about it, it&#x27;s an electric shaver, they&#x27;re lousy as a breed on longer stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I forget to shave for 2 days my Braun M60B works, but leaves the longer hairs. I shave first with the Braun, then clean up the leftover long hairs with my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is more effective than several full size rotary shavers I have, I really like it</li>
    <li> Was given one of these Norelco travel shavers for Christmas as a stocking stuffer. I&#x27;ve been wanting a small battery-powered shaver like this to keep in my car for quick touch-ups. I like that it&#x27;s a rotary-head style shaver. It came with two double A batteries so it was ready to go right out the box. The shave is about what you would expect for a shaver this size. Adequate for taking care of a bit of five o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving this four stars instead of five is because the battery cover occasionally gets loose and pops off.</li>
    <li> This shaver appears to be small but does the job of the mighty powerful full sized shavers.</li>
    <li> I needed this for a surgery on my hip and I know I won&#x27;t be able to shave my legs so I got this based on the Reviews. Its Great. Like shaving with a razor.</li>
    <li> does a good job while on the road, and easy to pack in an overnight bag as it&#x27;s compact.  Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Works well. But it&#x27;s slightly not as good as the actual razor, since that actually cuts to the skin, making it feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Good travel shaver.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of an electric shaver but it gets the job done when traveling. Also, if flying you can avoid taking shaving cream leaving you room for other liquids.</li>
    <li> great little travel razor.  I keep one in each car for touch ups between offices and on the way to work.</li>
    <li> Ergonomically superb...but needs a &#x27;stache trimmer and it&#x27;d be PERFECT!!</li>
    <li> My husband was looking for a travel razor, and this one was a nice find. The razor is compact and works well, though there are a few things to keep in mind:  - There are only two heads rather than the three heads on a standard Philips Norelco razor, so it may take you longer to shave - Despite being compact, the razor is rather heavy with the batteries in - No travel case is included  Overall, it&#x27;s a very nice travel razor, especially if you&#x27;re accustomed to using a regular Philips Norelco razor at home.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor, and it worked well. But I wasn&#x27;t sure how well until I purchased another razor recently that wasn&#x27;t a rotary configuration. And the results just weren&#x27;t there. I now have new respect for this razor.I leave in the car. And that way I can use it on the run, saving time.</li>
    <li> It is small, light, easy to carry, period. It uses 2 AA batteries, which means I have to bought a bunch of AA batteries for it. I was expecting one with Li-battery. Well, I will regard it as a backup.</li>
