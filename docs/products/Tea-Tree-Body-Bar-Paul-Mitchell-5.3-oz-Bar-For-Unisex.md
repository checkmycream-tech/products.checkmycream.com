      <li>but they are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Though strong</li>
      <li>I discovered this at a fine hotel.  </li>
      <li>It was fine otherwise, but I had to put it in a plastic container to keep the scent from invading the house.  </li>
      <li>The awesome scent (it really does fill the whole room, indeed sometimes my whole apartment when I was in an apartment)with the most refreshing, crisp clean scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great way to start your day and the scent is terrific.  </li>
      <li>this soap is key you know when you use it, great smell...</li>
      <li>It clears up acne and any kind of bacterial infection and leaves the rest of my skin much more clean and healthy than regular soap.</li>
      <li>happy love this and all the other Tea Tree products by Paul Mitchell!</li>
      <li>I originally tried this soap about a yr ago when I bought the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>It is an amazing body soap but don&#x27;t get it close to your face if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve ever had that mmmm, not so fresh feeling, then this will clean you up in no time.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin super refreshed and tingly</li>
      <li>Smells good, has tea tree and lasts quite a long time.</li>
      <li>I love this soap but this is a very old.  </li>
      <li>But does not feel worth the price.</li>
      <li>Worth the cost.</li>
      <li>It will leave your skin feeling cool and refreshed even under a HOT shower.</li>
      <li>The scent is divine and leaves your skin tingling fresh.</li>
      <li>Yeah, you read it right.  </li>
      <li>particularly like that the clean smell stays with you for a bit.</li>
      <li>This is a great bar of soap, I enjoyed it very much but find it to be expensive.</li>
      <li>I first tried this soap as a freebie-</li>
      <li>and so is my boyfriend ;-).</li>
      <li>Absolutely loveeeeeee this soap!</li>
      <li>This seems to provide the same effect but with a more natural, clean scent.</li>
      <li>It will definitely give you a true sense of an invigorating clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>The oil and other additives give a nice long-lasting moisture to the skin.</li>
      <li>Worth the money, 1 bar lasts 3 times longer than normal soap.</li>
      <li>Super smooth lather is perfect for shaving (much cheaper than other products), and it lasts a long time, especially if you keep it dry when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling minty fresh, slightly tingly, and very clean.</li>
      <li>However, his enthusiasm for this soap really took me by surprise.</li>
      <li>Always feel completely clean after using it and it does not dry out your skin</li>
      <li>I dries helps clear your skin and has a fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Much bigger than the one I had tried originally.</li>
      <li>You can tell it has more tea tree oil than other brands, but they have balanced it well with mint</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to Tea Tree Soap at a Sports Clips and like most men, not normally accustomed to spending extra dollars&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
      <li>If able to find it less or 2 bars for the amount I paid, I&#x27;d purchase often.</li>
      <li>I also have mild acne  on my back so it does help me with that</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>That in itself is worth the extra expense.  </li>
      <li>The bar&#x27;s are very large and should last you around 7 to 10 day&#x27;s depending on your shower frequency.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The smell from this bar extended from our bathroom through the bedroom and into the family room.  It was fine otherwise, but I had to put it in a plastic container to keep the scent from invading the house.  I finally dumped it.  I could not stand the odor.</li>
    <li> I first tried this soap as a freebie- a salon was no longer carrying this line and got rid of all the products. After finishing the two bars I had, I have been searching to find it locally because I discovered that this soap is a wonder! Unfortunately, most salons that carry the Paul Mitchell tea tree line, do not have the body soap. They really should: it clears up all those annoying red bumps and irritations that easily develop on skin, and it also is a natural deodorant. The oil and other additives give a nice long-lasting moisture to the skin. Simply- this will now be my soap of choice, I just haven&#x27;t found a better product for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order was through \\&quot;Plus Samples\\&quot; for approximately $5.50. Apparently the supplier&#x27;s name does just that- they also included some sample products, which was an awesome surprise. And the price might seem a lot for soap, but the bar is huge! Much bigger than the one I had tried originally. And for the benefits, I would gladly order this product again for that price.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Super smooth lather is perfect for shaving (much cheaper than other products), and it lasts a long time, especially if you keep it dry when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
    <li> My husband is Mr. Low-Maintenance. However, his enthusiasm for this soap really took me by surprise. He went to the dermatologist for bad razor rash/bumps about 3 years ago. His topical Rx works well (when he uses it), but leaves him with a Vaseline-shiny face. He didn&#x27;t mind, as the Rx works fairly well and he&#x27;s not a fussy guy. However, this little miracle in the green box eliminated (yes, eliminated) the rash, left his skin smooth and nicely conditioned, it smells great -- and no \\&quot;shiny-happy-people\\&quot; face. And now, no more costly Rx to refill... yes! Go figure; I threw this little bar into his gym bag, and he met me after his shower raving about... soap! Wish I could buy this in a store locally... the 1.25 oz. was a sample in a health fair gift-bag. Buying a few bigger bars. Very surprised that the little one he uses at the gym is still lasting and lasting, though!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Tea Tree Soap at a Sports Clips and like most men, not normally accustomed to spending extra dollars&lt;br /&gt;on styling products, I was put off a bit by the high price, but, having had a shampoo with the Tea Tree product prior to my hair&lt;br /&gt;cut, and really enjoying the fragrance, I bought the shampoo, and, later, the soap from Amazon. Other reviewers have noted&lt;br /&gt;some nice skin enhancement benefits in using the soap; I wouldn&#x27;t dispute them except to add that the fragrance is wonderful;&lt;br /&gt;it seems to last into the day longer than other soaps, and while I don&#x27;t believe any bar of soap is worth $6.00, the price of&lt;br /&gt;probably ten bars of irish Spring, this is one of life&#x27;s little bathing luxuries that I continue to enjoy!</li>
    <li> Yeah, you read it right.  If you exercise relatively regularly you know that the battle against foot fungus can be an ongoing struggle.  I had settled into a pattern of always keeping anti-fungal creams around just in case I had a flare up.  With this soap, no more foot fungus.  Evar.  That in itself is worth the extra expense.  The awesome scent (it really does fill the whole room, indeed sometimes my whole apartment when I was in an apartment)with the most refreshing, crisp clean scent.  It is also a rather long lasting bar of soap, which helps alleviate my concerns about expense as well.    Too many benefits to pass up.  BUT IT NOW!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  I have used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo for year&#x27;s and have always liked how it made my scalp tingle and gave me a refreshing feeling.  When I found the bar soap, I had to give it a try.  It will definitely give you a true sense of an invigorating clean feeling.  Nothing will give you a better refreshed wake me up than this soap.  It&#x27;s a great way to start your day and the scent is terrific.  It also will not dry out your skin like some bar soaps.  The bar&#x27;s are very large and should last you around 7 to 10 day&#x27;s depending on your shower frequency.  A little pricey for a bar of soap but nothing compares to it that I have found.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This soap has been a lifesaver.  Due to my sensitive skin (skin rashes, etc), this soap has cleared my skin within a few days.  Using regular tea tree oil in my bath is not the same.  I&#x27;ve tried going back to regular bath soap, but always go back to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Body Bar.  Very happy with the quick arrival of my order.</li>
    <li> This is expensive soap.  In fact, I would never have tried it expect I got some as a gift.  If you&#x27;ve ever had that mmmm, not so fresh feeling, then this will clean you up in no time.  I had to buy more</li>
    <li> This soap it very nice if you have sensitive skin and it smells nice as well. Please note this is a REFRESHING soap. It will leave your skin feeling cool and refreshed even under a HOT shower. On those cold winter mornings this may not be what you were aiming for but it does leave you feeling clean and the soap last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of Paul Mithcell products and with all of them I give this warning.  The smell can over whelm some but they are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Though strong the bathroom always smells amazing just by having the soap in the shower.  When using it you feel this cooling effect that really leaves a great sensation.  Always feel completely clean after using it and it does not dry out your skin later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy love this and all the other Tea Tree products by Paul Mitchell!</li>
    <li> We love this soap. It has improved the look and feel of our skin.</li>
    <li> This soap bar is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; - not extraordinary enough to justify its cost, especially considering it doesn&#x27;t last as long as my triple-milled soap bars that cost about the same.  I bought a couple of these bars to quench my curiosity...the minty scent and lather is good...I would consider another purchase if the price drops 20% or more.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loveeeeeee this soap! So glad I found it and even happier that it was shipped immediately. My entire family uses this so I wish there were more available to purchase. Very happy with the soap and how quickly it was received!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other cheaper tea tree soaps, and this one is definitely worth the money. I bought it just for me, but it&#x27;s now the favorite soap of everyone in the family. They all complain loudly if I let it run out, so I always keep a spare bar in the bathroom cabinet. You can tell it has more tea tree oil than other brands, but they have balanced it well with mint so it doesn&#x27;t have the typical tea tree smell. It smells really good. It feels like it has lots of moisturizer in it too. It lathers up creamy, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> A great refreshing way to start the day. This soap is a great , quality soap that is really refreshing and leaves you awake and feel clan.</li>
    <li> Constantly ordering this! Wish they sold it in stores. Best soap I have ever used! Now y&#x27;all need to make deodorant!</li>
    <li> Smells good, has tea tree and lasts quite a long time. The soap is more expensive but last 3 times as long IMO than typical soap.</li>
    <li> my favorite body and face soap!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance.  Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my rosacea. It lathers nicely and smells nice. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helping my rosacea, but it&#x27;s a nice soap.</li>
    <li> Not only does it work great, it prevents fungus and bacteria as well and smells really good. Does not dry your skin and helps maintain ph balance.  And it lasts a long long time. Will never use anything else after buying this soap. The shampoo is great as well.</li>
    <li> The product is very good. But does not feel worth the price. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It was a reviewer here that convinced me to get this by her review. My husband hated my soft soaps in the morning for shaving. I got him this for his shower and shave and he loves it. The smell is great too and I have started to use it as well.</li>
    <li> The soap smells really good but it is pricey.  I will look for something local to see if I can find something similar, a little bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> I discovered this at a fine hotel.  Took home every bar I could get my hands on.  The scent is divine and leaves your skin tingling fresh.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this soap once as part of a gift basket and don&#x27;t really like using soap bars so it took me a while to actually try it. Once I did, I was hooked. The mint smell is invigorating and the tingling feeling it leaves on your skin is so soothing. Also, if you are like me and are very sensitive to perfumes or fragrances when washing your &amp;#34;feminine areas&amp;#34; this soap is for you. I was a little wary of it at first but it never gave me any adverse reactions and actually kept me feeling fresh for longer than other products I&#x27;ve used. I used to use Summer&#x27;s Eve (Sensitive Formula) until I used this soap. Now I&#x27;m obsessed with it and so is my boyfriend ;-).</li>
    <li> this soap is key you know when you use it, great smell...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only started using, so I can&#x27;t attest to how long it lasts. However, I will say that it has a great \\&quot;just clean\\&quot; smell and lathers pretty well. So far, the best menthol-rosemary-verbena-type bar soap I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used dozens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like that the clean smell stays with you for a bit. I&#x27;m not a big fan of colognes or the Axe-type body sprays. This seems to provide the same effect but with a more natural, clean scent.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and just ordered some more</li>
    <li> This is very refreshing to use.  And easy on my skin.  Will keep using it a long&lt;br /&gt;it is out on the market.</li>
    <li> I love this soap but this is a very old.  I opened the first box and it was already starting to crack and has no smell at all.</li>
    <li> This body bar is wonderful.  Very refreshing leaves skin feeling clean and the whole bathroom smells great.  Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I originally tried this soap about a yr ago when I bought the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo and conditioner (soap was free) and it was really nice, however I did stop using it but I couldn&#x27;t remember why. I repurchased on September 2012 and very quickly remembered why I didn&#x27;t repurchase before. It&#x27;s not for sensitive skin, it will burn it! It is an amazing body soap but don&#x27;t get it close to your face if you have sensitive skin. It leaves your skin super refreshed and tingly which is great if you are not a morning person (me) and it helps with razor bumps.  So in conclusion FACE&#x3D; NOOO BODY&#x3D; YESSS</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Works great for my son&#x27;s and boyfriend&#x27;s acne problems.  It&#x27;s a little strong so I don&#x27;t use it, but it&#x27;s still a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for a while now, since all of the body washes contain sodium laureth sulfate.&lt;br /&gt; I also have mild acne  on my back so it does help me with that considered that all other tea tree products like oils, toner a bit harsh and make skin red. Soap is great way to start, without irritation, it has pleasant  mint smell as well. I dont like anything mint but this product also has tea tree so it well balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to give it a try!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling minty fresh, slightly tingly, and very clean. It clears up acne and any kind of bacterial infection and leaves the rest of my skin much more clean and healthy than regular soap. Also, no residue!</li>
    <li> I like the soap but it makes my crotch tingle.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this soap. It&#x27;s my signature soap. Take them everywhere!!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I dries helps clear your skin and has a fresh scent. You skin feels tingly when you are done using.</li>
    <li> This is a great bar of soap, I enjoyed it very much but find it to be expensive. If able to find it less or 2 bars for the amount I paid, I&#x27;d purchase often.</li>
    <li> Great product for fair dry skin. Cleans the dead skin and puts moisture back in. Worth the money, 1 bar lasts 3 times longer than normal soap.</li>
