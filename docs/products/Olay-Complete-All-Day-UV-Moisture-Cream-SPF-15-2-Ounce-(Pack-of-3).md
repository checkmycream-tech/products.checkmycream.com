      <li>Love this cream.</li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>more readily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Without the doctor&#x27;s recommendation, I would have never tried Olay as I always viewed their stuff as cosmetic more than protective.</li>
      <li>I love that this cream is hydrating and includes SPF protection.  </li>
      <li>I love this face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love using this during the summer to prevent dryness.</li>
      <li>Has SPF 15, I&#x27;d use something on top of it</li>
      <li>I love that its a 3 pack because my husband loves to use it too.</li>
      <li>All Day UV moisture cream (SPF 15) for more years than we can count.</li>
      <li>Thinking again that perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the cream, I tried this UV Moisture cream and behold - more</li>
      <li>I buy this pack for the price; plus I love Olay products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and light on my skin.</li>
      <li>This is way better for your face than putting on SPF Suntan lotion when going in the sun.  </li>
      <li>It is very clean, no gooyness at all.  </li>
      <li>For extremely dry skin, this would be perfect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the dry winter, but also has SPF for the spring/summertime.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the original hydrating cream, and upon moving to California, decided I needed more protection from the sun.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find this complete in a pack of three.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a great product so far</li>
      <li>Unlike perfumes, this cream has lotion function, perfume smell, and it makes me happy everyday with good smell on my face.</li>
      <li>This face cream goes on easily and protects my face from the sun and keeps it moist as well.  </li>
      <li>I always use this product it goes on nice &amp; has a fresh clean scent</li>
      <li>The cream is light and does a good job of moisturizing my normal skin.</li>
      <li>Like this more than the higher priced creams!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cream,it feels fresh and  my face moistured.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this multiple times and continue to be happy with it.</li>
      <li>Love it, and it works the first time you use it...</li>
      <li>This is a good all-around moisturize cream, I even use it at night on top of my regular night cream.</li>
      <li>so I bought a new one at the store just to be sure.</li>
      <li>Its great because its creamy and really moisturizes all day long.</li>
      <li>I use this product every day and it makes my skin really smooth guards against wrinkles really like this. .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to Olay Complete:)</li>
      <li>Economical and meets my needs:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As with any cream my face does feel oily and shiny for the first 2 minutes but that goes away quickly</li>
      <li>I like using it right after my face has been washed.  </li>
      <li>The price was definitely right for me.</li>
      <li>Now, I can easily hide most  shininess with a bit of loose powder, but that doesn&#x27;t even put a dent in the glare that comes off of my forehead and cheeks with this product.  </li>
      <li>The new one I purchased worked fine.</li>
      <li>so glad i was able to save a little by ordering the 3 pks from amazon.</li>
      <li>As they became worse/itchier/burning, I stopped using all products on my face and eventually reintroduced the normal face wash and the original hydrating cream.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite daily face cream, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in my local stores anymore.</li>
      <li>In the summer I use a lighter cream with higher uva/uvb potection around 25 or 30.</li>
      <li>At first, I observed this cream was a bit heavier and oilier than the hydrating cream, however, I assumed I would become accustom to the feeling.</li>
      <li>You cant go wrong because the prize is perfect.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin smooth and soft</li>
      <li>and I will purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>Also when it is hot, it does not hurt my eyes while perspiring.  </li>
      <li>And higher when I go to the beach etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has SPF 15 which helps with my efforts to stay as healthy as possible.</li>
      <li>Though I cannot recommend this product, I completely recommend using the original hydrating cream.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised how quickly it worked because I have been using moisturizers for years and have never run across one that worked over night like this one does...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as much &amp;#34;chunk&amp;#34; in it, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and does its job--moisturizes and provides me with a daily SPF.  </li>
      <li>The smell is a little sunscreen-y, to be honest, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
      <li>It goes on and absorbs fast.  </li>
      <li>For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it</li>
      <li>I feel this cream is very moisturizing ( the normal version) and gives me the uva/uvb protection for shorter days in the fall/winter.</li>
      <li>Main concern was sunscreen but the moisturizing is a bonus.  </li>
      <li>Both of these characteristics are important for someone with dry skin living at a high altitude.</li>
      <li>Highly suggested</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this skincare cream.</li>
      <li>and I broke out so normal</li>
      <li>Keeps my facial skin pretty.</li>
      <li>Apply this before doing eyes so it dries somewhat, and you&#x27;ll have no trouble applying your powder.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not heavy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>I can buy this product locally, but with Amazon Prime, much cheaper.</li>
      <li>My husband and I have been using Olay Complete</li>
      <li>tried the sensitive version one time</li>
      <li>I am in my early 20s</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s also sensitive.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it and hope that the sensitive skin version comes back!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve definitely spent money on more expensive lotions which were just full of perfumes and nonsense.</li>

    <li> I love the Olay products!! It moisturize and protects against the elements. You cant go wrong because the prize is perfect.</li>
    <li> Like this more than the higher priced creams!</li>
    <li> This is a good all-around moisturize cream, I even use it at night on top of my regular night cream. Makes my skin feel good and it lasts.</li>
    <li> my daughter uses this and she loves it, she&#x27;s being deployed to afghanistan for a year and wanted to take enough with her for a while so im so glad i was able to save a little by ordering the 3 pks from amazon.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t for my skin my be</li>
    <li> Love it, and it works the first time you use it... I was very surprised how quickly it worked because I have been using moisturizers for years and have never run across one that worked over night like this one does... I am licensed to do this kind of work and have used almost every brand you can name on the market! I am hooked after all of these years on this one product, I started out using Oil Of Olay when I was a teen and have been using Olay products through out the years. This one I read about in a review on a well known Beauty Blog on the Internet. I am really glad the I decided to try it!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years and thought this price sounded too good to be true. The first day I put it on my face broke out in a rash within less than 24 hours. I thought maybe Olay had changed the ingredients so I bought a new one at the store just to be sure. The new one I purchased worked fine. The ones I got on Amazon look identical to the one I bought it the store but there is definitely something in them that made me break out-- not sure if they are fakes or expired.</li>
    <li> Really great face cream!!</li>
    <li> I prefer this jar to the bottle</li>
    <li> Like it quite well.  Have been using Olay products quite a few years.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the Moisture cream because it protects her skin from UV rays all day the cream is a good value.</li>
    <li> Have been using this line of product for several years. I was happy to find this complete in a pack of three.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite daily face cream, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in my local stores anymore. I was happy to see I could buy it in bulk. Great price, I&#x27;ll be set for awhile :)</li>
    <li> My skin feels hydrated when I use this before applying my make up.  Has SPF 15, I&#x27;d use something on top of it if I know I&#x27;ll be outdoors more.</li>
    <li> Have dry, Irish-type skin: somewhat pale with minimal freckles and prone to dark spots.  Had trouble finding sunscreen on top of which I could apply merely powder as powders turned orange.  Main concern was sunscreen but the moisturizing is a bonus.  Apply this before doing eyes so it dries somewhat, and you&#x27;ll have no trouble applying your powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The same is in a bottle, but a little less moisturing as it has alcohol so that it can be poured more readily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the doctor&#x27;s recommendation, I would have never tried Olay as I always viewed their stuff as cosmetic more than protective.</li>
    <li> This face cream goes on easily and protects my face from the sun and keeps it moist as well.  Also when it is hot, it does not hurt my eyes while perspiring.  It is hard to find in the stores so I am happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> It feels nice going on and my eyes don&#x27;t burn.  It&#x27;s been a great product so far and I will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> This is one of my tops. In the fall/winter I have dry skin and it&#x27;s also sensitive. I feel this cream is very moisturizing ( the normal version) and gives me the uva/uvb protection for shorter days in the fall/winter. In the summer I use a lighter cream with higher uva/uvb potection around 25 or 30. And higher when I go to the beach etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I bought in 3 count so I have enough to last till at least February. So I am happy about that too. Economical and meets my needs:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the sensitive version one time and I broke out so normal is my pref.</li>
    <li> great product....been using it since my husband bought it for a joke on my 50th............i guess the joke is on him</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  It doesn&#x27;t have as much &amp;#34;chunk&amp;#34; in it, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and does its job--moisturizes and provides me with a daily SPF.  For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it and I&#x27;ve definitely spent money on more expensive lotions which were just full of perfumes and nonsense. I&#x27;ll stick to Olay Complete:)</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 10 years.  My dermatologist wanted to know what I use because my skin is in good condition for my age.  I ski and spend a lot of time outside.  I never get burned with this product!  I do not lay out in the sun, though.  I highly recommend it and hope that the sensitive skin version comes back!</li>
    <li> This is way better for your face than putting on SPF Suntan lotion when going in the sun.  And it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes when you sweat!!!</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Leaves skin smooth and soft</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this skincare cream. Price can&#x27;t tell truth. The most expensive product doesn&#x27;t do the function. Trust me.</li>
    <li> I love using this during the summer to prevent dryness. It&#x27;s nice and light on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years and have gotten so many compliments on my skin, a happy thing for someone of Medicare age.</li>
    <li> I buy this pack for the price; plus I love Olay products. The cream is light and does a good job of moisturizing my normal skin. As with any cream my face does feel oily and shiny for the first 2 minutes but that goes away quickly and all I&#x27;m left with is soft pretty-smelling skin. I&#x27;ve ordered this multiple times and continue to be happy with it.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 20s and I have been using Oil of Olay products for around 5 years; my mom has been using the traditional hydrating cream (which I ordinarily use) for 20+ years. I LOVE the original hydrating cream, and upon moving to California, decided I needed more protection from the sun. At first, I observed this cream was a bit heavier and oilier than the hydrating cream, however, I assumed I would become accustom to the feeling. After prolonged, I started noticing little bumps under/around my eyes and I assumed it was an allergic reaction to something - not thinking it would be the cream. As they became worse/itchier/burning, I stopped using all products on my face and eventually reintroduced the normal face wash and the original hydrating cream. Thinking again that perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the cream, I tried this UV Moisture cream and behold - more bumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that I might be having a reaction most people do not have, however, as a long time user of Oil of Olay products, I was surprised by the reaction my skin had and overall disappointed in the feel of the cream on my skin. It&#x27;s way too oily and leaves an unnatural sheen on your skin. Though I cannot recommend this product, I completely recommend using the original hydrating cream.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using Olay Complete All Day UV moisture cream (SPF 15) for more years than we can count. For the money, it cannot be beat. But suddenly, the product became difficult to find in retail stores. So we were very happy to find a package of 3 on Amazon at a very fair price. We believe this product is excellent and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream,it feels fresh and  my face moistured. I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> very good, I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years &amp; like it because it makes my face feel softer and moisterized.  The price was good for this.</li>
    <li> This is a product that my dermatologist told me to use every day.  I have been using it about a year and am very happy with the way my skin feels.  It has SPF 15 which helps with my efforts to stay as healthy as possible.</li>
    <li> I love this face moisturizer. It&#x27;s perfect for the dry winter, but also has SPF for the spring/summertime. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone and everyone. The smell is a little sunscreen-y, to be honest, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
    <li> This cream is a little thick so a little goes a long way on my face/throat.  I like using it right after my face has been washed.  It takes away that taut feeling that I usually get in the winter months.  I think it will last a long while.</li>
    <li> I can buy this product locally, but with Amazon Prime, much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love that this cream is hydrating and includes SPF protection.  Both of these characteristics are important for someone with dry skin living at a high altitude. The downfall lies is how shiny my face becomes after application.  Now, I can easily hide most  shininess with a bit of loose powder, but that doesn&#x27;t even put a dent in the glare that comes off of my forehead and cheeks with this product.  For extremely dry skin, this would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  It is very clean, no gooyness at all.  It goes on and absorbs fast.  No lingering film.  A great product.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and it makes my skin really smooth guards against wrinkles really like this. .</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It&#x27;s not easy to find a light facial cream that also has SPF included.</li>
    <li> Used previously,  restocking supply</li>
    <li> Unlike perfumes, this cream has lotion function, perfume smell, and it makes me happy everyday with good smell on my face. Highly suggested</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom. She requested this brand so I&#x27;m assuming she likes its performance. She said it has reduced the appearance of age spots. It was recommended by her doctor. The price was definitely right for me.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST DEAL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN OF OLAY.  AM SAVING 1/2 TO 2/3 OVER THE COST MT AMY DRUG SHORT.</li>

    <li> will use it during the summer and when we go on our annual tip to Laughlin.......nothing more to say here</li>

    <li> I always use this product it goes on nice &amp; has a fresh clean scent</li>
    <li> I love this face moisturizer! Its great because its creamy and really moisturizes all day long. It provides an SPF 15 protection from the sun without leaving my face looking or feeling greasy. I love that its a 3 pack because my husband loves to use it too.</li>
