### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Heard a lot of good things about this and have been using this for 3-4 weeks.  </li>
      <li>As we move into autumn this should be a good test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The reason I bought this is because of the good reviews it had</li>
      <li>And, BTW, for best results use this serum under Flexitone BB cream, also available from Dr. Brandt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Then I tried this spot remover, and it does not seem to be as effective, but it did fade them some.</li>
      <li>It might be cheaper (and more effective) to \\&quot;burn\\</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 63, very fair and used to live in the sunshine.  </li>
      <li>No change at all in the spots on the top of my hands.  </li>
      <li>I should be able to tell something that way.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no indication of how many days/weeks/months/years should go by before some fading is noticeable.  </li>
      <li>The product feels lovely as it goes onto the top of my hands.</li>
      <li>but I beleive that if you want real quick visibl results you&#x27;ll have to go with a perscribtion lightener that you can get with a visit to the dermatologist.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried Clinque to compare, but I&#x27;m not switching now : )</li>
      <li>I used it on age spots, discolored skin caused by a burn, and ruddy skin at the top of my cheeks.</li>
      <li>After 5 weeks still mostly nothing.  </li>
      <li>I probably have to use it 2 to 3 months more.  </li>
      <li>The product information states the serum \\&quot;will reduce skin pigmentation and discoloration for a more uniform &amp; brighter complexion.</li>
      <li>whatever that is, but the site&#x27;s claim is that it&#x27;s an \\&quot;innovative encapsulated lightening peptide\\&quot;), and pomegranate</li>
      <li>I did find another product that worked a lot better than this.  </li>
      <li>the spots removed, I can use more benign moisturizing and sunblock products on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>more closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of course you must use a strong sunscreen or after every sun exposure the spots will darken again.  </li>
      <li>For best result, it&#x27;s  important to use these products every day, then apply sunscreen, again I love the sunscreen rom Clinque because it has a little color to it, like a BB cream.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see a significant improvement.  </li>
      <li>They have faded significantly....</li>
      <li>so I am pretty sure this would be a factor also as to the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full ingredient list from the Dr Brandt website:&lt;br</li>
      <li>gives good results for a lot less money.serum under Flexitone BB cream, also available from Dr. Brandt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s probably worth checking with your dermatologist.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it for</li>
      <li>It costs a bit ore but worth it cuz it will fade spots.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update this review after I&#x27;ve had a chance to see more long term effects, but I certainly enjoy how it feels.</li>
      <li>For this product in particular, the primary risk factors are with allergies and immuno-toxicity, not cancer or reproductive health.</li>
      <li>This may be suitable for someone just starting to have spots</li>
      <li>gives good results for a lot less money.</li>
      <li>She advised me to never ever go out in the sun without sunblock on first and then put the Dr. Brandt on, then if you need moisturizer you can.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll check back in a couple more weeks!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am also pretty sure that the skin of people is different</li>
      <li>Most of my spots are on my hands and there&#x27;s only one noticeable one on my face.  </li>
      <li>I saw any results in the first 30 days I would be tempted to continue</li>
      <li>It is great for traveling, because the pump closes down completely so you don&#x27;t have to worry about spills and leaks.</li>
      <li>I appreciate the honest feedback from the other customers.  </li>
      <li>While not a dermatologist nor someone who has ever paid much attention to such things, I am never-the-less pretty sure</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous spot fading creams, and most of them did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>To interject something positive:  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Should I really bother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>at a reasonable price, I would.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really think this through before designing the experiment.  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be reasonable here</li>
      <li>I normally order products that I really want to try and 99% of the time they are exactly what I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>far as getting rid of unwanted spots, I&#x27;m no more successful with this Dr. Brandt&#x27;s serum than Lady Macbeth</li>
      <li>The dispenser has a pop up twist top with a small opening to allow just the right amount of product to be placed in the exact spot needed.</li>
      <li>There is most certainly a change; a lightening of the dark spots on my wife&#x27;s hands.</li>
      <li>The top twists and pops up, twists and goes down.</li>
      <li>There MAY be a slight lightening on one of them (might also be wishful thinking), and one of them has some redness around it that&#x27;s showing up now, but mostly nothing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll need to keep on using it to be sure, although the results so far are not promising.  </li>
      <li>Yet, the data also notes limited available data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m thinking maybe it&#x27;s several months to even years before they fade and by that time new ones will surely have cropped up to join them, no matter how religiously you slather on sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>almost completely gone!!</li>
      <li>So really I just have the skin one could expect for someone headed to the ripe old age of 70.  </li>
      <li>giving this three stars because it seems, in my humble assessment, a relatively safe product.</li>
      <li>Tune in next month for another exciting report.</li>
      <li>: if you use sunblock and stay out of the sun, it&#x27;s pretty likely that this would be 100% of the reason you wouldn&#x27;t get any new sun/age</li>
      <li>I selected this product quickly, after a quick scan revealed that at least it contains no hydroquinone.</li>
      <li>But when I finally blew a few bucks and got Clinique clinical better spot remover, it was the first one I ever tried that actually faded the spots by about 50%.  </li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t expect complete removal of spots.</li>
      <li>Hydroquinone is very damaging to the skin especially on the face.</li>
      <li>It came in a bottle marked \\&quot;not for resale\\&quot; and had no ingredients listed.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the product as far as letting shoppers know wether it works or not.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think any over the counter product can completely remove spots.</li>
      <li>but so did my skin color as it always does this time of year when I am not outside as much as in the summer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it at least six or more times a day as I keep a bottle on the end table and use it while watching television.  </li>
      <li>I would look elsewhere if you are looking for something that will completely remove sun spots.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the serum for 5 months now, and I can definitely see a huge difference in the dark spots on my face.  </li>
      <li>This is the first spot remover I&#x27;ve tried and was hoping, due to the well known brand name, that I would have some results.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>While by no means definitive, it does offer information on each ingredient, listing known risks and rating the risk as low, moderate, or high.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve barely seen miniscule results in three months</li>
      <li>/&gt;So is it worth the trouble of applying this faithfully every day?  </li>
      <li>gave it three stars because it did not sting my eyes even when I rubbed them, does not leave any irritating residue, and does not have any overwhelming scent.</li>
      <li>(It&#x27;s actually 0 stars for my results so far, but it hasn&#x27;t been very long</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and I don&#x27;t see a significant improvement.  I probably have to use it 2 to 3 months more.  I&#x27;ll write another review in three months.  The reason I bought this is because of the good reviews it had and also I don&#x27;t like to use lightening products that contain hydroquinone.  Hydroquinone is very damaging to the skin especially on the face.</li>
    <li> Heard a lot of good things about this and have been using this for 3-4 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything substantial yet, so I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.  Will keep using until it&#x27;s gone, but I would have expected to see a difference by now.</li>
    <li> It worked well on my dark spots on my face.  The dispenser has a pop up twist top with a small opening to allow just the right amount of product to be placed in the exact spot needed.</li>
    <li> (It&#x27;s actually 0 stars for my results so far, but it hasn&#x27;t been very long so I&#x27;ve given it an inconclusive 3.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as getting rid of unwanted spots, I&#x27;m no more successful with this Dr. Brandt&#x27;s serum than Lady Macbeth was with her obsessive hand washing.  At least mine are age spots/sun spots and not the result of a guilty conscience.  But then hers were imaginary so she comes out ahead anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the instructions, this serum should be applied to one&#x27;s spots twice a day.  There&#x27;s no indication of how many days/weeks/months/years should go by before some fading is noticeable.  At the rate mine are fading (not at all after three weeks), I&#x27;m thinking maybe it&#x27;s several months to even years before they fade and by that time new ones will surely have cropped up to join them, no matter how religiously you slather on sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is it worth the trouble of applying this faithfully every day?  Well, I have no idea.  It may work.  I&#x27;ll need to keep on using it to be sure, although the results so far are not promising.  Most of my spots are on my hands and there&#x27;s only one noticeable one on my face.  So really I just have the skin one could expect for someone headed to the ripe old age of 70.  Isn&#x27;t it all downhill for me now anyway?  Should I really bother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious about the ingredients of the serum and could not, for some reason, find the information on the bottle or the box it came in, so I went to the Dr. Brandt website to find out.  This contains vitamin C, olive-leaf extract, zinc PCA, beta-bright (whatever that is, but the site&#x27;s claim is that it&#x27;s an \\&quot;innovative encapsulated lightening peptide\\&quot;), and pomegranate enzyme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for results of its use, the website claim is that this serum 1) helps prevent formation of spots by regulating melatonin production, 2) reduces discoloration, 3) promotes even, uniform complexion, and 4) targets sun spots, age spots, etc. And, BTW, for best results use this serum under Flexitone BB cream, also available from Dr. Brandt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m just going to wear my age spots with pride and a WTH attitude.  And if that noticeable spot on the face gets worse, I hear that 15% hydrogen peroxide (not the 3% solution used as an antiseptic) applied directly to the spot and left overnight gives good results for a lot less money.serum under Flexitone BB cream, also available from Dr. Brandt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m just going to wear my age spots with pride and a WTH attitude.

    <li> In all honesty I am not sure if this stuff works our not. This is actually the second bottle of this product my wife and I have used...expensive I must say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have rather mixed results. There is most certainly a change; a lightening of the dark spots on my wife&#x27;s hands. There is nothing super dramatic here but lighter they are. On the other hand the two dark places on my face show no change what-so-every. They are smallish spots and are not all that dark to begin with but be that as it may, I see no changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it all depends upon what sort of &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34; are involved. While not a dermatologist nor someone who has ever paid much attention to such things, I am never-the-less pretty sure that &amp;#34;dark spot&amp;#34; are caused by different things. I am also pretty sure that the skin of people is different so I am pretty sure this would be a factor also as to the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line I suppose is that is something you are probably going to have to try yourself and just hope it works for you. I seriously doubt that we will be purchasing another bottle of this stuff ourselves as the cost does not justify the questionable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous spot fading creams, and most of them did absolutely nothing. But when I finally blew a few bucks and got Clinique clinical better spot remover, it was the first one I ever tried that actually faded the spots by about 50%.  Then I tried this spot remover, and it does not seem to be as effective, but it did fade them some. It comes in a gel form with a pump bottle. I don&#x27;t think any over the counter product can completely remove spots. For best result, it&#x27;s  important to use these products every day, then apply sunscreen, again I love the sunscreen rom Clinque because it has a little color to it, like a BB cream. I don&#x27;t think I will be switching to Dr. Brants from Clinique. It costs a bit ore but worth it cuz it will fade spots. But don&#x27;t expect complete removal of spots. For that you need a visit to a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I selected this product quickly, after a quick scan revealed that at least it contains no hydroquinone. I didn&#x27;t have time to research it further before ordering and, with it now in hand, have looked at the ingredients more closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The non-profit Environmental Working Group has a helpful database of cosmetics (and a separate one for sunscreens). While by no means definitive, it does offer information on each ingredient, listing known risks and rating the risk as low, moderate, or high. It ranks products overall, and also breaks it down by ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, \\&quot;Dr. Brandt&#x27;s\\&quot; products seems to score higher-than-average risk for the various categories. For this product in particular, the primary risk factors are with allergies and immuno-toxicity, not cancer or reproductive health. Yet, the data also notes limited available data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link:  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m not inclined to use this product. For the dark spots, my dermatologist dabs them with something (liquid nitrogen?) and they peel away in a few days. But my dark spots are small; if yours are large-ish, maybe that isn&#x27;t an option. Still, it&#x27;s probably worth checking with your dermatologist. It might be cheaper (and more effective) to \\&quot;burn\\&quot; off the spots that apply a variety of chemicals to your skin, with inferior results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the spots removed, I can use more benign moisturizing and sunblock products on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it seems, in my humble assessment, a relatively safe product. Other opinions may differ.</li>
    <li> Given the price of this product, I&#x27;d expect dramatic results.  What I&#x27;ve noticed is subtle.  Nobody else has noticed any difference in my appearance.  I do like the dispenser.  It&#x27;s a very slick, clever design.  I do not like the sticky feeling on my hands and skin from applying this product.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I used the serum twice a day until I ran out of product; about 30 days. It used under your daily moisturizer/ sunscreen or night cream.  The product information states the serum \\&quot;will reduce skin pigmentation and discoloration for a more uniform &amp; brighter complexion. And improve cell turnover renewal by gently lifting unwanted pigmentation &amp; dead cells from skin&#x27;s surface to help skin appear brighter, healthier &amp; refreshed\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;At $55.00 for a 30 day supply it would be $660 annually to add this to my routine.&lt;br /&gt;If I saw any results in the first 30 days I would be tempted to continue but unfortunately my dark spots and general skin pigmentation are the same as when I started using the serum so it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full ingredient list from the Dr Brandt website:&lt;br /&gt;WATER (AQUA), GLYCERIN, LACTOBACILLUS/PUNICA GRANATUM FRUIT FERMENT EXTRACT, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, PPG-26-BUTETH-26, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/VP COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, LIMONENE, CHLORPHENESIN, ZINC PCA, ASCORBYL GLUCOSIDE, OLEA EUROPAEA (OLIVE) LEAF EXTRACT, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, OLIGOPEPTIDE-68, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM OLEATE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll update this review after I&#x27;ve had a chance to see more long term effects, but I certainly enjoy how it feels.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum twice a day for almost 4 weeks, as directed, and have seen no change whatsoever.  Was truly hoping this would work.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to my glycolic lotion and 50 sunscreen.  Someone told me her esthetician used olive oil and lemon juice to diminish brown spots.  I see that this serum&#x27;s ingredients contain orange peel oil, so maybe that will work?  This is the first spot remover I&#x27;ve tried and was hoping, due to the well known brand name, that I would have some results.  I&#x27;m open to almost anything at this point.  If I could have the spots removed without the chance of scars. at a reasonable price, I would.  I&#x27;m 63, very fair and used to live in the sunshine.  Now it&#x27;s hats, shade and sunscreen for me!  No cancer cells yet!  I appreciate the honest feedback from the other customers.  I rely on them!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t recommend this product.  I used twice a day along with sunscreen.  Saw no results at all.  I did find another product that worked a lot better than this.  I would not waste my money with Dark Spots No More</li>
    <li> I normally order products that I really want to try and 99% of the time they are exactly what I had hoped.  Unfortunately, \\&quot;Dr. Brandt Dark Spots No More Serum Concentre\\&quot; falls into the 1% that does not meet my expectations.  I have been using the product about three weeks and there is absolutely no improvement.  Maybe I have not given the product enough time, but I believe I have.  No change at all in the spots on the top of my hands.  To interject something positive:  The product feels lovely as it goes onto the top of my hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over three weeks on some sun spots that appeared on my nose.  It has faded them slightly, but hasn&#x27;t provided the results I expected.  I would look elsewhere if you are looking for something that will completely remove sun spots.  I did like the container&#x27;s design. It is great for traveling, because the pump closes down completely so you don&#x27;t have to worry about spills and leaks.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample to review.  It came in a bottle marked \\&quot;not for resale\\&quot; and had no ingredients listed.  I don&#x27;t have any really bad allergies and there was no scary background music so I gave it a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because it did not sting my eyes even when I rubbed them, does not leave any irritating residue, and does not have any overwhelming scent. My dark spots did fade a little but so did my skin color as it always does this time of year when I am not outside as much as in the summer.  I didn&#x27;t really think this through before designing the experiment.  There is still some left so I plan to try it on one half of one hand.  I should be able to tell something that way. Tune in next month for another exciting report.</li>
    <li> I am using product every night and my brown spots seem to be fading. Hopefully this will do the trick!!</li>
    <li> The packaging for \\&quot;Dark Spots No More\\&quot; contains fairly limited instructions.  This product is supposed to reduce discoloration, help prevent formation of dark spots and \\&quot;deliver optimal dark spot fading results\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long does it take?  A week?  A year?  Dr. Brandt won&#x27;t tell you.  You know what he will tell you?  That he is a \\&quot;practicing celebrity dermatologist\\&quot;.  Um.... oh, and that you apply this to your \\&quot;face, neck, and decollete\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also tells you that you should (and I&#x27;m paraphrasing here) use sunblock AND stay out of the sun. Let&#x27;s be reasonable here: if you use sunblock and stay out of the sun, it&#x27;s pretty likely that this would be 100% of the reason you wouldn&#x27;t get any new sun/age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... no results yet, for me.  I have several sun/age spots that I&#x27;d like to wipe out.  I&#x27;m going to use this product twice a day as directed, and OCCASIONALLY use sunblock.  As we move into autumn this should be a good test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not this product is \\&quot;too expensive\\&quot; will of course depend on whether it does anything.  I&#x27;ll post updates here as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/17 UPDATE: I began using this on 10/1, so, it&#x27;s been 2.5 weeks.  I can&#x27;t see any results yet.&lt;br /&gt;11/6 UPDATE: After 5 weeks still mostly nothing.  I&#x27;ve got 5 different spots or blotches on my face that I&#x27;m focusing on. There MAY be a slight lightening on one of them (might also be wishful thinking), and one of them has some redness around it that&#x27;s showing up now, but mostly nothing.  I&#x27;ll check back in a couple more weeks!&lt;br /&gt;12/3 UPDATE: I&#x27;m not seeing any difference from the above.  I&#x27;m getting close to giving up, but I think I&#x27;m going to at least go another couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;12/30 UPDATE: I think I&#x27;m going to give up.  No further changes in my skin despite daily application of this stuff.  Maybe it works for some, but it didn&#x27;t work for me... on any of the 4 different types of spots I&#x27;ve been trying it on.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice a day for two weeks, then increased to three times a day for a week. I used it on age spots, discolored skin caused by a burn, and ruddy skin at the top of my cheeks. In every case there was no reduction in discoloration, or improvement in clarity. Simply, it doesn&#x27;t work. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s fifty-four dollars or one dollar, if it doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In it&#x27;s favor, it does come in a neat container. There&#x27;s no cap to fiddle with. The top twists and pops up, twists and goes down. It goes on smoothly, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the product as far as letting shoppers know wether it works or not. I haven&#x27;t been using it like it is instructed. That is the reason for a 4 star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for 5 months now, and I can definitely see a huge difference in the dark spots on my face.  They have faded significantly....almost completely gone!! I do use a foundation with SPF 20 in it and whenever I&#x27;m in the sun, I use additional sunscreen to prevent any further sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 1 oz bottle lasted me 3 months.  It&#x27;s expensive, but if you are looking to get rid of those ugly spots, this product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried Clinque to compare, but I&#x27;m not switching now : )</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  This product barely works and it&#x27;s extremely slow.  Also it&#x27;s overpriced for the expected results.  The instructions tell you to use it twice a day.  I&#x27;ve been using it at least six or more times a day as I keep a bottle on the end table and use it while watching television.  I&#x27;ve barely seen miniscule results in three months but I doubt I would have if I had used it according to the directions.  After this bottle is empty, I won&#x27;t buy another bottle, I&#x27;ll try a different brand. Wish I could have gotten a refund.  I very strongly do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> my husband uses this every day.  He has seen a slight improvement.  Of course you must use a strong sunscreen or after every sun exposure the spots will darken again.  He has found if he doesn&#x27;t use it for a day or so they come back. This may be suitable for someone just starting to have spots but I beleive that if you want real quick visibl results you&#x27;ll have to go with a perscribtion lightener that you can get with a visit to the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> My cousin works at a Beverly Hills spa and I asked her to reccomend a product for brown spots.  She advised me to never ever go out in the sun without sunblock on first and then put the Dr. Brandt on, then if you need moisturizer you can.  I haven&#x27;t been faithful about using this every day, just haven&#x27;t gotten into the habit.  But since my cousin esthetician in Beverly Hills recommended it, I think it will probably meet my expectations.</li>
