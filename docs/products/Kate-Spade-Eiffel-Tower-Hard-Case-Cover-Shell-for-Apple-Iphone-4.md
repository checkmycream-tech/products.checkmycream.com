<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for my niece for her bday liked it so much kept it a s bought a new one for her!!!</li>
    <li> I love protective cases, and this case definitely does the job. I wanted a case that wasn&#x27;t silicone so it wouldnt be falling off by accident. I stumbled across this case and for 5 bucks it was worth it. Probably would&#x27;ve bought it still if it was more money. I have been using this case for 2 weeks straight and for someone who has more than 30 cases that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
    <li> I love this case, the colors are pretty. The case is hard and protects well even after dropping my phone.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected, cute case :-) unfortunately due to my clumsiness, it  got broken after dropping my phone 3x, tsk tsk, I might order another one again :-)</li>
    <li> Cute and durable with a nice design. Easy to put on A little on the bulky side. I&#x27;ve dropped it one and no cracks or dings</li>
    <li> This case is exactly what you see, I love it and it keeps my phone well protected. thank you kate spade</li>
    <li> I ordered this over a month ago, and it hasn&#x27;t shown up... I will do an update review if I receive it.</li>
    <li> I got this case and love the design. However- I dropped it the next day and it chipped on the back. I didn&#x27;t drop it far. About a foot and a half. I would recommend this case due to its cuteness however!</li>
    <li> This KATE SPADE&#x27;s iphone case is as BEAUTIFUL as KATE SPADE! I love it! I gave it 4 Stars because I always have to take my phone out of the case whenever I want to charge my phone on iHome. The Case protects my phone, but the case comes apart everytime my phone drops.Other than that, gorgeous</li>
    <li> I loved this case from the time I received it! It came earlier than expected and was exactly what explained in the description. Also, I have dropped it a few times and it has protected my phone and the case is still intact. I would recommend it to anyone:)</li>
    <li> This case is super stylish and I just received it today! Happy that it arrived before the estimated time. The case is a bit hard to remove but I&#x27;m still completely satisfied with the case itself. The seller is super helpful, answered all the questions I had. Definitely will order from them again.</li>
    <li> I had another kate spade eiffel tower case but unfortunately dropped and broke the case (and phone). I love her products and instantly fell in love with this cover.</li>
    <li> picture is true to advertising, not scratching off as i have read other styles do. really like it. worth the wait and money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this case! It&#x27;s colorful decor &amp; beauty has received many compliments from friends. It has protected my phone better than my last case, which cost quite a bit more. I will definitely purchase another Kate Spade case!</li>
    <li> This case is amazing! I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and it is still in perfect condition plus I get lots of compliments on it :) I love how it comes in three pieces, it gives protection to your phone all around! I am definitely going to be buying more of these cases.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this cover! It&#x27;s super cute and feminine! The picture on the back is very nice, pink sides make it very &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;. The cover seems to be quite protective as it covers the edges of the front. Doesn&#x27;t make a phone look bulky! which is a good thing!</li>
    <li> I just received my new iPhone 4 case in the mail. I love the colors on the case and the sturdy way it feels in my hand!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my cover, I get it in a very good conditions and I will recommend this to others</li>
    <li> Not entirely sure that its authentically a Kate spade but the case is super cute and extremely durable (I&#x27;ve dropped it a ton on New York concrete sidewalk and not a scratch)  best case I&#x27;ve owned... Kinda hard to take off, but it my just be me being a dummy lol</li>
    <li> Very pretty my daughter is jealous as she doesn&#x27;t have a phone it will fit,  Arrived quickly, packaged well, better than pics!</li>
    <li> While the cover is nice looking I could never get it to fit on my IPhone.  I&#x27;ll try to see if I can get some help but it shouldn&#x27;t be this difficult.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as an additional gift for my wife. She had the Iphone 4 and was looking for a trendy cover for it. Quality is great and design is trend and fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> This phone case is not only stylish but it also protects the phone with a lip around the edge too</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  This was a gift to my daughter and was a big hit at Christmas this year, very pleased</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t received this yet, I hope it does come so I can give you an accurate review. Although, I&#x27;ve had a few different Kate Spade cases and they&#x27;re pretty decent. If you drop it, it will crack. Then again, it is plastic and I suppose that would be normal :) So it&#x27;s a god value on this site, I would never pay $35-$40 in the store for this. $5 is a good deal and well worth it. I really think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I paid about $5 for this case and I really love it. Very nice and stylish however the back keeps popping off and I&#x27;m very paranoid about it. I feel like I need to tape it so the back would stop popping off.</li>
    <li> I love the design on the back and the sheer stylishness of it.  Very satisfied with the case, and the price was incredible!</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife&#x27;s iPhone, she has seemed to like it and has held up well so far.Thanks you</li>
    <li> My teen daughter like the look of this case.  It is slippery, so not good for a dashboard as it will slide around. It fit fine, doesn&#x27;t fall off or anything and has lasted 6 weeks so far with no trouble.</li>
    <li> Much better than expected!  Exactly the design and quality I was looking for.  It arrived quickly and has been terrific to own.</li>
    <li> I love this adorable phone cover!  it is durable and I get tons of compliments on it!  I&#x27;ve dropped it about a dozen times and I can&#x27;t even see a scratch.</li>
    <li> love,love,love this iphone cover.  get lots of comments on it and everyone wants to know where I purchsed it.  If you are into fun things at a low cost you will love this case cover[[ASIN:B0097KLKG2 Kate Spade iPhone 4/4S Resin Hard Case - Paris Style]]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great case no issues. It protects my phone and I love it. I get compliments all the time. Aldo you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!  I would recommend this for anyone.  Good quality too!</li>
    <li> Love this Kate Spade Case. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of days but it seems to be well made and fits/covers my iPhone well. I am so pleased with the colors and have to admit I feel a little awesome carrying it around :) The shipping was also super fast. I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I love my case for my iPhone 4S. I like the texture and is very resistant. I recommend this seller and this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very Cute shell. I get lots of compliments.  It came quickly and was exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this case! The colors are fantastic and the style of the case is fabulous (it does come in three pieces.) It feels very sturdy and strong. I am so pleased with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> love this case very cute and stylish.  fits very well on iphone 4s.  i have dropped the phone a few times and the case has protected it no scratches</li>
    <li> Bought the case for my wife.  Looks are nicer than mist cases, but she already dented the corner after a few weeks.  Case feels a bit loose now.</li>
    <li> Great cell cover...easy to attach and sleek so it fits into all my handbags!! Keep up the cute work Kate!</li>
    <li> I love the picture on the back of the case. However, I had hard time open up the case, even after I watch the video on youtube.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this case. Shipped fast and arrived prioir to estimated delivery date. It doesn&#x27;t provide much &amp;#34;protection&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s not why my daughter wanted it. Looks great.</li>
    <li> I love the artwork on this phone.  It is so beautiful and so much fun.  It makes you want to visit Paris!</li>
    <li> I love the colors, materials, and pattern itself. The pattern is like a vacation in my palm. Thanks Kate Spade.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this case. It&#x27;s very beautiful. It looks great with my white iPhone. It was difficult to pull apart in the beginning to place it on my phone. It is also a bit heavy. But over all a great case.</li>
    <li> When I receive this case I feel in love with it right away. After using it for 1 day I accidentally dropped my phone from my desk and the case was gone. It broke on 3 edges and it is not good to use anymore. Unsatisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product it came within a reasonable time and the only thing I would say is that it is a little hard to take off once you hav it on.</li>
    <li> This case is soo cute and soo worth your money! It just takes a while to get to it&#x27;s destination and to assemble it,took a few minuets but other than that very nice... ps it&#x27;s a great fashion statement to have!!!</li>
    <li> I love the picture on the back of the case, and I can easily find my phone now by looking for the pink around the sides.  (It is often under a pile of papers in my classroom, as I use it to take picture of my students for parent viewing.)I have gotten lots of compliments on the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dropped the phone 3 times since I put the new case on, and the phone is not damaged.  Once it even landed on the corner of the phone, as evidenced by a dent in the case&#x27;s corner.  Not sure how long the protective plastic will last if I keep dropping my phone.  The case usually comes apart when dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimensions of case (when phone is laying on back):  2+5/16\\&quot; wide, 9/16\\&quot; tall, 4+3/4\\&quot; deep&lt;br /&gt;It does make the phone significantly thicker, as I have a vera bradley wrist wallet and phone case.  It is tricky to get the phone in and out of this now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this case for about a month, and I loved it at first! The image was great, and it was easy to take on and off. However, a few days ago, I realized there were two big cracks in the plastic on the side. I have not dropped my phone or anything, so I have no idea how the cracks got there. In the end, I&#x27;m sorry that I paid $20 for an item that broke so quickly and already has to be replaced.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I dropped my phone twice in a week and the cover protected it.... Chipped my case but saved the phone!</li>
    <li> I love the look and style. Very stylish and fun but it does not stay together very well. I had to tape it together for the back piece to not randomly fall off.</li>
    <li> Love this case, it is sooooooo cute. Makes the phone a bit bulky, but I like it. Fits great. Does come apart a little when you drop it, but mine hasnt broke yet. Took about a month to arrive though, from china i guess.</li>
    <li> The case is colorful and protects my phone.  I have received many compliments on it! If you love Paris - it is the case for you!</li>
    <li> Great girly case, to carry your phone in and the colors &amp; style as well.  You will not be disappointed, well protected.</li>
    <li> the case is high quantity and fit the phone well, as descriped and very good services. love it very much</li>
    <li> Look wise this case is very cute, anyone who is &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; would love this as a gift or for themselves. What I don&#x27;t like about the case is that the image peals very easily, i got this in late december and all the edges have chipped or peeled off already. Another thing about the phone is once you get the case on its very difficult to remove it, if you like to use an idock regularly this case will get annoying fast.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Great fit and what&#x27;s even better, is that the flash works perfectly. Last case I got (cheap China-made case), the holes didn&#x27;t quite line up and every time I took a flash picture, I got a pink screen. This case is so much better. I should have gotten it long ago. And it looks fantastic.</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars but there were too many pieces. Colors were vibrant and cute. Openings fit very well!</li>
    <li> I love the design and construction/sturdiness of this product.  It arrived quickly, too.  It is a very recognizable phone cover.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, and ships from Asia. Beware, this is not original Kate spade though. I am not regretting because I knew at this price, and shipping from overseas, it&#x27;s not going to be original.</li>
    <li> Dropped on floor falls apart in three pieces,would never order anything but a spec now ,and protects my phone and covers front</li>
    <li> 5 stars! I was really excited about getting this case, but I was kind of upset that the estimated delivery date was long. However, it came two weeks earlier than expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case was in good condition and it looks beautiful! I can&#x27;t wait to show it off to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is a very beautiful case. However, within a day of mild use of my phone i discovered to cracks along the edges (not even having dropped my phone). There is no support for falls, when I eventually dropped my phone the whole case fell apart, leaving my phone unprotected on the floor. For the amount you pay for this, it is not even worth it. In the end, it is just another pretty case that doesn&#x27;t last and isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Ordered this case for my phone and just loved it. Chic and nice for my iphone 4s :) Would order again.</li>
    <li> Just received my new iphone 4s case, love it... really nice .&lt;br /&gt;I really recommended. Fits  perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It was worthed the wait.</li>
    <li> case was new just as advertised. It was a little hard to put on and take off but was otherwise cute and effective</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super cute and protects the phone well. The case has chipped a little from dropping once, but that&#x27;s what its there for. I&#x27;d rather the case chip than the phone.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST phone case I have ever bought!  While it was super cute when it came in, it does nothing to makeup for what a worthless piece of junk it was.  Everytime I dropped my phone, the case would fall apart, and pieces would fly off.  This actually caused my screen to break - while it was in the case!!!!  It does nothing to protect your phone - at all.  DO NOT BUY this case, you will regret it.</li>
    <li> This case is beautiful, which is why I bought it.  However, every time it falls the whole case falls apart, so you have to put it back together.  It fell twice on my wooden floor, from my bed, so the fall wasn&#x27;t that bad, yet the corner broke.  I dropped it 3 more times within the first month of having it.  Each time it fell, it fell more and more apart....so I had to throw it out.  Not even glue kept it together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It breaks too easily.</li>
    <li> I love this case.  Although I am careful not to drop it, it is smooth, fits perfectly and easy to carry and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised to see just how nice this was for the low cost I paid.  I received it within a week, even more impressed.  I will buy more of Kate Spade&#x27;s IPhone covers again!  Love It!</li>
    <li> good purchase. I would recommend it to anyone. my piece fell off couple of times after i started using it and did not hurt my iphone.</li>
    <li> I give this case 5 stars because it fits nicely, very modern, stylistically answers my requirements. I would recommend this item for iPhone.</li>
