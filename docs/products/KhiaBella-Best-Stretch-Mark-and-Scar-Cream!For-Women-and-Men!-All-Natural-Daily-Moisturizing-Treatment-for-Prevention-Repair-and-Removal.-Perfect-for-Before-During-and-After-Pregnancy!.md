<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was 36 weeks pregnant with my second child when I noticed a single angry red stretch mark right above my belly button! I had been using another product (Palmers) up until that point but when I saw the stretch mark, I panicked and decided to spend a little more in the hope of avoiding more stretch marks in the last month of pregnancy.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was this product or not but I made it through the last month without any more stretch marks, and I&#x27;m happy to report that two weeks after having the baby, I can barely see that single stretch mark that I did get! This cream also helped with the itchiness, and I love the way it smells - very light scent unlike some of the other lotions and oils I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and stay all day. It matched all my expectations. I recommend it, good purchase for anyone! Best ever, I&#x27;ve tried all stretch marks products and this is the best one…I love this stuff! It&#x27;s worth the money! Its a must have for me, as it really proves to prevent the appearance of stretch marks! Stretch Mark Cream by KhiaBella works!</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Makes my skin soft and with no harsh smell. I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in stretch marks, but I have only been using it for a short time. I will have to review after a month to see if it works. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. The scent is great and it is so creamy and nice to apply.</li>
    <li> I just started using it but so far I love it!! The scent is clean and natural, not sticky or greasy at all, very moisturizing!  I am hoping it helps my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product! Smells good, so smooth for her growing belly! So far so good!</li>
    <li> I love this! My skin feels great! Not sticky at all! Light smell! Fast shipping! Will buy again definitely!</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. It nourishes the skin, and has a great natural sent. So far it seems to be working well !</li>
    <li> Great product magical results, the best I ve used so far. Finally a cream that really helps. I saw very fast results in short time. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 3 stars with how mad I was receiving it , but as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s helping me n that&#x27;s the purpose. Let me just start off by saying I paid $9 extra for 1 day shipping, as I was very desperate, and upon receiving my package I took it to my room and opened it on my bed and to my surprise there was a black spider in the box !!!!! Fact: I&#x27;m absolutely terrified of spiders !!! I was very upset ! Still makes me mad thinking about it ! Next thing is I saw people talking about this product being light and non greasy ... Yeah Right ! I have a specific T-shirt I wear when I apply the cream just because it sticks to my shirt and feels greasy. Also this cream was like applying sunscreen lotion on my belly ! No matter how long I rubbed it on it stood white and took forever to disappear ! I put some on my sides and then went back over and rubbed the middle again and it started forming lil clusters of dry cream. I gotta say it definitely wasn&#x27;t what I expected , but I have to admit after 2 days of applying it twice a day on my belly, I am definitely seeing results ! I&#x27;m waiting a lil to post some before and after pics :) oh and the smell is nice and light ! Took away the itchiness of my stretch marks ! (Currently 34 weeks pregnant) Old n new stretch marks clearing up !</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this product but I plan to. I have been sharing with my roommate after she saw her stretch marks reduce tremendously. For me, my skin has gotten softer and smoother- I don&#x27;t have stretch marks but I have seen it work for my roommate in that regard.</li>
    <li> I love this stretch mark cream.  It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;ve tried others and I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you KhiaBella.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It has a very light smell (unlike others), it&#x27;s perfect for every day use. I highly recommend this to anyone :))</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for that long and haven&#x27;t been good at doing it twice a day but when I do use it twice a day multiple days in a row I feel like it is working but unable to know whether it works as suggested yet. Will update my review in a few weeks with a more in depth description of the product. So far I&#x27;m in love with it and it seems to dull the sharp color down.</li>
    <li> So I am 32 weeks pregnant and have started getting angry, painful stretch marks. I ordered this cream because of the ingredients, which are primarily natural. It&#x27;s too soon yet for me to say if I have see results (I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days) but I can say that it smells AMAZING and is not greasy. It has also made my skin extremely soft!! And it has helped ease the pain and itching on my quickly expanding belly! So I am optimistic about the stretch marks -- but I will update this review once I have been using it longer about my results!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work for me, but unfortunately it did not. I got stretch marks on my belly and legs during pregnancy and was hoping this cream would help them go away postpartum. I applied it twice daily until all of the cream was gone and it made no difference in my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> The person I bought this for loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I will ordering again! I have been using it for 2 weeks now,and I see an actual difference, and feel the smoothness of my skin. No itching, no sticky felling! I love the smell of this cream!! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product did NOT reduce my stretch mark lines at all. I used twice a day for 30 days exactly like the instructions say. I also used the product right out of the shower thinking it would lock in moisture and maybe help. My stretch marks are exactly the same as they were 30 days ago. No improvement at all. The only positive about the cream, it does leave your skin feeling very soft. I would NOT buy this product again and would not recommend anyone waste their money.</li>
    <li> Too small and only last a week.</li>
    <li> I am on my second jar of KhiaBella cream and the results have been amazing! I recently gained weight and got stretch marks on my stomach. I did tons of research and finally ran into this cream. I am so happy with the results and I&#x27;m already starting to feel more confident! My stretch marks have gone from red and puffy to light and flat! I would recommended this product to anyone trying to reduce the appearance of their stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I have only been using your cream for&lt;br /&gt;about 3 weeks, but I do notice a great difference in coloring of my scars.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the cream and am looking forward to seeing more&lt;br /&gt;results.</li>
    <li> As I started to enter my 3rd trimester I noticed a few pinkish marks on my breast. I couldn&#x27;t tell if they were full blown stretch marks or if I just had really dark reddish veins that sorta looked like bruises. Either way, I wasn&#x27;t going to ignore them and let it get worse. I looked up a few products on Amazon for stretch marks, read the reviews, and decided to order this one. I&#x27;m SO glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first application I noticed that my skin was very soft. To me, it seemed like the sorta soft after you have used a really really thick cream, think Nivea. I threw on a old tshirt and went to bed. The next morning I woke up and, again, to me, the marks were already less noticeable. I was, honestly, very surprised. I have skin that DOES NOT respond to most lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have those annoying red spider veins on my chest that have come up during this pregnancy. I rubbed the cream on them after I showered this morning, applied it again to my breast, and both areas have significantly less marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly feel that this cream will keep me from developing stretch marks further into this pregnancy. I feel that this cream will remove the areas of concern I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will mention again, my marks were not deep dark, scar like, stretch marks; they looked more like bruises or red veins, so my results will probably differ from most. I do feel that this cream has prevented the marks from worsening and has helped them seem less noticeable within 2 applications. I would recommend this product if someone asked.</li>
    <li> The cream smells very good. It works, but works soooo slowly.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Smells great, feels great, very rich and moisturizing without being greasy or sticky. I&#x27;ve been using this stretch mark cream for a couple weeks now and it actually works! To my surprise my stretch marks have already started to fade, I can&#x27;t wait to see the complete results! Definitely recommend it and will order again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am six weeks into using this stretch mark cream. I wouldn&#x27;t tell you that all my stretch marks are gone- that&#x27;d be a lie. But they are fading gradually and I am so excited about this because this is the only cream that seem to be working and it&#x27;s the third product I am trying to help with my stretch marks. I hope to see more results. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My skin looks fresher and feels softer after just one week of use. Wish i had found this product earlier. Works perfectly so far!</li>
    <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t erase stretch marks.. I&#x27;ve come to accept that only exercise can. What this cream does do is make your skin really soft..So yeah that&#x27;s basically it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for wife who just gave birth of our first son a month ago. Because of delivering a child there were a deep mark on her belly. A doctor friend of mine suggested me to use this Stretch Mark Cream to remove the deep mark. Therefore, without making any kind late i ordered it and after receiving i asked my wife to use it twice a day as described in user manual. From very beginning it started to work and just within a couple of weeks there are no more Marks.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it twice a day. The color of my stretch marks changed after a few days and they turned lighter and aren&#x27;t bulging out as much. I couldn&#x27;t want to believe it! It absorb quickly and has a light smell. Well worth it!!</li>
    <li> Finally, something that really works!!! If you have stretch marks, it&#x27;s a must-try product. HIGHLY recommend. AAA+++</li>
    <li> Cream came beautifully wrapped and arrived a couple days after ordering! Smells amazing, goes on silky smooth and I can see the stretch marks fading already!</li>
    <li> Ive been using the cream for over a month and im not seeing much results. I will continue using it and hope over time to see positive results in lightening and minimizing stretxh marks.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have had this my entire pregnancy!  I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks with my first, but late in my second pregnancy some started to appear.  I have been using the cream for a few weeks now and I have not had anymore develop and it is helping the ones that are there currently.  I am due next week and will continue to use the cream until hopeful they all fade and are light in color.</li>
    <li> Makes them fade but no disappear, either way amazing product! You can barely see them. Exercise + this cream &#x3D; no more stretch marks!</li>
    <li> Im 6 months pregnant and so far haven&#x27;t noticed any stretch marks. I&#x27;ve been using Palmers cocoa butter cream every day since about 3 months to help keep moisturized and hopefully prevent any. I really like the Khiabella product so far though as its smell is much more pleasant and it absorbs quicker than the Palmers cream. I would recommend it to others because of this.</li>
    <li> I have been using for bout a month. I wish I have noticed a little more reduction of stretch marks, but over all it&#x27;s helping. I put on everyday after shower</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now and although I do like how soft it makes my skin, the consistency and the smell, I do not see a difference in stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I am a mom of 4 and I have numerous stretch marks - every one of them worth it of course, I have the best kiddos ever! Now that they are out of diapers, I finally have time to spend for myself. So, I thought I give this stretch mark cream a try. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would help as my stretch marks are not brand new. Well, after just one week of using the KhiaBella stretchmark cream, my skin feels super soft and my stretch marks are much less visible. Just one week made a big difference, I can only imagine what the future holds :). I love the nice fragrance of the cream, it makes me feel pampered. It is also good to know that it is all natural and comes from the US. Overall, I am very very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend KhiaBella to all expectant moms and moms who already gave birth. We are worth it!!!</li>
    <li> So after 3 kids and my last one being 23 yrs ago,I thought this will never work. Non of them ever work. Well this did. It has started to fade them. It is very smooth and rich feel nice when putting it on. There is no harsh perfume smells. It absorbs fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait forever to put on cloths like some lotions leave that sticky feeling.Just need to use twice a day. I DID RECEIVE THIS AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was so skeptical about buying a stretch mark removal cream because I didn&#x27;t want something harmful to my body, something that did not smell pleasant, something overpriced, or something that wasn&#x27;t going to give real results. I did a lot of research before I settled on this product and I am extremely pleased with the results. The cream was priced so well to work as well as it does. Within a month of using the product my stretch marks were 3/4&#x27;s of the way gone and even other people asked me what I did because their use to be more marks and they were a lot darker. You only need to use a small dab of the cream so it lasts for a month or more and I just ordered my second batch which is already taking care of the little bit of stretch marks I have left. I have started using the cream to lighten up dark spots I have from shaving as well. Definitely recommend this cream to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite creams! It smells wonderful, not overwhelming, has just a touch of fresh scent, and leaves your skin very soft. I use the sauna a lot which dries my skin, and I use this cream as an overall body lotion after spa - really wonderful.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, the first one I bought was making me nocious. Not too greasy</li>
    <li> Nice scent! Cream absorbs very well and leaves a hydrated velvety feel on the skin.</li>
    <li> My second bottle and I am enjoying the results.</li>
    <li> Great product! It matched all my expectations!I used it as directed, every day until I had my baby and no stretch marks!No odor, not greasy but works perfect on your belly.It&#x27;s worth the money and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was very worried about my wife getting stretch marks during her pregnancy so I ordered this cream and it worked!I am happy to report she got NO stretch marks!!!</li>
    <li> Finally! A stretch-mark cream that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or smell! I love this cream because it is LIGHT and really moist without the greasy feeling most creams have. I have been using this cream twice a day for a week and already feel a difference. My problem areas are already softer and the stretch lines are  diminishing. Can&#x27;t wait to use this even longer. I have tried everything and this is the best I have found so far. Also, a little goes a long way! No need to over apply because it is that moist. Excited to have found this!</li>
    <li> After my surgery I try to find something to repare my scar . I think i just found it. I can see resaults after using only for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cream! It has a very light smell and absorbs quickly. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after applying the cream. My stretch marks are fading already and I can&#x27;t wait to see them disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> My friend suggested me to try this product, I decided to start using this cream and I would see some resoult.</li>

    <li> It was hard choosing what kind of cream to get. After lots of research, I finally settled on getting this cream. This cream is amazing! I am currently 19weeks pregnant and have a few dark stretch marks from my 10 month old. I have been using this cream for about 3 weeks now twice a day (after I get out the shower) and the stretch marks are already going away! My skin looks more vibrant and smells so good! I just ran out of my first jar and am ordering another now! If you are worried about the price, just know that you will truly get your monies worth. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants real results!</li>
    <li> I lost over a 110 pounds in the last year, plus I&#x27;ve had 2 kids in my lifetime.  Needless to say I&#x27;ve got stretch marks from those experiences.  I&#x27;ve started using this rich cream on my thighs, belly and under my sagging arm skin.  I&#x27;m older, almost 52 - but I have noticed my thighs and belly look better.  Plus this cream is super moisturizing and I&#x27;m sure this is a big factor.  I wish I&#x27;d had something like this 25 years ago!  However it does make my more recent weight loss stretch marks look better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve included photos for your review of the product and ingredients. Made in USA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review. I trust that my thoughts in this review will prove helpful in some way - if there are any questions whatsoever, please post them, and I will do my best to answer them based on my personal experience with the particular product</li>
    <li> So I am currently 30 weeks pregnant and found my first angry red colored stretch mark on my tummy. Now this freaked me out so I decided it was time to splurge a little on a product that might help. I have been using stretch mark cream for two weeks now and honestly I can say this is like a miracle cream, my stretch mark is not &amp;#34;gone&amp;#34;  but I can hardly see it!&lt;br /&gt;it has gone from being a bright red very noticeable mark to purple then to white and now it practically blends in with my skin tone! I am so impressed with this cream and will continue to use it after my pregnancy and in my next ones!</li>
    <li> Since I have started using this cream along with olive oil on my stomach every evening after bath, my skin feels soft and looks great. Even after only  a little while of using this cream my stretch marks are already fading. I also don&#x27;t buy any products containing parabens, and this product is paraben-free. My skin is sensitive, and I didn&#x27;t receive any irritation from this cream at all. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just received it and heard nothing but good things looking forward to see how it works il check back in and let ya know how it goes</li>
