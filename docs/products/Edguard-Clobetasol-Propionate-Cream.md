      <li>So far, so good.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>I need more time to determine its true efficiacy for me, but I am pleased so far.</li>
      <li>Edguard Cream is a new product and I will be ordering more; I liked it that much.</li>
      <li>thanks so much!!!!</li>
      <li>This was just what I was looking for,it came very fast and neatly packaged.</li>
      <li>I am pleased to have found Edugard as a low cost substitute for Clobetasol lotion which is probably 10x the price of this inexpensive cream.</li>
      <li>In only 2 days it started getting better and within the week</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>but this stuff is the real deal!</li>
      <li>I used the cream the first night it arrived and the next morning, I felt so much better just with one application.</li>
      <li>I woke up one morning with a red bumpy rash on both arms and no matter what I used from the store it did not get better...</li>
      <li>I was prescribed a similar ointment for a boot rash, by far this works better and does not require a visit (co-pay) to my doctor!</li>
      <li>My problem is on the back of my head and it is easy to apply and clears up my issue.</li>
      <li>I used it on my elbows for my mild psoriasis and the redness and flakes completely disappeared.</li>
      <li>The only thing is if you have super dried skin its good to use the a eucerin ointment too.</li>
      <li>Fast relief of symptoms, and no side effects.</li>
      <li>This is working very well for a problem I&#x27;ve had for some years now.</li>
      <li>more peeling and weeping of my ears, it only took about three applications for it to clear</li>
      <li>I purchased this product to treat poison ivy on my arm and it relieved the itching very quickly and helped to dry it up.</li>
      <li>However, I suppose for a stronger - more active clobetasol - lotion you need a prescription.</li>
      <li>Vigilant foot care is still required (I used shea butter and solar oil), but this gives you a fighting chance of having decent, pain-free heels.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Within the first full week; all the redness was now pink and no pain!</li>
      <li>It helps clear up my eczema,a decent product.</li>
      <li>Had been prescribed clobetasol propionate by doctor which helped my psoriasis like dry skin patches, this stuff wokred just as good if not better.  </li>
      <li>It works exactly the same and has cleared up the rash in a couple weeks!</li>
      <li>This has the same ingredients and much, much cheaper!  </li>
      <li>The first week I applied it twice daily (once in the a.m. and again before bed).</li>
      <li>But anyhoo: this cream works exactly the same!!!!</li>
      <li>This year it came back, so I looked into skipping the whole health care system and buy direct.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to stop using it now, to see if it continues to clear up and go away.</li>
      <li>I normally use the clobetasol propionate ointment which is the only thing that works for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty active and developed a heat/friction rash that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
      <li>She quickly stated that the problem wasn&#x27;t just dried skin - it was an autoimmune condition.  </li>
      <li>If you have Dyshydrosis on your feet or hands, or in other words &amp;#34;Dyshydrotic Eczema&amp;#34; you should really get this cream!</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommended this product to clear your psoriasis.</li>
      <li>While it has only half the strength of the Rx cream, I had only needed the lotion to be used sparingly for my external psoraisis and the Edugard seems to do well for the light useage I require.</li>

<li> She prescribed Clobetasol Propianoate, and after a few days of regular use the first 2 layers of heel skin had peeled away, so that foot creams could finally start to penetrate the rest of the mess.  </li>
<li> Within a few days, my fingers were almost completely healed!</li>
<li> so I would not use this long term.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I had some stuff with similar active ingredients from the Dr.</li>
<li> I would sit and cry the places burned so bad and in desperation I went to the web and simply asked burning, itchy, rash with puss filled blisters.</li>
<li> and I read all the reviews carefully.</li>
<li> It has been a week and a half -no more itching,and has cleared up considerably,not nearly as noticeable.</li>
<li> A little went a long way.</li>
<li> And so are my underarms and other places!</li>
<li> only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that it&#x27;s slightly weak.</li>
<li> I was desperate and in so much pain from the eczema on both my hands and fingers for over two years.</li>
<li> (After suffering with the rash for two months, the Clobex made it go away in a few weeks.)  </li>
<li> I have pretty bad seasonal eczema and dried cracked skin.</li>
<li> I have pretty bad eczema</li>
<li> One small bottle cost me&lt;br /&gt;$200.00 and did not work.</li>
<li> So I bought this stuff, smeared it on, and no more itch.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had extremely dry, cracked heels, and thought is was just a case of bad dry skin, which I&#x27;ve got all over.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Shipping was painfully slow.</li>
<li> I dont know what I have, but it itches like crazy when the air gets dry.  </li>
<li> My hands hurt so bad I latterly wanted to cut them off.</li>
<li> I had such  painful cracking and bleeding from psoriasis all over my body and this cleared it up within weeks.</li>
<li> I am continuing to use Edguard twice weekly (although sometimes I forget and use it less frequently) just as a preventative to having this horrible rash return.</li>
<li> For very little money, I have replaced an expensive prescription.  </li>
<li> sometimes it was much worse than others.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I have to do annual check ups just to renew prescription for the ointment.</li>
<li> We were skeptical about trying this product, figured it was a knock off</li>
<li> I mean everything!!!</li>
<li> Very expensive just to see a doctor that tells you need a cream you already know you need...  </li>
<li> It was so bad at one point that it was cracked and bleeding.</li>
<li> I dont&#x27; have any bad side-effects.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Totally amazing results! I had such  painful cracking and bleeding from psoriasis all over my body and this cleared it up within weeks. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was prescribed a similar ointment for a boot rash, by far this works better and does not require a visit (co-pay) to my doctor!</li>
    <li> This wonderful Edguard Clobetasol Propionate cream helps me keep my skin rash free.  I had been using a much more expensive product, but after reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to give this a try. Add me to the crowd of believers!</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve tried alot of different products for my lichen sclerosus and nothing, even prescriptions, has worked as well. Fast relief of symptoms, and no side effects.</li>
    <li> I used to use a product that was physician prescribed that contained this same chemical.  That product was the only thing that helped my dermatitis.  After it was withdrawn from the market, my condition deteriorated until I discovered the Edguard product with the same ingredients.  For very little money, I have replaced an expensive prescription.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this brand - but I&#x27;ve been using Clobetasol Propianoate 0.05% prescribed by my doctor (and covered by my co-pay).  I&#x27;ve always had extremely dry, cracked heels, and thought is was just a case of bad dry skin, which I&#x27;ve got all over.  While visiting the dermatologist for a cancer screening I asked her to take a look at my feet.  She quickly stated that the problem wasn&#x27;t just dried skin - it was an autoimmune condition.  She prescribed Clobetasol Propianoate, and after a few days of regular use the first 2 layers of heel skin had peeled away, so that foot creams could finally start to penetrate the rest of the mess.  This is a prednisone based medication, so all the precautions related to steroid use apply, especially since this absorbs through the skin.  Vigilant foot care is still required (I used shea butter and solar oil), but this gives you a fighting chance of having decent, pain-free heels.</li>
    <li> I was desperate and in so much pain from the eczema on both my hands and fingers for over two years. I always said I would have it checked out by a doctor but I would get embarrassed and not say a word thinking I had something no one else did. My hands hurt so bad I latterly wanted to cut them off. They would crack up and whatever it was would spread like Ivy. I would sit and cry the places burned so bad and in desperation I went to the web and simply asked burning, itchy, rash with puss filled blisters. This wonderful product came up and I read all the reviews carefully. I decided I had nothing to lose and needed help as soon as possible so I ordered two of the last three tubes the supplier had in stock. I used the cream the first night it arrived and the next morning, I felt so much better just with one application. Within the first full week; all the redness was now pink and no pain! I could even bend my fingers for the first time in months!!! After the second week; everything was gone!!! I mean everything!!! Now I just use it once I have been in water or cleaners and the infection never came back. It has been two wonderful pain free months now!!!</li>
    <li> I used the product for 2 weeks twice a day and the problem is almost totatlly cleared up.  I&#x27;m going to stop using it now, to see if it continues to clear up and go away.</li>
    <li> If you used clobex like I did, this has the same affect. But way cheaper. Still using it. You have to use it for about a week to see results.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for,it came very fast and neatly packaged.I recommend this it anyone looking for clobetasol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many psoriasis creams.  Edguard Cream is a new product and I will be ordering more; I liked it that much.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing ....with just 3 days using it i already can see the difference but i constantly put on the skin through out the day, i got better results than the prescription med i was using.</li>
    <li> I kept getting razor burn and my prescription Clobetasol had run out. I ordered this cream, the seller got it in the mail to me the next day and I was happy! The razor burn cleared up just like when I use the prescription stuff but without the script cost! I baby sat for a friends son and she told me about his diaper rash and the cream she wanted me to use. So I used this cream on his rash and it started clearing up that evening! Now I use this on my son to prevent diaper rash and it&#x27;s not like that white diaper balm. We had a 6 hour drive and he had no heat bumps. His bottom is still smooth! And so are my underarms and other places!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have pretty bad seasonal eczema and dried cracked skin. No matter what I put on it (over the counter creams/ointments) it will not heal. I normally use the clobetasol propionate ointment which is the only thing that works for me. Unfortunately I have to do annual check ups just to renew prescription for the ointment. Very expensive just to see a doctor that tells you need a cream you already know you need...  But anyhoo: this cream works exactly the same!!!! So happy! The only thing is if you have super dried skin its good to use the a eucerin ointment too. Since this is the cream version it isn&#x27;t that great at moisturizing your skin. Overall totally happy with this purchase. I just ordered two more to stock up!</li>
    <li> I dont know what I have, but it itches like crazy when the air gets dry.  This stuff fixes it with one application.  I had some stuff with similar active ingredients from the Dr. but I didn&#x27;t want to go back and deal with Dr stuff again.  So I bought this stuff, smeared it on, and no more itch.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I dont&#x27; have any bad side-effects.  Win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was painfully slow.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream to use for psoriasis. My husband used it for 2-3 days and the marks went away in no time. I am planning on buying it for my mom as wel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty active and developed a heat/friction rash that just wouldn&#x27;t go away. I tried everything - powders, sprays, ointments... nothing worked - until I used Edguard. It took just one week and the rash was gone - amazing! This is one product to always have on hand for all kinds of skin conditions - I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Had been prescribed clobetasol propionate by doctor which helped my psoriasis like dry skin patches, this stuff wokred just as good if not better.  Very pleased will definately buy more when i run out.</li>
    <li> I have used Clobetasol for many years and this is a good product. If your skin is irritated and you have a rash and dryness caused by eczema, definitely try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that it&#x27;s slightly weak. However, I suppose for a stronger - more active clobetasol - lotion you need a prescription.</li>
    <li> Have ordered another tube. This is working very well for a problem I&#x27;ve had for some years now. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from some sort of dermatitis on my fingers under my wedding band as well as on the inside of my pinkie finger. The rash would come and go for over a year though sometimes it was much worse than others. It was so bad at one point that it was cracked and bleeding. I tried neosporin, anti fungal creams, hydrocortisone cream, tea tree oil, etc., and while offering immediate relief, the problem would always reappear within a day or two. As a last resort to seeing a physican I decided to try this product and I can say I am glad I did. The first week I applied it twice daily (once in the a.m. and again before bed). Within a few days, my fingers were almost completely healed! I am continuing to use Edguard twice weekly (although sometimes I forget and use it less frequently) just as a preventative to having this horrible rash return. So far, so good. This product seems to have solved my problem.</li>
    <li> It helps clear up my eczema,a decent product.If you have eczema with all of the itching,redness,cracking I would recommend using this.Do not waste your money on all the other creams or ointments unless they have.05% clobestol  propionate trust me.It has been a week and a half -no more itching,and has cleared up considerably,not nearly as noticeable.</li>
    <li> I am pleased to have found Edugard as a low cost substitute for Clobetasol lotion which is probably 10x the price of this inexpensive cream. While it has only half the strength of the Rx cream, I had only needed the lotion to be used sparingly for my external psoraisis and the Edugard seems to do well for the light useage I require. I need more time to determine its true efficiacy for me, but I am pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that this product was able to be purchased without a prescription at a fraction of the cost of other prescribed product.  I recommend for people with skin issues to try it. My problem is on the back of my head and it is easy to apply and clears up my issue.</li>
    <li> We were skeptical about trying this product, figured it was a knock off but this stuff is the real deal! Clears my boyfriends skin in two days and prescription is not needed! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Ive had eczema my entire life and the one thing that has worked was doctor prescribed clobetasol propionate. I love this stuff....showed up on time and will def. be making this a subscription purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to treat poison ivy on my arm and it relieved the itching very quickly and helped to dry it up. A little went a long way.There was no burning or discomfort. I am ordering another tube in case I need it again in the future.</li>
    <li> This cream was amazing! I used it on my elbows for my mild psoriasis and the redness and flakes completely disappeared. I am the clearest i have ever been in years. I would definitely recommended this product to clear your psoriasis. The price on amazon was incredibly inexpensive which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> i purchased this for my husband, and he is very satisfied with it. he uses it for itching and skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I have tried eight different products for my rash on my ears. This is the only item that worked.&lt;br /&gt;No more peeling and weeping of my ears, it only took about three applications for it to clear up.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to only use up to two weeks so I would not use this long term.&lt;br /&gt;I have been to two different doctors that prescribed ear drops. One small bottle cost me&lt;br /&gt;$200.00 and did not work. The price is a lot cheaper on this product and it worked for me.</li>
    <li> If you have Dyshydrosis on your feet or hands, or in other words &amp;#34;Dyshydrotic Eczema&amp;#34; you should really get this cream! works better than all prescribed ointments/creams I have gotten. I have been suffering with this for about 4 or 5 years and nothing have worked as well as this cream, I saw improvements within in days! I might stock up on this cream.</li>
    <li> This was a phenomenal product that really worked and was just as effective as what I get from my dermatologist. Wonderful product...wonderful price!!!! The company that sent the product to me also did an outstanding job with delivery. YOU GUYS ROCK!!!</li>
    <li> is the reason I purchased this. I woke up one morning with a red bumpy rash on both arms and no matter what I used from the store it did not get better...in fact it started spreading!! So that is when I got online and researched creams and came across this one. Let me tell you that it WORKS!! In only 2 days it started getting better and within the week it is GONE!!!</li>
    <li> This cream does the same job of clearing up skin as the much more expensive prescription cream.  No need to go back to the doctor, since I have such crappy health insurance that doesn&#x27;t pay for medicines anyway!</li>
    <li> I have pretty bad eczema so I&#x27;ve been looking for a cream that wasn&#x27;t oily. Well I read the reviews on this cream and had to order it. Well I started applying it once I received it. My eczema spots were gone in 3 days. I will be ordering more...thanks so much!!!!</li>
    <li> Six years ago I was diagnosed with lichen planus by going through a dermatologist and getting a biopsy.  She prescribed Clobex, which worked wonders!  (After suffering with the rash for two months, the Clobex made it go away in a few weeks.)  This year it came back, so I looked into skipping the whole health care system and buy direct.  Clobex is listed for sale at $140 from Canadian pharmacies!  This has the same ingredients and much, much cheaper!  It works exactly the same and has cleared up the rash in a couple weeks!</li>
