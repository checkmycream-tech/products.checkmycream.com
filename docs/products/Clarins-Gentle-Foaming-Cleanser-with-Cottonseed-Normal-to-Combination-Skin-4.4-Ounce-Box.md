      <li>But the original cottonseed is a great cleanser and doesnt make your skin feel dry</li>
      <li>My skin feels so clean after using it.</li>
      <li>This facial cleanser with cottonseed is great, very gentle &amp; lightly fragranced.</li>
      <li>the smell is a bit strong, but it smells clean and fresh, like fresh laundry, and has done wonders for my skin.</li>
      <li>Skin feels nice and soft after.</li>
      <li>The combo of the two leaves my skin extra soft, super clean and beautiful.</li>
      <li>The first time to use this cleanser is just a free sample from Clarins.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty foamy face wash, yet it feels so smooth, like you&#x27;re rubbing liquid satin on your face.</li>
      <li>first off, I LOVE really foamy face washes.</li>
      <li>It is gentle on my skin and does not have any strong odors.</li>
      <li>Gentle cream, with a light earthy floral aroma.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the foaming action.</li>
      <li>this stuff is gentle but your face feels CLEAN.</li>
      <li>it make my skin clean but not so much foams, so it&#x27;s not so match my clarisonic.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but once I&#x27;m done washing my face, my skin is calm, smooth, and has a matte appearance, which is wonderful since I have crazy oily skin.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is very gentle, foams up nicely, cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or dry.</li>
      <li>I love this facial wash.</li>
      <li>I have purchased 5-6 bottles of this but just recently switched to kiehls because my friend is not a clarins sales rep anymore :)</li>
      <li>I have combination type of skin and this cleanser is exactly what I need.</li>
      <li>Exactly as I used before.</li>
      <li>leaves it soft and moist but clean.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>for clean and soft skin then choose it.</li>
      <li>If you do not wear lots of make up every day and are looking for a non-abrasive cleanser to effectively get the oil and dead cells off your skin before bed this is definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>It has a really nice creamy lather and after rinsing your skin feels so fresh like all the oils and dead skin are gone</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it claims, it GENTLY CLEANSEs your face.  </li>
      <li>AFTER WASHING YOUR FACE, THE SKIN FEELS SOFT, GENTLE AND CLEAN.</li>
      <li>, you are fine, it&#x27;s enough for your face!</li>
      <li>(seriously a pea size amount will lather your whole face and then some) and it feels amazing!</li>
      <li>This product was recommended by a friend and it really works.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, and not greasy, and guaranteed to get off all that day&#x27;s gunk in one wash.  </li>
      <li>Gentle but still eliminates oil and and make-up.</li>
      <li>Its non-greasy and washes off very well.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to put so much, just with the size of a pea</li>
      <li>However, this product dries out my skin too much.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for offering this product here in Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>But on with the product itself (I&#x27;ll note that I am on the dry spectrum of normal healthy skin): it smells great, a little goes a long ways</li>
      <li>Very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I love clarins products especially cotton seed ,the only reasib this did not get five stars is because they sent me another version , a shea cleanser.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>High quality from a company that focuses on nature in all their products.</li>
      <li>I have tried other cleansers that are way too strong.</li>
      <li>TONING LOTION NORMAL</li>
      <li>I use it everyday and it is my favorite.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well .Will not use anything else .</li>
    <li> person I bought it for uses it all the time. she loves it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive and worth every penny. The ONLY cleanser that keeps my skin under control. Whenever I take a break to use something cheaper and easier to get, my skin freaks out. Clarins foaming cleanser is the one for me.</li>
    <li> My wife liked this product a lot. When this ran out of, I will buy this product here again. Thank you so much for offering this product here in Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Love Clarins products!  This cleanser lasts a long time, you do not have to use much at all.  The scent grows on you. Very creamy, does not dry out the skin or leave flakiness. High quality from a company that focuses on nature in all their products. If you want to tone after, use [[ASIN:B000BL1MPA Clarins by Clarins: TONING LOTION NORMAL TO DRY SKIN--/6.7OZ]]</li>
    <li> The smell is overpowering and undoubtedly masculine. The face wash is fine, but a little too harsh, like an astringent. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I have combination type of skin and this cleanser is exactly what I need. I use it everyday and it is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This product is gentle on your skin and leaves it feeling clean but not dried out as other products can.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FOAMING CLEANSER. I HAVE A COMBINATION SKIN AND HAVE USED IT THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS. AFTER WASHING YOUR FACE, THE SKIN FEELS SOFT, GENTLE AND CLEAN. IT DOES NOT FEEL TIGHTEN. 100% RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> A cool, calming cleanser that feels wonderful on your skin. Leaves skin feeling soft and radiant. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> As described. Honestly, the best product out there hands down. I have combination skin. DOES NOT LEAVE YOUR SKIN DRY OR FEELING STRETCHED . Thank you♥</li>
    <li> Foams nicely and you only need a little pea size amount. Skin feels nice and soft after.</li>
    <li> I use the Clarins skincare line &amp; am very happy with the products.  This facial cleanser with cottonseed is great, very gentle &amp; lightly fragranced. I recommend to anyone serious about their skincare</li>
    <li> This is the nicest cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. It cleans off every bit of makeup and dirt from the day, while leaving my skin soft but not dry.  The scent is pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I bought it from Macy&#x27;s few days back when they were giving out gifts for purchase of two items. This is one of the best cleansers i hv used so far!!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> A very welcome gift for someone else</li>
    <li> Clarins products are the best.  I have been using this product for many years and it keeps my face clean.</li>
    <li> Use effect in general</li>
    <li> Nice feel, nice smell, good scrub. Not great for a full deep cleaning though. Good for in betweens.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend</li>
    <li> Love this product, cleans face without a soapy after feel.  Gentle for everyday use.</li>
    <li> GREAT product.  I&#x27;ve used it for decades.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. I had adult onset acne and nothing got rid of it until I started using this face wash with the daytime moisturizing and firming cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for... god know how many years... it is the best one I ever used. Meanwhile I did try to switch to other brands since someone said it is better for the skin to have different brands, but none of others can compare with this one. It is very gentle, mild, with pleasant and lite smell, cleans very well with a refreshing feelings for me EVERY TIME.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers in my day, some more expensive than Clarins, some less. I will never go back to any of them again. This cleanser is very gentle, foams up nicely, cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or dry. It also visibly evens my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I love CLARINS! THIS PRODUCT is amazing.  I love it! I plan to order more! You don&#x27;t need to put so much, just with the size of a pea, you are fine, it&#x27;s enough for your face! This product makes your face so soft and makes it glow! Clarins, to me, IS THE BEST!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m including bang for buck in my rating and I subtracted 1 star because as wonderful as it is it is kind of pricey and I have a cheaper alternative I&#x27;m just as happy with. But on with the product itself (I&#x27;ll note that I am on the dry spectrum of normal healthy skin): it smells great, a little goes a long ways (seriously a pea size amount will lather your whole face and then some) and it feels amazing! It has a really nice creamy lather and after rinsing your skin feels so fresh like all the oils and dead skin are gone and it looks healthy. Now this is not very effective with eyeliner or any sort of heavy eye shadow/blush job this just smudges everything around even after you&#x27;ve used make up remover to wipe a lot of it off (another reason I deducted another star). If you do not wear lots of make up every day and are looking for a non-abrasive cleanser to effectively get the oil and dead cells off your skin before bed this is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> Gentle but still eliminates oil and and make-up.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous other facial products, this one really works. For a cleanser it works great. It leaves my skin very soft. I have tried other cleansers that are way too strong. This one is great. I would recomend it to young children.</li>
    <li> Really great gentle fashwash for older skin....leaves it soft and moist but clean.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser that has ever existed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! I have been using it for years and will continue to do so. Its non-greasy and washes off very well.</li>
    <li> The first time to use this cleanser is just a free sample from Clarins. It&#x27;s great for my face. Exactly as I used before. Nice!</li>
    <li> I looooove it !&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with Clarins</li>
    <li> first off, I LOVE really foamy face washes. This is a pretty foamy face wash, yet it feels so smooth, like you&#x27;re rubbing liquid satin on your face. the smell is a bit strong, but it smells clean and fresh, like fresh laundry, and has done wonders for my skin. no joke. I don&#x27;t really get pimples that often, but when it&#x27;s that time of the month, I usually break out a bit. this face wash actually kept my skin in check - a dramatic result from what I usually have to deal with each month! I also have rosacea (UGH) but once I&#x27;m done washing my face, my skin is calm, smooth, and has a matte appearance, which is wonderful since I have crazy oily skin. not that it has cured my rosacea or anything, but it does help. I also use my clarisonic when I wash my face, and when used with this cleanser, the foam and sudsy good smell is off the chain!! yes it is expensive, but I think I will stick with Clarins for a long time. I am SOLD.</li>
    <li> Claris makes fantastic products. This is one of my favorites. I use it every night with my G-Maher rotating facial brush. The combo of the two leaves my skin extra soft, super clean and beautiful. And yes, the smell is addictive. The texture is creamy and fabulous. The tube goes a long way so I think the price is cheap for the quantity you are getting. I am hooked on Clarins products and you will too once you try this cleanser!  Lastly, my pores have completely shrank. They are no longer noticeable. Another fantastic product from Clarins!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent, simply excellent. I&#x27;m always in the search of good skin products and I have spent a lot of money in expensive lines that all they did was to make my face to break out. This one feels amazing on my face like is so smooth and it does work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love clarins products especially cotton seed ,the only reasib this did not get five stars is because they sent me another version , a shea cleanser. I was too lazy to return it.  But the original cottonseed is a great cleanser and doesnt make your skin feel dry</li>
    <li> Awesome delivery time and product.  I would recommend this product to girl friends and to family members. This product was recommended by a friend and it really works.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend likes it and I save money via Amazon. Everyone is happy.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it definitely cleans your skin and removes makeup. However, this product dries out my skin too much.</li>
    <li> I have used Clarins products for 15 years. During those years I have shopped for my luxurious products by mail from Saks Fifth Avenue and from the Madison Avenue Store Front.&lt;br /&gt;The only difference I find between what I received from Amazon and the other high end store fronts is the convenience and the savings.&lt;br /&gt;As always, I feel amazon is looking out for me the consumer.</li>
    <li> I love this facial wash. It is gentle on my skin and does not have any strong odors. I don&#x27;t have any issues with it, but it may affect other people&#x27;s skin differently.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Greatest face wash ever with perfect delivery :) couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years! Love it</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it claims, it GENTLY CLEANSEs your face.  I have rosacea and I&#x27;ve had little or no outbreaks since I&#x27;ve started using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. My skin feels so clean after using it. Just don&#x27;t use near eyes such as washing off eye makeup. It is painful if it gets in the eye.</li>
    <li> All time favorite cleanser and FAST delivery!</li>
    <li> Very good  cleanser.  Makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the foaming action. Very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very happy with delivery and content!!!</li>
    <li> it make my skin clean but not so much foams, so it&#x27;s not so match my clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;just for clean and soft skin then choose it.</li>
    <li> Leaves face feeling soft and lightweight... this stuff is gentle but your face feels CLEAN. I have purchased 5-6 bottles of this but just recently switched to kiehls because my friend is not a clarins sales rep anymore :)</li>
    <li> can get a bit drying on a normal/combo skin</li>
    <li> Have tried many lines and none leave my face as clean and radiant as this one.  It&#x27;s gentle, and not greasy, and guaranteed to get off all that day&#x27;s gunk in one wash.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Gentle cream, with a light earthy floral aroma. I use it every night. I highly recommend this. It&#x27;s like aromatherapy before bed.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. A little goes a long way! The scent is light and clean. Will keep buying</li>
