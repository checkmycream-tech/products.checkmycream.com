<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This will be perfect for my husband and I using clippers for hair cuts. Well constructed! Strong snap clips! Much more comfortable than the one that fell apart in our kit! We are very pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> Just like the ones in the salons. Nice, lightweight fabric. Perfect for hair cutting.</li>
    <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose.  Haircuts are much less messy now.</li>
    <li> Love the material nice and strong cloth worth the money</li>
    <li> For adults this works well but is not adjustable enough for my little critters (5, 4 and 2 year old children).  I used it on the boys (4 and 2), and it stayed on them but the hair fell down to their backs. We give them a shower anyway and I&#x27;ll wrap a towel around their neck next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just think a few more snaps for a small increase in price would bump my review up to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;* Nice quality&lt;br /&gt;* Breathable material if you have your haircuts inside or on the porch&lt;br /&gt;* Adjusts to adult&#x27;s necks well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;* Does not adjust small enough for children</li>
    <li> Love this cape - very generous amount of material and washes beautifully.</li>
    <li> Its great!!! Good .. I cut my husbands hair and instead of using towels you can use this over and over again without getting your towel get hairs... More laundry too!!! With this you help yourself with that.... Very good thank u!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a black fabric cape now we can rule the world :)&lt;br /&gt;Saves your towels from hair dye!</li>
    <li> Nice quality.  I was hoping it&#x27;d have a bit more button so I can use it on my 8-year-old.  Unfortunately the buttons were designed for adults&#x27;/bigger kids&#x27; neck circumstances, not for young kids.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for an adult hair salon cape, this is a perfect solution.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality item, and works well. However, it is very short in the back, I would have preferred if it was the same long length all the way around, and the cape being short in the back is not shown or mentioned in the item listing.</li>
    <li> Nice salon cape! Definitely like this better than the vinyl style capes and I would guess this is going to be a lot better and more comfortable for hair cutting.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say much other than a great product does what it&#x27;s supposed to plain and simple</li>
    <li> Great cape for cutting our boys hair at home. We needed something with a fine enough weave to keep the hair off. Nice price, nice product.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product. I like the fabric type material that allows air flow opposed to the types made of plastic that act as a sauna. Snaps allow adjustments for any sizes.</li>
    <li> Used it once already when cutting my husband&#x27;s hair.  Worked great to keep hair off his clothes.</li>
    <li> it work just fine on my customer!! fits correctly and I like it. It was what I wanted to buy.</li>
    <li> Looks fine. But the collar is deteriorating after only two uses. I&#x27;m guess the plastic is too cheap and cannot stand hair color processing.</li>
    <li> Flimsy material but it works.</li>
    <li> Too much static to be useful.  Returned.</li>
    <li> This cape is great. It is soft to the touch. And it adjusts small enough to fit my 4yr old.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used any similar product so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others. The snap closures work OK, but not flawlessly; sometimes they need more pressure because they&#x27;re cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, here are a couple suggestions. One, make the back much longer, so it looks like a poncho, because hair clippings can get on pants, chair, etc, the way it is now. Most of us don&#x27;t have barber&#x27;s chairs you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, make the material so it does not attract hair through static or whatever else. I found that even after vigorous shaking, there was a lot of hair still stuck to it. I want to use it, shake it a bit and then hang it or store it cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two issues make me wish I had gotten something else.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, small enough for children so this is great for me.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and big enough to cover a 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; 230 lbs guy. Hair brushes of easily.</li>
    <li> Great item, covers body all around and stays on.</li>
    <li> works fine, price is right</li>
    <li> Wish we would have bought one years ago - on time - exactly what we expected</li>
    <li> Works well. Snaps on the neck  are plastic and can be fussy, but all in all this was a great buy.</li>
    <li> very light cloth, and fit on my kids, no hair stays after cutting.</li>
    <li> I works and it is capable of being put into the washing machine.</li>
    <li> Great cape for the price.  Happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Snaps are a little harder to fasten (I can&#x27;t see them)  than Velcro on other barber capes, but they fasten more securely and do not clog with hair.</li>
    <li> Wish neck was bigger.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> As expected or better.</li>
    <li> Fits great on young and old well. Hair sticks to the fabric and can&#x27;t shake it off and had to wash it to get it clean of hair clippings.</li>
    <li> It took me awhile to buy this, but I was so glad I did. Fits all sizes perfectly, no more trying to get cut hair off of the towels that I used to drape around my boys while I cut their hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I&#x27;ve been giving my Grandsons haircut since the were born with the Flowbee hair cutting unit ergo no hair to contend with but now they are 8 and 10 and want a little more style so I switched to Wahls hair cutting clippers....this cape kept them from wiggling and scratching as the hair was falling mainly because the snap setup fit around their skinny little necks and is long enough so that no hair falls on them.......thanks!</li>
    <li> I threw this away after the first use.  Although many reviews describe the &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34; back portion of this cape, I wanted to try it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By only having a thin ribbon of material behind the neck, there was no way to stop the hair from going all over my back and clothing.  Sorta defeats the purpose in the first place.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for giving home haircuts. No hair down my husband&#x27;s back(except when I shaved his back).</li>
    <li> Love this salon cape! Neck is adjustable and it&#x27;s plenty long</li>
    <li> one improvement would be for more fabric in the back under where it snaps.</li>
    <li> Item perfect just as described</li>
    <li> Looks great! I wish the neck was a little bigger</li>
    <li> Works well and is durable! Love it!</li>
    <li> No more trashing a newspaper full of hair after a trim.  This cape/apron (capron?) is simple and effective.</li>
    <li> For home use, works really well. The adjustable neck means it fits ages 9 to 49 in our house. The shorter back doesn&#x27;t pose any issues in our experience. The material is substantial enough to hold up after many uses, and it shakes out well to get the hairs off after use.</li>
    <li> This was a nice soft material, had no problems with buttons being hard to snap. Glad I had bought this from this seller.</li>
    <li> Keeps the hair over there instead of falling into your underwear.</li>
    <li> been needing one of these for a while as I cut husband and son&#x27;s hair at home.  Cheap, effective, handy.  We will see what happens with the velcro over time....some say it doesn&#x27;t work well once hair gets in it....but I&#x27;m fine with it....can always pin it....better than using a towels like I have been!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for what I use it for; protecting my clothes when I use hair spray. It is flexible and very easy to put on rapidly and take off. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but looks like I&#x27;ll save a bunch of towels.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t velcro so the hair would not stick to it. This cape does the job and is big enough for an adult. It is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Use this for my husbands hair cut. Works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use when I cut my husbands hair at home.  Its so much nicer then the plastic one that came with my hair cutting set and is much more comfortable for him to wear.  This is a really nice cape sold at an excellent price.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong snaps are nice And close and don&#x27;t feel like they will break hair slids off so easily I have had a cape before where the hair stuck to it so this one is a nice change</li>
    <li> Nice cape, good size, lots of snaps at neck so can adjust to many sizes there - quite long, can be used for large or smaller people.  All around very nice, esp. for the price.</li>
    <li> works well like the one they use in barbershops, lightweight and inexpensive</li>
    <li> I taught myself to cut my boys hair in nursing school when trying to save money. This cape is WORTH every cent. Soft quality easy to clean. From the nylon I expected it to feel a little more plastic/cheap. Especially the way the package arrived, cheaply packaged (worth it to keep costs down) Can also change the tightness on the neck from my 10 year old to my husbands.</li>
    <li> I love it,  it&#x27;s just what I wanted and needed!</li>
    <li> The same quality that is needed for daily professional use.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great cape at a great price.</li>
    <li> Perfect cape. Fits my husband and even gets tight enough for my 3 year old.</li>
    <li> worked great! Held up great after washing too</li>
    <li> Woman who cuts my husbands hair said this cape is really terrific. Easy clean-up and light.</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price. Same as the kind barbers have. Don&#x27;t hesitate and buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> very happy with this purchase would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> Bought this because I somehow got roped into cutting my husband&#x27;s, father&#x27;s and boys hair. My father stopped by and was wearing a cashmere sweater and there was no bushing the hair from it after his cut was done. Had to use a vacuum to get his shirt clean. Decided this was a way better idea. Love the snap closure because it can adjust for all of them, even my small boys, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about hair getting trapped in the Velcro and rendering the cape useless. The hair just slides off this thing so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty, not a cheap made cape at all. Worth the money, best part machine washable</li>
    <li> I would not buy these again..thin, flimsy.Rip easy.</li>
    <li> I have been home cutting all of my families hair for 17 + years.  This is the cheapest and best cape yet.  Snap closers work fine and it wraps around the back side good enough.</li>
    <li> Great quality and price!</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> A little short in the back, but works as needed.  Nice closure.  Will last for a few years I think.</li>
    <li> This cape is not the same length the whole way around, so hair ends up on you anyway.</li>
    <li> Great item and was delivered on time!</li>
    <li> Perfect and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I bought this to protect my clothing while I color my hair. It does the job. I was just surprised that the back side of the cape is not very long. It goes down to the middle of my back which is enough to meet my needs with my slightly longer than shoulder length hair. Price is definitely fair.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the cape.  Nice and light material (cooler than others) and the snaps work well.  Also, we machine-washed it (hung to dry) and it came out just fine.</li>
    <li> The cape fits different neck sizes nicely and does a great job of keeping hair off clothing!  What more could you ask of it?  Oh I know, to be able to machine wash it!  Yes!!!  It&#x27;s perfect for my needs - and as a stay-at-home mom of Army brats, we&#x27;re cutting about 4 heads of hair weekly.</li>
    <li> Great for those home haircuts. helps a lot with the mess and keeps the hair off you clothes. Especially great if you can cut hair outdoors as well. Just shake it off outside and the bird have help with nesting stuffing. LOL.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this product. Excellant quality on the fasteners too.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Very large, sturdy cape.  High quality, low cost.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the new.  black nylon cape. It&#x27;s just the right size for the gentlemens hair that she cuts. It&#x27;s long enough to cover their clothes to keep from getting hair on them</li>
    <li> had two hair cuts so far</li>
    <li> this works good for keeping hair off of clothes and skin. Beats using a towel for protection.</li>
    <li> Meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these capes because my kids don&#x27;t like to go to the barber, so I have learned to cut their hair. The biggest problem is that the kids HATE having the cut hair bits sit on their skin, because they itch. So, every time I cut their hair I strip them down to their underwear and wrap them in towels, and then their clothes wouldn&#x27;t be covered in itchy, cut hairs. Needless to say, they were not happy campers. The capes were an attempt to prevent that whole circus from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the reviews, I thought we had a good chance of being successful. The problem is that these capes are made of thin material - fairly tight weave, but very, very thin nylon. Think of a cheap halloween costume cape and you have the right material. The kids love running around the house pretending that they are superheros, but mom isn&#x27;t too happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a solid backed, high back chair, the hair will drop off the end of the back of the cape as it is short, and get into their clothes. So I use two  put on front and back to cover the kids bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long hair might easily be swept off the cape material, but short, pesky hair, like razored hair or textured hair cuts, don&#x27;t. There are little bits that are attracted to the static electricity of the cape, and don&#x27;t come off until laundered. So, I need four capes for two kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is thin - and although the weave seems tight, small hair fragments worked their way through the material to poke into the skin of the boys. Although MUCH better than regular fabric coverings and none of the hair got past the snapped collar, some did get through the cape material and get into their clothes. This was not the case for another cape I ended up buying that was heavier and thicker, so we use the other capes in the front, and these capes to cover their backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The necks fit my skinny 10 and 12 year olds at the next to smallest, and one larger snaps. The snaps are plastic anddon&#x27;t hold as well as a metal snap, but for the purpose, I think they are fine. Just don&#x27;t pull the snaps by the material so that the material doesn&#x27;t rip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - cost (inexpensive); large coverage - this is great!; black color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - very thin material, allows some hair to poke through, more so than other capes that are heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I was looking for the cape since I cut my 10 years old son&#x27;s hair.  I sometimes trim my hair as well.  This cape does the job. The best thing about this cape is - it fits perfect around the neck a small kid.  It is adjustable so it also fit for adult use as well.</li>
    <li> use when applying indian earth and all loose powders great price</li>
    <li> This was a gift so not sure how to review.</li>
    <li> It came with same snaps on both sides so they dont close !  Thats the only reason for 1 star rating &amp; its also thin but no big deal , if it was not defective I would have gave it 4 stars , &amp; im not the only one who has encountered this problem.</li>
    <li> I LIKEDD NOT HAVING HAIR ALL OVER ME WHEN I WOULD GET MY HAIR CUT. EASY A MINTANCE EASY TO STORE.</li>
    <li> My wife started cutting my hair over a year ago.  The only thing that was unpleasant about the home haircut was the hair falling behind my neck and under my T-Shirt. Oh, she would put a bath towel over my shoulders but the hair would fall down my back and onto my clothes anyhow. This \\&quot;cape\\&quot; has remedied  the problem. Wish we&#x27;d ordered one sooner.</li>
    <li> Works like it should. No real coverage at the back.</li>
    <li> Good quality and does a great job since it has many snaps to hold it in place.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and exactly what I expected. Seems to be of great quality. I cut/shave my own hair at home and this will come in very handy!</li>
    <li> I like this very much</li>
    <li> great for those home haircuts.  I use it for my husband and 3 year old and it works well and washes well.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Perfect for giving my husband a trim and hair not all over the place.  Snaps to hold in place.</li>
    <li> The cape I had was an old plastic falling apart one. This cape is wonderful.</li>
    <li> the snaps are REALLY hard to do. It also doesn&#x27;t go as far down in the back as i&#x27;d like. i don&#x27;t have a salon; i just cut my sons&#x27; and husband&#x27;s hair. it only goes about halfway down my husband&#x27;s back, which doesn&#x27;t really protect his shirt.</li>
    <li> The fabric is ok. If it weren&#x27;t for the fact that the closure came with both female snaps so there is no way to close the cape.</li>
    <li> Great price, this item is a must get. The price is great as well as the quality. Its made of good nylon material that is very durable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cape to use for hair cuts at home and I&#x27;m very glad that I chose this one. This cape is adjustable (multiple snaps) so it not only fits my husband but it fits my 7 year old too. The snaps have worked great for me so far. The material this cape is made out of is fantastic because the hair literally sweeps right off for easy clean up. I&#x27;ve had this cape for a while now and it has held up very nicely. I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for, much better than the cheap plastic cape that came with my trimmer.  It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  It&#x27;ll probably last me approximately forever.</li>
    <li> No complain so far. Pretty good product.</li>
    <li> Very nice until now!!</li>
    <li> Yeah I like it.  Could be bigger/longer but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> This cape works as well as the cape I bought for my son a while back for three times the price of this one. The hair clippings can be shaken easily from the cape.</li>
    <li> I love this this!  When coloring my hair I don&#x27;t get any on my clothes!!!</li>
    <li> I use this at home when I color my hair.  I wish I had thought of getting one of these a long time ago instead of ruining my own clothes.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this purchase.  I was looking for a cape that would fit my husband and my young sons.  This fits the bill completely.  Its lightweight with plenty of snaps at the neck to get the fit just right.  I even purchased one for myself to wear while cutting hair to keep the hair off of my clothes.</li>
    <li> Great and will fit all sizes.  Fast delivery and great service.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews by some who said they had problems with snaps etc. I experienced none of these the product is excellent</li>
    <li> Good quality, great size, serves it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
    <li> Been using a nylon cape at home for years.  This one blows it out of the water!  The snap closure is sturdy and the cape is SO much nicer. Definitely would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The cape was just as described. Some reviewers had trouble with the snaps not working properly, but mine were fine.</li>
    <li> Item is as described however the neck is a bit small. I have a 19 inch neck but I was able to modify it due to some of my Mothers teachings and it works just fine for an inexpensive cape.</li>
    <li> Does what is suppose to</li>
    <li> The professional cape to go with the Andis professional clippers.</li>
    <li> very nice. came very quickly</li>
    <li> The product was just as advertised and was delivered very quickly. It will fit kids and adults. The material and snaps are quality and is very lightweight</li>
    <li> durable but not to bulky</li>
    <li> I got this for my bro b/c he always used a towel or tshirt when he cut hair so I got this cape for him. So far so good.</li>
    <li> it is beautiful and definitely worthy of a 5 star. very long and perfect for my clients. thank you very much</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Works great for kids and adults alike!!</li>
    <li> I like this. It helps with my business.</li>
    <li> very sleek and functional</li>
    <li> Perfect for home haircuts, love it!</li>
    <li> This cape is large and has lots of snaps for different neck sizes. You can&#x27;t beat the price, either. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works . Seems very thin I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it so far used it about four times for home use. As somebody describes in a previous reviews seems like the kind of material a Halloween costume would be made of. I really was expecting a little heavier material</li>
    <li> The cape is a good size and quality.  The only minor issue is the hair tends to stick to it and is difficult to shake off. I guess the material generates static.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Very professional and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair for a few years now, we just used an old rain coat, after reading all the reviews decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;, and we are both very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I feel like Batman when I put this on...</li>
    <li> Love this item, works great for cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;Prevents hair from landing in clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to put on my son.</li>
    <li> Very nice item.  Covers everything.  Snaps work very well.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to dye my long hair at home. The dyr did not seep through either!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. This is soft and slick like a professional cape. The hair just slides right off. It is very long in front - it completely covered my 10 year old! And the snap closure is amazing. Would fit any child our adult. Delivered right on time. Great price! Completely pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. Good quality. Easy to use and clean. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> This item looks great but its super cheap. Doesn&#x27;t wrap around the body while using it as a cape for hair cutting.  Would never purchase again. Big mistake!</li>
    <li> Great cape for price! My only complaint is the length in the back is a bit too short in my opinion. I guess it would work fine if I had a low back chair or salon chair to use. The length in the back is good for kids not so much for adults if you are using a stool. Hair doesn&#x27;t cling to material. Water beads off well enough.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what we needed. Good material and great for the price</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, and nice quality.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality cape.  It isn&#x27;t thin and cheap.  It is a very good quality.  We love it.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my need.  It came quickly at a great price.  It definitely makes shopping online something I would do more.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  It is nice to have the snaps so you can adjust the size of the neck opening.</li>
    <li> I have cut my family&#x27;s hair for lots of years and they always hated the itchy feeling after all the small hairs landed on their neck.  This was such a wonderful blessing and improvement.  Wish I would have done this years before.  Great quality and easy care.</li>
    <li> It kept all hair off hubby while I cut, and feels and looks to be great quality. Did the job!</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described. It keeps hair off my body when i&#x27;m getting it cut so there&#x27;s no room to complain.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great cape...many, many neck adjustment settings...long enough (I&#x27;m 5,10 180lbs, male) to keep hair off my legs and it wraps around your back to prevent hair from getting down your back</li>
    <li> I bought this cape because you could adjust the neck.  Works great for me and my grandkids. Put a paper towel around your neck so that you don&#x27;t sweat making the hair stick to you!</li>
    <li> Nice quality cape fits adults.</li>
    <li> The snap feature is much better than the velcro</li>
    <li> Has a professional quality to it but yet such a good price. The snaps around the neck are great. Should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Got this for my home buzz cut. My initial impression is that this will serve me well.</li>
    <li> This one does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this cape because I recently started cutting my husband&#x27;s and brother&#x27;s hair at home, so I just needed a decent cape to keep the hair off of them. This cape will definitely do the job and it was a great price too.</li>
    <li> I found that this Hair Salon Nylon Cape that I received from amazon is of the best quality for the price, and the best deal in town I could find as a sound investment. I shop amazon first with everything, and I find I need not look any further for the BEST! Thanks again, amazon!!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  It&#x27;s thin but not flimsy.  It had snap-on buttons.  It fit a 6 yr old and adults.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 yr and have no issue.</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> Great for washing my daughters hair while in her wheelchair.</li>
    <li> Of decent quality... not stiff like some capes.  My only gripe is that the back is significantly shorter than the front... hope you are ok with hair down your back...  Description never addressed this and pics seem strategically taken so I can&#x27;t say they &amp;#34;lied&amp;#34; BUT I probably would look around more if I needed another.</li>
    <li> It was defective. Couldn&#x27;t snap it because they had the same side of snaps. So I sent it back</li>
    <li> No holes or tears, and the buttons didn&#x27;t feel like they would rip out when unsnapping.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> I agree with a previous comment - &amp;#34;Definitely not the type of fabric that is necessary for a cape. This is flimsy, small, light, and not for professional use&amp;#34;.  The material is extremely thin and light.  After unfolding it, it doesn&#x27;t even fall downward by gravity. Worse material than what I have been using now at home.  No professional hair salon would ever use this.  I bought it because it&#x27;s labelled for Professional Hair Salon.  This is a false advertisement.</li>
    <li> This was the best buy that I have made in a while.  it helps keep them clean and it doesn&#x27;t get hair everywhere! Great material, the snaps work fine and the adjustable neck is perfect for the hubs and the son.</li>
    <li> We have used it for coloring hair, cutting our toddler&#x27;s hair and our own hair. Large to cover adult. Happy with product. Doing what I needed for it to do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cape, it works and stops hair from sticking to you</li>
    <li> Great length: it covers well past the knees and the backside so that the hair doesn&#x27;t get on the clothes.  Love the adjustable neck size.  Makes cutting hair at home a breeze!</li>
    <li> It is a very nice cape. I&#x27;m sure I will be very happy with it</li>
    <li> This cape is just like in the beauty shops.It covers well and is adjustable around the neck.Saves dye stains from getting on your clothes.</li>
    <li> Very thin, so don&#x27;t expect heavy duty.  Works well for the occasional home cut we need it for.</li>
    <li> Item as described! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Nice cape for the price it fits right for a tall person nice material and nice snap closure, no problem</li>
    <li> This cape is what it was supposed to be and I like it fine. Our old one was getting rather frayed, so I ordered this one. But, until I&#x27;ve used it a while, how can I rate it? It does appear to be made well out of good quality nylon. The texture is very smooth and should shake out well. Yes, it is much longer in the front than in the back, but that is expected, since one&#x27;s lap is in front and needs the hair to be kept off it, but only the shoulders in the back.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and works well for our hair studio.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Really like it, short in the back and long with different size for the neck. Works great for hair cuts and my son uses it to wash his face, he hates getting water on his shirt.</li>
    <li> it was what I was looking for thanks</li>
    <li> Nice barber cape. It was inexpensive and I think it will do the job I need it to do. I like the snaps for various neck sizes.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> The capes met all of my expectations. The fabric is light and cool. Clients are not hot when wearing them.</li>
    <li> like going to the barber..easy to clean-up after ward..kids like to use it as superhero cape also..would recommend to any one looking to keep the hair off your shoulders and front...</li>
    <li> This is perfect for me.  The material is comfortable, and the cut hair just slides right off.  The snaps are great.  My old cape had Velcro, who just caught all the hair.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> My husband is in the military so I&#x27;ve taken over cutting his hair to save money n this works great for keeping the hair of him!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s long and is exactly what I was looking for. If I could add one thing, I would have loved the bottom of the cape to be stitched up to form a pocket all around the bottom to catch the falling hair, but I know most hair salon capes don&#x27;t have that feature. It really is a great hair cutting cape.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and at a great price :) would suggest this to anyone looking for a simple cape at a great price. BTW.. I bought this for home use, I don&#x27;t work in a salon.</li>
    <li> We bought this for home use and the quality is fine. It&#x27;s lightweight and adjusts to fit our children as needed. I recommend it for home use as a good buy.</li>
    <li> its a good cape I got one at Sally Beauty Supply for around the same amount and the quality was terrible compared to this one.</li>
    <li> Thought it would cover the back just a little better but it covers the top portion so its fine</li>
    <li> Wanted a hair catcher for my self haircuts.  This works beautifully.  Generously covers the sink and the hair is easy to gather and the cape shakes out cleanly.  Never got the black bag for the cape.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair cut apron. I&#x27;ve had several of these in my home over the years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve used this brand. I thought it was going to be like the rest of them that I&#x27;ve had that came with the shears. To my surprise these have a nice snap system for the neck and work good keeping the hair off the recipient of the hair cut. The material is thicker than others I&#x27;ve had and held up and worked better than ones I&#x27;ve had</li>
    <li> perfect, and not the traditional stylist cape. I went the extra mile and personalized this cape. It is a gift for a friend new to the salon business. I think her clients will be impressed.</li>
    <li> Nice cape but is rather thin. Snap closure works better than velcro.  I would purchase a cape with more substance.</li>
    <li> Unable to use without pinning because snaps were all the same--you need make and female to close!!!!  Looks like an error on the maker.</li>
    <li> Well made and fits nicely around the neck with its adjustable closure. The length was correct for the clippings to be caught.</li>
    <li> This is as described, made of the same material you&#x27;d find in barber shops and is big enough to cover a grown man.</li>
    <li> It has little buttons by the neck so can be used for little kids to any age handy cover. Cleans well ,great size</li>
    <li> just what i want but my neck is too big. i have a very big neck. you should be fine.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my friend who cuts hair. Makes his life and his clients much easier. Also good for beard cuttings</li>
    <li> Great soft feel and love the plastic snaps!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend highly over Velcro closures or cold metal snaps!&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have for any pro stylist.</li>
    <li> This is working out great.  There are plenty of snaps for a nice fit.</li>
    <li> It was all that I expected.If I had to say anything negative it would be it is a little loud.However I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like this hair salon cape. I use it at home to cut my boys&#x27; hair.  It has plenty of snaps to accommodate different neck sizes.  Easy to clean, nice fabric.</li>
    <li> the neck closure needs to be larger for larger necks. I really like the fact it can be washed and is light weight.</li>
    <li> This was all I expected and more.  very ample coverage.  worth the price.</li>
    <li> If you cut hair a must have for the price and value a great product purchase you won&#x27;t be unhappy with this buy.</li>
    <li> Item as described and great quality</li>
    <li> I still not really use it.  But I have it tried on my husband and son.  it fit them ok!</li>
    <li> This is a really good cape for the price.  I use it to cut my family&#x27;s hair, and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;head and shoulders&amp;#34; above those cheap capes that come in the hair clipper kits.</li>
    <li> Getting a home barber trim was always messy. The Cape made a big difference. After the haircut I always had a major personal cleanup. Now when I take off the Cape, I&#x27;m done and ready to go. Much better with the Cape.</li>
    <li> I was tired of ruining towels and t-shirts while coloring my hair at home.  This cape provides plenty of coverage and keeps the haircolor off of my arms and clothing.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy one of these years ago.</li>
    <li> This cape fits the neck well and is very light weight.  Don&#x27;t get hot either when you wear it.  Inexpensive too</li>
    <li> This is very useful as I cut my husbands and my kids hair, this makes my life much easier ;o)</li>
    <li> I only use it at home on my husband and sons, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting great. But here&#x27;s my honest review. The buttons don&#x27;t stay shut. Any movement and they pop open. The hair sticks to the fabric. I mean the hair is still stuck to it and I cut hair days ago. But what more can you expect from a $9.00 product.</li>
    <li> Great for giving my 2 and 4 year old haircuts. It feels solid and I think it will last a while. Held up to 3 washings already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist and been in the business for 10 years. I purchased 2 capes because of all the great reviews but once I received them I was very disapointed. They are very thin, flimsy and made out of low quality material. They are worth $2 or less in my opinion. Professional&#x27;s beware.</li>
    <li> Quality &amp; inexpensive. Not too small like some reviewers mentioned. My wife loves it. Buy with confidence. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was not useful because it was hard to clean up hairs. But size is good. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I see it.</li>
    <li> my mom has cut hair for years and does hair cuts for family members from her house. she was happy to get this cape for when she does hair cuts in her home.</li>
    <li> Very effective and helpful.  Had one of those circle ones before, I like this one much better. It fits even large necks and people.</li>
    <li> Large enough and no problems getting the snaps to snap easily. Would recommend with no reservations. Did what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> This hair salon nylon cape is light weighted, not stitching to skin like the plastic ones, reasonable priced. Very nice!</li>
    <li> Like the snaps, fits well, but the back is almost completely exposed and could use more material. Not a huge deal as not much hair falls back there, and this helps A TON with home haircuts, so for the price, it&#x27;s a good buy. Just not real barbershop quality.</li>
    <li> Every came on a timely manner and the snaps are good so far....It seems just as good as the ones I purchased at the distributors.</li>
    <li> Great quality, feels just like what they use at the salon.  Love the snaps so it&#x27;s adjustable for use on kids as well as adults.  It&#x27;s also nice and long.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that my wife cuts our hair on a no-back stool in the garage but this is only moderately useful for me. I was hoping it would be equal length front and back but it only covers a small portion of my upper back. This was somewhat deceiving in the pictures as there was one that looked like it was draped down the back of the mannequin but I&#x27;m guessing this was actually the front.</li>
    <li> it is nice cape.snaps are kinda tricky and i think will break fast but Ireally don&#x27;t care to much always can use hair clip.Iwish it came with storage bag.</li>
    <li> The cape was of even better quality than I expected. I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought to color my hair and found the material to be fine.  The snaps are difficult to close on yourself but there&#x27;s plenty of range for small - medium neck sizes.  My biggest objection is the length of the back.  I have medium length hair but it won&#x27;t protect my clothing from spills in the back like I need.  I guess I&#x27;ll try to wear it backwards.  I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone could use this professionally.  Too much hassle to return now.</li>
    <li> Way better than using an old bed sheet.</li>
    <li> Just as described, very nice. Such an improvement over the plastic one that came with my clippers!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and item as described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I like the material this is made of, I only wish it was long in the back as well.  So when I cut my families hair, they still get hairy on the back.</li>
    <li> nice quality cape with snaps to fit almost any size neck.  Just what I needed.  Used on my son already and it worked great</li>
    <li> I needed something for haircuts for a husband and three little boys. Used this for all of them. Much better than a sheet with a pin!</li>
    <li> It has the correct snaps and is a nice material. It may be long for my kid haircuts, but still quite effective.</li>
    <li> These capes are very flimsy. Not what I thought they would be.Thin material,But you only get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> We purchased this as the best barber I know is my wife.  We have been using old sheets and when I saw this, I figured I would give it a try.  I am very happy that I did because it does the job!</li>
    <li> This is exactly as described. I have used it twice now, for my son and my husband and they especially appreciated the light silky material that didn&#x27;t make them sweat like the old plastic cape I have always used when giving them haircuts. Secure snap closure fits snug around the neck..  Great product.</li>
    <li> I received this product promptly without any problems.  I was able to use it on my husband &amp; son.  I loved the snaps closure around the neck; which worked perfectly.  Material is of good quality and not cheap.  Would recommend it to everyone especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for coloring my hair.( I wore it backwards with the short side in front so I had better arm movement. I even went into the shower with it when I was rinsing out the color. It rinsed out along with my hair. It didn&#x27;t have that plastic smelly odor. another bonus.  overall a great buy.</li>
    <li> Really happy with the service, I will definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair cutting cape.  I was nervous because some reviews stated that their snaps didn&#x27;t work.  Ours were perfect.  Helps my son not get so itchy when my hubby cuts his hair!</li>
    <li> Bought to replace old vinyl cape that was taped together with duct tape. This is perfect. Good price, adjustable snaps around the neck. Plenty long enough. Good quality.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my salon. They are exactly what I needed. A light nylon cutting cape .</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT I AM VERY GLAD I BOUGHT IT</li>
    <li> Fits everyone, and works great.</li>
    <li> Very good product, reliable, stable. I use it more than six months and had no problems. I think you will like it too.</li>
    <li> works well, item as described</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost a year now.  The buttons still snap well.  I use it when I cut my boys hair so it doesn&#x27;t get used a frequently as it would in a beauty salon.  It fits my needs for now.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for anyone.  I use on my children and adults.  I&#x27;ve had it for a while and it&#x27;s held up nicely.  Great price and design!</li>
    <li> This worked great for my husband and my three year old son, the neck snaps fit them both just fine, hair easily slipped off the fabric for easy clean up. I just wish it had a carrying case for storage or stayed folded up more easily. It does have a strap to hang it up but I am not a professional so don&#x27;t use it very often.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great buy.</li>
    <li> The neck is not big enough for some of my clients. I have one client with a 22&amp;#34; neck. This would never fit him. For the rest of my clients, it works well. The hair falls right off.</li>
    <li> This cape is a great buy and reasonably priced compared to salon supply stores. I won&#x27;t buy my future capes from anywhere else again! I love this cape for 3 main reasons compared to others:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Its perfect for Taller clients. It has better coverage over their clothes and shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The button snaps are way better than velcro because it doesn&#x27;t catch on hair. (There are multiple snaps for different sized necks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Its slick material makes dusting hair off a very easy task.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product 100%!</li>
    <li> I have always cut my husband&#x27;s hair and that of all of our children. This cape blows my last cape out of the water. I love the snaps! These allow the cape to be small enough for our youngest children. They do not collect hair the way velcro does. This cape is also a nice large size.</li>
    <li> I got it right away.  It was a great shopping experience.  I used it at home and thought the snap around the neck was wonderful design.  In addition, there is a thoughtful loop for hanging it up either on a hook or thread through the top of a hanger and leave it in a closet.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2; one for myself since I cut family members hair and in the past have used a sheet. The other one was a gift to my grand daughter who is taking cosmetology; she is a batman fan and had it put on the cape.</li>
    <li> I get my haircuts from a friend.  Saves money and this keeps hair off the floors.  I don&#x27;t know what else you would expect a cape to do.</li>
    <li> Everything I was looking for. It does the job. The snap closure works well. Not much more to say about it.</li>
    <li> Good value.  My wife says 3 stars, but she&#x27;s harder to please than me.  If the plastic snaps wear out too soon, she will have been right.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and wanted a fabric barber cape.  His neck measures about 18&amp;#34;, and there was concern as to whether the neck would fit, but I ordered it anyway.  Glad I did...neck fits fine and cape is perfect for our needs.  Due to snap placement, the cape should fit nearly every neck size, and hair slides right off of it.  I&#x27;m happy, he&#x27;s happy...I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this cape.</li>
    <li> Snaps are hard to work with</li>
    <li> The product is nice, convenient and easy to use. Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Material is nice and slick to keep hair off... But the back is pretty short -  just about 20 inches or so.  Would have preferred a full length back like the front,  then I&#x27;d give it 4 or 5 stars</li>
    <li> I bought this for my DIL who cuts her family&#x27;s hair.  Great price, and they don&#x27;t have to sit wearing a trash bag anymore.  Everyone is happy.</li>
    <li> This cape is exactly what I was looking for.  I had no problem with the snap closures - they work well.  If, down the road, they do break it would be fairly simple to replace them with a strip of velcro.  The cape is thin, but that&#x27;s exactly what you want.</li>
    <li> This cape has lots of snaps around the neck for that just right fit.  Material is very light but shakes off hair very easily.  I do not use it for professional hair cutting, but I&#x27;m sure it would hold up to lots of uses.</li>
    <li> Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to hold on body.</li>
    <li> nice salon cape will serve its purpose</li>
    <li> We bought this cape for our at-home henna conditioning treatments.  DD had researched it and found it to be a well-rated product.  The cape works perfectly.  We fasten it to the front so that we have freedom of arm movement and so that it covers the back.  Any spills or splashes can be washed or wiped away quite thoroughly.  All in all, we are quite pleased.  Shipment was very fast as well.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels right for the job. Kit allows for learning curve and cost is reasonable; Brand you can trust.</li>
    <li> very satisfied, this is exactly what I needed, I cut my brother&#x27;s hair and the cape that came with my hair clippers ripped, and this nylon cape replaces it well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husbands hair for a few years and instead of cape we always used towels. But I was tiread of his hair sticking into towels even after wash so I&#x27;ve decided to buy it. It&#x27;s big and great, just like the ones at hair sallons. My only concern are those small buttons on the neckline. They are so small that I&#x27;m afraid I will accidentaly ripp them off one day.</li>
    <li> reasonably priced and high quality product. Adjustable snap closures make it easy to fit any neck. the smooth nylon material makes it easy to remove cut hair with just a couple of  quick snaps.</li>
    <li> It is light weight and large. Seems like it will do the job well. Like the feel of the material.</li>
    <li> Good product. Willing to buy again if must.</li>
    <li> Perfect for haircuts that I give my husband. Good quality and durable. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I like the quality of the fabric and craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;The cape looks professional, the snaps are working and seems very well made.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Need replacement. Snaps do not work. Just noticed from other reviews that I am not alone. How could this happen? No basic QC?</li>
    <li> Ordered this along with new clippers and a razor and it is awesome.  This is perfect size, just like the salon.  I used it for my son who is 6&#x27;0, 215 lbs and it fit great!  Great cape for a great price!!1</li>
    <li> It was fine it arrived on time &amp; will be using it tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I have not actually used this cape yet but the material is of a professional quality, like what you would find in a professional barber shop or salon....it is not the cheap plastic like material that some capes are made of.  It has buttons instead of Velcro which on one hand is good because hair will not get caught in buttons like it would in Velcro but it does slightly limit the sizing ability.  the buttons are pretty close together so I don&#x27;t really see it being an issue.  All in all, I would say you are not going to find a better cape than this and at a great price too!</li>
    <li> Satisfied with this product,  the best part about this product are the buttons instead of Velcro going around the neck, snug fit.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes it a lot and thinks it will be great for cutting his son&#x27;s hair. It has more than one snap closure so it will fit skinny necks and not so skinny necks. Seems like a great product. Long, lightweight, and as pictured.</li>
    <li> The material is good quality and feels like it will last for a long time.  The Neck adjustments seem adequate to fit anyone.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice...don&#x27;t have to worry about hair all over me</li>
    <li> It fits my sexy body and doesn&#x27;t allow hair to get on my shirt.  What more can you ask? Nothing!</li>
    <li> It is simple and easy to snap. Very functional.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the money. I wasn&#x27;t looking for I didn&#x27;t get this to use when cutting hair or anything, but when I&#x27;m dying mine or my moms hair at home. The front is nice and long, my only complaint is that the back isn&#x27;t that long, so if you have long hair or the dye splatters it can still get on your clothes.</li>
    <li> use at home for cutting my boyfriends hair.</li>
    <li> Good price...works adequately; however, the plastic snaps at the neck don&#x27;t work very well. For home use, it is fine.</li>
    <li> closures do not close</li>
    <li> Simple, inexpensive and practical.</li>
    <li> Made full cut and snap closure fits well.</li>
    <li> Great Product, great price. Would definitely do business again.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these capes. Very good quality. Lots of adjustment at the neck closure and keeps hair clipping from going under the cape. I recommend this cape to anyone. It is easy to clean, plenty large enough for even the biggest person, well constructed and at a real good price.  Snaps are very small and may be difficult for some to manage.</li>
    <li> The nylon cape works great for home hair cuts which is why I needed it.The cape covers well and the  snaps are located to fit small to large neck. A very good buy.</li>
    <li> I think that is the item I want to have. I like this one because it all made by nylon</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I utilize often. I obtained product at a reasonable price and I am overall very pleased with this transaction. I highly recommend, and this is a high quality product. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> seems well made. does the job I want from it.</li>
    <li> It works great, and it fits my 10-year old as well as the adults. I saved package it came in for storing it when not in use.</li>
    <li> This is just like what they use at my salon or maybe it is what they use in the salon!  Snaps well.  Does a great job!</li>
    <li> Great product easy to adjust and use!!!</li>
    <li> The hair sticks to it a little more than I expected.  Still had to take it outside and shake it out.  But much better than using a normal towel.  The fit was nice and my boys thought it was comfortable.</li>
    <li> Good quality as describe by seller...</li>
    <li> This is the first cape I&#x27;ve bought separately from the plastic ones included with a clipper set.  I used it yesterday for the first time and I love it.  Hair doesn&#x27;t cling to it like it does with the plastic ones.  It just slides right off.  The snaps at the neckline worked well and the whole cape provided ample coverage for my husband (whose hair I was cutting).  The cape is a nice material and I don&#x27;t think it will be hot and sticky like the plastic has been when the weather turns hot again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and keeps hair clipping off of you.  It&#x27;s not the best cape you can buy, but if you are not a professional hair stylist then this will do the trick.</li>
    <li> It is great.  No more garbage bags!</li>
    <li> Love the size of this cape. Keeps the hair off of my chair when cutting.</li>
    <li> Nice transaction, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! With it, I feel myself like in a professional salon!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace broken cape that came with hair clippers.  Awesome coverage on my husband - keeps him clean and is super easy to put on and take off.  Soft draping material made it much more comfortable for him than the small, stiffly draping plastic one that originally came with our clippers!  Perfect for our home use!</li>
    <li> This one just works like what you see in professional hair salon the collar is so flexible to meet all size of necks.I&#x27;d recommend this for any home use.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I actually really like this cape and it was better than I expected. Some reviews said the snaps were backward and other things, but our&#x27;s is fine. The material is good, snaps work fine, and so far it&#x27;s fit everyone in my house from my 60lbs son, on up to my adult husband and myself. When used on my smallest child there was still room to go smaller, so I bet I could also use this on a toddler. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come down far enough in the back for someone who has long hair. Our solution was to simply rotate the cape the other direction with the short area in the front (when using this as a hair dye cape.) Overall I am very happy with this cape.</li>
    <li> I like it.It covers all the body and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My husband is 6&#x27;2 and it works well for his size, covers all that need to be covered. Has snaps that are secure. Hair is easily removed.</li>
    <li> It shipped and arrived quickly, and was a gift for my brother. He loved it, especially the &amp;#34;suggested uses&amp;#34; shown on the cape in a series of sketches, which were particularly clever in the design.</li>
    <li> I really like this but, after a couple of uses, the snaps started to rip away whenever you would go to take it off. You have to be careful with the snaps.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  good quality..thanks!</li>
    <li> I like the cape.  It will work with most of my clients.  I do have clients with large necks and this one will not work our for them.  It will get the job done.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and we are very pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> Nice, heavy quality.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good quality material and attachments that are more practical than Velcro. I also like that it is large enough to give adequate protection. and all at a good price.</li>
    <li> little bit expensive, otherwise nice product</li>
    <li> nice size providing good coverage. and nylon is more durable than plastic.&lt;br /&gt;the only con is the snap closures are all \\&quot;males\\&quot;, how can that mistake happen? now I have to get a string or sth to wrap around the neck...</li>
    <li> Good quality. Works well, good quality and good price! My husband and son are 6&#x27;4 and it works well for them.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, Great Price and Good Quality Cape.  The Snap is great to secure the Cape around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;Would have liked the Cape to be a little longer at the back.</li>
    <li> It is like they discribe. Long, good quality, nice and fits perfectly. I recommend it. The black color is nice  too.</li>
    <li> This, actually, works.</li>
    <li> Instead of going to a barbershop, I&#x27;ve since learned to save money by going to friend&#x27;s houses who have been cutting hair for years. The only issue is that most of them lacked a barber apron. This was cheap and arrived in a decent time and solved the issue. Now I can go to my friend&#x27;s house for a cut without getting hair all over myself.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Met expectations.</li>
    <li> Great product.  As advertised.</li>
    <li> Used once so far and is a great product.</li>
    <li> excellent  product!  The quality is very good and it fits. Most that come with haircut kits are children sized but this one is sized for a tall person.</li>
    <li> Its o.k. just a bit thin</li>
    <li> My clothes are grateful.  I use it to cover up when I bleach my hair.</li>
    <li> It feels like a professional quality product that covers well and breathes well.</li>
    <li> Not so use full for my hair cut. It does not cover the whole area of shoulders and arms</li>
    <li> This could be just a tad bigger around the neck for my XXL guy but it&#x27;s still works fine.  Just shake it off when you are done and it has a loop to hang it up for out of sight storage.  Great Product, great price</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my son and his fiance for Christmas! Also got them a hair clippers, that&#x27;s why the cape was needed. They loved it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time. Cape is long enough to capture hair for tall people; also love the snap closure. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in buying it.</li>
    <li> This cape is saving us lots of clean up time allowing the cut hair to just glide its way to the floor, we just wish we would have bought this sooner instead of trying to make do with big garbage bags!  Especially considering the small price to pay for it.  The hair slides right off, the cape covers the shoulders, front, and back and hangs loosely down protecting all of my husband&#x27;s clothes while I cut his hair and the neck it fully adjustable so I can make it tight over his shirt collar.</li>
    <li> Perfect - and a great price!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Nothing wrong with the product. Looks exactly like the picture</li>
    <li> Great product. Worked out very good when my 8 yr Son had his Haircut using it. Hair does not stick to it and big enough for use with anyone size person.  Delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> I bought for my one-year old. It is big enough to cover all over him. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> If you need to use this cape for your child with expected smaller than adult neck size, this cape is not even close to a good fit. It leaves a large gap that allows hair to get inside.  Prior reviewers have said it but I did not pay attention. My low rating has to do with this problem.  My children ages are 8 and 10 years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I have a client come in regularly for his dreads to be retwisted, and I used to have a velcrow cape and it would pull on his dreads and take out what I just put in. This cape is so perfect and flowy. It&#x27;s so cool.</li>
    <li> This cape was exactly what we needed. The cape generously sized and the neck fastener can adapt to many sizes. The fabric is easy to shake free of hair, and is comfortable to wear/</li>
    <li> I love this cap.  It&#x27;s soft and comfortable as well as large enough to use for an adult.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
    <li> Pros: Long so fits well on guys&lt;br /&gt;  quality material&lt;br /&gt;  Low price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I have a little trouble getting the snaps to snap sometimes because they are plastic instead of metal. But they do work and it was cheap!</li>
    <li> Exactly like I wanted it. Good body coverage. Hair slips right off. Closeur keeps hair from falling down back. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I cut my kids&#x27; and husband&#x27;s hair regularly, but have not used a cape since the plastic one that came with the clippers fell apart. What was I thinking?? This is soooo worth the few dollars it costs. Keeps the hair off their clothes and skin, and makes clean up so much easier! No need to wash, just shake it out. I&#x27;m so glad I got this. The snaps are great. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Its good, durable, long to cover up right the customer, itas a good choice to buy for your bussines. Excellent</li>
    <li> This cape is large enough for good coverage of clothes and has the adjustable neck snap closure for added protection; also, it is very easy to clean and maintain. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> The cape is easy to put on and long enough to catch any spills. Easy to launder and easy to pack away. No more spills on towels or clothing that are ruined because of permanent stains. A very cheap savior.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok Cape. Better for styling than cutting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner barber and I wanted something simple. This product is light, easy to clean, and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> As a Mama of 5 boys (plus my husband), I do a lot of haircutting.  This is PERFECT for a quick cut when you don&#x27;t want to give a shower to follow.  Apply cape, cut hair, brush off with hand, and wash hair under faucet!  Yeah, that was easy! :)  Boys love that too!   This cape will work for my 2 year old, to my 40 year old honey! :)  I used it the day I got it, and it seems like it is great quality and should last for years!</li>
    <li> Works great. Fits me just fine (and I&#x27;m a large person)</li>
    <li> Good for the summer, not heavy at all, snaps were a bit tight. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful for all ages. Worked great for my 3 yr old to my 79 yr old father.</li>
    <li> This salon cape is a nicer cape then the ones I have purchased in the past. It fits very comfortably around the neck and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin or chock you. It is made with nice fabric which I am in love with and it has buttons that snap together in the back that do not show. When cutting hair, the hair just slips right off the fabric onto the floor. It is by far a better cape then going to a beauty store and getting one. Very happy with this purchase and I recommend this cape to all the hair dressers out there. It will be worth your money.</li>
    <li> Nice cape ! Very durable !</li>
    <li> The dye went through!!!!! Do not purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Basically on for haircuts. Liquid and dye go right through the material.</li>
    <li> My order came in quick. It is what i expected. I am a happy customer</li>
    <li> I like the snap on neck but didn&#x27;t like that it was too too short in the back</li>
    <li> I use it as a barber drape.  It&#x27;s not exactly a complex item, so there&#x27;s not much to say about it.  Seems to be well-constructed, and the fabric is slippery and lets the hair slide off.  The snap closure at the neck really does the job well.</li>
    <li> nice cape for/when clipping my husbands hair (the hair slides right down the cape) ...and sometimes I borrow it to color my hair; (great use since I don&#x27;t ruin clothes or towels when coloring my hair)</li>
    <li> I cut my 7 year old son&#x27;s hair and the worst part is the hairs itching him, they get everywhere.  This cape worked perfectly. The snaps are easy to adjust, the cape overlaps in the back, easy on, easy off and not a single hair to annoy him.</li>
    <li> Very nice and lightweight.</li>
    <li> I love the longer length and having snaps that allow the cape to be closer around the neck than my previous cape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male who uses this when cutting my own hair.  Does the job.  Stays in place when fastened around the neck, which has been an issue for me with other products.</li>
    <li> For the price this is great.  I don&#x27;t need it much, once every 6 weeks or so when I buzz my husbands hair.  It&#x27;s not very big and it&#x27;s not very thick, I doubt it would be very durable.  But it&#x27;s also very cheap so for how little I use it, it suites my needs just fine</li>
    <li> Great Salon Cape! I like that it is made of fabric, not plastic - should last a lot longer! Shipped quickly and came as described! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I wear a white shirt with a high collar as part of my work uniform and a problem I often have is makeup fallout onto my clothing as I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning. I have to put on the shirt before I start applying my foundation so I took a tip from my hair stylist and bought this inexpensive nylon cape to protect my clothing when I do my makeup. It works great for this purpose and has held up well. If you are careful with the snaps (do not rip the snaps apart quickly when you want to take it off), this cape should hold up very well for you, too.</li>
    <li> I just got the cape.  Overall, I like it.  The hair falls off the cape and you can just shake it out.  Its big enough to cover your whole body as you sit ther getting you hair cut.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the snaps are hard to snap at first and need to be broken in.  I&#x27;m afraid that I might end up tearing the cape up trying to pull the snaps back apart.</li>
    <li> Fits very well. Feels very professional after wearing it.</li>
    <li> Cape seemed a little small since it does not go all they way around my back but thinking about it, I don&#x27;t recall the ones used in Salons doing that either.  For the price it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the garbage-bag cape that came with my Wahl set. It looks like it will be great - it is long and a nice, silky fabric that should shake off hairs easily. Good price, good product &#x3D; good recommendation.</li>
    <li> As one reviewer mentioned, the back is too short and does not cover completely.  Other than that, good!</li>
    <li> great value for the money!</li>
    <li> Great product for a low price. Works well for young kids and adults for occasional use at home.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with the condition in which the cape arrived, and it&#x27;s obvious quality. It arrived timely as well. Good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> Works nicely for cutting my husbands hair.</li>
    <li> It does what is it suppose to</li>
    <li> The capes were delivered before they were supposed to be and they were just what the description said. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and was exactly what I was hoping for!  It will work great!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Nice size and well made cape for the price.</li>
    <li> I used this cape for the first time last night when I cut my daughter&#x27;s hair. Usually I would use a towel to wrap around her, but finally I had an easy, CLEAN way to keep the hair off of her. It worked wonderfully! I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s and kids&#x27; hair for, oh, 18 years now and can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to order this. Great product!</li>
    <li> 0 stars for quality of material.</li>
    <li> works great for wiggling grandsons. Keeps hair off of them very well.</li>
    <li> Affordable, nice material, nice snaps, and my customers aren&#x27;t sweating to death! I definitely recommend this product. It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> I like it, I&#x27;m keeping it. Short in back, but I just use a clothespin to bring some of the material together to make it longer in the back. I use this on my toddler and a small setting fits perfectly around his 2 1/2 year old neck, and it could go smaller. Soft and slick without making anyone sweaty!! and so much better than using a towel for home hair cuts that I&#x27;ve been doing for years. Why didn&#x27;t I buy one sooner??</li>
    <li> This cape was exactly what I needed and more.  It has snaps at the neck that hold securely and they are adjustable. All in all excellent quality for the price.</li>
    <li> For me this is a good product. It is very good quality and botton buckle. I can rest assured that for a good haircut</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started to cut the hair of my 3 and 5 year old little boys and this fits them perfectly!</li>
    <li> Product was of a very light material but had a great fit and kept all the hair off of me. I would recommend this to anyone who does light hair cuts.</li>
    <li> The snap closure was a must, as hair always seems to get caught in Velcro, so this cape is perfect.  The neck was large enough to fit around my husband&#x27;s neck, but could get small enough to fit around my 18 month old&#x27;s neck as well (and still snap!).  The cape itself is large and does a great job of allowing cut hair fall to the floor rather than getting caught on clothing.  Great fine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m picky about everything I buy. I&#x27;ve had this for awhile now and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend money on a pricier cape. It works well.</li>
    <li> Nice, lightweight cape. Plenty long in the back. The snaps are great since they make it adjustable for different neck sizes.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and expected.</li>
    <li> Some reviews reported a problem with the snaps; the one I got was fine. The length, weight of the fabric and the neck closure are all perfect for at-home haircuts that I do. Wish I had ordered it sooner!</li>
    <li> This arrived on time! I am not sure of te quality because it was a gift for my sister in law who just graduated hair school. She used it right away and was very happy, so that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
    <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose and was very inexpensive.  I just wanted a good, basic cape and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for one and this fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.....a great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Well made and comfortable to use. Drapes well fits snugly.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I was afraid this cape would be stiff &amp; plastic feeling but it is not. It is soft and pliable while still being easy to discard cut hair. The snaps are sometimes slightly hard to align but overall not a major problem. I would recommend .</li>
    <li> Great light weight snap closure cape. Very nice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my family&#x27;s hair from almost the beginning - husband and 3 sons. We used a cheery, dinosaur plastic cape that had velcro at the neck (barely closed on hubby). Eventually the plastic split near the neck, and inevitably my sons grew up, but we kept using it. Last month I decided to replace it and purchased this professional hair salon nylon cape. The snap closure is an improvement over velcro, which is impossible to clean totally. The fabric feels great. The coverage is nice - long in the front and sides and shorter in the back, with perfect coverage. The one downside is that, unlike the plastic dinosaur cape, the little hairs don&#x27;t slide off easily. I took it outside to shake them loose, but some still remained. I tossed it into the washing machine and that did the trick. The cape came out like new and hair-free. And actually, the old plastic cape still had a few hairs on it and being plastic that wouldn&#x27;t fare well in the washing machine, I never washed it. So, maybe the new cape is even better with the little hair issue. I&#x27;d give the cape a 4.5 if I could, but the little hair sticking issue keeps me from giving it a 5.</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great cape and I really like it. The material feels nice and is very similar to what they have when I get my haircut by a professional. I purchased this to cut my buddies hair and we all really like it. The snap closures are really nice. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Makes me feel like a pro!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the cape to keep my husband from having hair all over him when I give him haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfect and I am very happy with my purchase .It was fast service and you can&#x27;t ask&lt;br /&gt;anymore than that .Thank You</li>
    <li> The fabric feels light and of good quality. SO much better than a thick plasticy cape I had purchased several years ago. The buttons fit great on my husband AND my 3yo boy.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described online.</li>
    <li> Just like going to a professional except we can cut our own hair at home and the hair just slides off. Much better than a towel or old sheet:))</li>
    <li> works great and fast shipping. thanks</li>
    <li> Finally my kid let&#x27;s me cut his hair without itching like crazy. Simple, does the job, has several snip-snaps on the neck for adjusting.</li>
    <li> Works as I hoped. I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for 2 years and every time we set up I wished I had a professional cape. This cape works great. The snap closure is secure but not too tight. The hair falls to the floor for an easy sweep.</li>
    <li> Covered all my expectations!</li>
    <li> Good product! My wife is using it for haircuts at home for my son and myself. Quality? Well, it is too early to say how long it will last but the manufacturing process is spotless... Great Product!</li>
    <li> ...all over the patio or kitchen floor! Great product and fast service. Didn&#x27;t give it a 100% because a particular family member vetoed it. But what does a ten-year-old know???</li>
    <li> The cape is a little thin but still good quality. For the amount of times it is used for home hair cuts, which is what I bought it for, I am very pleased with it. The cape is a generous size with good coverage.</li>
    <li> Works great for styling and cutting. I don&#x27;t recommend for color. I am a licensed cosmetologist with Over 10 years experience. Great for small to extra large clients. I will buy again.  I do not put in dryer for long. I machine wash and tumble dry for ten minutes. No wrinkle.</li>
    <li> Definitely not the type of fabric that is necessary for a cape. This is flimsy, small, light, and not for professional use.</li>
    <li> Nice large cap, overage all around the neck</li>
    <li> This is long, but the neck adjusts small enough to fit my young kids. I have used this quite a few times so far, and love it.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected... Good product for the price but dont expect to much....</li>
    <li> Works great, light weight, has plastic snaps on the neck and is long.</li>
    <li> Very Comfortable, workable light weight. Snap closures are an added benefit. Wonderful coverage, at 6&#x27;2&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I used to use a cheap plastic cape that came with my hair buzzer, but it was loud, scratchy and didn&#x27;t keep the hair out. This one is so much better - and because it&#x27;s fully adjustable, I can use it on my 5-year-old and my 6&#x27;2 husband with great results for both. What a bargain!</li>
    <li> I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT. IT WILL DEFINITELY GET THE JOB DONE. GOOD HAIR CATCHER. I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO OTHERS</li>
    <li> For 27 years I have cut my husband&#x27;s and my children&#x27;s hair. All that time I used the plastic cape that came with the hair trimmers. Now that I have this awesome cape, with snaps and all. I feel like a pro :)</li>
    <li> Great quality product. Snap closure is very convenient even with kids</li>
    <li> The buttons don&#x27;t work and will rip the cape. I tried to make it work but had to have someone else place it on and off! Huge inconvenience!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. We have had this cape for 2 years now. Sturdy.</li>
    <li> I love the size, it drapes over my knees and I am 6&#x27;3&amp;#34;. one complaint is the way they made the collar, there are some sharp folds that can poke you in the back of the neck and is rather uncomfortable but a tissue folded over the collar fixes that issue.</li>
    <li> First cape I ever purchased. Would recomend especially if you cut hair at home, makes it a much nicer experience.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the hair salon cape I ordered it is adjustable around the neck and covers well so no one gets hair on them.</li>
    <li> Works great for hair cuts, keeps hair off person and makes cleanup easier!</li>
    <li> I use it all the time in my shop! Good quality.</li>
    <li> Really liked this cape. It fits small children&#x27;s necks and adults!!!</li>
    <li> Great material. The neck size is adjustable so it fits both my husband and my 3 year old son. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The cape arrived quickly, covers a person completely protecting clothes from hair, and has small simple snaps which close well having several notches to choose from.  Nice, simple, basic cape!</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my husbands hair for a while now to save money, and I just used this a couple days ago.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with hair clinging to it or anything.  Its nice and long and fit very well around his neck.  Works way better than just putting a towel over his shoulders.  The hair fell straight to the floor and it was easy clean up.  Thanks for a good product.</li>
    <li> For the price is good. Material is thin and it may not fit your bigger client around the neck.</li>
    <li> Much nicer then I thought it would be , for the price.&lt;br /&gt; Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described - exceeded all my expectations! It appears to be sturdy enough to use over and over.</li>
    <li> What a difference it makes to have a high quality Cape that easily adjusts to any size.  I had been using aprons or towels. The size fits even the tallest of my &amp;#34;customers&amp;#34;.  Thanks for offering such a great product!</li>
    <li> Great for cutting, applying coloring, or conditioning hair. Helps to protect clothing from falling hair, dyes, and lotions.</li>
    <li> yes i would order again very durable and looks like ill be having it for a while</li>
    <li> It is relatively cheap and serves the purpose.  The material is fine However, it is too short at the back side and does not cover well.  I have to turn it to cover the back.</li>
    <li> purchased this cape as a new chemical cape and the buttons were broken... do not recommend because it is also extremely thin</li>
    <li> Great for home hair cuts!</li>
    <li> Perfect length. Super good customer support. Go for it! (:</li>
    <li> For a home barber, it is just what we need. It won&#x27;t get much use and does the job.</li>
    <li> The material this cape is made of is so cheap. It is very thin and if hair dye or lightener were to get on it, it would probably leak through. The second I opened it I knew I regretted it. Yes it is very long, but only in the front. The back only hits the middle of my back which isn&#x27;t long enough for me to use on client&#x27;s who have long hair (for when I&#x27;m coloring hair). The snaps suck too, some of them don&#x27;t snap together and I have to use a different hole to snap. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The item was delivered quickly and I am pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this long enough to have used it twice but so far it&#x27;s much better than than the vinyl thing that I&#x27;ve used for years. It&#x27;s fabric so it breathes better but it&#x27;s still slick enough for the hair to be easily brushed off. Snaps hold it snug at the neck better than velcro and don&#x27;t gum up with hair. I can&#x27;t attest to the durability, but I see no reason why it should wear out any time soon. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product. I cannot testify to if it is professional quality but it will last quite sometime at home. It is very smooth and does not seem to have any problems with static which would cause the hair to stick to it.</li>
    <li> I color my wife&#x27;s hair regularly and this cape makes it a lot easier than our previous technique which involved the clunky use of random pieces of plastic film.</li>
    <li> Hair sticks to the cape magnetically and will not shake off.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for hair coloring at home.</li>
    <li> It is large and cover the whole body. Snaps in place and plastic seems to be durable. The only hitch is that my kid&#x27;s baby fine hair gets stuck to it. I had to vacuum the cape to get rid of the hair. That or a very good shake outside.</li>
    <li> It is just what I was wanting. I love that it fits my one year old all the way to my dad.</li>
    <li> This cape is far superior to the cheap plastic one we had before.  It was reasonably priced and shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> Having cut my family&#x27;s hair for years, I finally got a cape to use!  It is light, easy to store on a coat rack, and handy to snap around the neck. My only criticism is that I wished it was longer in back. It only extends a foot or so in back.  Otherwise, great!</li>
    <li> Great Product and great price.  Nice extra large size cape will be nice for use when cutting husband&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Same snaps on both sides, so impossible to close without utilizing a pin or sewing on your own closures.  Do not waste your money on this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> We returned this item because it was just too flimsy! It was made out of very low quality material, and I just couldn&#x27;t see our family getting the bang for the buck out of it. Returned it!</li>
    <li> The cape is as described.  The quality is very nice.  I love the size, large for more coverage.  The snaps are far better than velcro.  It fits children and adults.  Excellent customer service.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am the Hair Stylist in my Home, I give my Husband &amp; his Boys Haircut all the time. When I got this &amp;#34;Professional Hair Salon Nylon Cape w/Snap Closure&amp;#34; it was the best thing I have ever gotten for Hair Cuts!! Great for Small to Large Necks, Soft Texture &amp; Easy for clean-up afterwards!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Wish it was a little longer in the back but it&#x27;s just made that way. Snaps work fine around the neck.</li>
    <li> Professional Hair Salon Nylon Cape is of good quality and price.</li>
    <li> I trim my boys hair with the guidance of online videos, and they were going crazy with itchy hair falling on their bare skin. This cape has saved us a lot of tears. It&#x27;s pretty thin and might not hold up to frequent use, but since I use it twice every few weeks it doesn&#x27;t matter.  It&#x27;s nice and long and it adjusts nicely for their tiny necks.</li>
    <li> Cape has several snaps to adjust around the neck.  Large enough to cover the whole body when sitting down. Material is soft &amp; comfortable. The hair does not stick to it so it is easy to shake out.  I have used it for several haircuts &amp; just roll it up to store &amp; it does not wrinkle. I would highly recommend this cape.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 of these for a friend mine for her hair salon and she loves them. All the bottoms work and are made of good material</li>
    <li> The material is of good quality and I like the snap closure vs the velcro which fill up with hair after a while.</li>
    <li> I needed an extra cape for some traveling &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; and so I decided to give this a try. It functions well and the price was really good. No hesitation on buying this again if and when needed.</li>
    <li> The Item looked like of good quality. I have not used it yet. May be soon. Will update my rating after use.</li>
    <li> The cape is pretty short in the back!</li>
    <li> good price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I recommend this order to anyone. it was better than I expected to be for the price it came back quick I will order many more.</li>
    <li> The same snap pieces were sewn on both sides of the cape so it was unusable. Waste of time, had to return it.</li>
    <li> Not really sure what material this is made out of but it is very thin.  I was looking more for a plastic type cape. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used a towel, for many years, around my familes shoulders when I&#x27;ve cut their hair...too heavy, too big, won&#x27;t stay in place, etc.  I decided to look for a hair cape, at Amazon.  Oh, so many to choose from!  I decided on a nylon one with snaps  and I  found I chose the best one, for me....and my family.  We are very pleased.</li>
    <li> Received this cape in the promised time.  I have always cut my husband&#x27;s hair and was tired of using a towel to wrap around him, but could not find a cape that was both of good quality and inexpensive.  This one meets both requirements.  The quality is even good enough for a cosmetologist to use on a day-to-day basis.  Really like this product - no more \\&quot;hairy\\&quot; towels!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Just like the ones at the barber.  Multiple buttons around the neck from our 2 yr old&#x27;s neck, to uncle beefy meat head&#x27;s necks.</li>
    <li> A good product and a good price.</li>
    <li> It is very thin which would be ok, except that it arrived and when the package was opened there was a slit in it...Not cool.</li>
    <li> Works great on small kids with the way the snap enclosure is created.  Will be using it lots in the future.</li>
    <li> This is just perfect.  I have cut hair for many years and I have used several capes, most were some type of plastic.  This cape, however, is a light-weight fabric, plenty long, and the hair has no tendency what-so-ever to stick to the cape.  In one or two shakes all the hair is gone.  It is adjustable so it easily fits a very large neck and also a small child&#x27;s neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable and the quality is very nice.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This works really well. I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband &amp; sons&#x27; hair for years. My clippers came with a cheap plastic cape that wore out quickly. This cape is much nicer and washable.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet but It looks real nice.</li>
    <li> Great product. I Got it to cut my husbands and my almost 5 year old. They like it! No more itchy hair on the shoulders !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and big and looks to be sturdy yet soft enough to drape nicely. It should cover my husbands legs completely to avoid hair all over him when I cut his hair. I&#x27;ve been using an old sheet for years, but decided to buy this cape. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it the next time I cut his hair. I haven&#x27;t washed it yet, but the material suggests it should wash up nicely. A nice product.</li>
    <li> I suppose if you were sitting in a salon chair, this cape would work.  The back of it was very short; it only partially covered my back, which doesn&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re trying to color your hair at home as I was trying to do.  I somehow missed that when I looked at the photo online.</li>
    <li> Plastic gown.  Works fine.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Used it this week to cut hair and it was nice and long to protect clothes and easy to clean!  THanks!</li>
    <li> I often give haircuts to my husband(in the military) to save some money and found it annoying having to brush off hair afterwards and still find it everywhere. Had a hair cape before that came with a clipper set but the material was rather stiff and cheap like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;This cape is thin but felt sturdy and moves like a fabric instead of stiff, cheap plastic. It is comfortable, breathable,  and there are multiple snaps to get a medium male&#x27;s neck snugly. The length is decent as well as it can reach the calves of a medium/tall male. It really did feel like the cape you wear at salon&#x27;s and glad with this purchase. It makes gathering hair and cleanup so much easier.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good. but the buttons are a bit hard to get together. gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The hair salon nylon cape works as it should, was shipped quickly and the price is very reasonable!  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Cape functions well. Good price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Is as explained. Did the job!&lt;br /&gt;Understand that it is shorter in the back just like you would see at a professional hair salon. The back is usually just long enough to drape over the back of a chair.</li>
    <li> Great product. The cape is soft and comfortable for my kids to seat still.</li>
    <li> honestly for this price it is what you get but this product is very then and the snaps are difficult.</li>
    <li> Great service and product!</li>
    <li> this is exactly as pictured. i cut my boys hair. the plastic cape that comes with most clippers are so cheap and ALWAYS rip. so i decided to look for something a little more durable.  the snap closures are secure and are small enough for my boys neck ( 5 and 7yr) and you can custom for each person. i have also given my husband touch ups and it is comfortable for him as well. very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Skimpy in the back but overall works fine.</li>
    <li> The snaps will fail first.  Material deflects hair and moisture and will last.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> will work but thinner than I expected</li>
    <li> great cape it doesn&#x27;t go small enough for toddlers neck</li>
    <li> These capes are great for the price and snap on closure is the best this is my second order!</li>
    <li> Liked it i recomended this for a friend, she liked it wauwwwww....</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize hear aren&#x27;t waterproof. Not the company&#x27;s fault... Just my naivety.</li>
    <li> arrived fast and works great thanks</li>
    <li> Very good for the price. Easy to put on. Good coverage size-wise. Will recommend it to my friends. It&#x27;s a good alternative.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Great price and professional look. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and would recommend it to others. Simple packaging a plus.</li>
    <li> The back of the cape is not long enough to stay over the back of the chair. The material is very thin</li>
    <li> Super light weight, great snap closure and fits wonderfully over layered neck towels.</li>
    <li> Good quality and whole process was very easy. Arrived ahead of schedule</li>
    <li> Exactly  as described  not flimsy. .good buy for the price</li>
    <li> This does the trick. Keeps me hair free without having to hop in the shower after a shave. I also give my father a cut often so this was definitely a needed purchase. Hopefully the snaps last a long time.</li>
    <li> The cape seems nice, but when I went to use it, I realized the snaps don&#x27;t work.  The same side of the snaps is on both sides of the cape, so it won&#x27;t snap closed.  Nice concept, poor execution.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and so much more handy than anything else I tried.  If you&#x27;re doing home haircuts, I highly recommend this cape.</li>
    <li> This works perfect! From a child&#x27;s small neck to an adult&#x27;s average neck. Snapping is easy and it&#x27;s sufficiently long enough to allow hair to fall smoothly to the floor for clean up.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used this cape yet, but I really like the snap closure. The Velcro closures itch.  The material seems thinner than my old cape but like I said I haven&#x27;t used it yet to know for sure.</li>
    <li> Great job with the delivery time.  The product met my expectations.</li>
    <li> We got this in the mail quickly.  It fits around my neck perfectly and it keeps the hair off of my body.  What more can you ask for in a cape?</li>
    <li> The cape was not as thick as I&#x27;d hoped for and the snaps were a little on the flimsy side, but overall it does the job. Maybe not what I&#x27;d call \\&quot;professional quality\\&quot; but it still wasn&#x27;t a bad cape for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very excited about my new nylon cape.  The numerous snap closures make it a perfect fit for my 2 yr old all the way up to my  16 yr old.  Now my poor family won&#x27;t be itching and scratching all through their haircuts.  Yippee!!  And the hair just glides right off.  Great product for a great price.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the snap closure it easily fits everyones neck. Good material it cleans easily. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Kept the hair off nicely. Could be a little heavier duty material but if your relatively careful with it it should last a long time</li>
    <li> The capes work great! I&#x27;m happy with them!!!</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my husband and  2 son&#x27;s hair for years.  I wish I had bought one a long time ago. Now they don&#x27;t have to change after they get a hair cut.  Make sure you snap it tight, so hair can&#x27;t get passed it. They think they are being choked, but once you let go, it loosens a bit.  Now I need one, so I don&#x27;t need to change.</li>
    <li> The cape is Spot on. The length is ok and snap closure is priceless. I will be ordering another for my nephew.</li>
    <li> this is something that my wife wanted as it is longer than most capes also looks to be quite sturdy</li>
    <li> I cut my husbands and son&#x27;s hair...I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy one of these...so much easier and keeps hubby and son clean during the cut.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on, excellent coverage.  Cut hair lands on the floor, not down my neck - what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Material is almost perfect.</li>
    <li> Very nice salon cape. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> no frills, but effective!</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great cape!</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s big and sturdy.</li>
    <li> This cape was exactly what I was looking for. The adjustable neck was great for the different aged boys in my family.</li>
    <li> needs a better snap at neck.</li>
    <li> First Cape I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;m not a professional but it does it&#x27;s job well when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair. No complaint&#x27;s here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional stylist, but use this cape when cutting hair for a few friends. It&#x27;s nice because it is nylon (not cold crunchy plastic like the last one I had). Another nice feature of this cape are the snaps. My previous cape had velcro and hair clippings would get stuck in it.</li>
    <li> I really like the snaps on this cape! On it&#x27;s tightest snap, I can fit it around my [very thin] 9 year old son&#x27;s neck without much hair falling underneath. It&#x27;s heavy enough for our needs. I don&#x27;t know how waterproof it would be if used while spraying or after washing though.</li>
    <li> The cape is large and fits snugly around the neck -- just what we needed!</li>
    <li> Great price, covers well, feels okay on my sons&#x27; necks, easily adjusts to fit many sizes</li>
    <li> Perfect product at a price. Delivery was done quickly and efficiently.Very happy with the quality of item and performance too. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great, sturdy fabric- just like at the salon!</li>
    <li> Works great for my at home hair cuts I do on my two boys and husband.</li>
    <li> I love the snaps on this cape.  There is no velcro for hair to get caught in.</li>
    <li> Nice cape, very large and easily covers everything. Neck closure very secure. Hair slides right off. Haven&#x27;t tried to wash it yet but looks like it would hold up well.</li>
    <li> Breathable feel yet sturdy cape. The snaps hold tight and are durable so far. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a simple nylon cape and it&#x27;s been perfect for family haircuts. It covers my husband well at 5&#x27;9&amp;#34;/160lbs and has a line of snaps for adjusting tightness around the neck. It&#x27;s lightweight and breathable, and has held up great against lots of use! It&#x27;s easy to shake off the hair when you&#x27;re done and can be stuffed easily in any nook for storage. This isn&#x27;t waterproof and will soak up water pretty readily - similar to a traditional salon cape.</li>
    <li> Durable, professional.  Good delivery time</li>
    <li> The item arrived as scheduled and was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> the back is short (not as long as the front) so you can get some hair falling on your rear.</li>
    <li> Too bad the back is short. Stop a the back middle of the body.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, salon quality. We use it for dyeing and cutting my own hair at home.</li>
    <li> I am happy. Good product!</li>
    <li> This has made my life so much easier for cutting my kids hair at home!  Hair falls right off the surface and its comfortable for my picky kids neck w/the snaps rather than velcro.  Shipped on time and arrived as expected.  Would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Met our expectations.&lt;br /&gt;However the picture shown seems to suggest there is a sort of bag which comes with it, it fact it came without any bag</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. I use it on my 3 year old and husband. Neck collar has enough closures for a perfect fit for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fab product</li>
    <li> I love it because it keeps all my hair off my body when I get my hair cut. The snap closure works well too.</li>
    <li> Never thought I would want a cape, but glad I got it.  No more pinning cloths on my husband to cut his hair.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> easy to usa for me i like get sometime am need to chan color hand and am use tower to</li>
    <li> Bought this after a cheaper cape tore. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and adjustability of this cape. Fits nicely without choking anyone. Will need to update after a few more uses to determine durability.</li>
    <li> The only thing that could make this product better, is if it was longer in back</li>
    <li> I think it is good for home use, not for salon. It is very light weight.</li>
    <li> Only one complaint, hair gets caught a little around the neckline</li>
    <li> The nylon cape is everything we expected and are pleased wit it.</li>
    <li> I used my cape for the first time this month when dyeing my hair.  It was perfect!  The material seems sturdy, the design is great AND, even better, I can use it as my cape when I turn into a b*tch....oops, I mean witch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Simple and easy, exactly what u was looking for. Personal use at home, does what it needs to do. Excellent item</li>
    <li> This product does the job well and is an affordable price in my opinion.  The snap closures around the neck of the cape are great because I can get a nice fit around my neck or my husband&#x27;s neck with it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as nice as the ones used in salons as this one seems much more thin, however, for at home use I think it&#x27;s just right and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it during the past few months of use.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice full size nylon cape. Works great at home or where ever. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, when cutting my husband&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> Product was received in the mail.  I just used it tonight when the wife cut my hair and it worked great.  It is just like the real capes used at the hair salons.  It really kept the hair off of my clothes and body.  Would recommend and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was great product</li>
