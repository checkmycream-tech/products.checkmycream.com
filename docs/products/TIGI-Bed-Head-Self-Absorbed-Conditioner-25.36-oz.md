      <li>Best stuff ever!</li>
      <li>Excellent Conditioner</li>
      <li>It smells great too!</li>
      <li>the best of all, no frizzy afro puff.  </li>
      <li>So it turned out to be the perfect combination!!</li>
      <li>It has been 5 weeks since having my hair colored, and today my hairdressers said that my colored still looked good!</li>
      <li>They both smell great, but they do nothing for the hair.  </li>
      <li>It smells amazing too!</li>
      <li>I pumped a good 1/2 oz out into my hand to condition my shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>Fair deal.</li>
      <li>what good is conditioner without the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the shampoo and conditioner after reading the good reviews on amazon.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on a search for a good conditioner for years.  </li>
      <li>Great product love it</li>
      <li>hair looks beautiful and easy manageable, even my friends made this observation.</li>
      <li>It is amazing.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner works well and the scent is nice.</li>
      <li>I am very allergic to perfumes and I can use this without any issues - It&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>Scent is nice but not overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>Love love love it!</li>
      <li>I am still on the look-out for something better, however.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than most of the drugstore brands, but this is definitely not TIGI&#x27;s best.</li>
      <li>Love the conditioner though.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this conditioner makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite lines for hair care.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months.  </li>
      <li>I solve this by using my Suave professionals humecticant shampoo (excellent price and results) and Aussie 3 minute miracle most of the time and the nice smelling Bed Head combination a few times a week.</li>
      <li>Items both arrived as promised in fine condition.  </li>
      <li>Just fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using it, and its fine.</li>
      <li>Its nice too cause its very lightweight for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased that I was able to find this particular brand of conditioner on Amazon for the right price.  </li>
      <li>Orange-ish scent and conditions lightly.</li>
      <li>My hair smells great even the next day!</li>
      <li>Leaves hair smooth and silky, makes hair healthly.</li>
      <li>Self Absorbed does an ok job on it.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the Moisture Maniac smell in the shower and</li>
      <li>The scent is light and fades in an hour or so.     </li>
      <li>smells sooooooo good and leave my hair feeling so soft</li>
      <li>If you are like me and you decided to go au natural, with no clue of a good conditioner, this is a must try.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and leaves my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>might* play into a good product combination, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than many other less-expensive conditioners.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately no longer available in Europe!</li>
      <li>Other products, especially when used in combination with one another, seem to be able to *come close *to fulfilling my request, but I still haven&#x27;t found the perfect product (or combination).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time: I bleached my fine hair and it fried.</li>
      <li>Luckily it hadn&#x27;t leaked all over yet.  </li>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s a good purchase which will produce noticeable results with your hair from the first or second use.</li>
      <li>I used Self Absorbed</li>
      <li>Product shipped pretty quickly</li>
      <li>it absorbs right in and takes all my tangles out.</li>
      <li>If I blow dry my hair, it dries STRAIGHT!!!!!  </li>
      <li>and it was like a miracle, it made my hair soft and strong.  </li>
      <li>Bed Head needs to use a higher quality plastic bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and tried SO MANY conditioners before this and have finally found it.</li>
      <li>To my estimate, that&#x27;s about a dollar per wash which is pretty pricey.</li>
      <li>With this product my hair looks smooth and shiny after washing it and has a soft feel.</li>
      <li>After the FIRST use my hair was noticably shinier.</li>
      <li>I also put in a little chi silk infusion into my damp hair (which is a great product unto itself) and I woke up this morning with amazingly soft hair.</li>
      <li>Ok for a guy with long hair and working in Afghanistan, this product has done wonders.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised though because though I did not like this one much when smelling it straight from the bottle, I actually like its smell better than the Moisture Maniac when it is dry and blends in with my hair better.</li>
      <li>This is a delicious-smelling conditioner, and it does soften my hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that this conditioner is any more (or less) effective than any other conditioner I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
      <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t really improved much.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the pineapple smell of the Moisture maniac shampoo when I am in the shower and was suspicious of this one because I do not really like orange smells or taste.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Since using this product my hair has been prone to breakage and very frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately I still had my last bottle</li>
      <li>This product is great but the container that it comes in is easily broken.  </li>
      <li>I have long, color treated hair &amp; this conditioner not only keeps it well hydrated, but super shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
      <li>When I purchased the large bottle I bought the Shampoo and Conditioner at a decent price.  </li>
      <li>It was a lot cheaper than some of the other TIGI products I love (Oatmeal Honey &amp; Curls Rock) but still said it was a \\&quot;Mega Vitamin Conditioner.\\</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a relaxer, I decided to go natural, and a good conditioner is hard to find, because it&#x27;s limited, or most have no reviews that pertain to my hair type.  </li>
      <li>The only drawback is that I need to use a lot of the conditioner (which comes in a smaller bottle than the shampoo) - more than the bottle recommends (I have straight hair that is about 4 inches below my shoulders).</li>
      <li>Though it has not (so far) done much for the thinning of my hair, it has noticeably improved the look and feel of it</li>
      <li>fine textured hair, they weigh it down after using it for awhile and tend to make my hair feel a bit waxy.</li>
      <li>Yes, the only one that is a real conditioner!</li>
      <li>It might be too heavy for someone with fine, straight hair (mine is curly and coarse).</li>
      <li>This makes my hair feel really soft and not heavy.  </li>
      <li>It leaves no residue, unlike some conditioners make you feel like its still in your hair, but it does leave it soft.  </li>
      <li>so I transfered the conditioner to the old bottle.  </li>
      <li>A few weeks ago, I had to go out of town and bought travel size herbal essence shampoo and conditioner and was amazed at how silky and smooth my hair felt.  </li>
      <li>Thos conditioner makes my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>After several weeks of use, my hair isn&#x27;t getting any drier, so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, but not weighed down like a lot of other moisture rich conditioners.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and it is such a difference the way my hair looks when I use this one or any other ones (more or less expensive)!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>and I would say it&#x27;s Normal to Dry during the winter.</li>
      <li>It is thick and creamy and washes out clean.</li>
      <li>My hair is chronically dry, so why not try a new product.&lt;br /&gt;Initial reaction while using the product is that you get a tiny bit for 15 dollars-</li>

<li> i felt i was tricked in to ordering only half the package since I didn&#x27;t know I would not be getting the shampoo till later and wasn&#x27;t about to pay to ship it back.</li>
<li> I will say that these products tend to build up in my long (waist length) and</li>
<li> The smell lasts a long time too.</li>
<li> The second time: currently my hair reaches halfway down my back and it is just aged, lightened from the sun,and heat/chlorine damaged.</li>
<li> I have used allot of other shampoos and conditioners and only helps out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Items both arrived as promised in fine condition.  Would purchase from this weller again.  Fair deal.</li>
    <li> Great product love it</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months.  I&#x27;ve been on a search for a good conditioner for years.  I&#x27;m African American.  I don&#x27;t have a relaxer, I decided to go natural, and a good conditioner is hard to find, because it&#x27;s limited, or most have no reviews that pertain to my hair type.  I tried this just to see if it would work and boy was I amazed.  This has got to be a godsend.  It is amazing.  It detangles, it moisturizes, and........the best of all, no frizzy afro puff.  It leaves me with the nicest curls, and I can let my hair air dry like that.  If I blow dry my hair, it dries STRAIGHT!!!!!  Unbelieveable.  Now, I got this at the Target, and they wanted like $27 for this larger size bottle, so that&#x27;s why I ordered from Amazon.  I haven&#x27;t rec&#x27;d my order yet, so I guess if the bottle is a piece of crap, I&#x27;ll update my review.  If you are like me and you decided to go au natural, with no clue of a good conditioner, this is a must try.  You just have to try it.</li>
    <li> No matter what my hair has been through, this hair conditioner smooths out my hair, does not leave residue, and leaves my hair silky.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and tried SO MANY conditioners before this and have finally found it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after having my hair color-treated four times in less than six months. I started noticing my hair getting a bit thinner and wanted to do something to make it healthier. Though it has not (so far) done much for the thinning of my hair, it has noticeably improved the look and feel of it and I have only gone through a single bottle of the conditioner and accompanying shampoo. I have always had problems (even before the coloring) with my hair being flyaway and have small \\&quot;baby hairs\\&quot; that tend to stick up and make my hair look unkept and frizzy, especially after washing. With this product my hair looks smooth and shiny after washing it and has a soft feel. The only drawback is that I need to use a lot of the conditioner (which comes in a smaller bottle than the shampoo) - more than the bottle recommends (I have straight hair that is about 4 inches below my shoulders). And it&#x27;s expensive. But all in all, I think it&#x27;s a good purchase which will produce noticeable results with your hair from the first or second use.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin, but I have a lot of it.  Since using this product my hair has been prone to breakage and very frizzy.  It also feels like there is a residue still in my hair after I&#x27;ve shampooed, conditioned and rinsed thoroughly.  I&#x27;ve used a very little and a lot to see if there is a difference, and if I use a lot it seems to be a little better but that to me seems like a waste given the price.  It makes my hair so snarly.  A few weeks ago, I had to go out of town and bought travel size herbal essence shampoo and conditioner and was amazed at how silky and smooth my hair felt.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Orange-ish scent and conditions lightly. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasier than before you washed it! I hate that. Instead it de-tangles and smooths but doesn&#x27;t over moisturize or weigh your hair down. Scent is nice but not overpowering at all. I am very allergic to perfumes and I can use this without any issues - It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Ok for a guy with long hair and working in Afghanistan, this product has done wonders.  Giving the very dry conditions and the water (almost as bad as your pool water) we use here on base is probably the worse scenario you can think of. This makes my hair feel really soft and not heavy.  Can run a brush through with ease after it dries.  I have used allot of other shampoos and conditioners and only helps out.  I use this along with the Moisture Maniac Shampoo.  My hair is soo dry at times this conditioner is sucked up in my hair.  It leaves no residue, unlike some conditioners make you feel like its still in your hair, but it does leave it soft.  I can run a wide tooth comb through it when its wet and not worry to much about tangles.  This is one product I will forever buy.</li>
    <li> Nothing else smells like it!  It is the only conditioner I ever want to use.  I hope I can continue to find it on Amazon.  Love love love it!</li>
    <li> It has been 5 weeks since having my hair colored, and today my hairdressers said that my colored still looked good!</li>
    <li> This product is great but the container that it comes in is easily broken.  When it arrived it had a small crack towards the bottom of the bottle.  Luckily it hadn&#x27;t leaked all over yet.  Fortunately I still had my last bottle so I transfered the conditioner to the old bottle.  Bed Head needs to use a higher quality plastic bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Unfortunately no longer available in Europe!</li>
    <li> Smells good and leaves my hair soft.  It is thick and creamy and washes out clean. Will keep ordering. Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent Conditioner</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the Shampoo because my hair was drying out in the winter from running. It was a lot cheaper than some of the other TIGI products I love (Oatmeal Honey &amp; Curls Rock) but still said it was a \\&quot;Mega Vitamin Conditioner.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m still using it, and its fine. Just fine.  My hair hasn&#x27;t really improved much. I have fairly thin curly hair and I would say it&#x27;s Normal to Dry during the winter. It&#x27;s better than most of the drugstore brands, but this is definitely not TIGI&#x27;s best. If you have oily hair or need something lighter for the summer, this might be the shampoo for you. I don&#x27;t plan to buy this again.</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner after reading the good reviews on amazon.  These were a total disappointment.  They both smell great, but they do nothing for the hair.  My hair felt dry and brittle.  It also left my hair tangled and difficult to brush.  I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> Yes, the only one that is a real conditioner! Very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and it is such a difference the way my hair looks when I use this one or any other ones (more or less expensive)!&lt;br /&gt;The hair looks beautiful and easy manageable, even my friends made this observation. It&#x27;s a pleasure to wash my hair using this conditioner. I spent a lot of money buying expensive products and most of them went to the trash can.&lt;br /&gt;I will always recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! sorry, I can&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore!</li>
    <li> I have extra dry hair. Self Absorbed does an ok job on it. After several weeks of use, my hair isn&#x27;t getting any drier, so far. I am still on the look-out for something better, however. This one isn&#x27;t adding any more moisture to my hair, which it badly needs.     I use a couple hand-fulls of it, which seems excessive to me. I have medium thickness, shoulder-length hair.     The scent is light and fades in an hour or so.     It is heavy enough to weigh my hair down and prevent it from being fluffy and fly-away. It might be too heavy for someone with fine, straight hair (mine is curly and coarse).</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 bottles.  1 was open  and leaked all over inside packageing.  Love the conditioner though.  The conditioner works well and the scent is nice.</li>
    <li> I ran out of conditioner and purchased this product on a whim. My hair is chronically dry, so why not try a new product.&lt;br /&gt;Initial reaction while using the product is that you get a tiny bit for 15 dollars- I pumped a good 1/2 oz out into my hand to condition my shoulder length hair. To my estimate, that&#x27;s about a dollar per wash which is pretty pricey. I left it in for 10 minutes and then rinsed. I also put in a little chi silk infusion into my damp hair (which is a great product unto itself) and I woke up this morning with amazingly soft hair. It&#x27;s hard to find a product that gives results within one use.</li>
    <li> I love the way this conditioner makes my hair feel. It&#x27;s soft, but not weighed down like a lot of other moisture rich conditioners. It smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> Thos conditioner makes my hair so soft. You don&#x27;t have to leave it on for very long..it absorbs right in and takes all my tangles out. It smells great too! I will never use a different product.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner two different times when my hair was in SERIOUS need. The first time: I bleached my fine hair and it fried. I used Self Absorbed and it was like a miracle, it made my hair soft and strong.  The second time: currently my hair reaches halfway down my back and it is just aged, lightened from the sun,and heat/chlorine damaged. After the FIRST use my hair was noticably shinier. After each use it tangles less and less while using a hair dryer.My hair smells great even the next day! If I could rate this ten stars I would!!!!!</li>
    <li> smells sooooooo good and leave my hair feeling so soft</li>
    <li> This is a delicious-smelling conditioner, and it does soften my hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that this conditioner is any more (or less) effective than any other conditioner I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person with insanely dry hair, I am constantly on the search for products that will hydrate my hair, soften my hair, enhance my waves, and reduce my frizz.  That&#x27;s a tall order, but I don&#x27;t believe it is an unreasonable order.  Other products, especially when used in combination with one another, seem to be able to *come close *to fulfilling my request, but I still haven&#x27;t found the perfect product (or combination).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Bed Head Self-Absorbed Conditioner *might* play into a good product combination, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than many other less-expensive conditioners.</li>
    <li> I got this conditioner as a mistake.. I had ordered the Moisture Maniac shampoo and was wanting the conditioner to go along with it but ended up clicking this one instead.. oops! When I got it I was surprised and thought they sent me the wrong one, but my order form made me realize it was my fault. I LOVE the pineapple smell of the Moisture maniac shampoo when I am in the shower and was suspicious of this one because I do not really like orange smells or taste. I was pleasantly surprised though because though I did not like this one much when smelling it straight from the bottle, I actually like its smell better than the Moisture Maniac when it is dry and blends in with my hair better. So it turned out to be the perfect combination!! I enjoy the Moisture Maniac smell in the shower and then this conditioner when it is actually in my hair. The smell lasts a long time too. I will say that these products tend to build up in my long (waist length) and fine textured hair, they weigh it down after using it for awhile and tend to make my hair feel a bit waxy. I solve this by using my Suave professionals humecticant shampoo (excellent price and results) and Aussie 3 minute miracle most of the time and the nice smelling Bed Head combination a few times a week.</li>
    <li> This is my fav bedhead product. Leaves hair smooth and silky, makes hair healthly. Its nice too cause its very lightweight for my fine hair. Product shipped pretty quickly</li>
    <li> One of my favorite lines for hair care. I like to change my shampoo &amp; conditioner after a month or so, but I find myself using this conditioner all the time, &amp; just switching out my shampoo. I have long, color treated hair &amp; this conditioner not only keeps it well hydrated, but super shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
    <li> I was not thrilled with ordering this item.  When I purchased the large bottle I bought the Shampoo and Conditioner at a decent price.  They only had one of them in stock so I had to go out and buy the shampoo at a more expensive price.  what good is conditioner without the shampoo.  i felt i was tricked in to ordering only half the package since I didn&#x27;t know I would not be getting the shampoo till later and wasn&#x27;t about to pay to ship it back.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased that I was able to find this particular brand of conditioner on Amazon for the right price.  I had looked everywhere for this product by was not willing to pay an outrageous price for it.  Thanks Amazon.  I am a very happy customer</li>
    <li> I got two of these and the pump nozzle was broke off on one</li>
