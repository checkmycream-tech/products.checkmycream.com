      <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t too perfumey yet it smells quite pleasant.</li>

      <li>It seems to be good for the skin.</li>

      <li>Good stuff.</li>

      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been very pleased with its use, and will continue to use it and recommend it to friends for their own tattoos.</li>
      <li>First of all, it&#x27;s not scented, which is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s kind of thin/runny, but that in no way negates its moisturizing abilities.</li>
      <li>so I have no idea how this would work on its own.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for the whole family.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
      <li>This is a great lotion if you want something with no scent at all, which is exactly what we wanted.  </li>
      <li>The price made it seem like it was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>and very smooth and pleasing on my aging and embattled skin.</li>
      <li>I put it on once a day before bed after I&#x27;ve showered, and literally after about two weeks I noticed a huge improvement!</li>
      <li>I love curel.  </li>
      <li>I love to lather my skin in olive oil</li>
      <li>This lotion definitely exceeded my expectations &amp; proved to be a great value for the money!</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: We&#x27;ve had an unusual streak of sunny weather in the Seattle area and I&#x27;m happy to report I have NOT noticed any increased sun sensitivity from using the Curel.</li>
      <li>way more on than you might want.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fragrance free which is nice, doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume.</li>
      <li>The texture of this lotion is really silky and feels great on the body.  </li>
      <li>I like the way it is absorbed, and it does a good job of moisturizing and smoothing.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>First I loved the size of this bottle and the fact that it was a pump.  </li>
      <li>When I first used it I loved it.</li>
      <li>This is definitely a great skin softening lotion and this is a huge bottle and doesn&#x27;t take much effort to get the product out.</li>
      <li>For me a 5-star product would be something I just loved for many reasons, and have to keep on hand because I like it so much, regardless of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to keep in the bathroom and use post shower.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>During the summer I am mostly fine</li>
      <li>This Curel for rough skin is a very good product.</li>
      <li>It went on smoothly and soften my skin and left it feeling great and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It says fragrance free</li>
      <li>Dime-sized amounts help to blend the lotion smoothly over the skin without there being a filmy residue.</li>
      <li>I worship the sun and enjoy the glow of a summer tan,  </li>
      <li>I liked this particular brand, because the lotion didn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is prone to eczema).</li>
      <li>Very good results with this product as I need so much moisture for my skin in the winter months especially.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unscented, and goes on quickly and smoothly, without any greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>seldom remember to apply a daily moisturizer though it is more and more becoming a requirement rather than an option as I age.  </li>
      <li>I have a special spot in my heart as well as my bathroom shelf for Curel products.</li>
      <li>The Curel Rough Skin Rescue lotion is a great product.</li>
      <li>It is moderately viscous and has a fairly neutral odor.</li>
      <li>And for this price, I doubt you could buy a more effective dry skin remedy.</li>
      <li>It has kind of a greasy feel to it when you first put it on, but it rubs in completely and doesn&#x27;t leave that feeling on your skin.  </li>
      <li>I really like that it is scent free</li>
      <li>Great results after just few days.</li>
      <li>I works great of dried up feet or hands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found the Curel to be more nourishing, and with a better protective barrier; the Nivea lotion absorbed too quickly and did little to improve skin condition and promote healing.</li>
      <li>For my feet I use this right after my shower and then throw on a pair of socks for an hour or two until the lotion has soaked</li>
      <li>The consistency seems just right</li>
      <li>The pump action is easy to dispense the amount of lotion that you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its like a new layer of skin!!!</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it claims</li>
      <li>My feet are softer and so much of the cracks in my feet are gone!</li>
      <li>I use Curel&#x27;s Itch Relief formula on myself, my daughter, and my (formerly) eczema riddled son and we all love it.</li>
      <li>(In healthy individuals, cells are dying and being replaced constantly.)</li>
      <li>If feels different than most lotions I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s thicker.</li>
      <li>I tried many lotions with mixed results.</li>
      <li>have been pretty pleased with the Curel lotion over the first week of daily use.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more of this lotion and keep it on hand, literally and figuratively, for all my skin moisturizing needs.  </li>
      <li>It creates a mild protective layer between the healing skin/art and the environment, which encourages more rapid healing with minimal</li>
      <li>It is thick but spreads nicely and feels good on dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It does not have much of a scent at all, which is nice if you like to still wear perfume or other body sprays.</li>
      <li>A little thicker but better !&lt;</li>
      <li>and I see it all again when my arms are dry once more.</li>
      <li>My knees have lost that dry, almost pebbly feel and my feet look and feel tons better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is particularly good for anyone who is not used to regularly exfoliating dry areas with a brush, loofah, or pumice while bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In the summer months, I really try to make a point of \\&quot;lathering up\\&quot; since so much more of that dry skin is visible to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have dry skin that will tend to build up flakes despite a good scrubbing with a loofah, especially on my arms.</li>
      <li>lotion has been used almost exclusively during tattoo healing periods: it&#x27;s thick, and doesn&#x27;t evaporate immediately, which makes it an excellent choice for the ten days after after getting new work.</li>
      <li>It is definitely cheap enough to give it a shot if you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like using creams myself, but sometimes I just have to.  </li>
      <li>This Curel lotion works really well for me.</li>
      <li>Time will tell if they are really gone or just well glued down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really dislike that feeling.</li>
      <li>This has helped me SO much.</li>
      <li>Excellent..and very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>and this is a much cleaner way to do that.  </li>
      <li>it being a very hydrating formula to rescue your skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*It took a couple of weeks to see real improvement but it truly works.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this as an Amazon add on for $8.88 and really like it. I was looking for my regular fragrance free Curel but this was even cheaper at the time. I hate any kind of fragrance or ... This passed. A little thicker but better !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m commenting because it is now unavailable as an add on or anything from Amazon and would cost me over $27 from the Amazon site. Amazon, please bring it back ! I&#x27;ll buy a case if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keyword : Amazon Amazon bring back Curel Rough Skin Rescue</li>
    <li> Received this lotion in Allure&#x27;s beauty box and I am so impressed I will be purchasing it on Amazon from now on. It hydrates so well that you can feel the hydration 24 hours later and even after a shower. I stand on my feet for a living and this lotion has taken care of my dry foot issues and the rough areas on my heels. It is perfect for the whole family. My 5 year old loves it and so does my husband. They both requested that I continue to buy this brand.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this lotion.  I have a genetic skin condition called Ichthyosis which results in extreme dryness, scaling and flaky skin.  I have used the Curel for two weeks and my skin is the softest it&#x27;s ever been and no flaking.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if if will keep the scaling down as I had previously been using a lactic acid lotion.  I also like it&#x27;s staying power.  Most lotions need reapplying in a short time but the Curel Rough Skin Rescue lasts 24 hours at least.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for 25 years and tried everything. I was always willing to spend a lot on creams if they worked, but so few did. I had just bought a $60 cream with Argan Oil that made it worse, so I tried Rough Skin Rescue and one month later, it&#x27;s almost all healed. I have been a longtime user of Curel Ultra Healing, but Rough Skin Rescue is my new favorite. I wished I had taken before/after pictures, because it is truly amazing! This has helped me SO much.</li>
    <li> This lotion definitely exceeded my expectations &amp; proved to be a great value for the money! I&#x27;ve been using it to help treat my KP, &amp; it&#x27;s worked better than many other more expensive lotions I have tried.</li>
    <li> Use it every day. I have very dry skin and this really helps to keep it moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very good results with this product as I need so much moisture for my skin in the winter months especially.  You might want to give it a try if you have very dry skin as i do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Curel user for years, I usually stick with the Ultra healing formula and use it from head to toe. I&#x27;ve been using this formula on my body(not my face) since I feel like the olive oil addition could make me break out - I haven&#x27;t found the &amp;#34;non-comedogenic&amp;#34; statement on the bottle so I don&#x27;t want to be the guinea pig in that respect. Otherwise, I do like it. Not too heavy, though it takes a bit longer to sink in, I&#x27;m guessing due to it being a very hydrating formula to rescue your skin. Fragrance free which is nice, doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume. It does note not to go out directly into the sun due to the alpha hydroxy acid, so I&#x27;m only using it in the evening.</li>
    <li> I can’t rate this on effectiveness because I don’t like using it. The lotion does leave a layer on the skin that remains a little tacky and feels slightly gritty. In the heat of summer that is particularly unwelcome and because it takes so long to absorb/dry I am concerned about transferring the product to clothes, furniture and shoes.</li>
    <li> I have a special spot in my heart as well as my bathroom shelf for Curel products. I love the anti itch version, extremely helpful for my itchy skin. So I was eager to try Curel&#x27;s Rough Skin Rescue.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a patch of very rough skin on my left elbow for at least 6 months. It was rough to the gritty sandpaper level. I tried many lotions with mixed results. Nothing completely softened the elbow patch.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Curel Rough Skin Rescue as soon as I received it. Within 3 days, my left elbow is smooth. I mean smooth like it has never been rough at all, not just the temporary smoothness I would achieve from time to time with other products.&lt;br /&gt;If you have rough skin, you should use this product I can&#x27;t say it will soften the rough spots on you as quickly as my rough spot softened up, but it will definitely go a long way to making that skin soft and smooth again.</li>
    <li> This Curel for rough skin is a very good product. It soaks into dry skin, but leaves a protective covering behind. Because of this, I would recommend it for cold weather. It is a little uncomfortable in the warm weather. I could tell that it was softening dry patches. It is not scented. It seems to be good for the skin. And for this price, I doubt you could buy a more effective dry skin remedy. At last I feel confident that I have found the answer to my winter dry skin!</li>
    <li> This hand and body cream works.  It does exactly what it claims, it makes rough skin soft and pliable.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month with no complaints.  The fragrance is rather non-descript, a smell that is neither too feminine or too masculine which pleases my husband since he doesn&#x27;t like smelling like roses when he uses these creams.  Give this one a try if you have dry flaky skin or patches.</li>
    <li> I know that a lot of my dry skin issues are self inflicted.  I worship the sun and enjoy the glow of a summer tan,  I don&#x27;t drink enough water and I take a scalding hot shower every morning even though I know all of these things are bad for my skin. And then there&#x27;s the toll taken by the cruel and relentless march of time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seldom remember to apply a daily moisturizer though it is more and more becoming a requirement rather than an option as I age.  In the summer months, I really try to make a point of \\&quot;lathering up\\&quot; since so much more of that dry skin is visible to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pretty pleased with the Curel lotion over the first week of daily use.  It is a thick, even \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; lotion that will require quite a bit of rubbing to work it into the skin.  I suspect this is by design, as part of the exfoliating process.  My skin has a supple and healthy glow after application but there is a slight sticky/greasy feel that remains throughout the day.  I guess that is an acceptable tradeoff however, because this is the first lotion I&#x27;ve tried that actually kept the dry flakes at bay for an entire day without needing a second application.  Time will tell if they are really gone or just well glued down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin also has some rough patches from a hereditary condition, that have become quite sensitive where my bra straps hit my shoulders.  This product is specifically marketed for that condition and I have hopes that regular use will reverse that sensitivity as those dry patches are re-hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was quite surprised to see the sunburn alert on the product page!  That could be a deal breaker for me.  I&#x27;ll update my review if it turns out to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: We&#x27;ve had an unusual streak of sunny weather in the Seattle area and I&#x27;m happy to report I have NOT noticed any increased sun sensitivity from using the Curel.</li>
    <li> I switched to Curel Rough Skin Rescue from Nivea (basic lotion in the blue pump bottle). I&#x27;ve found the Curel to be more nourishing, and with a better protective barrier; the Nivea lotion absorbed too quickly and did little to improve skin condition and promote healing. It&#x27;s unscented, and goes on quickly and smoothly, without any greasy feeling. Like most lotions, it&#x27;s best used when you&#x27;ve just had a shower or washed up -- it&#x27;ll help preserve the moisture already on your skin and prevent drying and damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has been used almost exclusively during tattoo healing periods: it&#x27;s thick, and doesn&#x27;t evaporate immediately, which makes it an excellent choice for the ten days after after getting new work. It creates a mild protective layer between the healing skin/art and the environment, which encourages more rapid healing with minimal scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very pleased with its use, and will continue to use it and recommend it to friends for their own tattoos.</li>
    <li> According to my wife, she thinks the lotion works well and she is using it almost daily. She did think it had a greasy kinda of feel to it, but it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Curel Rough Skin Rescue doesn&#x27;t irritate my too-sensitive skin; it soothes the eczema and stops the peeling and flaking. I don&#x27;t have very dry skin, but there are those feet and elbows, and age is making a difference. Sometimes I need something without a fragrance or anything weird, just to help out with the roughness. I don&#x27;t know a lot about advanced ceramide therapy, but I have tried a number of lotions, and this seems to work the best. It is thick and not drippy, but it is quickly absorbed into my skin, so the touch pad on my laptop still works after a few moments. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Curel Rough Skin Rescue will help restore your patches of rough skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be sure, this is a thick and heavy product.  You apply to your skin daily and massage in.  I am not sure how, but it removes your rough skin and equally importantly moisturizers at the same time.  The pump action is easy to dispense the amount of lotion that you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bottle it says &amp;#34;Advanced Ceramide Therapy&amp;#34;.  Ceramide is a type of lipid that is very common in your skin.  It is one of the key components that keeps your skin water proof.</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  It does seem to help dry skin.  It is not greasy like Eucerin but seems to work just as well.  It is thick but spreads nicely and feels good on dry skin.  My hands (I do a lot of work outside and with bleach) have improved and are less chapped since beginning to use this.</li>
    <li> I noticed that as I&#x27;ve gotten older, if I don&#x27;t put lotion on my legs almost every day, then they tend to dry out really fast. Winter tends to be quite trying on my skin so I need lotion like this to keep my skin hydrated. I&#x27;ve used this Curel lotion for about a month now. I do notice that my skin tends to be a lot softer since I started using this lotion. Any dry patches on my legs have cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I noticed that the lotion leaves your skin feeling quite greasy. I really dislike that feeling. Even when I shower, I touch my legs together and feel the greasiness coming off my skin. That&#x27;s the big reason why I couldn&#x27;t decide if I wanted to give the lotion three stars or four. I decided on four because it does work and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so greasy. I&#x27;d recommend maybe using this at night.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion if you want something with no scent at all, which is exactly what we wanted.  The lotion is thick and leaves my skin feeling so soft.  I love it.  My husband likes the lotion as well, especially because it has no scent.  He’s been using it to help with the healing of a tattoo he recently got.  I will definitely buy more of this lotion and keep it on hand, literally and figuratively, for all my skin moisturizing needs.  A perfect product for me and mine.</li>
    <li> This is a serious, hard-working therapy for extra dry, flaky skin. It is particularly good on calloused areas such as the soles of the feet, elbows, knuckles and any other part of the body where the skin is coarse and scaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is particularly good for anyone who is not used to regularly exfoliating dry areas with a brush, loofah, or pumice while bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also recommended for psoriasis-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is an odorless thick white cream that goes on smoothly and penetrates the skin fairly quickly. Since the exfoliation comes from the ingredients in the product and not from physically rubbing with say, a brush, the effect is gradual but ultimately successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good product.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate and although I do not have severe skin issues, I do need something that can really keep my skin from looking dry and flaky.  First I loved the size of this bottle and the fact that it was a pump.  Easy to keep in the bathroom and use post shower.  Some lotions for extreme skin dryness can be hard to rub in, but this Curel was not too thick and was just as easy to rub in as other less specific skin lotions.  It has done a better job of keeping my skin from drying out than my previous suave, so I think I will stick with it.  It does not have much of a scent at all, which is nice if you like to still wear perfume or other body sprays.</li>
    <li> Awesome, I love this stuff. It is not for everyday use, feels a bit like petroleum jelly, but just a little.  I works great of dried up feet or hands. I think you should have this in addition to a regular lotion for the harder jobs. Put it in the kit you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin that will tend to build up flakes despite a good scrubbing with a loofah, especially on my arms. This Curel lotion works really well for me. Other lotions seem to stick the dry skin back down and I see it all again when my arms are dry once more. This Curel Rough Skin Rescue says it exfoliates to remove the flakes of skin and that’s what it appears to be doing on my arms. I really don’t see any of the flakes I had before I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curel Rough Skin Rescue goes on well. It is not so thick that I have to rub it a lot and not thin like the Vaseline lotions I’ve tried. It’s fragrance-free, so that’s great for anyone that doesn’t like a scent or anyone that is wearing another scent and doesn’t want to lotion to conflict. I am really happy with this Curel lotion and I plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Curel Rough Skin Rescue Lotion 4/5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is perfect for elbows or the bottoms of the feet or any other area that has dry and rough skin. Smooths and hydrates the skin. I will defintely be buying some to use during the harsh winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars</li>
    <li> Curel&#x27;s Rough Skin Rescue Lotion doesn&#x27;t disappoint. This moisturizing lotion will ensure that your skin remains moisturized. I liked this particular brand, because the lotion didn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is prone to eczema).</li>
    <li> This formulation does contain dimethicone. Dimethicone is a silicone-based polymer that forms a protective barrier to moisture loss but for some people it creates a problem when impurities are thus trapped on the skin. What Curel is promoting here are the ceramides they&#x27;ve put in. Ceramides are waxy lipid (combo of waxy and fatty substances) molecules that appear to have a role in apoptosis which is the normal process of programmed cell death. (In healthy individuals, cells are dying and being replaced constantly.) Some go so far as to call ceramides &amp;#34;tumor suppressors&amp;#34;. You can read for yourself in Wikipedia. It would appear the issue is not entirely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, the ingredient list reads like a chemistry text. But I am using this Rough Skin Rescue and although this is not the time of year when I have the worst drying/flaking problems, I can report that it is in fact free of scents (which you have to watch out for: quite a few products labelled scent-free and hypoallergenic in fact do contain these troublesome scents!) and very smooth and pleasing on my aging and embattled skin.</li>
    <li> The lotion works great.  It has kind of a greasy feel to it when you first put it on, but it rubs in completely and doesn&#x27;t leave that feeling on your skin.  I really like that it is scent free, then you can choose to use another scent if you want.  I work in a place that is &amp;#34;scent free&amp;#34; so this lotion is perfect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using it this winter - our winters are very dry with the furnace constantly running.  This will be a great lotion to use!</li>
    <li> I love curel.  I don&#x27;t really like using creams myself, but sometimes I just have to.  During the summer I am mostly fine and I apply some probably a little less than monthly to my hands.  During the winter I gotta keep up with keeping my hands and elbows moisturized or it can get bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has always worked the best for me.  When I let it go to long and my hands start to actually hurt a bit from it I can apply this stuff one day and the next day they no longer hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can&#x27;t beat curel.  Of course everyone is different so you have to try it yourself, as for me I don&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> This product revived my lower legs which had been severely dried out since last winter.  I used this daily and after about 4 days, I could see a difference.  After a week, the problem was gone. I use it 1-2x week now and have not had a recurrence.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have pretty bad dry and cracked feet. I&#x27;ve used many other lotions before but my feet would always look the same. I decided to give this lotion a try. I put it on once a day before bed after I&#x27;ve showered, and literally after about two weeks I noticed a huge improvement! My feet are softer and so much of the cracks in my feet are gone! I didn&#x27;t do anything else different to my feet than just use this lotion once a day and this stuff seriously fixed my feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the ONLY negative is that it can feel a bit greecy - but I&#x27;m not using it for the feel of the lotion, I&#x27;m using it because it fixes my feet and makes them look and feel amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend this Curel Rough Skin Rescue!</li>
    <li> Excellent..and very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Really helps with constantly dry and flaky skin! Me and my fiancee both like it and use it on a daily basis! Highly recommend it, since compared to other cheaper lotions acctualy does its job. Great results after just few days.</li>
    <li> grear stuff mix it with a little lanolin see the difference</li>
    <li> I have KP on my arms and legs and have tried expensive lotions and creams ($30+) that did not do much to get rid of it so I was skeptical about this lotion. The price made it seem like it was too good to be true. Surprisingly enough, it has made more of a difference than any other product I have tried and it is super cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a couple of things to note:&lt;br /&gt;*This stuff is thick and rich so if you don&#x27;t have dry skin, you probably want to skip it.&lt;br /&gt;*It goes further than I expected and it is easy to end up with way more on than you might want.&lt;br /&gt;*It can be a bit sticky so give it a few minutes to absorb. (This is the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars)&lt;br /&gt;*It took a couple of weeks to see real improvement but it truly works. Now I just use it to maintain my awesomely smoooooth skin. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I use a body brush in the shower and then use this immediately afterward. I have never seen results from just a brush or just a lotion so I have no idea how this would work on its own. It is definitely cheap enough to give it a shot if you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I had absolutely horrible alligator dry skin and within one application of this lotion, there was a 75% improvement. I&#x27;ve used it 3 days now and my skin has suppleness and not one sign of the dryness that has been plaguing me for a long time. I&#x27;ve used every moisturizer on the market. It had no odor, dries within 5 minutes of application and there is no stickiness at all. Its like a new layer of skin!!!</li>
    <li> First of all, it&#x27;s not scented, which is wonderful.  If feels different than most lotions I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s thicker. I like the way it is absorbed, and it does a good job of moisturizing and smoothing.  My problem area is elbows and heels, and this lotion does a good job on those.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Curel rough skin rescue claims to gently loosen flaky skin without irritation and it does contain lactic acid and botanical extracts for that function plus other ingredients to condition and protect the skin. It is moderately viscous and has a fairly neutral odor. It works quite well as an all-over lotion after bathing and does improve the feel and appearance of dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, glycerin, petrolatum, cetearyl alcohol, tapioca starch, mineral oil, ceteareth-20, dimethicone, isopropyl isostearate, lactic acid, allantoin, panthenol, Olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, octyldodecyl myristate, ethylhexyl isononanoate, hydrogenated polyisobutene, glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, isohexadecane, cetyl-PG hydroxyethyl palmitamide, behenyl alcohol, DMDM hydantoin, methylparaben, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, polysorbate 60, BHT, butylene glycol, Eucalyptus globulus leaf extract, Citrus medica limonum (lemon) juice, Citrus grandis (grapefruit) juice, Ananas sativus (pineapple) fruit juice.</li>
    <li> Curel Rough Skin Rescue works well moisturizing dry skin. It has a pleasant scent and absorbs quickly into the skin. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s kind of thin/runny, but that in no way negates its moisturizing abilities.</li>
    <li> The texture of this lotion is really silky and feels great on the body.  The consistency seems just right and I&#x27;m surprised someone hasn&#x27;t put the olive oil in the lotion before that I&#x27;ve known about.  I love to lather my skin in olive oil and this is a much cleaner way to do that.  It says fragrance free but I do notice scent when I put this on.  Also, I was a little splotchy with it...but I&#x27;m not a good test subject because I&#x27;m allergic to what seems like everything. This is definitely a great skin softening lotion and this is a huge bottle and doesn&#x27;t take much effort to get the product out.</li>
    <li> I use Curel&#x27;s Itch Relief formula on myself, my daughter, and my (formerly) eczema riddled son and we all love it. We just moved last month to a much drier climate and my feet were a dry mess, and my knees were getting really rough. This lotion works great on both of those! My knees have lost that dry, almost pebbly feel and my feet look and feel tons better. For my feet I use this right after my shower and then throw on a pair of socks for an hour or two until the lotion has soaked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does have a warning about increasing sensitivity to sun (similar to products with retinol) so I wouldn&#x27;t use it as an all over body lotion, especially in the summer, but I really like it!</li>
    <li> 3.5 stars from this user. This does what it is supposed to do. So maybe you&#x27;re thinking, then why only 3.5 stars instead of 5? For me a 5-star product would be something I just loved for many reasons, and have to keep on hand because I like it so much, regardless of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Curel product goes on rather heavy and stays that way.  Unlike other users, I noticed a stickiness from it.  It does dry up after a few minutes, but I don&#x27;t like the feeling of it when you first put it on.  I use it in rough areas only, like elbows, cuticles and heels. I don&#x27;t apply it all over my body, however,  as I prefer a lighter moisturizing lotion, especially in summertime. I do like that it is unscented, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any other scent I may be wearing, and I trust the Curel name as I have used many of their products for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for rough skin, just like it says, so if you have some rough spots that need attention, it is definitely worth a try and to you it may very well be the 5-star product you are looking for.  I appreciate having had the opportunity to try it through Amazon&#x27;s Vine program for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> The Curel Rough Skin Rescue lotion is a great product. Dime-sized amounts help to blend the lotion smoothly over the skin without there being a filmy residue. The trick is to not cake it on and to blend evenly. My skin stays moisturized and soft throughout the day. The fragrance isn&#x27;t too perfumey yet it smells quite pleasant. My skin tends to be quite dry and I&#x27;ve been please with the quality and performance of this product.</li>
    <li> When I first used it I loved it. It went on smoothly and soften my skin and left it feeling great and moisturized. But after using it for a few weeks I now have an allergic reaction to it. I broke out in a rash and it hurts so bad. So I can no longer use it. If you have sensitive skin beware. My skin is rather normal and insensitive. Wish I could have continued using it though.</li>
    <li> Perfect for winter skin. Not sticky or heavy feeling.</li>
</ol>
