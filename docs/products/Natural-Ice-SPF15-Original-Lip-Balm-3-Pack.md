      <li>Natural Ice is THE best chapstick around.</li>
      <li>The shipping rates were very reasonable, the product was shipped quickly, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>Better to use Aquaphor it that case.</li>
      <li>The shipping was more than the product whish was lip balm,</li>
      <li>Love this lip balm.</li>
      <li>So glad I</li>
      <li>Yea, it&#x27;s my wifes favorite</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find a vendor on Amazon that sells them.</li>
      <li>I love the way it protects my lips as well as how it makes them look.</li>
      <li>I love that this chapstick doesn&#x27;t have the sunblock flavor or smell that some do.</li>
      <li>Thank goodness for the internet, Amazon and this supplier for making it available to me!</li>
      <li>love product and price</li>
      <li>I only use this chapstick its the best I have tried others</li>
      <li>The cherry one is ok, but I did want to try what I had originally ordered.</li>
      <li>quick shipping too!</li>

      <li>If I feel chapped lips coming on, I apply this stuff and it is healed super quick.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Natural Ice is absolutely my favorite lip balm.</li>
      <li>my favorite lip dip, if you&#x27;ve never tried Natural Ice, I recommend trying.</li>
      <li>I tried to use it right before going in the store.  </li>
      <li>This product cannot be found in local drug stores but has been my favorite for years, making it worth the postage to order over the internet.</li>
      <li>I would have returned it, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product but the shipping charge was so out of line that you should look to whom you contract with outside your organization.</li>
      <li>I ordered the original Natural Ice, but got the Medicated Cherry one instead.</li>
      <li>I really like this product so have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I tried it as a free sample at the age of 13 and never looked back.</li>
      <li>It feels cool as mint when you first apply it on your dry lips</li>
      <li>For me, the Natural Ice (mentholatum) is more healing than other lip balms.  </li>
      <li>Once you have had lips in trouble and tried this, you will do anything to find more.</li>
      <li>When you know something works for you, it&#x27;s worth the postage if you can&#x27;t buy it locally.</li>
      <li>I wear it everyday &amp; love it.</li>
      <li>The only other place I&#x27;ve been able to find it is Walgreens, but with the SPF 15</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY lip balm that I have ever used that actually makes my lips not only feel better, but improves their texture without feeling like my lips are covered with wax.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s almost completely made of petroleum, which does not absorb, but rather sits on your lips and holds in moisture (for me</li>
      <li>I was hoping this was better, but this lip balm was extremely thick and waxy and didnt absorb on my lips.</li>
      <li>Natural Ice is my favorite chapstick and they&#x27;re increasingly hard to find OTC at any local store.  </li>
      <li>It had completely liquefied and the entire tube spilled all over my clothes.</li>
      <li>I am a little lazy and don&#x27;t spend too much time on my appearance but my lips dry up pretty fast</li>
      <li>Hard to find but totally worth the search</li>

<li> This is really hard to find in local stores around me.</li>
<li> Hands down.  </li>
<li> I have long used this product, but it has been increasingly difficult to find it in my local stores.</li>
<li> It is very hard to find a simple minty lip balm with an SPF.</li>
<li> It is medicated which gives it a soothing feel but not a strong scent.</li>
<li> As chapped lip weather is coming at us like a freight train I&#x27;d been looking for it in our small town but couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
<li> When you apply it, your lips will be ice cold for a few minutes.  </li>
<li> Seriously!</li>
<li> Never had painful chapped lips ever since I started using this.</li>

    <li> my favorite lip dip, if you&#x27;ve never tried Natural Ice, I recommend trying.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm ever.  Hands down.  Since it&#x27;s not in any of the stores in my area, I was happy to be able to purchase it online.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> Good stuff!!! Good service and delivery time. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product so have used it for years.  For me, the Natural Ice (mentholatum) is more healing than other lip balms.  As chapped lip weather is coming at us like a freight train I&#x27;d been looking for it in our small town but couldn&#x27;t find it.  When you know something works for you, it&#x27;s worth the postage if you can&#x27;t buy it locally. The shipping rates were very reasonable, the product was shipped quickly, so I&#x27;m happy.

    <li> Natural Ice is my favorite chapstick and they&#x27;re increasingly hard to find OTC at any local store.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find a vendor on Amazon that sells them.</li>
    <li> This is really hard to find in local stores around me. I love that this chapstick doesn&#x27;t have the sunblock flavor or smell that some do. Nice,  tingling feeling from the menthol. Caution: If lips are already chapped, the menthol may lend to that &amp;#34;burning feeling&amp;#34; my children describe. Better to use Aquaphor it that case.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner in original packaging.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave it in your car!  I tried to use it right before going in the store.  I was horrified when it poured all over my clothes.  I doubt it will wash out.  It had completely liquefied and the entire tube spilled all over my clothes.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years...highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Yea, it&#x27;s my wifes favorite</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! It is one of the few that does not dry my lips out! I like the original and cherry!! It doesn&#x27;t leave a yucky taste either.</li>
    <li> Good quality. It feels cool as mint when you first apply it on your dry lips</li>
    <li> I only use this chapstick its the best I have tried others but there is no comparison.  Hard to find but totally worth the search</li>
    <li> Natural Ice is absolutely my favorite lip balm. The consistency of this is different from all the other ones that are sold in stores. This one is &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; if that makes any sense, so the balm lasts longer once put on your lips.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! I am a little lazy and don&#x27;t spend too much time on my appearance but my lips dry up pretty fast and they hurt. However, this lip balm feels so good when applied, I feel motivated to keep applying it! lol. Seriously! And it works great. Never had painful chapped lips ever since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this lip balm forever .&lt;br /&gt;Love it! So glad I i googled it and you had it Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY lip balm that I have ever used that actually makes my lips not only feel better, but improves their texture without feeling like my lips are covered with wax. And I have tried every brand I could get my hands on.</li>
    <li> love product and price</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was better, but this lip balm was extremely thick and waxy and didnt absorb on my lips. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s almost completely made of petroleum, which does not absorb, but rather sits on your lips and holds in moisture (for me thats non-existant). Also the label is blurry and looks printed on so i wonder if this is legit or just a knock-off.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find a simple minty lip balm with an SPF. I wear it everyday &amp; love it. Good price too.</li>
    <li> This product cannot be found in local drug stores but has been my favorite for years, making it worth the postage to order over the internet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 18 years. I tried it as a free sample at the age of 13 and never looked back. I love the way it protects my lips as well as how it makes them look. If I feel chapped lips coming on, I apply this stuff and it is healed super quick. I cannot find it in any stores however, so I was very happy to find them here. quick shipping too!</li>
    <li> I have long used this product, but it has been increasingly difficult to find it in my local stores. Thank goodness for the internet, Amazon and this supplier for making it available to me!</li>

    <li> The best, most relieving lip balm available.  When you apply it, your lips will be ice cold for a few minutes.  Once you have had lips in trouble and tried this, you will do anything to find more.</li>
    <li> Natural Ice is THE best chapstick around. The only other place I&#x27;ve been able to find it is Walgreens, but with the SPF 15 it is a must. Great in the winter too when you have severe chapped lips.</li>
