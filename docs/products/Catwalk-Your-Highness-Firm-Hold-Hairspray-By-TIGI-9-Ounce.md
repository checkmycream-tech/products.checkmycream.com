      <li>On top of that, the smell is fantastic.</li>
      <li>The product makes your hair feel sticky doesn&#x27;t really hold that good.</li>
      <li>and I loved it so much I had to have it at home too.  </li>
      <li>Has a great smell,and a really good firm hold.</li>
      <li>which is fine</li>
      <li>It is Floral, but I don&#x27;t smell the Citrus &amp;#60;as in the description&amp;#62;, which is fine</li>
      <li>Luckily the sprayer still worked, but I won&#x27;t be able to pack it for any overnight trips with no cap.</li>
      <li>It smells like my cheap hairspray, which annoys me.</li>
      <li>Smells great and hair stays in place all day long without having to spray over and over!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just right!</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray however it was not protected very well when shipped.</li>
      <li>I expected a better hold honestly, but this does get the job done.</li>
      <li>My new favorite hairspray; holds my style all day.  </li>
      <li>this is a great product, it is a little pricy though.</li>

      <li>The hairspray does exactly what I want.  </li>
      <li>This is the only hairspray that works on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>use it daily on my fine hair and it is long-lasting as well.</li>
      <li>seems to work very well for my wife-</li>
      <li>This hairspray really does the job.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too.  </li>
      <li>It really holds my style in place even after a 5 hr bike ride with a helmet on,I just it shake it out and my hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>works really well, holds hair in place all day</li>
      <li>and I absolutely dislikes the smell.</li>
      <li>holds better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>but seriously Im not buying this again</li>
      <li>I tried a few other cheap brands but they didn&#x27;t hold well enough and didn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
      <li>Very light and heavy hold!</li>
      <li>This hairspray is great because it holds yet doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky or dirty.  </li>
      <li>makes my head itch and doesn&#x27;t hold very well also leaves white residue from the hairspray .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too firm of a hold but not so light that it doesn&#x27;t hold anything.</li>
      <li>It feels drier to the touch than normal but I can&#x27;t control my hair when it&#x27;s soft and flat like a child&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I just got a funky short new hair style and Catwalk keeps it in place.</li>
      <li>This is the first hairspray that I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
      <li>but if you put too much or you spray it very close to your head, your hair will feel hard.</li>
      <li>It is FIRM hold and does exactly as it says.</li>
      <li>And when you have fine, thin hair like me, that is not what you are looking for.  </li>

<li> Lasts a long time.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great hold. Great Smell</li>
    <li> great product.  holds better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> They sent me a can of hairspray the lid was broke in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would try to piece it back to together.  The problem was they didn&#x27;t even bother sending all the pieces.  I think they send us cans that can&#x27;t be sold in the store at regular price they charge their online customers regular price.&lt;br /&gt;We need to be treated as good as people going to the store. The product makes your hair feel sticky doesn&#x27;t really hold that good.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray! Holds your curls all day and doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily or sticky after use! Very light and heavy hold!</li>
    <li> This hairspray really does the job.Has a great smell,and a really good firm hold.Try it you&#x27;ll love it.Been using this product for over six months.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Holds even in extreme humidity.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best hairspray ever.</li>
    <li> I got this because I saw a review on youtube. It smells like my cheap hairspray, which annoys me. I like it but if you put too much or you spray it very close to your head, your hair will feel hard. And that does not happen with other sprays I have used.. I like it but seriously Im not buying this again, I think I&#x27;ll go for the L&#x27;oreal spray. Maybe even the sebastian. A girl said wonderful thing about this spray on youtube, but its just, in my opinion, a regular hairspray, nothing fancy. Nothing my hairdresser would use.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t think ill buy this again :( makes my head itch and doesn&#x27;t hold very well also leaves white residue from the hairspray . as well my bf and I absolutely dislikes the smell.</li>
    <li> One of the best products!</li>
    <li> This hairspray is great because it holds yet doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky or dirty.  The next morning I can brush my hair and it doesn&#x27;t even feel as if I have used any hairspray.  My hair stylist used it on my hair and I loved it so much I had to have it at home too.  Haven&#x27;t found it in stores here in our small town so I tried Amazon and was happy to find I could now buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray however it was not protected very well when shipped. One can was dented and the cap was broken on one of the cans. Should have been packaged better for shipping.</li>
    <li> I Love this product!! It works great in my hair. It&#x27;s half the price from the salon. I would hight recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray that works on my fine hair. Love it</li>
    <li> Holds hair well without leaving any residue.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 6 years and have not found any other hair spray that works for my hair which is long thick and wavy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Smells great and hair stays in place all day long without having to spray over and over!</li>
    <li> My favorite!  Try other products but I come back to this one.</li>
    <li> Nice hold without being sticky.</li>
    <li> This spray is very good for hold without unnecessary stiffness&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily on my fine hair and it is long-lasting as well.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good holding hair spray, which this was but it was a bit to good. It made my hair very stiff and hard feeling. I like a lot of hold but not so that my hair looks crunchy.</li>
    <li> This is the &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; hairspray for humid weather, always holds up, my hair is very straight and it works wonders..</li>
    <li> This Catwalk Firm Hold Hairspray&#x27;s fine mist is amazing! I have very fine, curly hair and need a lot of boost. This fine spray does wonders for my hair! I spray once in the morning and generally do not need to worry about my hair looking its best all day &amp; night. I&#x27;ve used it for years and hope I will be able to continue to find it.</li>
    <li> 😋  Great hold.  No smell.  Lasts a long time.  Will buy again.  Nice size for the money.  Try is today</li>
    <li> this is my favorite hairspray. i consider myself a prduct junkie. i have curly/fine hair so i am always looking for product to reduce frizz without weighing me down. this is a great product, it is a little pricy though.</li>
    <li> this hair spray will keep you looking good even in the strongest of winds and humidity, It is a bit tacky so spray from a distance,,,,</li>
    <li> unfortunately both caps were broken and there was leakage in the package; both still work so hopefully there are no more problems</li>
    <li> My new favorite hairspray; holds my style all day.  It&#x27;s stiffer than I like, when I put it on, but the stiffness soon softens.  My problem is trying to find it, without having to order it.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray,  natural yet holds perfectly</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray. It&#x27;s not too firm of a hold but not so light that it doesn&#x27;t hold anything. It&#x27;s just right!</li>
    <li> works really well, holds hair in place all day</li>
    <li> After using Catwalk Work It for years and running out, i have been looking for something different. I tried a few other cheap brands but they didn&#x27;t hold well enough and didn&#x27;t smell good. I took a chance ordering this online without having tried it, but i will definitely buy again! It holds my thin, flyaway hair. It also seems to dry it out a bit so that it&#x27;s not so flat and slippery, which I like. It feels drier to the touch than normal but I can&#x27;t control my hair when it&#x27;s soft and flat like a child&#x27;s. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hairspray. It holds well, but it is brushable.  It has a pleasant smell. It does not feel sticky in humid weather.</li>
    <li> The hairspray does exactly what I want.  I have all day hold but my hair doesn&#x27;t look stiff and fake.  This is the only hairspray I will use.</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this hairspray.  It does seem to work when I use it initially in the morning but by lunch time, its totally gone.  It will not hold your style all day.  And when you have fine, thin hair like me, that is not what you are looking for.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I expected a better hold honestly, but this does get the job done. On top of that, the smell is fantastic. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. It really holds my style in place even after a 5 hr bike ride with a helmet on,I just it shake it out and my hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I couldn&#x27;t find it at Walgreens anymore (I don&#x27;t like the mousse just the spray version), I ordered it thru Amazon.  However, when I got my order, the can was not secure within the too big box and the plastic cap broke in half. Definitely not happy about this as now I can&#x27;t take this with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> This is the hairspray I use all the time.  It smells good and works well on my hair. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s my favorite! The hold is perfect, it smells great and it really works nicely for volume!</li>
    <li> Great product, however, it is just called firm hold, not Your Highness anymore according to the vendor.</li>
    <li> The product was packed well for mailing. I  really love this product for a humid climate and a good hair spray hold.</li>
    <li> I have tried several kinds of Hairspray for hard to hold, thin hair.  This is the first hairspray that I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I love it.  Fast shipping too.  Thank you  :)</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING!! Doesn&#x27;t hold very long. It&#x27;s definitely more of a finishing spray for fly aways and it&#x27;s expensive. probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The product was not real.. It was definetly a knock off product.. It was a waste of money</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t move and I can&#x27;t fix anything after I spray. It feels stiff and unnatural and not flexible at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Smells great and the hold is wonderful!  The shampoo  and conditioner are fantastic also!  Great price too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, go-to, hairspray.  It provides the right amount of hold without making my hair sticky or immobile.  I like the smell; although not as well as some of the other sprays I use.  Still, this is a must-have product.  I gave it only one star and am providing a review simply because I was VERY disappointed in the packaging.  It was mailed in a padded manilla envelope.  The cap was broken in about 4 places - completely destroyed.  The can was also dented.  Luckily the sprayer still worked, but I won&#x27;t be able to pack it for any overnight trips with no cap. In looking through earlier reviews (after receiving my order), it appears the seller has had the same issue previously and has obviously not changed their packaging.  (Note:  the seller was Plenty Cosas)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order the product...use a different seller!</li>
    <li> I love Catwalk products so decided to give this spray a try. The first thing I noticed is the fragrance - it is Awesome! It is Floral, but I don&#x27;t smell the Citrus &amp;#60;as in the description&amp;#62;, which is fine - it smells really good. I like a spray not to smell like glue or a household cleaner, as a lot smell like that. It is FIRM hold and does exactly as it says. I really only use a firm hold when I get dressed up to go out on the town. I have extremely long curly/wavy thick hair &amp;#60;almost to my waist&amp;#62; and usually like the natural look especially when it&#x27;s curly - but when I &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair to go out &amp;#60;like flat iron it&amp;#62; - I like to hold it for a while. This held for about 4-6 hours - which is fine - i don&#x27;t usually go out for 12 plus hours! It didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or sticky, which I hate. And you could actually smell my hair and the spray, not some yukky smell. Good product - I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> seems to work very well for my wife- that&#x27;s why it seems many places are not carrying it any longer  thank heaven for Amazon!</li>
    <li> I just got a funky short new hair style and Catwalk keeps it in place.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells good (coconut).  My one complaint is that a few weeks after getting it (I only use it a few times a week), the top seemed to malfunction and it got all over my hand and started dripping down the bottle.  However, I twisted it a bit and it seems to be back to normal.  Hopefully just some dried up product blocking the opening?</li>
