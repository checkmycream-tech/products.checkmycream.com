      <li>Wonderful</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a perfect nude lip then this is the way to go.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
      <li>Very good concealer for the lip line.</li>
      <li>Otehr than the color issue, it&#x27;s not drying so if you have fair skin, try this product out!</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>This product is great</li>
      <li>However, this concealer is really great if you pat it on your lips.</li>
      <li>happy to have it but its not a must item</li>
      <li>Great packaging and cute samples to boot!!</li>
      <li>Again that may be good if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>i love the consistency of it!</li>
      <li>Awesome product, much like everything else from Etude House.</li>
      <li>Kind of mix with the lipstick;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>It was nice.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more moisturizing cover</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a really, really fabulous product!</li>
      <li>I have been waiting for a quite while to see if this product is re-stocked once more</li>
      <li>Really love it</li>
      <li>For the most part it just sits on top of the lips.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It takes way my lip color and makes the lipsticks color show more.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product and would definetely purchase it again.</li>
      <li>Drier will be better;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>So while it does work with the methods I said before I&#x27;d prefer a product that has better quality.</li>
      <li>but you know its worth it!!</li>
      <li>Goes on very smooth and is very useful to do lip gradients and work with lip stain.</li>
      <li>And make sure to work with a smooth palette (that is, no skin bits from chapping) when you put this on.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
      <li>(also maybe mix in some lip moisturizer if your lips chap easy.)</li>
      <li>It is good also as normal concealer.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturize so lip balm should be applied first because cracks/dryness in lips shows very easily.</li>
      <li>Smooth, creamy and covers blemishes and pigments on lips to allow color to blend evenly.  </li>
      <li>and this is too light for me -</li>
      <li>(and this is important, I think)</li>
      <li>The colour is perfect for my skin tone (pale but a bit yellowish).</li>
      <li>It is nice but the color is so light, it doesn&#x27;t look very natural on me.</li>
      <li>At first I was really satisfied with this lip concealer</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good item.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s really smooth and really does conceal your lips,</li>
      <li>so it works well on me, but if you have medium or darker skin, it&#x27;s definitely not gonna play as nice for you...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m someone who takes the lightest available shade in foundation consistently, and still, I thought it was much too</li>
      <li>I have a hot pink lipstick that doesn&#x27;t show up too bright by itself.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t tried this product extensively, so it&#x27;s possible I may run into some of the issues other reviewers have, but for the price I paid (2-ish dollars), this is a very good</li>
      <li>I recommend putting on some chapstick first, though</li>
      <li>It seems like it&#x27;s pretty water resistant too</li>
      <li>This gives my a much more subtle look, and it makes a cute gradient lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast, I got it 2 weeks early!  </li>
      <li>but you have to put a lip balm to moisturize your lip and keep it smooth and not dry, just apply it before you put any concealer or lip product</li>
      <li>It only comes in one color which is pretty light</li>
      <li>It works very well for this.  </li>
      <li>Really shipped from Korea;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>If you try to apply it like a lipstick way too much product will come off.</li>
      <li>would (if your lips are really flaky however that will affect it).</li>
      <li>It applies on kind of chunky and not really smooth.</li>
      <li>Normal consealors can be really drying on the lips</li>
      <li>Make sure to get EVERYWHERE on your lips, everywhere that shows on the outside when you open your mouth.</li>
      <li>Work well with decent price.</li>
      <li>Fun to play with and no complaints on seller (Etude House) as I have used them multiple times.  </li>
      <li>It works really good for me but it certainly is a little dry</li>
      <li>Most importantly for me was a concealer that actually hides my lip color since i naturally have dark red lips.</li>
      <li>It feels creamy at first but then gets pretty drying over time (fyi I have very dry lips by nature, but I do take care to moisturize my lips throughout the day).</li>
      <li>Make my hot pink lipstick color really pop out;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also can tone down a &#x27;too bright&#x27; or &#x27;harsh&#x27; color.</li>
      <li>the sad part that it&#x27;s really bright on my skintone when i apply it on my lips, but i don&#x27;t mind i will use it anyways and put the lipstick over it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>What it produced was a color nearly identical to my skin tone.</li>
      <li>natural looking concealer</li>
      <li>thick but easy to blend, I also got it with a tint sample which is like..</li>
      <li>Came in within 2 weeks, definitely fades my lips which is what I was looking for, but if you want it to be completely opaque on your lips</li>
      <li>I can barely even feel it on.</li>
      <li>I use this because my lips are such a bright natural red, it drives me crazy.</li>
      <li>Does not dry out lips --</li>
      <li>It seemed to stay on well and did not dry my lips.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Other reviewers are correct: when you first put this on, it&#x27;s incredibly pale.</li>
      <li>I bought this to give my lips a neutral base for applying lip products to get a more true color especially on nude lipsticks.  </li>
      <li>I have very naturally large, naturally red lips, so i thought if it was too pale, it wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>

<li> It is very very pale.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is nice but the color is so light, it doesn&#x27;t look very natural on me.</li>
    <li> Very good concealer for the lip line.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. A little bit dry for my lips.</li>
    <li> It was nice. I like it. Work well with decent price. Lobe using it with my tint lip stain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pale, and if you apply this thick its much darker than my skin color. However, this concealer is really great if you pat it on your lips. I use this because my lips are such a bright natural red, it drives me crazy.

    <li> This product is great I love it</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for a quite while to see if this product is re-stocked once more so i can buy it, and it did so i bought it!!&lt;br /&gt;I Really love it, it&#x27;s really smooth and really does conceal your lips, the sad part that it&#x27;s really bright on my skintone when i apply it on my lips, but i don&#x27;t mind i will use it anyways and put the lipstick over it.&lt;br /&gt;There are chances that it would dry your lips but you have to put a lip balm to moisturize your lip and keep it smooth and not dry, just apply it before you put any concealer or lip product and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> happy to have it but its not a must item</li>
    <li> Smooth, creamy and covers blemishes and pigments on lips to allow color to blend evenly.  Also can tone down a &#x27;too bright&#x27; or &#x27;harsh&#x27; color. Fun to play with and no complaints on seller (Etude House) as I have used them multiple times.  Great packaging and cute samples to boot!!</li>
    <li> I love it. It takes way my lip color and makes the lipsticks color show more. I will oder other one when I finish this ones.</li>
    <li> I have very dark violet pigment lips and pale skin which makes me look kinda dead and washed out.  I bought this to give my lips a neutral base for applying lip products to get a more true color especially on nude lipsticks.  It works very well for this.  I do not think it would work well for medium or dark skin.  It is very very pale. It seemed to stay on well and did not dry my lips.  Seemed to flake up and mix with my lipstick a bit but was workable.  I think I will use it but not something I would rave about.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and I would recommend this!  Just what I needed, works well!  Please have the time to check out these great products for the price!</li>
    <li> For the price...it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It feels creamy at first but then gets pretty drying over time (fyi I have very dry lips by nature, but I do take care to moisturize my lips throughout the day). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend reapplying this lip concealer throughout the day unless you couple it with a chapstick, lip balm, lip gloss, or some form of moisture for your lips. I only use this item if I&#x27;m going for a dramatic gradient lip with my lip tints, and then I put either balm or gloss over it for some moisture. Overall, it&#x27;s a good item.</li>
    <li> Just received it. The colour is perfect for my skin tone (pale but a bit yellowish). It&#x27;s creamy and it doesn&#x27;t crack on my lips. It is good also as normal concealer.</li>
    <li> At first I was really satisfied with this lip concealer but after a day or two it ends up looking really nasty. It still works well but just breaks off and to apply it well you need a lip brush or to dab it on with your fingers. If you try to apply it like a lipstick way too much product will come off. So while it does work with the methods I said before I&#x27;d prefer a product that has better quality.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but when I put it on, it makes my lips look dry and chapped. I was looking for a more moisturizing cover but this one made me look &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; as one of my friend told me. It applies on kind of chunky and not really smooth.</li>
    <li> Does not dry out lips -- natural looking concealer</li>
    <li> Initially I was sort of wary of this product because of some of the ratings. I have very naturally large, naturally red lips, so i thought if it was too pale, it wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers are correct: when you first put this on, it&#x27;s incredibly pale. I&#x27;m someone who takes the lightest available shade in foundation consistently, and still, I thought it was much too pale.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER (and this is important, I think) I used my finger and i smoothed it into my lips. What it produced was a color nearly identical to my skin tone. I then put on the brightest red lipstick I have, and it looked great!!!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried this product extensively, so it&#x27;s possible I may run into some of the issues other reviewers have, but for the price I paid (2-ish dollars), this is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;MY ADVICE: Rub the product into your lips for an even coating and the paleness and the mixing will go away. Make sure to get EVERYWHERE on your lips, everywhere that shows on the outside when you open your mouth. And make sure to work with a smooth palette (that is, no skin bits from chapping) when you put this on.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works out for you!</li>
    <li> This cakes very badly. Maybe my lips are just too dry for this product?</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth and is very useful to do lip gradients and work with lip stain.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I can barely even feel it on. I recommend putting on some chapstick first, though</li>
    <li> Most importantly for me was a concealer that actually hides my lip color since i naturally have dark red lips. This lip concealer did just that. For the most part it just sits on top of the lips. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize so lip balm should be applied first because cracks/dryness in lips shows very easily. It is applied like lipstick but can come off a little to thick if you apply directly so use your finger or a lip brush. if you dont touch/lick your lips often it stays on for a few hours.</li>
    <li> you need to actually buy it and ...like..OMGG~~ they are quite small but you know its worth it!! i love the consistency of it! thick but easy to blend, I also got it with a tint sample which is like..A PERFECT COUPLE &amp;#60;#</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and would definetely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a soft pink, turned out to be a weird silvery sort thing. Will not be buying again</li>
    <li> Normal consealors can be really drying on the lips but this is soooo hydrating! And a little goes a really long way! It only comes in one color which is pretty light so it works well on me, but if you have medium or darker skin, it&#x27;s definitely not gonna play as nice for you... The shipping was super fast, I got it 2 weeks early!  It&#x27;s just a really, really fabulous product!</li>
    <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;1. Really shipped from Korea;&lt;br /&gt;2. Delivered a week earlier than estimated;&lt;br /&gt;3. Make my hot pink lipstick color really pop out;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;1. Kind of mix with the lipstick;&lt;br /&gt;2. Drier will be better;</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a perfect nude lip then this is the way to go. If you&#x27;re looking for a lip stick base then this is not it.  While your lip color may adhere to this concealer it will lighten it a lot. Again that may be good if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a lipstick lightener.</li>
    <li> I have a hot pink lipstick that doesn&#x27;t show up too bright by itself. This makes it just POP. Awesome product, much like everything else from Etude House.</li>
    <li> Came in within 2 weeks, definitely fades my lips which is what I was looking for, but if you want it to be completely opaque on your lips it looks a little strange, and it doesnt look dry on your lips like concealer would (if your lips are really flaky however that will affect it). It seems like it&#x27;s pretty water resistant too which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a lip concealer for a while, and I thought I finally found one. Maybe it was my heightened expectations, but it just wasn&#x27;t the product for me. I have light-medium skin but on my lips this product just looked way too pale (bordering on white). Otehr than the color issue, it&#x27;s not drying so if you have fair skin, try this product out!</li>
    <li> I have olive skin and this is too light for me - so, I would probably not use it.</li>
    <li> not used frequently, very dry. You must apply the lip balm before use it.</li>
    <li> It works really good for me but it certainly is a little dry</li>
</ol>
