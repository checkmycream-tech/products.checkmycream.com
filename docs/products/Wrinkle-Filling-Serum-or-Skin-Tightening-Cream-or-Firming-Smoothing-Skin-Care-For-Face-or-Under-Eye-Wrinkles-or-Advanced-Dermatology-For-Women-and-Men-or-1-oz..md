<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not work for me!</li>
    <li> I got this instant wrinkle filler serum for my mom and she really loves it. It really works. It blends very well and make the skin much smoother right away. This is great if you used it under your foundation to get a flawless skin. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:cd056533ed996e4f8562d6363ff217a0]]i was a little hesitant at first about this product, I have been using it for about 2 weeks and it has help so much! Right away, my skin began to appear more youthful within days!  Great product, I felt the effects right away!</li>
    <li> I feel too young to start looking old! I am not am image obsessed person, but have always been the girl who looks great without trying. As I cherish the last few months of my 20s I am regretting every day that I chose to forgo sunscreen and loving the mirror a little less. My mother and grandmother are BEAUTIFUL, but I am hoping to fight against nature as they look their age (and I&#x27;m ready to stop looking my age). I have been using ANAITI&#x27;s instant wrinkle filling serum once to twice a day for a few weeks and I am sold. The small creases in my forehead all but disappear. The extra lines around my eyes look great 30 minutes after applying the serum and I&#x27;m convinced they are slowly starting to look better at a baseline: I look so much more awake when I first get out of bed! I have received a few general compliments about my look and secretly attribute it to Anaiti. I think I will eventually given into dermal fillers, but I&#x27;m not there yet and hopefully with Anaiti&#x27;s help I can fight it off for another decade: of course I will still supplement with Anaiti.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review but will pay full price in the future because it is worth it. I am happy I can sincerely recommend it to all of you. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Nothing changed for me after 3 months of using it day &amp; night.  Not asking much since I&#x27;m 28 and only have 3 little lines on my forehead, imagine if I was 80 yr of age !! Spent $50 for it to make my face soft &amp; hydrated. That&#x27;s about it !</li>
    <li> It does help fill the line smothly</li>
    <li> I was given a discount on this product for my honest review I have used this product for a very short time, with that being said let me note that with any and I will say again &amp;#34;With any anti Wrinkle product unless it states instant, takes time and effort on your part&amp;#34;  I did not see any instant anything with this product sorry but I only give my honest review.  I have used a lot of anti wrinkle products and yes I have used some that are instant and most that are not instant and I have come to realize that you must do your part in researching every product that you would like to try.. I did not see instant but let me add that with this product and some other products from the same line are some of my favorite and most used products.  I will state that with use and consistent use you will get the results that you are looking for it will take some people longer and some not as long.  Good luck on the never ending quest for youthfulness.....</li>
    <li> I got to try this product free for review and it really made my skin feel smoother and plumper. I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Okay, but no better than other products such as Clinique.</li>
    <li> I love Anaiti&#x27;s instant Wrinkle Filler - it&#x27;s smooth and feels luxurious on my skin. After 3 weeks I noticed a visible difference in the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth. I use this serum along with the Advanced Age-Defying Face Cream which gives me extra moisture and makes my skin feel great - it also smells beautiful. I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Instant Wrinkle Filling Serum for almsot 2 weeks now. I do see a difference when I apply it.I feel like it is disguising my lines while working at the same time to get rid of those fine lines. I have been using it twice daily. I have been using it with Anaiti&#x27;s New Instant Wrinkle Smoothing Serum. It feels good going on my eyes and I feel the tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using all their products together and it does make a difference when you use the same companies products together.  Advanced Age-Defying Serum By Anaiti | Anti-Wrinkle Skin Care Product As A Cosmetic Alternative To Botox | Anti-Aging Cream With Hyaluronic Acid,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By using their products together they seem to work together. I am very satisfied with my results so far and will continue to use all of the together. I received the Instant Wrinkle Filling Serum complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.</li>
    <li> After spending my teen years in the intense sun without sunscreen, my skin needed help. The lines and wrinkles on my forehead, the dryness, and the crow’s feet all made me look years older than my actual age. The drug and department store creams did little to affect my problem areas, and I thought the only solution would be multiple, painful, and expensive injections, peels, and lasers at a doctor’s office. That was before a friend let me borrow this instant serum. Although I was sceptical, having been disappointed by so many creams and serums before, I tried it. Well, this serum will not be returned to my friend, until I buy my own as I am 100% satisfied! After just one use, my crow’s feet were smoother and less noticeable. My forehead wrinkles relaxed and seemed to “fill” from below my skin’s surface. But, this serum isn’t just a wrinkle filler. My skin is no longer dull but rather vibrant, firmer, and youthfully plump. My dryness is gone and my skin is hydrated and smooth. Best of all, I feel like I am doing something good for my skin’s future. I am protecting it against the damage from free radicals, promoting collagen growth, and I am taking a step to prevent future wrinkles and skin issues.</li>
    <li> This serum comes in a creamy white formula that smells so fresh and clean.  When I received this product I tested it on the back of my hand so I could find out how it worked with my skin and to see if there were any visible results.  It glides over your skin easily and absorbs instantly.  I noticed immediate results in the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles.  This serum leaves your skin feeling amazingly soft and silky all day long.  I am able to use it both morning and night for clearly visible results each and every time.  I have experienced no reaction to this product with my extremely sensitive skin so I would recommend it for all skin types.  I firmly believe in paying a premium price for high quality skin care products and this is one of those items.  Pick some up today for healthier looking skin tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at no charge in exchange for my honest review**</li>
    <li> Great for moisture not great for wrinkles</li>
    <li> Bought as a filling serum a month ago. Read so many good reviews and decided to try it. No change at all. Product doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
    <li> A nice wrinkle filling serum that comes in a handy pump bottle that makes it very simple to dispense, with no mess or fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum applies to the skin very easily, with no greasy residue and absorbing well. Once applied on the wrinkled areas of skin, it feels remarkably smooth and soft with it&#x27;s added moisturising effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lines on my forehead and by my eyes, so I tend to use more serum around those areas, but also apply it to the rest of my face as a preventative measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have been using it for a few weeks, the &#x27;wrinkle-filling&#x27; effects were almost instant, with some of the finer lines being reduced straight away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, but would prefer it if it came in a larger bottle as I find I run out rather quickly, perhaps I am using too much each day?</li>
    <li> Love this. Feels like it is working....</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. Wrinkles are not reduce (even the fine ones)  and the advertise should avoid the word Botox as for no way could this be an alternative. I found that another brand that claims to also reduce wrinkles works better; nevertheless, they do not replace the heavenly effect of Botox. I will return for a whole refund.</li>
    <li> Love seeing the difference. Thanks for such an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. This serum works great and feels so good. Love the way it is lessening my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have tried many wrinkle creams, all of which have made my eyes red, itchy, and swollen. Some even cause more wrinkles! The Anaiti Instant Wrinkle Filling Serum did none of that! I have been using this product morning and night for about 2 weeks and I have already seen results! My eyes look more youthful, there are less wrinkles, and I have had no side effects from the serum. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Super-charged hydration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 months ago I received a gift - a bottle of champagne and a pack with all Anaiti products!!! I loved them all and now buying my own.&lt;br /&gt;This serum has pretty much taken care of the extreme facial dryness that has been bothering me for the past couple of years. I do like the instant &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; it gives to my laugh lines and forehead wrinkles, but it&#x27;s the hydrating effect that has really got me hooked. I know it&#x27;s probably crazy to pick an intensive wrinkle filler to try to combat the dryness, but I was pretty much at my wit&#x27;s end. Frankly, I would have paid double or triple its price for a product that provided lasting moisturizing, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available at a price that doesn&#x27;t make me cringe as I pay it. The money-back guarantee doesn&#x27;t hurt either. I&#x27;ve used the lotion for about three weeks now, and I&#x27;ve already gotten a few compliments about how bright my face looks, so that&#x27;s a bonus too. Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the instant wrinkle serum, and I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for an super-hydrating lotion or an instant wrinkle relaxer.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:f23d8efb8d6c5d40442d173f6043ccc0]] How many of us have looked in the mirror and wished there was a cream or serum that would smooth those lines away?  Instantly?  Anaiti has apparently wished that too - and they made it.  This little gem of a serum is like a miracle in your pocket - one that you can&#x27;t overuse!</li>
    <li> Product does minimize lines around the mouth somewhat.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1W6MC7PRLXTLA]]I am not getting any younger. I am a 57 year old grandfather. I hate looking old and wanted to see if this serum would help me to get rid of the lines in my face. I have used any other product in the past so this was a first for me. I didn&#x27;t tell my wife either! After only using it for a couple of days I could see a difference! My face is more taught and the fine lines are disappearing. Very easy to use too. I love it!</li>
    <li> I shop Amazon a lot but rarely write reviews but this product is so good I wanted to let you all know. I&#x27;m pretty fussy with my skin, it&#x27;s in already good shape but I did have a wrinkle that bothered me and it&#x27;s gone! I will def buy again.    I loved this product but found a better one at a lesser cost and because of this, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again..this is too expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> I am 45-years-old and my wrinkles are now a problem - I hate them. I work outside in the sun all day which makes my wrinkles worse. My children started telling me I look old so I needed to do something about it.  I&#x27;m too scared (and broke!) to get dermal injections at the doctor&#x27;s office so I was really happy when I found Instant Wrinkling Filling Serum. I can apply this product at home and can see improvements straight away. My line of work puts a lot of wear on my body and skin but with this product I can keep my face looking younger. This serum adds moisture to my face which is perfect for me since my skin is often dehydrated from being out in the sun all day.</li>
    <li> My skin was starting to lose its elasticity, with all the stress I experience from my job my skin is starting to age. Just like you I was afraid of getting dermal injections and I&#x27;m glad I found Instant Wrinkle Smoothing Serum as an alternative! This serum is a non-invasive solution to dermal injections and is completely safe to use. Not only did this product firm my skin but it made my skin softer and more hydrated within minutes after use! This product also helped even out my skin tone by reducing my pigmented spots. Unlike dermal injections, if you are not satisfied with Instant Wrinkle Smoothing Serum you are guaranteed your money back. That guarantee put my mind at ease and assured me that I had nothing to lose.+</li>
    <li> This really works and does fill in the lines. I was presently surprised as I am always skeptical of the promises skin care products give. This totally filled in the lines on my forehead.</li>
    <li> I am a woman of a &amp;#34;certain age,&amp;#34; I have always taken impeccable care of my skin. In my social circle, one can do no less. My daughter told me about her excellent experience with the Instant Wrinkle Filling Serum by ANAITI. She is nearing 40 and is afraid she is beginning to look it but I can see the difference this has had on her face the few months she has been using it&lt;br /&gt;I know that the product is said to fill in and plump wrinkles and lines. It certainly worked well for me. Within a few weeks, my skin, bare of other products or makeup, began to appear younger and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I have an important society event to attend soon and, of course, the opera season after that. I will be proud once again that I will appear in a way of which I will be proud. Thank you ever so much.</li>
    <li> I am a 50-year-old woman and I also have wrinkles from sun damage. I did not want to get dermal injections since I have a fear of needles so I decided to try Instant Wrinkling Filling Serum. This product was modeled after the serums found in dermal injections so I knew I had to try it out. This product smoothed out my face and moisturized my skin. My skin now looks healthy and youthful and I feel more confident. I really like using natural products especially when it comes to my face, so I was really happy that this product is safe and natural! Another important aspect is that this product is paraben-free and cruelty free. I know I made the right choice to try out.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6009bd16b1b5a11d3234933aa49992dc]] I&#x27;m having a great time with the Anaiti products!  I love love love the Instant Wrinkle Filling Serum--a.w.e.s.o.m.e. I don&#x27;t have a lot of deep lines, but I do have quite a few fine lines under my eyes.  I have never been very careful with the under eye skin, and then after my fourth baby was born definitely noticed an increase in fine lines. I&#x27;m in a wedding in a few weeks and really wanted to eliminate some of those fine lines.  This is my first product for this skin issue and I am so pleased with the changes I&#x27;m seeing in my skin. It has been very easy to incorporate into my daily skin regime too. I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but its definitely worth the money. A++++</li>
    <li> Works great, leave the skin soft and glowing.</li>
    <li> Smells like citrus and it gives a cooling sensation when applied. As far as results, I haven&#x27;t seen anything thus far but I don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
    <li> Just started to use, so far -  have not seen instant change. BUT - I do use with the Wrinkle Smoothing Cream, and the 1st night I&lt;br /&gt;used, woke the next morning, and my expression lines ( laugh ) were less deep.&lt;br /&gt;This is the very 1st product that has ever done that..&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I am on my 2nd day. I NEVER write about a product. I am 58 years old. I can pass for 40. I only say that so you know&lt;br /&gt;that I do take care of my skin. I have tried EVERY cream. For the $, and for the average womans budget, I really like this Anaiti Line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 40-year-old mother of two and I have started noticing my skin is getting dry and I&#x27;m starting to get a few wrinkles. With my busy schedule I don&#x27;t have time to go to the doctor&#x27;s office to get dermal injections. I recently started using Instant Wrinkle Filling Serum and my skin has never looked better! Instant Wrinkle Filling Serum returned the moisture to my skin and reduced my wrinkles. My skin looked smoother in minutes after I applied the product as per the instructions. The best part about this serum is that I can apply it whenever I find time in my busy schedule!</li>
    <li> I too am a mother in my 30s and I needed to find an option for what I could do about my wrinkles. I am always on the go and I needed something easy to use and not time consuming. Instant Wrinkle Filling Serum really works to tighten my skin and reduce my wrinkles. This product fills in all my lines and wrinkles and plumps my skin to keep my skin looking youthful. My skin is instantly moisturized when I use this product. The more I use this product the better the results get. I love that I will get maximum results with this product and my skin will continue to improve. I never thought I could get the elasticity back in my skin!</li>
    <li> I did not notice a change after using this product faithfully 2 times per day for a full 2 weeks. I am a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly all of Anaiti&#x27;s products now, and for good reason!  I was first introduced to the product line by a friend, and I was so impressed with it that I decided to try the other products as well. For years I&#x27;ve been seeing more and more fine lines turn into full-blown wrinkles.  While cosmetic surgery is always an option, I really don&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money and go through all that pain!  I&#x27;ve been using this wrinkle filling serum and it *instantly* made me look younger.  Talk about impressive results!  I can go out with confidence and people often mistake me for much younger than I am.  It has me smiling from ear to ear.</li>
