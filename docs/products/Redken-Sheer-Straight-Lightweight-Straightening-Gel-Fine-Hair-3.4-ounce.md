<li> It made my hair very stiff (even if I used a small portion) and actually made my hair MORE difficult to straighten.</li>
<li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A GOOD PERFORMER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR.  </li>
<li> Just a little needed for my chin length hair, the tube lasts a long time.</li>
<li> The product was taped around the cap and the product was half empty when I received it!</li>
<li> but when I put it on my hair it becomes dry, stiff and difficult to style either with the hair dryer and the flat iron......</li>
<li> This made it thick and stiff and actually, not straight.</li>
<li> This product lasts at least 2 days after straightening.</li>
<li> But alas you don&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Nothing bad to say at all and would recco to everyone.  </li>

    <li> I bought it because it had great reviews for thin hair but when I put it on my hair it becomes dry, stiff and difficult to style either with the hair dryer and the flat iron......I used it twice and stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I received a free full-size tube of this from the company and after trying it several times for my fine, wavy, normal/dry hair, I finally gave up. It made my hair very stiff (even if I used a small portion) and actually made my hair MORE difficult to straighten. This made it thick and stiff and actually, not straight. My end-result was lightly wavy, frizzy, and weighed down hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Try Got2b Smooth Operator, Smoothing Lustre Lotion instead. It&#x27;s lighter, smells better, works great as a straightening cream, and is much more affordable.</li>
    <li> i think this product is great. it was here early and i am very satisfied and will tell my friends about it. thanks alot again.</li>
    <li> works wonderful on gray, curly, hair</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. This gel--like balm gives a sheer weightless coating that resists frizz. Just a little needed for my chin length hair, the tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My salon did not have this product in stock so I went online. My stylist mentioned something about reorganizing Redken products, but I have finally become used to this item and don&#x27;t want to change.</li>
    <li> works perfectly for curly hair and dont have to worry abt using a hot iron regularly when u apply this. I have been using it since 2 years and never had split ends</li>
    <li> I have waivy hair (not too curly) but in humid weather it turns frizzy. This product did not do very much for my hair. I used it as suggested and did not keep my hair from becoming curly and frizzy again. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist years ago.  I have short wavey hair and it straightens the ends of my hair fairly well.  Not completely sometimes, but it is worth using.</li>
    <li> Love it, keeps me from having to flat iron out the weird spots every day. Made it feel thicker, too!</li>
    <li> Works very well! You may actually start believing you have straight, super soft hair. But alas you don&#x27;t. This product lasts at least 2 days after straightening.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my fine, thin shoulder length hair for five years. I have never found any product that comes close! Soft, straight and frizz free. No build up and a pea size dollop works for me. Does not weigh your hair down and looks great post wash day one and two.</li>
    <li> Kind of heavy. Not the same formula as years ago. The product is not as good as they previous one. I don&#x27;t know why Redken had to change the formula. They had a great product that really worked and now it is just so so.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A GOOD PERFORMER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR.  DOES NOT HOLD WELL EVEN ON RELAXED HAIR. IT IS CLEAR AND LIGHT AND HAS NO HOLDING POWER.  FORGET USING THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Great straightening product. I like the way this makes my hair feel. My hair has natural curls and when I straighten it, this straightener doesn&#x27;t hang heavy. It keeps my hair from drying out and my fingers don&#x27;t get tangled. It is a really good product.</li>
    <li> It really helps people with curly hair to control their hair....works great for me. Needs to stay on the market!!!</li>
    <li> Good product, delivered in a short time and priced well</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Nothing bad to say at all and would recco to everyone.  Great in humid temps and works for all hair</li>
    <li> Just recently purchased a second tube of this amazing stuff and that says a lot since I never rebuy any of my hair products.  Give me sleek, staight hair.  I do have to go over it with a hot iron, but I really notice a difference when I&#x27;m using it!</li>
    <li> The product was taped around the cap and the product was half empty when I received it!</li>
