      <li>The first week of use  </li>
      <li>After two months, I noticed my pores are smaller, my face skin has even tone, look radiant, rejuvenated and has a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>Pretty soon we&#x27;ll both look like 30 yr olds again.</li>
      <li>The skin did not appear hydrated and I feel as though my face was not as plumped, healthy and much younger looking.  </li>
      <li>The feel of my skin was the first real thing I noticed.</li>
      <li>Overall, an easy supplement to take.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I highly recommend this combination to anyone and wish I&#x27;d known about it sooner.</li>
      <li>My niece has no complaint about it and it seems to help with the nail growing.</li>
      <li>I ordered this products because specially at this season i always have problems with dry skin</li>

      <li>Not only is her hair growing back quickly its healthier tan ever</li>
      <li>but her nail is soft soft soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old with sun damage (brown spots), undereye pouches and discoloration, and the beginnings of jowls and chicken-neck.  </li>
      <li>first heard of this through a friend, who takes this supplements for a long time.</li>
      <li>I was using a phytoceramide from another manufacturer and decided to try this one out and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m 53, my boyfriend is several years older, he agrees that it is making a difference in his skin texture, as well.</li>
      <li>It is less dry, and the fine lines around my mouth are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised that I actually see a difference.</li>
      <li>And even within the first few days of use.</li>

    <li> I got this with the triple C facial serum and have been using them for a month now.  I&#x27;m 66 years old with sun damage (brown spots), undereye pouches and discoloration, and the beginnings of jowls and chicken-neck.  The first week of use  and my skin looked way brighter and healthier.  The second week, the undereye discoloration disappeared.  The third week the sun damage was almost gone.  This week the chicken neck is GONE!!!! and the jowls are almost unnoticeable.  In addition my skin tone and color are better than they&#x27;ve been in years and years.  Also any little boo-boo I get heals in a matter of hours instead of days like it used to.  I highly recommend this combination to anyone and wish I&#x27;d known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> Originally I tried the plant derived phytoceramides and loved it.  I tried this one for 3 months because it was a sale and I figured it works the same.  Well.., I was totally wrong and regret switching!!  I&#x27;m 47 and the difference when I switched was extremely noticeable.  The skin did not appear hydrated and I feel as though my face was not as plumped, healthy and much younger looking.  Back to my original plant derived phytoceramides.</li>
    <li> I have been taking HC Phytoceramides Capsules supplements for about 4 months now. Having suffered with eczema for years, I am pleased to say that now my skin is smooth and itch-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first heard of this through a friend, who takes this supplements for a long time. Although, I have always been interested in skin restoring supplements and had read a few articles on Phytoceramides, I was skeptical, but wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about one month of taking these capsules I started to see the difference in my skin. My skin looked suppler and smoother, less itchy. After two months, I noticed my pores are smaller, my face skin has even tone, look radiant, rejuvenated and has a healthy glow. It is less dry, and the fine lines around my mouth are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am on my 5th month. I continue to take it, 1 capsule per day. My skin is clear, itch-free, my overall complexion, not just my face, has improved greatly. I love this product and will continue to use it. I suggest hang in there, some of us just take longer for noticeable results. I do hope you read this and give this product a try. I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation purposes, my review is based on my experience with the product which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the phytoceramide capsules! I have been having troubles with dry skin and as I advance in age adding more fine lines and wrinkles in my face. These phytoceramides help the skin to retain water and look healthier and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. I appreciate that they have the exact amount of phytoceramides per capsule as Dr. Oz recommends for a days dosage, 350mg. They are also vegetable capsules which is appealing to me and reasonably priced for a months supply.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> The product arrived fast even though I used no-rush shipping, it arrived in two days. I gave this to my niece. She has pretty hair but her nail is soft soft soft. She has taken it for 3 days only. She says it is not hard to take and no weird taste. She feels her nails seem to be stronger, and she is hoping to see firmer skin as well. Overall, an easy supplement to take.&lt;br /&gt;I got this at a discount in exchange for my honest review. My niece has no complaint about it and it seems to help with the nail growing. I am giving it 5 star.</li>
    <li> I recently began taking Healthyclip Phytoceramides capsules. I must admit that I was doubtful I would see any real difference from them, but, it&#x27;s worth a shot. I was pleasantly surprised that I actually see a difference. And even within the first few days of use. I have not finished my first bottle, but, already see a great improvement in my skin. The feel of my skin was the first real thing I noticed.My skin feels soft and smooth.Almost as if I had just had a facial.I notice a nourished appearance and a healthy glow where my skin was looking a bit lack luster and very dry before. I am very excited to see how much this will help my skin over time and excited to see near immediate results already. I like taking a daily pill much better than putting on creams and serums. This is a great product and I am glad I received this product in exchange of honest opinion. I will continue to repurchase it once I finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> I was using a phytoceramide from another manufacturer and decided to try this one out and was pleasantly surprised.  It seemed that my fine wrinkles became more faint.  If you are hesitating because this company is not as well known and wasn&#x27;t the one seen on Dr. Oz don&#x27;t worry this one works better and is less expensive.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I really like when the product is received on time with no delays. I ordered this products because specially at this season i always have problems with dry skin and I heard that this product really helps. The bonus given it is super helpful because it explains in detailed how this product works and it also provide tips to protect and help your skin.</li>
    <li> Aged 67, I have been having problems with dry skin. I heard about this product, checked into it and decided to give it a try. For the first three weeks I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference, but on the fourth week I realized that my arms and legs no longer felt dry and itchy all the time. I was not having to slather on lotion constantly. I have also noticed a reduction in the depth of the crows feet around my eyes. I&#x27;ve also been getting unsolicited compliments from people! This is so simple and effective. I will definitely be staying with this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Been taking for a month.  My skin is really starting to glow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for several weeks now and I can see a difference in my skin. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using them.</li>
    <li> I do not notice any less wrinkles on my face however, I no longer have horribly chapped lips. Also, my hands and fingernails are no longer dry as a bone.</li>
    <li> I loved this supplement, I put it in my whey shake every morning. Thank You, I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> my order arrived on time and in perfect condition. I like the results very much. I am 57 and every one says I  look like I&#x27;m in my thirties. Drink a lot of water and eat well for the best results.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and service from Healthy Clip!</li>
    <li> I bought my second bottle. Must be doing something right. Bought both the phytocermides 350 mg and the advanced vitamin c serum with hyaluronic acid, to use in conjunction together. My face is softer and more evenly colored than ever before. Not sure exactly which one is doing the trick, but I plan on continuing both for at least another round. I&#x27;m 53, my boyfriend is several years older, he agrees that it is making a difference in his skin texture, as well. Pretty soon we&#x27;ll both look like 30 yr olds again. LOL</li>
    <li> I just recently found out I had celiac disease, and had been using a wheat-based Phytoceramide. I was very happy to find this product that doesn&#x27;t contain any wheat. It is giving me better results then the wheat-based product that I was previously using. Once again I&#x27;m very thankful that there is a non-wheat-based product.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this now for almost a full three weeks and have to say I already see a difference! My skin and complexion looks so much better, much more re-hydrated than before. I noticed awhile back while talking to my doctor that I do not get enough vitamins let alone A, B, C, D and E. This had everything that I was lacking and then some! I had a chance to purchase this at a discounted rate for my honest review and I can honestly say I am very impressed. I feel so much better over all. I have been multiple compliments for my face, hair, skin.. everything. I feel and look so much more youthful! Great product! I highly recommend this HealthyClip Phytoceramides Capsules.</li>
    <li> I am old to be worried about wrinkles and skin but in my opinion, these pills seem to help my face retain moisture and a less tense appearance.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> My friend just went through chemo and lost all of her hair so when I was offered this product during a promotion for my honest opinion I could not wait for it to get here so I could take it to her! Not only is her hair growing back quickly its healthier tan ever and  her nails are as well!!</li>
