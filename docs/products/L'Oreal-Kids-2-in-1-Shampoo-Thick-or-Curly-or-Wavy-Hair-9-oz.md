      <li>Other than that its perfect.</li>
      <li>THIS SHAMPOO IS REALLY THE BEST SHAMPOO I HAD EVER TRIED FOR MY GIRLS, IT LEAVES THEIR HAIR SO SOFT, AND PREVENTS</li>
      <li>Works well, fragrance is a bit too strong for me, however my kid doesn&#x27;t complain about it.</li>
      <li>It smells great and is otherwise good, but extra gentle is an overstatement.</li>
      <li>But the shampoo works just fine.</li>
      <li>My daughter has fine, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>A winning product if my 11 year old likes it, that is for sure!</li>
      <li>and they enjoy the smell.</li>
      <li>My daughter likes it, but I found it is not that cheap as compared to that from store.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also didn&#x27;t leave her hair feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>I remember when this came out when i was a kid claiming it was tear free.</li>
      <li>Clean, watermelony hair.</li>
      <li>When she was around a year old, we switched from an all-in-one baby soap/shampoo and started using this for her hair, and we were amazed at how much better her hair looked afterward!  </li>
      <li>It gives her \\&quot;curlies\\&quot; more life and definition, and is great at washing out the baby hair mousse we use to tame her hair.  </li>
      <li>His hair is so much easier to manage and so very smooth after the bath.</li>
      <li>Works okay on straight hair, Did nothing for the curly / wavy haired child.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t like the cool watermelon smell.</li>
      <li>still they smell a whole heck of a lot better then before they used it.  </li>
      <li>She loves that the bottle is &amp;#34;cool looking&amp;#34; and even at 11 does not mind that it says kids (must be the cool bottle).</li>
      <li>It smells sweet.</li>
      <li>one of the first ones was that you can&#x27;t just slap some suave shampoo on a 3-5 year old and think that you&#x27;ve done a good job.  </li>
      <li>Has a nice watermelon smell that&#x27;s not too strong and bubbles up just enough in the tub.</li>
      <li>A quick trip to the store (after screaming for 20 min about soap in the eye, and then attempting to EAT the strawberry shampooo)</li>
      <li>kids go through it so quickly.</li>
      <li>The very first time we used it we were hooked.  </li>
      <li>Great shampoo for little kids</li>
      <li>Smells good and is great for my daughters thick hair!!!</li>
      <li>The scent is very very fruity and my son loves it.  </li>
      <li>I buy this product regularly and my kids love the smell.</li>
      <li>Kids like it so much!</li>
      <li>His hair was instantly softer and more shiny.  </li>
      <li>I will more than likely not purchase this again.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and wish they sold it at my local store.</li>
      <li>Love the scent and works well on my daughters hair, just wish was in a larger size.</li>
      <li>small bottle but works good.</li>
      <li>It makes it feel soft and look so pretty!  </li>
      <li>The downside is, I find the scent to be a bit intense.</li>
      <li>She has also expressed that she really loves the smell.</li>
      <li>I wish it really smelled like watermelon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very good smell, my daughter loves it. The only problem I had is with the cover, it pops open too easy, we wasted a lot that way. But the whole bottle is so cheap, it is still very good value.</li>
    <li> It smells really good. My daughter likes it, but I found it is not that cheap as compared to that from store.</li>
    <li> My little stepstons remind me of the peanuts character - pigpen.  They are filthy, I could scrub them and put them in an all white room and they&#x27;d STILL end up filthy some how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after they moved in I had to learn a few mom things - one of the first ones was that you can&#x27;t just slap some suave shampoo on a 3-5 year old and think that you&#x27;ve done a good job.  A quick trip to the store (after screaming for 20 min about soap in the eye, and then attempting to EAT the strawberry shampooo) I grabbed 4 different bottles of kid&#x27;s shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this is the brand we stuck with, now sure, we alternate the scents to switch it up a bit, but this stuff didn&#x27;t sting little eyes, wasn&#x27;t toxic incase of \\&quot;tasting\\&quot; (I don&#x27;t recommend chugging it though) and was a combo of both shampoo AND conditioner.  This cut down my \\&quot;wrangle kids in the tub time\\&quot; by 1/3, which is huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids seem to enjoy the fruity scents, though they will never go down as my favorites... still they smell a whole heck of a lot better then before they used it.  Also the scent stays with them for the next several hours.  In the end - it gets nasty heads clean with minimal screaming and crying involved.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kids shampoo. It&#x27;s foamy and cleans their heads and bodies. It smells sweet. It doesn&#x27;t taste good. All the things you&#x27;d want in a children&#x27;s hygiene product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for my curly-haired daughter.  When she was around a year old, we switched from an all-in-one baby soap/shampoo and started using this for her hair, and we were amazed at how much better her hair looked afterward!  It gives her \\&quot;curlies\\&quot; more life and definition, and is great at washing out the baby hair mousse we use to tame her hair.  The shampoo seems tear-free (although I haven&#x27;t tested it by pouring suds directly into her eyes) and rinses out pretty well.  A few other reviewers complained about the smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I highly recommend signing up for Amazon Mom and doing a \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; for this item (and others).  This gives you a 20% discount on the purchase price, plus it shows up on your doorstep as often as you want it!  In our family, we have migrated towards using Subscribe &amp; Save for just about all of our baby items and even toiletries and cleaning supplies; the savings is nice and the automatic, recurring delivery is SO convenient.  A huge timesaver for a busy family like ours... who has time to hunt for all those little items in a big box store?</li>
    <li> We purchased this shampoo for a 2 year old with thick curly hair.  We have used baby shampoo in the past for curly hair but it seemed to dry his hair out.  The very first time we used it we were hooked.  It cleans his hair, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down &amp; doesn&#x27;t burn his little eyes when \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; gets in them.  I would defineately recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> My one year old has incredibly long curly soft hair. Johnson&#x27;s Baby shampoo for curls makes her hair frizzy and dry (adding extra conditioner weighs her hair down), regular baby shampoo makes her hair limp and dry. This is one of the few tear free shampoos for curly hair. It works wonderfully! Her hair gets clean, the curls are soft and springy, the only problem is the smell! Burst of Watermelon would be great if it smelled like Watermelon or even Watermelon Candy. It smells like the vomit of a kid who just ate a watermelon jolly rancher. The initial smell is good, but while you&#x27;re sudsing the kid&#x27;s hair the smell gets kinda nasty. If they would fix the smell this would be the best shampoo for curly haired kids!!!</li>
    <li> This is best shampoo/conditioner tear free formula I have found for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and wreck it.  It makes it feel soft and look so pretty!  Thank you L&amp;#34;Oreal!</li>
    <li> Great item&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, I love it, recommend for people buy it, light and so convinence, shipping fast and cheap, so great and save a lot of money</li>
    <li> Smells great and kiddos love it! Subscribe and save with 5 items makes it a great deal with the 15% off (used to be 20% for Amazon mom members but Amazon changed that in 11/2014 grumble grumble).</li>
    <li> My son has curly hair and it was always quite hard to get it under control.  I bought this product and love it! His hair is so much easier to manage and so very smooth after the bath. No knots at all.  And the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all!</li>
    <li> My parents used to use this shampoo on my sister and me all of the time, It&#x27;s a nice smelling shampoo..I would reccomend it</li>
    <li> My 5 year old loves this.</li>
    <li> Works okay on straight hair, Did nothing for the curly / wavy haired child.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and is great on my baby&#x27;s curls.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;oreal hair products will and forever be my go to choice for my sons hair Goodbye Johnson and Johnson I needed something that would not leave my sons curly hair looking so dry and this product not only smells good but works i highly recommend this product for other families</li>
    <li> Good soap, smells nice. Just wish it had a conditioner/detailer to help with the hair.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great and smells great</li>
    <li> Started using L&#x27;Oreal kids shampoo/conditioner after the little one outgrew Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo. The watermelon has a weird smell to me; it doesn&#x27;t smell like watermelon, but it&#x27;s not bad. The strawberry scent smells a bit better and more &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34;. The product claims &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; but it still burns my son&#x27;s eyes on occasion, so it&#x27;s not exactly tear free. I prefer this brand because I&#x27;m able to add it to my subscribe and save subscription. I won&#x27;t buy watermelon scent again. I actually have a different scent on my subscription.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working for my son with very hard hair. he loves the smell. Now his hair is like silk. highly recommended..</li>
    <li> This is a great brand of kids product. It doesn&#x27;t seem to bother either of my kids eyes and they enjoy the smell.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo for my child that has curly blond hair. This makes her hair soft and can be used everyday. This used to say for curly, wavy, or thick hair on the front but it doesn&#x27;t anymore. I was a little concerned when I received it but it seems to have the same ingredients and smells the same so I think we&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> Amazon always had what I&#x27;m looking for. My sister used to use this now we use it to bath her son. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper here them when I finally found it at wall mart.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the only shampoo my 10 year old will use. Ive tried other brands but nope. He loves it, so i love it. Whatever it takes to get him in the shower!!</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> great product, easy to use. will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and wish they sold it at my local store. I buy this product regularly and my kids love the smell.</li>
    <li> small bottle but works good.</li>
    <li> Too small for the price</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for little kids</li>
    <li> My boys and I both use this shampoo on a regular basis. Smells like candy, and no crying tears!! Yay!!!!</li>
    <li> Normally we love the smell of L&#x27;oreal kids shampoo, however this smell is horrible! It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like watermelon and the kids refuse to use it. :( I would not recommend this product to anyone, and suggest the Strawberry or Blueberry scented instead.</li>
    <li> Great Value - Super Product</li>
    <li> Smells good and is great for my daughters thick hair!!!</li>
    <li> THIS SHAMPOO IS REALLY THE BEST SHAMPOO I HAD EVER TRIED FOR MY GIRLS, IT LEAVES THEIR HAIR SO SOFT, AND PREVENTS TANGLING AND IT SMELLS SO GOOD TOO, WE REALLY LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this extra gentle. My 2-1/2 y/o still cries when it gets in her eyes and she does not with other tear free shampoos. It smells great and is otherwise good, but extra gentle is an overstatement.</li>
    <li> I remember when this came out when i was a kid claiming it was tear free. I got it and burned my eyes, i hate false marketing and it deserves one star for that reason.</li>
    <li> Even though its paraben free it still has SLS and that&#x27;s not great as its very drying for curly hair. Many SLS free alternatives on the shelves, buy those instead</li>
    <li> Expensive on here look in the store near you</li>
    <li> I have 2 little girls with curly hair and been using separate shampoos and conditioners on them. Although the products worked great, they didn&#x27;t enjoy getting their hair rinsed twice. Loreal shampoo &amp; conditioner made life a little easier and the watermelon scent wasn&#x27;t too overwhelming. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> The watermelon scent is a bit overpowering. My daughter does like the bubbles with the wash, and it does foam up well when it&#x27;s in her hair. Not the greatest shampoo I&#x27;ve used for my daughter.</li>
    <li> It smells good and I like the way my daughter&#x27;s hair feels afterwards. The downside is that it has chemicals I am trying to avoid. I will more than likely not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this shampoo! Gentle on the scalp and no more tangles! I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars though &#x27;coz the smell doesn&#x27;t last long, probably because of its mildness.</li>
    <li> the smell is amazing my daughter loves it . i dont know why im starting to see less of loreal paris kids in stores.. very sad ive gone to like 8 different stores and have a hard time finding stuff and live in a big city ...weird so ill just keep ordering her love the product my daughter has curly hair and works great to help detangle</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. We rotate between this and Aussie kids shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my toddler with fine, curly hair, and it worked fine but nothing amazing.  Then I accidentally used it on my preschooler with thick, straight hair, and I noticed a huge difference after the first use!  His hair was instantly softer and more shiny.  After a few days, his hair was so silky I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it!  Plus it smells amazing.  I highly recommend for kids with thick hair, whether curly or not.</li>
    <li> I live loreal products. The smell is really good, I also like to share it with my daughters from time to time</li>
    <li> These is a good shampoo. Works well, fragrance is a bit too strong for me, however my kid doesn&#x27;t complain about it.</li>
    <li> My kids loves this shampoo. It has a great smell and it lathers really good. My kids loving washing their hair.</li>
    <li> Me and my daughter love the smell, looks like its good for kids hair as her hair are softer and no residue. Only problem is some times we apply hair oil to my daughter&#x27;s hair before shower and that hair oil doen&#x27;t clean 100% with this shampoo.  Other than that its perfect.</li>
    <li> My son loves the way L&#x27;Oreal Kids Extra Gentle 2-in-1 Shampoo with a Burst of Watermelon smells.  I love that it is inexpensive, tear free and best of all paraben free.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a 2 in 1 body wash and shampoo for my son.  It&#x27;s not, it is a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  The scent is very very fruity and my son loves it.  I do like that it had the gentle on eyes feature.  However, within a day the flip top lid broke off with very little touch and now, so much for it going in a gym bag or on a trip.  Lid is very flimsy and not what I expected.</li>
    <li> For the price, this stuff works wonderfully. Easy to use, smells great, and leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair smelling wonderful and feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Clean, watermelony hair. Lovely. No complaints about stinging eyes from my boys.</li>
    <li> this is great for kids, no tears no tangles. they love it</li>
    <li> Love the smell! My kids enjoy it too!</li>
    <li> My kids love this at bath time.  Has a nice watermelon smell that&#x27;s not too strong and bubbles up just enough in the tub.</li>
    <li> My daughter has fine, curly hair.  I had used Johnson&#x27;s shampoo since she was born, and added Johnson&#x27;s conditioner as she got older.  However, I found her hair to be dry and only curly when it was wet or humid outside.  So, I added Johnson&#x27;s gel detangler/conditioner, which did the job of detangling, but I still found her hair to be dry.  I found this online with great reviews, so I tried it. I love it and have not used the detangler since.  Her hair is curlier and softer than ever before, and we save a step in between bath and combing!</li>
    <li> My kids like this, but I wish it had a little more suds to it.  I guess that&#x27;s why they call it extra gentle.  It may be better for kids with straight hair, but not good for kids with curly hair at all.  Not sudsy enough to clean.</li>
    <li> The product is not that bad BUT I HATE THE SMELL! I wish it really smelled like watermelon.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 2 yr old daughter. The scent is not pleasant-kinda odd cuz it&#x27;s supposed to smell like watermelon.&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t leave her hair feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the cool watermelon smell. But the shampoo works just fine. Nothing spectacular. But at least it&#x27;s gentle on eyes and different than j&amp;j</li>
    <li> My son loves it, and it does its job. No stinging eyes! The downside is, I find the scent to be a bit intense. The bathroom fills up with the smell of watermelon.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a swimmer, so she is in the pool A LOT. This is her favorite shampoo/ conditioner for after practice. She likes the smell, and it seems to do well on her hair as well (she has long, straight hair). She loves that the bottle is &amp;#34;cool looking&amp;#34; and even at 11 does not mind that it says kids (must be the cool bottle). She has also expressed that she really loves the smell. A winning product if my 11 year old likes it, that is for sure!</li>
    <li> Kids like it so much!</li>
    <li> Smelled horrible, and left hair very dry. My daughter has naturally curly hair, and it did not agree with this shampoo. I guess I will have to stick to the more expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and my daughter loved it too.</li>
    <li> It is a good shampoo and conditioner it does not dryout my toddler hair wich is wavy that&#x27;s the reason I got this one, is a winner totally recommend it for curly wavy hair it does moisturize and the smell is very pleasant</li>
    <li> Love the scent and works well on my daughters hair, just wish was in a larger size. kids go through it so quickly.</li>
