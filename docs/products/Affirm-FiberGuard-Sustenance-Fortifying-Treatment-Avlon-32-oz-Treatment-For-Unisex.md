<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is awesome. It makes your hair really soft and brings the life back into your hair.  I was having a problem with my hair breaking but my hairdresser used this product on my hair and it stop the breakage.  As a result, I ordered the product so I could use it at home.    I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the secret to using the Affirm line of relaxers.  You have to use the Sustenance Treatment. It absolutely makes all the difference in how your hair performs after a relaxer.  I love this product.  I use it as directed immediately after a relaxer and I also use it to deep condition my hair.  I absolutely love it.  It leaves my hair soft and rehydrated every time I use it.  My hair is very coarse and dry but this product just softens it and it feels like silk.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product I am a fan for life.</li>
    <li> Great product for relaxed hair!!  My hair was absolutely luscious after relaxing, and continued use as a deep conditioner has kept my hair in A+++ shape.</li>
    <li> The best thing I could do for my hair.  I never, ever felt my hair sooo soft very silky even after I got my hair done at the beauty salon!  This is my first use of any Affirm products and I&#x27;m sold. My scalp is very sensitive and my hair is coarse, damaged and dry but not color treated.  I use this after touch ups and whenever I shampoo.  I will buy Affirm products when my Mizani butter blend is gone.</li>
    <li> This product just detangles the hair beautifully. As soon as you put it on you can feel the slip. Under heat for 45 mins (could be less but I just space out when I start multitasking) and it just feels soooo soft. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this conditioner. Unlike some people, my hair cannot handle combing through it while wet, so I avoid doing so like the plague until this product. Literally, it is the only conditioner that I can use to comb straight through my hair while my hair is dripping wet (the slip is amazing). Although I wish the price was a bit lower, it is worth it and you do get a decent amount of product (32 oz). Affirm always gives helpful information about their products such as the ph level. This conditioner truly moisturizes my relaxed hair. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not the miracle product for my daughter&#x27;s natural hair. So, you may want to skip it if your natural, but totally try it if your relaxed. It&#x27;s a holy grail conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent conditioner. I will be recommending this to my stylist. It really made my hair soft after I did my relaxer.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair was dry, breaking and just overall unhealthy looking. Literally, after one use of this product my hair looked and felt healthier. I&#x27;m a product junkie but I stray away from this product for too long. Kind of costly but if your hair is damaged, this is what you need!</li>
    <li> Makes hair super soft. If hair is tangled or kinky it will work through your hair to untangle. use this product at the hair salon</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I am African-American and have relaxed hair. Finding a staple deep conditioner was a little bit hard for me. Most of the conditioners I tried from stores just seemed &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; to me... they would provide a lot of slip while on my hair but after rinsed off I don&#x27;t think they were improving the actual condition of my hair. They were more like coating it, if you know what I mean. I bought and have been using this for a while now (deep conditioning 1x a week, leave on 1-2 hours) and I see a genuine improvement in my hair&#x27;s condition. There is less breakage, more strength, and it holds on to moisture better. Even though this isn&#x27;t necessarily advertised as a moisture conditioner, it moisturizes my hair. I also like the weird texture of this stuff. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it exactly. It isn&#x27;t creamy like normal conditioners... it is very gooey, slimy, and stringy if that makes sense lol. But not in a bad way! I have tons of hair and this spreads very well throughout my hair without me having to use 1000 pumps/squirts like I do with other conditioners. Amazing product! I will use this for as long as it is in production! It is worth the price to me because the bottle is huge and a little goes a long way. I also get to stop wasting money on trying new conditioners all the time. Only this from now on! I have yet to find it in a store but I&#x27;m in L.A so it has to be in one of the millions of beauty supply stores out here.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product but, it&#x27;s a protein and needs to be deep moisturized after using this product. I would suggest you use this product sparingly in between relaxers it&#x27;s the safest way.  My hair was soft while using this product but became straw feeling after washing it out. I used a leave in conditioner afterwards which helped in combing out my hair. Please be careful people......</li>
    <li> is so good that i buy another one for my sister</li>
    <li> I use the entire Fiberguard system on my hair. I have thick 4b/4c textured hair. In between relaxers I like to use the Sustenance Treatment as a weekly deep conditioning. (I have very thirsty hair). Anyway I would recommend this product to anyone with dry, brittle, relaxed or natural hair! This is my all time favorite conditioner and I like this most over other products in the Affirm hair care line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product mainly when I am relaxing my hair. It leaves my hair detangled, soft and kinda like movie star hair, lol. I would give this product 10 stars, if I could!</li>
    <li> This product sooths the scalp and adds a layer of protection to your hair once relaxed.  I also noticed that on my hair this product acted like a detangler.  The smell of the product is also very aromatic and wonderful to smell.</li>
    <li> I first used AFFIRM Sustenance in a salon. My hair was completely dried out from coloring for several years; even though I always used moisturizers. The difference it made was like night and day. I was told I could only get this product in a salon but a little birdie whispered to look on AMAZON.com...Thank you little birdie! Seriously, try it. You will see the difference it will make. Is it pricey. Maybe for the initial investment. BUT not nearly as much as going to a salon for it and it is a big bottle and will last for quite a long time. I am not a stylist or work for the company that makes this product or for Amazon; just a very satisfied customer. THANKS Amazon.</li>
    <li> A must have in my hair care regime.</li>
    <li> I have been using Affirm FiberGuard Sustenance Fortifying Treatment for years now, and let me tell you, this is THE best thing ever! I have dry, thick, coarse relaxed hair, and this was my stylist go to treatment during those cold and very drying winters. The cold weather would cause extreme dryness which caused excessive breakage, but that is no longer a problem. My hair feels stronger, healthier, shinier and the breakage has ceased. I loved this treatment so much that I continued to use it all year around. I highly recommend this product, you will be pleased!</li>
    <li> I have a LOT of long but thin relaxed hair. It tangles when damp (sweat) or wet (swimming, etc.) no matter what I do. It can get matted if I wait to long to get a touch up. In my twenties I was still doing my own hair, traveling a lot, and trying different products. Experimenting. I wrecked my hair. It looked horrible. Towards my late twenties I was going to a lot of Dominican salons that were getting my hair really straight but it was still not growing past a certain point (maybe mid neck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I was 29, I started seeing a new African-American hairdresser who like most of my hair dressers before complained that my hair was tangled and damaged. So she started using Sustenance. I think it was a new product back then. When I tell you the difference in my hair was literally like night and day -- it was. At first I thought she was the magic, but she admitted that it was the treatment. It completely detangled my hair and made it smooth and easy to comb through. By the time I hit 30 my hair was shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am in my early forties, my hair is shiny, light, down to the middle of my back and extremely healthy. I&#x27;ve gone to 3 new hairdressers since the one when I was 29 but have always brought Sustenance with me. Every single hairdresser was AMAZED at the difference it made. Even one who argued me down that she had better (newer) products that she could use had to admit that Sustenance performed miracles for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE&lt;br /&gt;I use Sustenance about every 3 weeks. After a wash, I slather it on my hair and sit under a hooded dryer on low for about 15 minutes. After I rinse, it&#x27;s smooth, tangle-free, and ready for heat. It&#x27;s also important to use it after a relaxer (which is what it&#x27;s really made for). Again I do the same thing and sit with it for about 15 minutes under low heat. I have tried in the past to alternate use of this conditioner with others to make it last longer ( it is kind of pricey) but that didn&#x27;t work for me. This is the only conditioner that works this well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TYPES OF HAIR&lt;br /&gt;While this conditioner works phenomenally well on my hair, I can&#x27;t say that it did for my daughters who all have natural hair. I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. So my suggestion is that this works better for texturized/relaxed hair. For you -- this is definitely a product well worth the investment.r me.

    <li> Excellent product I will order again</li>
    <li> I just started using it.. It really works specialty for relax and color hair... I love it.. If anyones hair is falling out. This is great</li>
    <li> I love this product,I use it as a deep conditioning treatment,it leaves my hair vibrant and iam not kidding! If I didn&#x27;t like this product and felt it didn&#x27;t help my hair I would say it! This is truly a great great great product! And i t was shiped asap!</li>
    <li> I tried this when my sister gave me a sample.  I loved it and my hair loved it.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a staple in my hair regiment for over 8 yrs. My hair is the healthiest!  I can&#x27;t live without it! Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product has literally changed my life and my hair. The results are soft, totally manageable hair. I was natural for about a year and a half. Then I got tired of working with my thick 4c hair. It all just became a bit too much. The 8 plus hours of waiting for my hair to dry, never ever really seeing a true curl pattern...the style options..etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understand that I did enjoy seeing the true nature of my beautiful deeply coiled hair. But after a year of watching it grow out..then dealing with shrinkage..ughhh. I just simply had enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searched for the best system for my hair, mindful of the fact that I wanted something gentle and then came across the Affirm FiberGuard sensitive scalp relaxer. I&#x27;ll keep this short and just say - Relaxing was a breeze- had so much hair to relax that I enlisted the help of my wonderful husband to handle the left side of my huge head of hair. I did this because I was determined to stick to the 15 minute limit as the directions instructed. BELIEVE ME - FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS FOR YOUR HAIR TYPE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The relaxer washed out beautifully. I used the 9 piece kit sold here at Amazon..and I was left with a full head of beautifully relaxed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Affirm Fiberguard Sustenance Fortifying Conditioner - BEAUTIFUL product. It made my thick 4c hair flow and swing in the wind after my relaxing treatment. I am writing this review January 24 and I just used this yesterday as a treatment following my week of working out and sweating etc etc. I read another woman&#x27;s review and she suggested that you could use this Sustenance treatment as your follow up conditioner to washing your hair. She was right!! It turned out beautiful. Have I used the word beautiful enough ? LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and Amazon shipping of course is ...wait for it.. BEAUTIFUL!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for some time now and it works like a dream. It conditions and fortifies the hair in such a way that you don&#x27;t even need leave in conditioner afterwards. It also has a pleasant smell. Everything that I have tried from Affirm so far is awesome.</li>
    <li> Read Perm Kit directions and helpful information on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is nice not only after relaxing my hair but also as a moisturizing conditioner which is rinsed out after washing hair.</li>
    <li> never has my hair felt so smooth. this product has dramatically tamed down my frizz as well. I have relaxed hair (my natural texture is a 3c) that is also color treated. I feel like this product is getting me on the right track to healing my hair and maintaining health.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended the 5 in 1 reconstructor, and I bought this by mistake.  I was planning to return it but kept in instead and I am glad i did.  Great product line greatly recommend it, it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, but you get quality and beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> My beautician has been using this on my hair for quite sometime. I came home one after getting my hair done and just googled the product. It came up on amazon, I was sooo happy because she said you had to have a cosmetologist license to get it. This product works great and does wonders for your hair. If you have colored treated hair you would want to use this once a week to avoid shedding and breakage. It makes your hair so manageable, soft and tangle free. I can&#x27;t rave about this product enough. Im glad Amazon carries it because I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great for processed hair. This brings your hair back to life, the only conditioner my beautician used. It&#x27;s grows my hair and keep it healthy, I use it weekly.</li>
    <li> I love this product. it is a must have especially if you have tangles. I use it in the shower after all of my regular conditioner and it just rinses tangles out. I would love to use this for my deep conditioning treatment but it is so expensive! It&#x27;s worth the price so I will keep ordering it.</li>
    <li> Nice product and suited to my needs in price and quality.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> Great product! Gives the hair a healthy appearance and body. Has a wonderful smell! Would definitely purchase again.</li>
