      <li>The downside is that I had to throw it away today because it started to become sticky, and some kind of oil or something would stick and stay on your hands, almost like glue.</li>
      <li>material is really nice, it&#x27;s one of the best-made dildo&#x27;s</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>great price worth the money, try it you&#x27;ll LIKE IT!</li>
      <li>Like most say it&#x27;s quite nice that the head is semi-small</li>
      <li>IS fine after some practice!</li>
      <li>The quality is excellent and this is  not a beginner toy but certainly is one that will provide loads of fun.</li>
      <li>ITS HUGE!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried washing it (I always do after use, but I&#x27;ve tried to wash it more periodically as well.)</li>
      <li>:]</li>
      <li>and she didn&#x27;t want it in any more.</li>
      <li>Definitely got to stretch yourself before use too, but is an excellent toy.</li>
      <li>like it a lot. :)</li>
      <li>but that is from top of Dildo to tip.</li>
      <li>I guess she needs more time with it...................</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like 8 1/2 inches</li>
      <li>The texture is not porous and should be safe and not harbor bacteria.</li>
      <li>EASY TO CLEAN AND MADE OF GOOD QUALITY MATERIAL.</li>
      <li>Cole Ryder Sensafirm Penis is sensafirm, its soft but frim and it is great in the wall or on the edge of the tub holds on pretty good.</li>
      <li>Good size if your partner likes them large, but not monstrous.  </li>
      <li>The Cole Ryder dildo had a semi potent sent but no ooze, honestly I can&#x27;t complain I was pretty</li>
      <li>I will recommand using it w/ condom so that it goes more smoothly</li>
      <li>It also has a slightly strong smell.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s going to be fine after some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s huge..</li>
      <li>This guy is huge.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It was a free shipment.</li>
      <li>over all really great, just bit too big...</li>
      <li>BUT IT CAN SURE BRING YOU LOTS OF PLEASURE IN THE RIGHT PLACES.</li>
      <li>She does have very powerful orgasms when it is in her.</li>
      <li>Many people who have bought dildos say that they tend to have a very prominent scent that last forever or has an oozy slimy coating.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not as soft as I would have liked for it to be.</li>
      <li>but I am sure it will take a while and a lot of lube to take the whole thing in.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always liked the look of a nice thicker-head, so I didn&#x27;t like the more narrow look of this one, but you really need it for the girth on this dildo.</li>
      <li>Luckily there were none.</li>
      <li>In my personal opinion its potential insert-able size is perfect!</li>
      <li>Haha let me just say the pic on here does this toy NO justice!!</li>
      <li>You certainly have a feeling that you have been filled when this thing is inside you.</li>
      <li>The only problem is the odor, because it made of some kind of plastic, but the odor will wane over time.</li>
      <li>next purchase just might be some of the nice toys</li>
      <li>The material was soft, but not too soft, and I loved the texture.</li>
      <li>Nice and big and FAT</li>
      <li>I read the reviews, looked at the item, but when it was delivered to my door, it came in a large box!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re new to this kind of thing and are looking for some back yard fun I would pass on this baby</li>
      <li>Okay, I just got this and tried it last night.</li>
      <li>First thing...</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>This was evidenced by the top paper-layer of the cardboard being torn off where the tape used to be prior to being opened.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure you use lube with this giant piece.</li>
      <li>i love my man big!</li>
      <li>we have had lots of fun with this toy, it definitely stretches me to the limit but it feels so good, especially after i&#x27;ve already had penetration with my partner to loosen me up</li>
      <li>(don&#x27;t forget the lube though!) ;)</li>
      <li>ho is interested in additional toys for women...</li>
      <li>;) Still wish it was softer.</li>
      <li>but the jewels are pretty hard!!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Great product craftsmanship material is realistic life like to the touch  and does not have hardly any rubber smell like others do..</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was surprising, not sure why,</li>
      <li>:) I recommend it highly, especially if you are a couple looking for new toys.</li>
      <li>Mmmm,the suckin cup is very stable.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This toy is very well made.  </li>
      <li>Looks and feels like the real deal.</li>
      <li>Very chemically.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And if it turns out to be too much for you, ladies and gents... you can always use it as your bedside bat for midnight break-ins.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very beneficial for introduction and acclimation.</li>
      <li>My thought to those people is that you&#x27;re not buying the real thing, if it were a real man and his goods were covered in goo</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my girlfriend. It looked pretty big on line but when it arrived, WHOA. This guy is huge. She hasn&#x27;t used it yet but I am sure it will take a while and a lot of lube to take the whole thing in. I am looking forward to seeing her in action with this massive tool..... Well, she used it and thought it was a little too big. The girth was causing pain and she didn&#x27;t want it in any more. I guess she needs more time with it...................</li>
    <li> Cole Ryder Sensafirm Penis is sensafirm, its soft but frim and it is great in the wall or on the edge of the tub holds on pretty good. great price worth the money, try it you&#x27;ll LIKE IT!</li>
    <li> The product came in on time. It was a free shipment. My girlfriend loved it. We use it on occasion. The only problem is the odor, because it made of some kind of plastic, but the odor will wane over time. Generally the penis looks very real.</li>
    <li> THIS ONE IS FOR THE MORE EXPERIENCED TOY USER. THE TOOL IS THICK BUT IT CAN SURE BRING YOU LOTS OF PLEASURE IN THE RIGHT PLACES. EASY TO CLEAN AND MADE OF GOOD QUALITY MATERIAL.</li>
    <li> I cannot wait to try this bad boy! i love my man big! so this is my 1st sex toy :] ill write another review after i ride it for awhile!!!</li>
    <li> Omgg I just got this in today! Its so much bigger than the picture.   I love it!</li>
    <li> mmmm, i have to say the quality is really good..., i like the coloring and the feeling of it.  It is actually pretty bigg, i mean seriously,, pretty big, it take me A WHILE to put half of it in my rear end.  But when i finally succeeded, it feels really \\&quot;fulfilled\\&quot;, which is a feeling that i like. But my rear hurt a little bit due to the expansion lol, not too bad tho, recovered w/in one day. Mmmm,the suckin cup is very stable. over all really great, just bit too big... it&#x27; a little bit hard too, but doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  I will recommand using it w/ condom so that it goes more smoothly lol. like it a lot. :)</li>
    <li> Good size if your partner likes them large, but not monstrous.  Interesting composition, still a little firmer than a real penis, the head especially.</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price. It is firm but bendable and is soft to the touch. Wife says it is a little firmer than a real one. Like other reviews have said head is less thick than rest of Dildo and allows for easier entry. My wifes eyes expressed surprise and said it is so big it looks a little scary before we tried it for the first time. 6.5\\&quot; girth in the center and almost 7\\&quot; at the base. Description said 8\\&quot; long but that is from top of Dildo to tip. Insertable lenght is about 6.5\\&quot;. I was expecting it to be an inch or so longer. Does not really seem to be an issue as the wife could only take about 4\\&quot; the first time and after a few tries has managed to take a little more than 5\\&quot; in her. It is so thick she has to leave it in her for a few minutes with very limited motion for her to get accustomed to the size. She does have very powerful orgasms when it is in her. Especially if we leave it stationary in her and I lick her clitoris.</li>
    <li> Okay, I just got this and tried it last night. It&#x27;s my first actual toy. And honestly it&#x27;s going to be a big challenge actually using it! But with some time and practice it should be great! But yeah.. it&#x27;s huge.. haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was surprising, not sure why, but I was expecting it to be around 6 or so inches. It&#x27;s more like 8 1/2 inches and it&#x27;s very thick.. so a big shocker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as soft as I would have liked for it to be. It also has a slightly strong smell. But I think that should go away in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it&#x27;s nice and it&#x27;s going to be fine after some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edit*&lt;br /&gt;It IS fine after some practice! ;) Still wish it was softer.</li>
    <li> This toy is very well made.  It must be about 8 inches long.  The girth at the head is just average but then about half way down it gets very thick. The texture is not porous and should be safe and not harbor bacteria.</li>
    <li> This is my first toy and expected it to be huge. For those contemplating about buying this, just do it. It&#x27;s 8\\&quot; long and does wonders! I used when it arrived and I could not be any happier. Also, make sure you use lube with this giant piece. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I just got this toy and had to try it from the moment I opened it. First thing...ITS HUGE! It has the perfect shape and I like the way it feels, but it is firmer than I was anticipating. I was unable to get the full length inside but it should be easier to take with time. Definitely got to stretch yourself before use too, but is an excellent toy. I only gave it 4 stars because it was overly firm, but still has some flex to it. I have another problem with it as well, it has an awful smell to it. Very chemically.</li>
    <li> this toy is massive!!! it&#x27;s not something to just start off with if you are new to toys. it is really nice if used in moderation and with some good lube. we have had lots of fun with this toy, it definitely stretches me to the limit but it feels so good, especially after i&#x27;ve already had penetration with my partner to loosen me up</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, looked at the item, but when it was delivered to my door, it came in a large box! I opened it, and to my surprise there it was, but it turns out it was *way* bigger than I thought it would be! When I opened it, I checked for any damages or any other odd things that might have happened to this product before I actually opened it. Luckily there were none. There were no \\&quot;off\\&quot; smells accompanying this product, and itself held up real nice. It was flexible, but not floppy. The material was soft, but not too soft, and I loved the texture. The suction works great! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS, unless you are a first timer (which, in that case, maybe you should try something a little smaller). It was bigger than I expected, as said, but the size actually worked out, and I really enjoyed this product! (don&#x27;t forget the lube though!) ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update: I&#x27;ve had it for a bit now, and have used it a fair amount. The downside is that I had to throw it away today because it started to become sticky, and some kind of oil or something would stick and stay on your hands, almost like glue. I&#x27;ve tried washing it (I always do after use, but I&#x27;ve tried to wash it more periodically as well.) It was good while it lasted, though. I suppose if I placed a condom over it it would still work, but I don&#x27;t want to chance getting the icky solution in the parts that are hard to reach, so to speak. ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d have given this 5 stars but it&#x27;s a bit bigger than I thought it would be  lol  If you want to feel it this will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Great product craftsmanship material is realistic life like to the touch  and does not have hardly any rubber smell like others do..&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to anyone ho is interested in additional toys for women...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks good product....</li>
    <li> Well Ilet me tell you this toy is AMAZING!!!  I use this at least a couple times a week because I just can&#x27;t get enough of it.  You certainly have a feeling that you have been filled when this thing is inside you. It is very large and very thick but when you get it in the feeling is great. The quality is excellent and this is  not a beginner toy but certainly is one that will provide loads of fun. Best to go-ahead and order lots of lube because you are going to need it.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about buying this due to its size.  I just received it the other day...and let me say...I LOVE IT!!  Talk about a &#x27;fulfilling&#x27; experience!!</li>
    <li> Small on top, giving a different sensation than others. Does have girth (which I like). Only drawback, could be about an inch or two longer (long canal). Then again this is supposed to be Cole Ryder&#x27;s actual size, oh well.</li>
    <li> This is awesome. Good starter toy cuz the head is small, but this guy gets thick quick! No smell. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Wow.. was getting kind of tired of the lack of girth in my life and scanned around for something new and found this.. Let me just say I&#x27;ve had it for MONTHS now and STILL have to take it slow and easy to get it in, use lots of lube (female fan, here; I know there are a lot of male reviews too) and STILL have to wait a minute or two of adjustment time once it&#x27;s in to actually accept it (practically doing the labor-breathing the whole time) *LOL*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got what I wished for, alright. Don&#x27;t let that tapered tip fool you, the rest is COMING TO GET YOU IN JUST A MINUTE! Be afraid, be very afraid. *L* And excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always liked the look of a nice thicker-head, so I didn&#x27;t like the more narrow look of this one, but you really need it for the girth on this dildo. It&#x27;s very beneficial for introduction and acclimation. I really don&#x27;t think I could have handled anything that started out this thick to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is really nice, it&#x27;s one of the best-made dildo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned (out of maybe 6-7 from various companies). I don&#x27;t know the specs on the material, but the feel (in handling and in use) is just different and, well, better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if it turns out to be too much for you, ladies and gents... you can always use it as your bedside bat for midnight break-ins.</li>
    <li> Despite other reviews stating the Cole Ryder dildo was super-duper thick, the product description seemed more reasonable than others made it out to be. There may potentially only be roughly three things some may dislike with this product -&lt;br /&gt;1.) It is SUPER-DUPER THICK!!! I&#x27;ve seen several Cole Ryder films and his disco stick is nowhere near that thick!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;2.) It is pretty hard. It has a semisoft exterior, its core is hard as stone - yet it&#x27;s pliable about an inch and a half in any direction.&lt;br /&gt;3.)  This may not bother some but the jewels are pretty hard!!&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the perky perks&lt;br /&gt;1.) In my personal opinion its potential insert-able size is perfect! It&#x27;s not too long and not too short.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Like most say it&#x27;s quite nice that the head is semi-small, it makes insertion \\&quot;better.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Many people who have bought dildos say that they tend to have a very prominent scent that last forever or has an oozy slimy coating. My thought to those people is that you&#x27;re not buying the real thing, if it were a real man and his goods were covered in goo you&#x27;d probably want to drop him or take the risk and get tested afterward (don&#x27;t take the risk - you&#x27;ll regret it.) The Cole Ryder dildo had a semi potent sent but no ooze, honestly I can&#x27;t complain I was pretty happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! How can I forget my personal nutshell experience?!? I bought the Cole Ryder dildo for anal \\&quot;stimulation,\\&quot; it is so thick that even after a week of ownership I&#x27;ve only been able to manage the head (bummer) - however I&#x27;m a persistent kind of guy who will work with what I bought (at least till I give up and buy a less thick piece.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was extremely discreet which I greatly appreciated. I went with express shipping and it came quite promptly. The company charged my card very fast and it processed and cleared in less than two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to this kind of thing and are looking for some back yard fun I would pass on this baby, it&#x27;s too thick -it&#x27;ll rip you a new one! Maybe some might call me a puss-ay but I don&#x27;t have one so to the ladies looking for advice this applies to both men and women use a lot of lube!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my personal experience I wish I would have listened to everyone who said it was too thick and that I would have bought a dildo of an appropriate size for my desired use. If I could go back in time I would pass on this product, but to those who like them thick - the company, the quality, and the product in whole is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next purchase just might be some of the nice toys Cody Cummings has to offer.</li>
    <li> Product met expectations, shipped as specified. N o p r o b l e m s Happy with purchase. Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought for someone as gift LOL</li>
    <li> OMG!!! Haha let me just say the pic on here does this toy NO justice!! Delivery was really good... I received the package today when the expected delivery date was for next Monday. Looks and feels like the real deal. No smell at all. Nice and big and FAT :) I recommend it highly, especially if you are a couple looking for new toys. Hubby and I decided to get this one due to the girth (thickness) of it (we will be using this as kind of a \\&quot;prep\\&quot; for me for bigger penetration ;) lol) It has a really good suction cup at the bottom... I tried it on the wall and it held up really good. I also tried it on the coffee table which is made out of... I don&#x27;t know, wood I guess (it&#x27;s from Ikea) and it suctioned really good.. I had a little bit of trouble pulling it off it was on there so good. Measurements are: 8\\&quot; from the tip down to the bottom of the shaft (not including the suction cup) and girth: Tip is about 4.5\\&quot;, right under the tip is about 5.5\\&quot;, middle and bottom of shaft is about 6.5\\&quot;. Enjoy!! :P</li>
    <li> I am totally embarrassed to have this item on my purchase list...but a friend was having her 60th birthday and I got this for her as a joke. Much to her dismay, and I&#x27;m quoting here, &amp;#34;the thing is too big, do they have something smaller&amp;#34;. So of course you can&#x27;t return this which means I purchased another one for her. That one, she said is &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;. To each her own.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Yum it feels great.</li>
    <li> Ordered from Healthy and Active. Item came in a plastic clam-shell within a cardboard box. This box originally had several tapes to hold it together, which were \\&quot;opened\\&quot;. This was evidenced by the top paper-layer of the cardboard being torn off where the tape used to be prior to being opened. Then the clam-shell itself was not seated properly, but rather had been pulled apart, exposing the product. The product had smudges and dust specks on it, indicating it had been handled previously. This made the product unacceptable for use because of hygienic and aesthetic reasons.&lt;br /&gt;The seller refused to cooperate with a replacement or refund, insisting that it&#x27;s a final sale. Final sale for a defective, falsely advertised-as-new product??</li>
