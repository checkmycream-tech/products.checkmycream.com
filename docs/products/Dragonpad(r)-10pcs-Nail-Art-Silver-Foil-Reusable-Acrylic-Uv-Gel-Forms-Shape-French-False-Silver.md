      <li>this is way better nail forms then</li>
      <li>They work ok.</li>
      <li>and I love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Not super great materials or great quality</li>
      <li>Loved them at first</li>
      <li>Enjoying my forms very much for school!!</li>
      <li>Item came early and they work great.</li>
      <li>I love these they are flexible and fit well.</li>
      <li>but overall a good product!</li>
      <li>They were so easy to use and the UV gel did not stick to them.</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and take off, never get in the way, the metal is flexible to fit over any shape of nail and the acrylic doesn&#x27;t stick to it at all.</li>
      <li>So happy these finally arrived.</li>
      <li>They are flexible, but not flimsy so you can fit them to any size finger.</li>
      <li>They work fantastic for the price</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>When I first got these reusable forms I was in love.</li>
      <li>She is excited about having all the material to work with.</li>
      <li>they are really good products and they come in a nice little case for you to store them</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything spectacular because they are so inexpensive, but I was happily surprised with these.</li>
      <li>received this item very quickly and it was exactly what the description stated.</li>
      <li>they fall apart quickly</li>
      <li>Exactly Wat I wanted!</li>
      <li>They are also very flexible so that you can bend them how you wish to fit any type of finger/nail.</li>
      <li>These are really useful and reusable for acrylic nails.</li>
      <li>These would get a better rating if they worked on short nails.</li>
      <li>just OK product, I will try the disposable next...</li>
      <li>I received only 5 &amp; one of them were broke &amp; on top of that</li>
      <li>They work ok for minor nail repairs but that is it.</li>
      <li>then just the sticker is self because they don&#x27;t stick properly and easily comes off these will solve all those problems for u</li>
      <li>I only recieved 5 of them and they bend too easily and hang so far away from the nail that you literally have to file acrylic from up underneath the free edge because they fit so loosely.</li>
      <li>They grip well &amp; are much easier for me to use than the sticky disposable forms.</li>
      <li>I found that these are a useful tool in applying acrylic over my natural nails.</li>
      <li>makes life so much easier</li>
      <li>Thanks for delivering them so promptly.</li>
      <li>Wow...I really like this item.</li>
      <li>These are surprisingly short for free edge extension.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I really like them</li>
      <li>havent really used this yet but hoping too in the coming months ahead as i am getting closer to graduation</li>
      <li>but it a real saying you pay for what you get.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll let my real nails grow than do an arcylic overlay</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t pay much.</li>
      <li>, it fits all the other ones though :)</li>
      <li>make sure to not let the nails dry completely or you will have problems getting them to separate from the form.</li>
      <li>They will not last forever, but can be used many times with proper care &amp; cleaning them with alcohol on a paper towel.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>but I was looking for a little bit better quality</li>
      <li>Very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t match the natural nail at all.</li>
      <li>The acrylic comes off of the form easily when you pull down and out.</li>
      <li>and they can be made to fit a lot of other fingers</li>
      <li>so hopefully ill get the other 5 soon, but all in all it works great!</li>
      <li>I tried one on as soon as I got them and was being gentle to mold it to my finger but as soon as I put it back in the case and closed the top it was smushed and the foil cracked even though I flattened it to its prior position..</li>
      <li>they also came really early</li>
      <li>They also come in useful cases so that they don&#x27;t crushed.</li>
      <li>Even if I intentionally bend them in order to make them stay in place, they&#x27;re still far too wide to match the natural curve of my nail bed, so I can&#x27;t line them up with my real nail or existing acrylic nail, there&#x27;s still a gap between them.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t figure out how to get these to stay on my fingers straight - the gel makes curved nails instead of straight once dried in the LED UV</li>
      <li>I am excited to try then but a little hesitant at the same time.</li>
      <li>BUT for the price it might be worth it to just buy a few sets of these at a time.</li>
      <li>Wish I had received all ten not half.</li>
      <li>I look forward to reordering due to the price thanks Cynthia</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So womderful product and i will get stuff from this store..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks ..nice for my nails&lt;br /&gt;Faster to do my acrylics</li>
    <li> I love them! Easy to put on and take off, never get in the way, the metal is flexible to fit over any shape of nail and the acrylic doesn&#x27;t stick to it at all. Great price for a great product too, kudos!</li>
    <li> Received this order today. It was just as described.</li>
    <li> Enjoying my forms very much for school!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money! Not worth it, they&#x27;re too floppy</li>
    <li> stronger than what I was looking at but it a real saying you pay for what you get. I look forward to reordering due to the price thanks Cynthia</li>
    <li> Waste of money. I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t pay much. #1) I only received 5 of them, and they took almost 3 weeks longer to get here than they should have... #2) I have small hands and they don&#x27;t fit a single one of my fingers. Literally, not one finger -- they&#x27;re far too loose and hang down too low away from the nail. I was excited to use them to make longer nails or fix a broken one, but now after waiting almost a month, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that they won&#x27;t be the least bit helpful whatsoever. Plus, they&#x27;re flimsy as heck; the metal pieces bend out of shape with hardly any pressure at all, and the foil part looks like it was taped on with standard Scotch tape. Even if I intentionally bend them in order to make them stay in place, they&#x27;re still far too wide to match the natural curve of my nail bed, so I can&#x27;t line them up with my real nail or existing acrylic nail, there&#x27;s still a gap between them.</li>
    <li> I only received 5 not 10 like it says</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great for their price, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Its still doing it&#x27;s thing after Many mail extension I have done! Great with acrylic and great with gel extension</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t match the natural nail at all. I bought these thinking that I would save money in my salon but unfortunatley they just cost me time. I only recieved 5 of them and they bend too easily and hang so far away from the nail that you literally have to file acrylic from up underneath the free edge because they fit so loosely. Very disappointed and would not recommend these for nail techs. They work ok for minor nail repairs but that is it.</li>
    <li> This product is just as the advertisement pictured and described. The forms are easily adjustable and have a good hold,</li>
    <li> So happy these finally arrived. Came at the last date of the specified time frame. Love these</li>
    <li> I order this for my daughter who is now pursuing a hobby in applying false nails. She now has all of the material that is needed for her to become quite an expert in applying nails. She is excited about having all the material to work with. She has begun to practice making/building her own acrylic nails using this product. I received this earlier than expected and no damage. Thanks.</li>
    <li> good product.... works as discribed.&lt;br /&gt;makes adding length easier.&lt;br /&gt;why do we need to write a book&lt;br /&gt;for the reviews?</li>
    <li> These are smaller than I thought these would be. They work fantastic for the price and I love them :)</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to use these, they are just what I wanted. Thanks for delivering them so promptly. They work great.</li>
    <li> makes life so much easier then just the sticker is self because they don&#x27;t stick properly and easily comes off these will solve all those problems for u thank u and i will def order again they also came really early</li>
    <li> The concept of reusable nail forms is awesome, but these are not the best</li>
    <li> I need those, I am still a newbie so it would be helpful if it did. Also, one of my thumb is a bit wider and these can&#x27;t fit it perfectly, it fits all the other ones though :)</li>
    <li> they work great I love the quality and the price was good too. i definitely recommend this product. thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased these 10 piece and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Already knew the product is very good.This is 10 piece. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These are surprisingly short for free edge extension. They would work for the typical client, but if your client likes really long nails you should carry another form. I do appreciate that these are reusable and I can disinfect them for use on my next client.</li>
    <li> This item came really late it said it wold take 17-28 days but I got it a week after the 28 day But they fit my fingers very good and they can be made to fit a lot of other fingers and it holds the acrylic very good to I really like them</li>
    <li> Only got 5 pieces!?&lt;br /&gt;Also they are flimsy made with scotch tape. I shud&#x27;ve ordered disposable paper ones.</li>
    <li> Better off getting the sticker nail forms.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t figure out how to get these to stay on my fingers straight - the gel makes curved nails instead of straight once dried in the LED UV</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use these I&#x27;ll let my real nails grow than do an arcylic overlay</li>
    <li> I found that these are a useful tool in applying acrylic over my natural nails. Reusable and affordable. The forms are perfect for the nail.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I can&#x27;t get a good fit with these.</li>
    <li> I like these just need a bit more practice with them! but overall a good product! I got them in like 2 weeks which was a plus!</li>
    <li> havent really used this yet but hoping too in the coming months ahead as i am getting closer to graduation</li>
    <li> When I first got these reusable forms I was in love. They were so easy to use and the UV gel did not stick to them. They are also very flexible so that you can bend them how you wish to fit any type of finger/nail. The only downfall is that they aren&#x27;t reusable for long... I used them for 5-10 sets before the form started to pull away from the frame of the form. BUT for the price it might be worth it to just buy a few sets of these at a time.</li>
    <li> Happy to find very durable foil that I can use over and over again. Great price, and worth it.</li>
    <li> I love how this product is reusable and good for gel and acrylic  will be amazed if bough for nail structuring</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok to practice on.</li>
    <li> the material is very weak and the unite is held together by tape! would no recommend! total waste of money</li>
    <li> 10pcs?????. I received only 5 &amp; one of them were broke &amp; on top of that it took about 2 months to get here!! Very disappointed</li>
    <li> These would get a better rating if they worked on short nails. I could only get them to work properly with fairly long nails.</li>
    <li> Fits fingers perfectly.</li>
    <li> Received these within the time promised.  Using them already and they work great.  I like have the plastic box to keep them in.</li>
    <li> just OK product, I will try the disposable next...</li>
    <li> I love these they are flexible and fit well.</li>
    <li> good product thank you</li>
    <li> unfortunately this is not reusable, I bought them for my personal use...thank God...if I use it for customers i&#x27;ll be broke the separate from the metal making the purpose of it imposible...so its pointless to buy it</li>
    <li> These are definitely not worth the time it took for them to get to me... I tried one on as soon as I got them and was being gentle to mold it to my finger but as soon as I put it back in the case and closed the top it was smushed and the foil cracked even though I flattened it to its prior position.. It&#x27;s too easy to mess these up even if you&#x27;re careful :( very disappointed</li>
    <li> Item came early and they work great. The item was well packed. i love them now i can start extensions without using artificial nails</li>
    <li> received this item very quickly and it was exactly what the description stated. I will recommend this item to others</li>
    <li> Only got five pieces not ten. Not happy. Wish I had received all ten not half. Not what I paid for.</li>
    <li> works as intended. make sure to not let the nails dry completely or you will have problems getting them to separate from the form.</li>
    <li> Took 4 months to arrive. Ended up going to Sally&#x27;s instead.</li>
    <li> Maravillosa presentación</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I was looking for a little bit better quality I am excited to try then but a little hesitant at the same time.</li>
    <li> These are really useful and reusable for acrylic nails. They are flexible, but not flimsy so you can fit them to any size finger. They also come in useful cases so that they don&#x27;t crushed.</li>
    <li> came in quick and works great for the price will defenitely purcase this set again I like how they came in two protective boxes I just so they don&#x27;t get squished in shipping but I can think of alot of thing I can use them for so awesome :)</li>
    <li> Wow...I really like this item. .will be awesome that I can reuse these. .jus waiting on MI other set of 5..I got one set of 5...I guess they send them it in different packages. I wonder why. .oh well..can&#x27;t wait to get the other 5..other then that they are awesome. .</li>
    <li> They work ok. they don&#x27;t seem to stay put on my practice hand, that could be because it is a practice hand and not a human hand. Have not tried it on a person yet</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything spectacular because they are so inexpensive, but I was happily surprised with these. They grip well &amp; are much easier for me to use than the sticky disposable forms. You can adjust the shape. The acrylic comes off of the form easily when you pull down and out. They will not last forever, but can be used many times with proper care &amp; cleaning them with alcohol on a paper towel. I am a nail tech.</li>
    <li> Cheap and hard to use. uncomfortable on clients. Use T.T. sticker forms.</li>
    <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
    <li> this is way better nail forms then the paper for beginners reusing it is a snap love it....i&#x27;m just saying</li>
    <li> I only got a pack of 5 foils not 10 so hopefully ill get the other 5 soon, but all in all it works great!</li>
    <li> Not happy with them they do not stay put no matter what I do</li>
    <li> Exactly Wat I wanted!</li>
    <li> they are really good products and they come in a nice little case for you to store them so you do not have to have them loose in a drawer and they are very easy to cleam they get the job done.</li>
    <li> bien bien bien bien lo recomiendo excelente producto espero volver a contar con algo que posea para la venta ok ok</li>
    <li> I used this item twice since ordering them and have noticed that they are all splitting at the bottom.  They are able to hold the on to the nail but when you go to shape the bottom of the nail by pushing the sides together the foil splits.  Loved them at first but sis not expect for them to break after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> I Thought This Was all metal but its not didn&#x27;t like these</li>
    <li> they fall apart quickly</li>
    <li> So far so good. It took awhile to get here but I knew that it would take longer conning from China. I got it on the last day of the expected delivery date when other stuff I ordered from  China didn&#x27;t take half as long. Not super great materials or great quality but they will work for home use.</li>
