      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I really love this eye cream .</li>
      <li>Has many of the ingredients need to improve skin around your eyes</li>
      <li>but it seems to be doing an okay job, for me anyways.</li>
      <li>Love this eye cream.</li>
      <li>It just keeps getting better with continued use.</li>
      <li>The packaging is pure class, ok, so yes it looks good, but all we care about is.... &amp;#34;does</li>
      <li>30 days before I can really give a good review.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making such great, and true products!!</li>
      <li>My skin is soft and I love it!!</li>
      <li>Reviewed it very quickly</li>
      <li>those fine lines aren&#x27;t there</li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly.</li>
      <li>so far so good.  </li>
      <li>Any two or three of these would improve the look, but COSMEDICA puts them all in to give that true difference.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but more unscented really.</li>
      <li>Mild.</li>
      <li>It dries up quickly and it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy .</li>
      <li>Fragrance is extremely mild.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
      <li>Not irritating in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If under-hydrated eyes aren&#x27;t your issue, this may work just fine for you.</li>
      <li>Very creamy and smooth.</li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t fun.</li>
      <li>You can feel the moisture in the cream being absorbed into the eye area.</li>
      <li>( I don&#x27;t want to go to bed until it&#x27;s absorbed) which is seconds.</li>
      <li>Consistency is just right</li>
      <li>goes on easily,goes right in my skin.</li>
      <li>This cream is lightweight, not heavy on the skin, It easily gets absorbed and hydrates the skin with ease.  </li>
      <li>Thicker than expected but feels nice once absorbed into the skin.</li>
      <li>This cream is made of all natural products, safe for everyone, and the results are the amazing rapidity of action and the lasting effect.</li>
      <li>Within a week I could clearly see the fine lines around my eyes disappearing and reduced puffiness under my eyes disappearing also.</li>
      <li>Nice light texture on this - could be worn under makeup - but not nearly as hydrating as Mario &amp; not the same quickly noticeable improvements that come from truly hydrating the skin around your eyes.</li>
      <li>, however I really don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s ANY anti-aging product that&#x27;ll completely take away wrinkles so these results are good enough for me.</li>
      <li>I used as directed, but did see any recognizable difference.  </li>
      <li>And most important: it improve the skin around the eyes, the puffiness and the dark circles.</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time today and within minutes saw a difference.</li>
      <li>Too early to tell yet but seems to smooth out my puffy eyes.  </li>
      <li>You notice it the moment you apply it by patting (not rubbing) the cream into the skin around the eye, but the real value is the &#x60;morning after appearance&#x27;:</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
      <li>I really was hoping that this product would work for me.  </li>
      <li>It takes very little--I dab my pinkie onto the cream and pat around my eye</li>
      <li>I really does not have a scent</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and has diminished my fine lines as well as lightened my dark circles!!!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I high recommend this product.</li>
      <li>You know what I mean, let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
      <li>so I thought I&#x27;d use the opportunity to try something new.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very soft cream, almost like a mousse</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a faint, but pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>Goes on feeling a tad bit heavy but sinks right in to my skin very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I really like Total Restorative Eye Cream!!!</li>
      <li>Not harsh.</li>
      <li>and I am completely sold.  </li>
      <li>but my skin is overly sensitive</li>
      <li>Most eye creams that I have tried are either too greasy and do not absorb completely, or they burn the delicate skin around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something that would take away the dark circles under my eyes and also help with the puffiness, this cream seemed to do the job pretty well since I started using it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> its goo for my deep bags</li>
    <li> It does very little for my puffy eyes in the morning &amp; leaves my eye area with a greasy feeling. No matter how little I put on, my makeup cakes up in the creases above/below my eye. I was trying to find a cheaper version of Clinique&#x27;s All About Eyes, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> works well would say obagi eye cream is better though</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all!  It noticeably reduces my under-eye puffiness, minimizes my little lines and lightens the crows feet area.  I&#x27;m delighted with this product!</li>
    <li> COSMEDICA has provided us with a truly restorative eye cream - not just a cover-up or &#x60;tighten for an hour&#x27; product, but a cream that when applied actually reduces the puffiness of tired eyes, smoothes out the fine lines and even crow&#x27;s feet, and takes away the dark circles. You notice it the moment you apply it by patting (not rubbing) the cream into the skin around the eye, but the real value is the &#x60;morning after appearance&#x27;: these restorations LAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are the ones supported by cosmeticians and cosmetic surgeons - Aloe, Jojoba oil. Grapeseed oil, green tea, licorice, primrose, vitamin C, rosehip, CoEnzyme Q10, apple, lemongrass and a peptide complex.  Any two or three of these would improve the look, but COSMEDICA puts them all in to give that true difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice aspect about this eye cream is that it can safely be used at night. Often the eye creams that contain hyaluronic acid irritate the eyes during sleep. No problem here. This cream is made of all natural products, safe for everyone, and the results are the amazing rapidity of action and the lasting effect. An excellent product. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 14</li>
    <li> This is a very nice eye cream.,  It hydrates well and is not greasy.  It does not make my skin break out.  Fragrance is extremely mild.  I am very pleased with this cream.</li>
    <li> I like it. Has many of the ingredients need to improve skin around your eyes</li>
    <li> Will admit was skeptical when I purchased this but the lines around my eyes just puffed right out. Consistency is just right as well - not too thick and not too light. Will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Comes in a very nice container that is sealed. The cream is light and feels good. I noticed already that it helps my dark circles under eyes and the bags under my eyes. This is awesome as  I haven&#x27;t been sleeping well and it&#x27;s been looking it. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> The container was smaller than I expected but for the tiny amount that you use around your eyes it actually last a long time. I have been using it for a week now and have noticed less puffiness in the under eye area. I would recommend it if it that is a problem you have. I really does not have a scent so thats a plus for me. i did receive it to review.</li>
    <li> Works wonders. I tried it for the first time today and within minutes saw a difference. It helped  tighten up the wrinkles I have hiding under my eyes and on the edges. Love the packaging as well. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend</li>
    <li> so far so good.  Received product on time.  Will need to use for approx. 30 days before I can really give a good review.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Lines around my eyes are definitely softening. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results with extended use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye cream! It&#x27;s light and has diminished my fine lines as well as lightened my dark circles!!! Love Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Too early to tell yet but seems to smooth out my puffy eyes.  Mild. Not harsh. I have very sensitive skin so this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> My Mario Badescu glycolic cream melted in the 100+ degree car temps on vacation recently so I thought I&#x27;d use the opportunity to try something new. Nice light texture on this - could be worn under makeup - but not nearly as hydrating as Mario &amp; not the same quickly noticeable improvements that come from truly hydrating the skin around your eyes. Not irritating in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If under-hydrated eyes aren&#x27;t your issue, this may work just fine for you. My eyes just happen to respond to hydration so I may return to Mario.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and smooth. Not much needed. Not greasy like other eye creams and does not make my eyelids puffy. So if you are sensitive like me - this is a perfect product.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream. I have been using this for a while and have seen a difference in the smoothness under my eyes. I will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with eye cream.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would take away the dark circles under my eyes and also help with the puffiness, this cream seemed to do the job pretty well since I started using it. It&#x27;s a very soft cream, almost like a mousse but it applied very easy and didn&#x27;t feel greasy to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see how it keeps working and update my review again as needed.</li>
    <li> I really love this eye cream . It dries up quickly and it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy . I have been using it day and night and I can see the difference for the dark circles under my eyes .</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Thicker than expected but feels nice once absorbed into the skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product a couple of weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen results yet. My slight dark circles, crows feel and fine lines are still noticeable. I will continue to use this product hoping I start to see results.</li>
    <li> If i see diffrent i will come back to tell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks I can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
    <li> Just got it and put it on it feels great</li>
    <li> This product is great. Reviewed it very quickly</li>
    <li> This product has decreased the lines just under my eyebrow and has helped some with the crows feet and wrinkles under my eyes.  It moisturizers the areas wonderfully!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent eye cream.  This cream is lightweight, not heavy on the skin, It easily gets absorbed and hydrates the skin with ease.  Also it smells freshly pleasant.  And most important: it improve the skin around the eyes, the puffiness and the dark circles.</li>
    <li> I was already addicted to the H.A, ( hyaluronic acid), I just placed another order. But now, I have tried the restorative eye cream, and it&#x27;s simply wonderful. Another addiction coming. The packaging is pure class, ok, so yes it looks good, but all we care about is.... &amp;#34;does it work&amp;#34;?  And all I can say is YES!! It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s almost like a mousse/cream product. It goes on so smoothly. My skin sucks it right up,  and no, there is no greasy residue or unwanted pimples the next day. You know what I mean, let&#x27;s be honest. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my skin is not like leather at all, but I&#x27;m sure if it was, the eye cream would still work wonders!! There&#x27;s a faint, but pleasant scent. but more unscented really. I put it on, wait a few minutes  ( I don&#x27;t want to go to bed until it&#x27;s absorbed) which is seconds. My skin is soft and I love it!! I&#x27;m even using it after i get out of the shower.So as I stated, I&#x27;m becoming addicted!  We all want to look like those fine lines aren&#x27;t there and we try everything to try to make every line disappear. My fine lines are disappearing even more!! I exfoliate my face, apply the H.A. and after I feel it tighten up a little, I apply the eye cream. I do admit that any extra cream from my fingertips, I use on my face. This one is a keeper. I would give it 10 stars if I could! Thank you for making such great, and true products!! I encourage all of you, to just try it. You won&#x27;t be sorry!! Thanks!!  :)</li>
    <li> I really was hoping that this product would work for me.  I used as directed, but did see any recognizable difference.  I gave it 2 stars because it works as a but of a non-greasy moisturizer, but I can get that from many products that I already own.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price.  will order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my eyes but this cream feels so good when applied. You can feel the moisture in the cream being absorbed into the eye area.</li>
    <li> This was a good cream but my skin is overly sensitive so I could not use it everyday!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is wonderful! Within a week I could clearly see the fine lines around my eyes disappearing and reduced puffiness under my eyes disappearing also. It just keeps getting better with continued use. I have been using this product for 3 weeks.I  have used other highly advertised products in the past  but none compare to this eye cream. I will continue to  use this product...Thank you Cosmedica.  I high recommend this product. The results are amazing.</li>
    <li> Instead of removing the puffiness it made my eyes puffier.</li>
    <li> Cosmedica products are sensational!  I have been using them for about 7 months and I am completely sold.  I waited until I could definitively and wholeheartedly recommend them, and I can!  I started with the Vitamin C serum and hyaluronic acid.  Once I saw how well they worked, I ordered the Total Restorative Eye Cream and Toner.  This eye cream performs flawlessly for me.  While I don&#x27;t have dark circles, the skin under my eyes need moisture, and this delivers.  I use it morning and night.  It takes very little--I dab my pinkie onto the cream and pat around my eye and it absorbs almost immediately.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Have noticed a difference but the  circles  are still there</li>
    <li> no better than any other eye cream I have bought.</li>
    <li> I received this eye cream to test out in return for my unbiased opinion.  I really liked it!  Most eye creams that I have tried are either too greasy and do not absorb completely, or they burn the delicate skin around my eyes.  This did neither!  Goes on feeling a tad bit heavy but sinks right in to my skin very quickly.  No burning at all, which is almost unheard of for me.  Does seem to help the skin around my eyes retain moisture and look plump, for lack of a better word.  The true test will come 6 months from now in the cold New England weather.  I would definitely recommend this eye cream.</li>
    <li> Love it! goes on easily,goes right in my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like Total Restorative Eye Cream!!! I wear it under my make-up, I work 8 hour shifts and at the end of my shift my eye make-up is still on. I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of other eye creams that either end up being greasy or they burn and putting make-up on when your skin is burning isn&#x27;t fun. I honestly have never used anything that you can get in a drug store or department store that compares. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Have only used Total Restorative Eye Cream for about 2 weeks but it seems to be doing an okay job, for me anyways. The fine lines under my eyes are a little less noticeable and the skin is smoother. Not a big difference, however I really don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s ANY anti-aging product that&#x27;ll completely take away wrinkles so these results are good enough for me. This eye cream is made with organic ingredients which is a plus, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Maybe if I keep using for a longer period of time I might see more visible results.</li>
    <li> This has done nothing for my eyes,unfortunately. I was so hoping it would work.</li>
