      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t get foamy - unlike most other shaving &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; products.</li>
      <li>so I can see what I am doing while shaving and it leaves my semi-sensitive skin feeling refreshed and comfortable.</li>
      <li>This gel is fantastic.</li>
      <li>For larger areas than the oil - yields a great shave</li>

      <li>but luckily I&#x27;m a Prime member.  </li>
      <li>Great product, which seems much easier than traditional aerosol shaving gels.  </li>
      <li>but luckily Amazon has started carrying it.</li>
      <li>Order arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
      <li>Quick turn around time on the delivery and the product is as promised.</li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s available and an excellent shaving gel - low foam and high lubricant for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I can transfer an ounce or so of this stuff into a travel bottle easily (and it will last me for a couple of months or more).  </li>
      <li>so I order 12 months worth from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>As usual,  shipping is great</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, this is the only place I can find it these days</li>
      <li>Was my favorite shaving cream until my last shipment arrived with warning labels stating that it had ingredients found to cause cancer by the state of California.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and clear.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that there are some spice and natural oil scents available too.</li>
      <li>The first ingredient is Aloe Vera</li>
      <li>It provides excellent glide for my razor and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
      <li>My first shaving gel and I&#x27;m pleased with it, it&#x27;s substancially better than the old school shaving cream, it gives better and quicker shaving on difficult areas.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never had such comfortable shaves.</li>
      <li>I returned the product and have since gone to using shaving oil which I really like.</li>
      <li>Makes shaving with a straight razor or safety razor much quicker.</li>
      <li>For me it works really well.  </li>
      <li>Really helps blade glide without causing nicks.</li>
      <li>I had tried many other gels, foam and creams and stumbled on to alpha--gel when I needed something in a non-aerosol to take on a trip.</li>
      <li>really slick and gives a nice glide.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice and slick, without being gooey.</li>
      <li>I think one needs to personally try different one&#x27;s until they find one they are satisfied with.</li>
      <li>This shaving gel lets me shave whenever I want or need to and is far better than any of the other creams or oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Rarely cut myself with daily shaving.  </li>
      <li>I use this under my normal cream</li>
      <li>Expensive zillion-blade cartridges to an old school safety razor - works splendidly on all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin, so much so that I usually only shave once or twice a week.</li>
      <li>travel frequently</li>
      <li>Nearly frictionless.  </li>
      <li>of Shaves starts and finishes with a good shave and never had to get into weird stuff to make it happen.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t form a thick lather</li>
      <li>The few others that are mostly natural stuff are not as good - too creamy, to scented, and usually too</li>
      <li>Shaving oil is another great option to use solo, but it&#x27;s expensive and works better in small doses in cocktail with other products.</li>
      <li>Close comfortable and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>, I only need a small dollop and a can of regular cream gives me far too much every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> only complaint about this product is the local drugstore I first discovered it in</li>
<li> It is becoming difficult to find</li>
<li> : 1) this product is primarily au-naturale (despite the space-age blue color), 2) the consistency is similar to aloe vera gel you put on sunburn, and 3) in the unfortunate event you nick yourself with the razor, the healing process has a jump-start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> You will never go back to any other shave balm, gel or cream again.  </li>
<li> If you shave several different directions, you&#x27;ll want to even out between segments or reapply a little.  </li>
<li> The only complaint (if any) is that it can be nearly invisible</li>
<li> It adds that slick film between my sensitive skin and the triple blades causing fewer skin blemishes.  </li>
<li> This is my favorite shaving product and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in the states.</li>
<li> I usually shave with cold water as it allows me to actually feel the razor cut the hair and makes the hair stand up better.</li>
<li> The sticker seems to have been stuck on top of the tube - so I guess, it has some ingredient that California considered bad....</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shaving gel as a very bad order and found on the back of the tube a disclaimer note that this product in the state of California is know to cause cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that threw the gel in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is the Very Best shaving gel on the market.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever with dollar shave club razors</li>
    <li> With two shaves under my belt, I love this gel. Makes shaving with a straight razor or safety razor much quicker. I shaved once with warm water and once with cold water. I usually shave with cold water as it allows me to actually feel the razor cut the hair and makes the hair stand up better. Either way, this gel provided a great shave. Not as enjoyable as a full on soap and brush shave, but you don&#x27;t always have time to create a great lather. Shaving oil is another great option to use solo, but it&#x27;s expensive and works better in small doses in cocktail with other products. Like this amazing shave gel! This is a great, cheap choice for people who like to sleep in and still shave in the morning with a man&#x27;s single blade razor.</li>
    <li> Love this non foaming stuff! Best shaves ever!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Have been using it for years.  Order arrived quickly and as described.  Would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I can still get this - there seemed to be a problem getting it for a while there. But, it&#x27;s available and an excellent shaving gel - low foam and high lubricant for sensitive skin. This gel is the only shaving gel that keeps me from getting razor rash - the best reason to keep getting it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and it has always given me s great shave. The downside is in my area i cannot find it in the local stores.</li>
    <li> Was my favorite shaving cream until my last shipment arrived with warning labels stating that it had ingredients found to cause cancer by the state of California. Granted, parts of California are wacked out and hard to believe connected to planet Earth, but, I wasn&#x27;t going to research any further. I returned the product and have since gone to using shaving oil which I really like.</li>
    <li> this is the best shaving product ever. I shave my entire head and face, and it moisturizes quite well even in Phoenix temperatures. I buy it by the case.great product.</li>
    <li> The best shaving product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> If you are bald this is the only shaving gel I can use. I shave in the shower and it works great. I have used it for years and it is the only thing I use.</li>
    <li> Why did the price of this stuff jump $2 per tube?  I used to buy this stuff in a 6 pack for $24.  A price jump of 50%??  Must have grown in popularity and the manufacturer is making their killing.  Good product, but I will forego the convenience for a traditional brush and soap.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for your skin&lt;br /&gt;No razer burn</li>
    <li> Have been using this now for over 15 years. great stuff.</li>
    <li> Delivers a smooth shave and helps the skin agains razor bumps. Recommend</li>
    <li> I am so glad I can still find this.  I think it&#x27;s the best of the best.  Nice comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> It has a sticker on it stating &#x27;This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer.&#x27; Since I put this on my face - this scared me. I have stopped using this. The sticker seems to have been stuck on top of the tube - so I guess, it has some ingredient that California considered bad....</li>
    <li> This product gives the best shave. No irritation and always leaves my legs smooth.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite saving gel.  Not the easiest to find but luckily I&#x27;m a Prime member.  It adds that slick film between my sensitive skin and the triple blades causing fewer skin blemishes.  If you have trouble scraping your upper chin and neck like I do try it.  I have noticed that there are some spice and natural oil scents available too.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t get foamy - unlike most other shaving &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; products. It stays clear, giving you a good view of your progress, ensuring you didn&#x27;t miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and slick, without being gooey. I&#x27;ve used it with all kinds of razors. Expensive zillion-blade cartridges to an old school safety razor - works splendidly on all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad Amazon sells this; the big-boxers seem to have dropped it. Buy some.</li>
    <li> Close comfortable and a little goes a long way. I use this under my normal cream and I&#x27;ve never had such comfortable shaves.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave gel I have used.  I love it.</li>
    <li> You will never go back to any other shave balm, gel or cream again.  You use very little, so a bottle last a 6 months to one to year.  Non foaming,  invisible so you can see where you shave. Softens stuble,  lubricates your face so the razor glides effortlessly without any razorburn or irritation.  Must try it.  Nothing Gillette or other companies have can compare.</li>
    <li> Great Product and lasts a long time. Really helps blade glide without causing nicks.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best shaving gels I have ever used. really slick and gives a nice glide. protects my face from nicks and since it dosent foam up like shaving creams do I can define my goatee with more accuracy.</li>
    <li> This gel is fantastic. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find but luckily Amazon has started carrying it. It provides excellent glide for my razor and a small amount goes a long way. This is the only shave gel I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Nearly frictionless.  Haven&#x27;t found anything else like it.  Softens the beard.  Rarely cut myself with daily shaving.  The only complaint (if any) is that it can be nearly invisible so you just have to know its there.  No trace lines to tell where you&#x27;ve shaved to overlapp (if you like to lather and remove chunks to see where you are).  If you shave several different directions, you&#x27;ll want to even out between segments or reapply a little.  Some gets left behind.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shave cream(gel) I have ever used.  It is becoming difficult to find so I order 12 months worth from Amazon.  Cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Alpha-Gel is the best. I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Great shave cream that does NOT cover up what you are shaving and let&#x27;s you SEE what you are doing when you are doing it!</li>
    <li> This is the only shave gel I will use! I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t form a thick lather so I can see what I am doing while shaving and it leaves my semi-sensitive skin feeling refreshed and comfortable. It has also virtually replaced my aftershave as well since it contains aloe and tea tree oil which helps to soothe my skin during and after shaving.</li>
    <li> Shaving gels, shaving foams, shaving creams are a matter of personal choice. I use it with my electric shaver and plain razors. For me it works really well.  I think one needs to personally try different one&#x27;s until they find one they are satisfied with. I had tried many other gels, foam and creams and stumbled on to alpha--gel when I needed something in a non-aerosol to take on a trip. Been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it!!! Great shave.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, this is the only place I can find it these days</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else. As usual,  shipping is great</li>
    <li> I used it for shaving face only. My first shaving gel and I&#x27;m pleased with it, it&#x27;s substancially better than the old school shaving cream, it gives better and quicker shaving on difficult areas. On using this product, I recommend shaving while taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to say: two months of daily use took about just half of the content!</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve used lots of products over the years, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shaving product and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in the states. I have really sensitive skin, so much so that I usually only shave once or twice a week. This shaving gel lets me shave whenever I want or need to and is far better than any of the other creams or oils I&#x27;ve tried. I usually buy a big pack each time so I don&#x27;t run out.....definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> There are a number of shave gels on the market but there isn&#x27;t anything close to this.  The first ingredient is Aloe Vera so we can make some assertions: 1) this product is primarily au-naturale (despite the space-age blue color), 2) the consistency is similar to aloe vera gel you put on sunburn, and 3) in the unfortunate event you nick yourself with the razor, the healing process has a jump-start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel frequently and I don&#x27;t like to carry aerosol.  I can transfer an ounce or so of this stuff into a travel bottle easily (and it will last me for a couple of months or more).  I also find I can easily be more conservative when using this stuff than with an aerosol, I only need a small dollop and a can of regular cream gives me far too much every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is the local drugstore I first discovered it in stopped carrying it.  The other non-aerosol stuff is all unpronounceable chemicals.  The few others that are mostly natural stuff are not as good - too creamy, to scented, and usually too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King of Shaves starts and finishes with a good shave and never had to get into weird stuff to make it happen.</li>
    <li> Great product!.  Have reordered several times!</li>
    <li> Great product, which seems much easier than traditional aerosol shaving gels.  I wish I could get it in a TSA-approved travel size, though.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s my favorite shave gel.  Nice smooth glide, no funky smells, no/low foaming.</li>
    <li> Love this, been using for years. Goes on smooth and clear. Huge part of a really good shave.</li>
    <li> For larger areas than the oil - yields a great shave</li>
    <li> Quick turn around time on the delivery and the product is as promised. Great product, super smooth shave.</li>
