      <li>It keeps my hair from drying out and allows it to be smooth.</li>
      <li>I have fine, 4c hair that is relaxed with Mizani Classic Rhelaxer, so if my hair goes more than 8 days without a wash, I&#x27;m heading for damage.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 1 1/2 years now and it hasn&#x27;t been easy finding products that help me achieve optimum straight results.  </li>
      <li>getting ready to order more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also natural &amp; found that this is great for protecting your hair from heat, it leaves the hair soft, light &amp; full of body.</li>
      <li>When I reviewed this product the print on the bottle was not the same as the authentic even the consistency of the product was much more watery .</li>
      <li>and the salon formula smells different (better!)</li>
      <li>I prefer Mizani&#x27;s Thermasmooth Smooth Guard Serum; it&#x27;s much lighter, in smell &amp; texture.</li>
      <li>Love the results, leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky.</li>
      <li>The smell was nice, but a little strong for me.</li>
      <li>It really keeps out humidity better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and makes hair feel smooth after flat ironing.</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair feel soft and amazingly easy to do into a style...</li>
      <li>For those who are into hair typing, I don&#x27;t know my exact hair type, but it is of varying degrees in the level 4 range.</li>
      <li>When I use this product it makes my hair look so much healthier!  </li>
      <li>Love it left hair silky</li>
      <li>I will continue to use the products because they are high quality and worth the money.</li>
      <li>Hair dries soft and full of body.</li>
      <li>very silky and humid days are no longer a problem.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m posting this for the natural/kinky/curly ladies who sometimes seek straight hair days.  </li>
      <li>It really smooths your hair.</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>Like someone else said, it&#x27;s very perfume like, but not my taste.   </li>
      <li>Someone told me that this product was specifically for women of color, but it works SO good with my hair; other products just haven&#x27;t shown me the same results.  </li>
      <li>I mostly use it whenever I decide to flat iron my hair, since it&#x27;s naturally curly.  </li>
      <li>Normally this product works very well .</li>
      <li>This product has left my hair feeling silky and full of body.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and very manageable.</li>
      <li>I live in a humid climate</li>
      <li>I purchased to use in conjuction with Mizani Thermasmooth when I blow dry my hair with hopes that it would prevent it from being dry and more damaged.</li>
      <li>No complaints, easy and silky, no residue left over after styling on natural/thick African american hair.  </li>
      <li>Much cheaper then buying it in  African American/Hair Store...</li>
      <li>Use on my 6yr old.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>works well with me daughters soft curly hair</li>
      <li>Even when it&#x27;s humid outside, my hair won&#x27;t curl and frizz up as much.  </li>
      <li>Do not buy unless you buy it from a beauty supply store or directly from a Mizani distributor .</li>
      <li>My daughter said it has an old lady smell and after she said that , I see what she means.</li>
      <li>You want to make sure the serum is protecting all your hair but be careful not to use too much because a little goes a long way !</li>
      <li>I go thru a bottle every 3-4 months, but it is worth it for predictable styling.</li>
      <li>It is kind of expensive, but it lasts about three months if you wash every week like I do.</li>
      <li>I wear my hair natural always, but for a change I decides to flat iron.</li>
      <li>It has a spicy fresh scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>One bottle usually lasts me about 3 months, so I think the price is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>Thus, I have to be careful with products because they often dry my hair and make it brittle and cause it to be very damaged.  </li>

<li> I use it daily before using my flat iron.</li>
<li> I have African American hair that has a tight natural curl.  </li>
<li> This product cured me of all those problems and now I can flat iron my hair without damage!</li>
<li> My advice is to be careful how much you use at a time as it can make your hair heavy.  </li>
<li> and is thicker, which tells me the Amazon version (at least from this seller) is a knock-off rather than the real thing.  </li>
<li> I have been using Mizani Therma Strength for a long time</li>
<li> I will be using this product as long as I can locate it.</li>
<li> My stylist used this on my wet hair, blew it dry with a hair dryer, then flat ironed it.  </li>
<li> I use it while my hair is wet before blow drying.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had my current bottle of Mizani Therma Strength for over a year - one small pump run through damp hair is all you need.</li>
<li> I usually buy it local but the price on Amazon was about 10.00 less</li>
<li> My hair is extremely coarse, thick and unruly.  </li>
<li> What a let down.</li>
<li> Or it&#x27;s watered down or something.  </li>
<li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has hair that is thick, difficult to manage, or dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve use a little of this each day and it smells like heaven.</li>
<li> When I skip using it for a while, my hair gets super dry and looks awful.  </li>
<li> Just one small pump works throughout my hair.</li>
<li> So use small amounts until you achieve the look you prefer.  </li>
<li> This product works wonders for my thick, unruly hair.</li>
<li> Randomly I was not able to find this in store</li>
<li> Well the reason why it&#x27;s 10.00 less is because this is a fake knock off!</li>
<li> But there are sellers on here that are advertising false Mizani products .</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny, but it did leave an unpleasant feel to it.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hairdresser started using this on my hair several years ago and I haven&#x27;t found anything that is better.  I introduced it to my daughter and sister and now they are sold on it as well.  It leaves your hair feeling very silky and humid days are no longer a problem.</li>
    <li> Makes hair shiny and frizz free. Always told my hair smells great.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and does the job!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for my thick, unruly hair. I know this line is designed for women of color, which I&#x27;m not, but this product was recommended to me. Now I always use it! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has hair that is thick, difficult to manage, or dry. This product cured me of all those problems and now I can flat iron my hair without damage!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  Love the results, leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it makes my hair soft, smooth, easy to manage and smells great.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this sometimes, so I bought it. The smell was nice, but a little strong for me. Like someone else said, it&#x27;s very perfume like, but not my taste.   It didn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny, but it did leave an unpleasant feel to it.    I prefer Mizani&#x27;s Thermasmooth Smooth Guard Serum; it&#x27;s much lighter, in smell &amp; texture.</li>
    <li> I cuncur, it smells amazing, and I love using it for roller sets. Hair dries soft and full of body. I go thru a bottle every 3-4 months, but it is worth it for predictable styling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use a little of this each day and it smells like heaven. Love it. Pricey, but you don&#x27;t need much. I&#x27;ve been using this leave in conditioner for about 7 years. I go through about a bottle every 6 months. Smell it and you&#x27;ll be a fan.</li>
    <li> Great deal and fast delivery, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 1 1/2 years now and it hasn&#x27;t been easy finding products that help me achieve optimum straight results.  My stylist used this on my wet hair, blew it dry with a hair dryer, then flat ironed it.  The results are so good people think I relaxed my hair.  This product has left my hair feeling silky and full of body.  I&#x27;m posting this for the natural/kinky/curly ladies who sometimes seek straight hair days.  Try this product.  For those who are into hair typing, I don&#x27;t know my exact hair type, but it is of varying degrees in the level 4 range.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product about 3 years ago and I&#x27;ve yet to find another that can match up to it.  My hair is extremely coarse, thick and unruly.  Someone told me that this product was specifically for women of color, but it works SO good with my hair; other products just haven&#x27;t shown me the same results.  I mostly use it whenever I decide to flat iron my hair, since it&#x27;s naturally curly.  When I use this product it makes my hair look so much healthier!  One bottle usually lasts me about 3 months, so I think the price is well worth it.  It leaves your hair soft and shiny.  Even when it&#x27;s humid outside, my hair won&#x27;t curl and frizz up as much.  I just wish they made a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Just one small pump works throughout my hair. I live in a humid climate And my hair gets frizzy. This works great to stop the frizz. My friend who works in the hair industry recoended it and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 yeas! Gives a smooth blowout.</li>
    <li> No complaints, easy and silky, no residue left over after styling on natural/thick African american hair.  Use on my 6yr old.</li>
    <li> I use this leave in treatment every week when I get my wash and set at the local Dominican beauty salon.  I have fine, 4c hair that is relaxed with Mizani Classic Rhelaxer, so if my hair goes more than 8 days without a wash, I&#x27;m heading for damage.  I wash out with Botanifying Shampoo and Fulfyl Conditioning treatment, which I bring and they don&#x27;t charge me extra for.  This leave in is excellent, because it smells good and you only need like three or four pumps for shoulder length hair before styling your hair with rollers.  It is kind of expensive, but it lasts about three months if you wash every week like I do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my current bottle of Mizani Therma Strength for over a year - one small pump run through damp hair is all you need. My hair smells SO nice whenever I use it. It has a spicy fresh scent that is not overwhelming. Additionally, it really is effective at smoothing hair and it seems to really be protected from the heat of my blowdryer and curling iron, plus it looks shiny to boot. Give this one a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazeballs.  When I skip using it for a while, my hair gets super dry and looks awful.  That said, I knocked one star off because I think you should buy from a salon instead of Amazon.  I have done both and the salon formula smells different (better!) and is thicker, which tells me the Amazon version (at least from this seller) is a knock-off rather than the real thing.  Or it&#x27;s watered down or something.  Good product, just make sure you get the real thing.</li>
    <li> love this hjeat protectant for my daughters hair.  getting ready to order more.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel soft and amazingly easy to do into a style... LOVE the SECENT..... Much cheaper then buying it in  African American/Hair Store...</li>
    <li> I love this heat protectant and it smells awesome. I&#x27;ve used this for 5 years now.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It really keeps out humidity better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and makes hair feel smooth after flat ironing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mizani Therma Strength for a long time and I love it. I usually buy it local but the price on Amazon was about 10.00 less so I decided to purchase it through Amazon. Well the reason why it&#x27;s 10.00 less is because this is a fake knock off! The picture of the product shown online here is not what you will get. I compared my current bottle to the one I received and there were definitely discrepancies. What a let down. Sold by NewvoBeauty and Fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have African American hair that has a tight natural curl.  I love my hair just the way God made it.  However, I do use a relaxer.  Thus, I have to be careful with products because they often dry my hair and make it brittle and cause it to be very damaged.  This product is part of a system that WORKS!  I hope they never stop making it.  My advice is to be careful how much you use at a time as it can make your hair heavy.  So use small amounts until you achieve the look you prefer.  Use the whole system and love your hair even more!</li>
    <li> Randomly I was not able to find this in store so I got in online. It works just as well! I use it daily before using my flat iron. It keeps my hair from drying out and allows it to be smooth. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair natural always, but for a change I decides to flat iron. My hair is so beautiful. Everyone thinks I have a perm. This product is amazing. It really smooths your hair.</li>
    <li> I use Mizani products all the time.  All products made by this manufacturer work for me.  I will continue to use the products because they are high quality and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love the product but not the best quality for my hair type. works well with me daughters soft curly hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also natural &amp; found that this is great for protecting your hair from heat, it leaves the hair soft, light &amp; full of body. I use it while my hair is wet before blow drying. You want to make sure the serum is protecting all your hair but be careful not to use too much because a little goes a long way !</li>
    <li> Do not buy unless you buy it from a beauty supply store or directly from a Mizani distributor . Normally this product works very well . But there are sellers on here that are advertising false Mizani products . When I reviewed this product the print on the bottle was not the same as the authentic even the consistency of the product was much more watery . I ended up throwing it away after I used it on my hair . It did nothing for my hair</li>
    <li> Great product for ethnic hair!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome and leaves  your hair smoothe and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this in my hair</li>
    <li> Love it left hair silky</li>
    <li> My daughter said it has an old lady smell and after she said that , I see what she means.</li>
    <li> I purchased to use in conjuction with Mizani Thermasmooth when I blow dry my hair with hopes that it would prevent it from being dry and more damaged. I can say I am very pleased with the results I achieved in using this product.  My hair is so soft and very manageable. I will be using this product as long as I can locate it.</li>
