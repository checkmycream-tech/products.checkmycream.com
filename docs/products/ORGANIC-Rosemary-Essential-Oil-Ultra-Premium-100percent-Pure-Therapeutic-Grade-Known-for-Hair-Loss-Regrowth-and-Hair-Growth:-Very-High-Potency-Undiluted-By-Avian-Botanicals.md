<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just a few months ago now I was introduced to wonderful world of essential oils. This is my very first bottle of Rosemary Essential OIl. The scent alone is just amazing. Not to mention all of the amazing uses that it has. As soon as it arrived, I opened it up to smell it and I just could not believe how good it really smells. It has a minty, like wintergreen type of scent. It almost really smells like sweet peppermint. I was offered the opportunity to receive this Aviano Botanicals Rosemary 100% Pure Essential Oil in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. While waiting for it to ship, I did my research. I discovered that Rosemary is said to affect the Immune, Respiratory, and Nervous System. It is also said to affect memory, opening of the conscious mind, and assists in learning.&lt;br /&gt;Since my oil arrived I have found a few things that I really love to use it for. The first thing I found that it really helps me with is anxiety. I lost my Mom tragically a little over a year ago, and since then I often experience anxiety just out of the blue. I found that by adding a single drop of Rosemary Oil to my hands, then rub them together, and cup my hands over my nose and mouth to flood my senses. I do that for around a minute and within just a few minutes, I suddenly instantly start getting relief of the anxiety. Not even prescription anxiety medications help that quickly. I also found that its excellent to soothe a cough. My husband has been battling a cold and seasonal allergies. He has had a nasty cough. I mixed up a combination of 2-3 drops of the rosemary oil with a teaspoon of fractionated coconut oil to be sure that it didn&#x27;t irritate his skin. We applied the oil over his throat and chest. We did that every few hours just as needed. I honestly can say that it was better than leading cough drops. I have now made a Rosemary/water rinse that I apply to my hair after shampooing it. It is said to help to prevent dandruff and also to reduce oils in my hair that can cause hair to look oily or greasy even when freshly washed. My final and favorite use that I have found that I love to use Rosemary for is to get rid of a darn headache. I simply mix 1-2 drops of it with a 1/2 teaspoon topically to my temples. I also discovered that it also works just as well if you apply a drop or two to your hands and just inhale it for about a minute. This is now one of my favorite Essential Oils by far. I am very much pleased with this brand of Rosemary Essential Oil and its quality. I also am overall beyond pleased with my purchase.se hair to look oily or greasy even when freshly washed.

    <li> This was the first time I have ever used rosemary oil and after doing some research, I don&#x27;t know why I have gone so long without it! There are so many different uses and so many different types of health benefits of incorporating this oil into your life. Here are just a few uses for this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Boosts your immune system - Both massage and inhalation of rosemary oil decreases cortisol levels in your system. It also helps combat diseases caused by free radicals such as cancer and heart disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Treatment of respiratory problems - The scent of Rosemary oil has proven to be effective in relieving throat congestion and can be used to treat infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Relieves pain - massaging oil to affected areas will help relieve pain, as well as stimulate blood circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Treatment of acne (my biggest issue) - Rosemary oil has powerful disinfectant and antiseptic properties that help to treat acne and oily skin conditions... just massage it into your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Hair benefits - promotes hair growth by stimulation the hair follicles. You can mix it with coconut or argan oils and create a hair mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil smells amazing and is very high quality. It arrived very quickly and was packaged in bubble wrap to ensure it arrived here safely. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone! *I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I recently jumped on the essential oils trend and I&#x27;ve tried several different types of oils but I hadn&#x27;t tried the rosemary one. I figured I needed to add rosemary to my collection as rosemary has so many different healing properties. I suffer from anxiety and I try and use oils as much as possible to help calm my nerves. This rosemary came in an amber bottle with a dropper top, and it was packaged nicely. The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was it had a strong smell of pine, I was expecting it to smell like an herb, but it almost smells like a cross between Pine and Peppermint. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. I honestly have never used fresh rosemary so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too. This oil diffuses nicely into the air, and leaves me feeling calm and less stressed. I also place a couple drops in my hands and smell it when I&#x27;m feeling anxious, so far it seems to be helping. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this oil. I was able to purchase this oil during a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Very helpful for my leg cramps at night!!</li>
    <li> I would not buy again</li>
    <li> Rosemary oil is an amazing oil for your hair. Regular use of rosemary oil helps to stimulate follicles, making hair grow longer and stronger. Rosemary essential oil is also beneficial for dry and flaky scalps. Regular massaging of the scalp with rosemary oil nourishes the scalp and removes dandruff. I love doing my coconut treatments for my hair with a couple drops of this oil. I get a really dry scalp in the change of seasons and this really helps. Rosemary oil is also great for other things asides hair, breathing in rosemary essential oil can help relieve anxiety. I also like to rub it on my feet in the morning and night to help with fatigue.  I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> WOW!! This is my first purchase of Rosemary oil. I knew it was pretty strong just from certain products that I purchased that had this as an ingredient in it but when I first opened the box, the smell was so strong I was sure it had either leaked or the bottle had cracked. To my surprise it wasn&#x27;t either. It&#x27;s just that strong!! It doesn&#x27;t bother me though. My purpose in getting this was to use to mix in with my own hair butter concoctions as it has so many benefits with hair growth!</li>
    <li> great to use and vary healthy,,,,</li>
    <li> Excellent essential oil! Good price and timely delivery!</li>
    <li> This Rosemary oil smells AMAZING. A hint of minty goodness!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small, but the dropper lid helps you control how much you use, so you can make it last longer!&lt;br /&gt;I could smell this right out of the package, before I even opened the bottle! I put a couple drops of this into my diffuser each morning, and let the whole living room fill up with a wonderful minty aroma!&lt;br /&gt;There are many uses you can find for Rosemary oil, just do a quick search. Because this is therapeutic grade and 100% pure, it&#x27;s safe to use in your soaps, lotions etc. I have a roller bottle that I plan to put some into!&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an awesome essential Oil, and I recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free for the purpose of an honest review. My opinion is my own and is not influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> The product is as labeled, and came sufficiently packaged to ensure it wouldn&#x27;t break on delivery. However, the container is not sealed properly, so a small amount of the product leaked into the packaging and could be smelled before being opened. This seems to me like a pretty inexcusable error considering the nature of the product.</li>
    <li> used only a little from it, since the bottle fell accidently and content lost. I will need to purchase another soon.</li>
    <li> Wow! I received this package and opened the box, instantly I smelled it. I though &amp;#34;oh no, it must have came unsealed and spilled everywhere&amp;#34;. I continued through the packing and the bottle was perfect. Wrapped in bubble wrap, then inside a small ziplock type bag, in a box with air bubble packs and a couple other things. The oil is just that strong I could smell it. The bottle was still sealed well and the plastic band around the top was not broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosemary oil has several uses, I use it for sleep, rest, anxiety, hair care, pet shampoo and conditioner. I instantly started a diffuser going with 3 drops lavender and 2 drops rosemary in the tank. It was wonderful, the entire house had a very light calming aroma. I add 3-5 drops per bottle of shampoo. It helps with dandruff, smells amazing, is very refreshing and feels clean. Helps with hair growth also and strengthens hair. I have very coarse curly hair and it needs all the help it can get for strength and moisture. I also use it in hair gel, I make my own out of flax seed, I have to make it every 3-5 days as it has no preservatives in it and I only make about a cup at the most in a batch and 2 drops works perfect in it. I add it to pet shampoo, it seems to help with dry itchy dog skin and the smell keeps fleas away I think, even though I have never read that anywhere. When this ad stated it was 3X stronger than other brands out there I would believe it after the smell. It is packaged in a 10 ML, (1/3 ounce) brown glass bottle with a dropper for ease of use. I have used lots of different brands of rosemary oil and by far this is the strongest I have ever had the pleasure if using. I will be adding it to lotions and other things shortly I am sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This label doesn&#x27;t state how it is processed, all it states is manufactured by: Aviano Botanicals, LLC, Dallas Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

    <li> good product, useful in so many ways, been using it daily.</li>
    <li> This essential oil does have almost a minty odor when you sniff the pure oil in the vial, but in a diffuser, it&#x27;s a bit more pine-like. Rosemary is a member of the mint family and it shares b-pinene and limonene with relative peppermint, so it can be a bit mint-like. It&#x27;s used as a treatment for hair growth when diluted in neutral oil, as a stimulant to mental acuity in diffusers. It should not be used if you are pregnant or have high blood pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil comes in an Amber vial with a dropper cap. Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> i was given this Rosemary Essential Oil Ultra Premium 100% at a low cost for my review and i am so glad i was able to test this is so nice i bought this for my hair because i have very fine hair and while using this i found it to bring shin and put bounce back into my curls....this is also used for so many other reason and i just know you will find a great reason to use this in your home so i would say run and buy one for your home</li>
    <li> It came in the mail today. I don&#x27;t know if it does anything, but is sure does smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> I liked how strong the rosemary oil is.  It smelled a lot like peppermint to me.  This was my first time trying Rosemary undiluted essential oil.  I thought it smelled good, and a drop goes a long way.  I also like the glass eye dropper that the bottle comes with.  I received product for free for my opinion.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell so much, but it was useful. It is used for many different purposes, but I decided to use it to stimulate hair follicles. I hope it helps the length and strength of my hair! I&#x27;ll update my review in about a month or so. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this pure Rosemary Essential Oil&#x27;s quality and aroma, and the manufacturer is right about it being more concentrated than others I&#x27;ve purchased before.  It&#x27;s delightful woodsy minty scent is every bit as lovely as the rosemary I clipped from my garden but even more powerful, so this 10ml bottle should last me a while since I don&#x27;t need to use as much of this in my home made cream and shampoo as I used to use with the brands I bought before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanicals Rosemary Essential Oil is 100% pure, undiluted, not combined with carrier oils or any other extender, is highly concentrated, and comes with a dropper so it&#x27;s easy to measure out the exact amount of drops you need. It&#x27;s perfect for adding to my home made whipped Shea Butter skin cream, because Rosemary is a powerful antioxidant with the same free radical fighting power as goji berries!

    <li> I recently received this oil and I have already fallen in love with it! Rosemary has an excellent reputation for oily skin, scalp and hair care, and it can be helpful with hair loss. Purchased this as an ingredient I use in my homemade shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosemary oils is one of the best for the scalp and is refreshing in hair products. My hair loves this!!! I use it as a hair treatment to thicken my hair in mixture of coconut and argan oils. Before this homemade treatment I used to see lots of hair in my hands after shampooing and putting conditioner in my hair, and now after just a two weeks of using this oil it has almost completely stopped! Way faster results than expected. I would recommend this essential oil for scalp massage combined with castor oil. Works excellent for stimulating hair grow and the smell is very nice too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation purposes, my review is based on my experience with the product which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> This is my very first bottle of Rosemary oil I have ever owned. The bottle came nicely packaged in bubble wrap and I could smell a very mint-like scent even before I opened the package. The bottle is made out of glass which is great to keep the oil pure, fresh and toxin free. The smell of the oil is soothing and very calming and I completely love it. I purchased this item using a one time promotional code, this review is written in my own words.  Rosemary oil is so good for hair growth, mental stimulation and great for aroma therapy. I have recently began to replace commercial cosmetics, lotions and pain relief remedies for natural oils. Aviano offers a very pure and condensed oil that is 3X more potent than most rosemary oils out there. Since the oil is so versatile it can be used to strengthen and relax the mind, body and spirit.  I place a couple of drops of oil in my shampoo and my hair has gotten softer, stronger and has even grown more! I have also used the oil to reduce anxiety and stress, the smell calms my mind and when placed in an infuser the scent is very relaxing. The oil is potent and when placed on the skin, the aroma fills the room and removes bad odors and negative vibes! I would highly recommend the purchase of this oil for a natural and healing remedy for stress, hair loss and mental stimulation.</li>
    <li> I just love this oil, I have bought two bottles of it already. I love the smell. Now I don&#x27;t have a problem with the smell, it is strong, at least my son says it is strong, he can smell it before we get to the mail box. But I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops in my shampoo and my conditioner. I also put it on my scalp and massage it to help my hair grow, haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but I know that takes time. I also mix it with coconut oil and rub in my scalp and hair and leave it overnight and wash out the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Rosemary will also make your hair shiny if you use a little bit and just leave it in.&lt;br /&gt;I have read that is will also keep you alert if you smell it. so I have some sitting on my desk. I will be buying more from this company.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely satisfied with the quality of the product that I have received. It&#x27;s is so much better than expected, and I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder if there are bigger bottles of this wonderful stuff...unfortunately they don&#x27;t make any, but I will definitely become a loyal customer. I have smelled all types of &amp;#34;100% Rosemary Oil&amp;#34; and none beat this. It is very potent. And it leaves you feeling so clean. It&#x27;s really great stuff. I use a drop or two on my hair every day and it&#x27;s made my hair silky and it has even helped with my hair growth. Buy this product and you won&#x27;t regret a penny of it. (Be advised that the scent is really strong.)</li>
    <li> The bottle was broken and most of the liquid was spilled on the box..</li>
    <li> I received the rosemarry oil in the mail and I could smell it without opening the package. It is pretty noticeable smel which is very soothing. Risemary oil does wonders for hair. I get headaches very often and due to headache I lose lots of hair. Whole day my hair shedd like no one business. I was so tired of seeing my hair all over the places. I started using rosemary oil for scalp massage mixing it with argan oil. I apply it in my scalp n hair for few hpurs before shower. After wash my hair are frizz free and silky. I have noticed change in my hair growth and hair lose. Im losing very few hair now which is naturally. I was going crazy to see hair lise before. I was thinking I would bold soon if my hair will keep losing in this speed but luckily I got the opportunity to try rosemarry oil on a promotional discount and Im absolutely glad with performance of rosemary oil.</li>
    <li> I am a firm believer on the benefits of aromatherapy so I am constantly looking for the most pure and concentrated oils in the market. I was offered this oil in a great deal to insect it and share my honest opinion. This oil is a undiluted strength and it has a powerful refreshing smell. I do use rosemary for several ailments including headaches and body aches from working out. This oil is just fantastic and also rosemary is very uplifting and mind clearing so when I combine with my lavender oil in my tub I can&#x27;t help it but to feel awesome when I am done. As any other oil do a small test before you go full strength on your skin, I do recommend diluting on some fractioned coconut oil or other oil carrier. Buy with confidence I am truly satisfied with this brand.</li>
