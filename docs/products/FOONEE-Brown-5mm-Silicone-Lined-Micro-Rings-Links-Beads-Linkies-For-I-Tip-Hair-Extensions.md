      <li>For one, they are WAY better than the beads that came with the extensions.</li>
      <li>Not the best ones I&#x27;ve ever used, but they do hold the hair in fairly well for a few weeks before they all start sliding out.</li>

      <li>Easy to use, stay in hair until you take them out.  </li>
      <li>they seem good quality, but the silicone can slide in and out when not closed.</li>
      <li>i love the price for how much you get!</li>
      <li>they hold extremely better and they are reusable unlike these ones which ones you use them, they are more likely not to be reusable again.</li>
      <li>Color is great for blending into all dark hair colors.  </li>
      <li>I have also used these micro beads a bunch within the first two days of having them and they&#x27;re pretty easily removed and installed.</li>

    <li> Item works great when adding extensions, feathers, tinsel and other items added to hair - great item to have and will get more.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, stay in hair until you take them out.  I had extensions in for weeks and these didn&#x27;t slip one bit until it was time to take them out.  Matched my hair really well. Once in, you couldn&#x27;t see them at all.</li>
    <li> After a while they become silver...(((</li>
    <li> love these beads! can&#x27;t beat the price and the lining prevents damage and breakage to the hair. a win. socks.</li>
    <li> Work just as I expected!</li>
    <li> The beads are too big to even work with</li>
    <li> The product was sent on time. It was sent with the correct amount of beads! I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered much faster than I ever anticipated. I have also used these micro beads a bunch within the first two days of having them and they&#x27;re pretty easily removed and installed. I find them to be an overall fantastic buy. A good investment for anyone planning to install extensions; however, I recommend the tip of any extensions to be glued securely before being threaded into this product.</li>
    <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth.&amp;&amp; they were at a  grate price. &amp;&amp; they arrived  earlier then said.I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with some synthetic feather hair extensions I bought, and so far they&#x27;ve worked great! For one, they are WAY better than the beads that came with the extensions. Upon visual inspection, all the beads in the bag still have the silicone in them. They are also the perfect size for the hair extension, and when I pinched them closed with pliers, they didn&#x27;t break. One of the beads lost it&#x27;s lining while I was trying to put it in, but I just pushed it back in, and that bead has been in my hair for 5 days now. I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> loved them they were exactly what i needed!!♥ they didnt even take long to arrive. just when i needed them i had them at my mailbox</li>
    <li> This beads come in a little container. They are easy to use, and stays in your hair for a long period!</li>
    <li> Just came in the mail, 189/200 were in the mini Ziploc bag it&#x27;s cheaper here than at the store, but you get what you pay for :/ they seem good quality, but the silicone can slide in and out when not closed.</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  Just be aware that this does shop from China. If you need them in a hurry,  look elsewhere.  If you can wait,  then definitely worth a try for the price.</li>
    <li> i love these because although i have blonde hair they are hidden nicely in my hair. they hold pretty good! i love the price for how much you get! would buy again! fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I bought these and they were of terrible quality.i like the longer tube ones the best. they hold extremely better and they are reusable unlike these ones which ones you use them, they are more likely not to be reusable again.</li>
    <li> THEY ARRIVED ON TIME, COLOR IS PERFECT,SIZE JUST RIGHT,BEADS LOOK JUST LIKE DESCRIBED, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY HAPPY:)) I WILL SHOP AGAIN.</li>
    <li> These beads break when closed and if you can&#x27;t close them they are worthless.  The silicon slides out and in fact a lot was already out when it did arrive.  I would not use these at all, trash.</li>
    <li> Not the best ones I&#x27;ve ever used, but they do hold the hair in fairly well for a few weeks before they all start sliding out. I like the longer ones better, but these are okay for the price.</li>
    <li> I have bought several beads but must say these have been the best yet! Have not lost any of the silicone linings while applying.</li>
    <li> We loved this product in our shop.  It held the hair extentions in well.  WE will order again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These silicone lined beads are the smallest &amp; best I&#x27;ve used for hair extensions.  Color is great for blending into all dark hair colors.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice they stay in my hair really well and I have not had any slip out. They are the perfect brown color to blend into my hair. DEFINATLY going to keep buying these</li>
    <li> The inside helps the grip of the beads a lot. Stay well, good product.</li>
    <li> These are really easy to use.  They actually let you re open to move the extensions up getting a double use out of them.</li>
    <li> These beads turned silver after about four weeks in my hair. I even tried coloring them with a Sharpie and the color wouldn&#x27;t hold.</li>
