      <li>summer in a bottle ladies love it!!!!!</li>
      <li>This smells like coconut and lime, perfect for summer and the beach.  </li>
      <li>This reminds me of my vacations in Costa Rica: relaxing at a beautiful resort on the beach drinking pina colada.</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful scent but it doesn&#x27;t flow with me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great summer fragrance from Creed.</li>
      <li>This was great.</li>
      <li>did purchase this on Amazon by Amazon and shipped via Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great purchase.  </li>
      <li>Its a great scent, but the longevity and projection just isn&#x27;t there for this one.</li>
      <li>Smells great and is offered at a great price an amazon</li>
      <li>Great for the beach or when</li>
      <li>Absolutely excellent fragrance from this very consistent house.</li>
      <li>It was authentic and the price was great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This, like many Creeds, makes a great blind-buy if you can afford it.</li>
      <li>Smells great and like most Creed products</li>
      <li>If you want good smelling and cheap buy the Tommy Bahama if you want great smell and longevity buy this.</li>

      <li>Interesting!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing</li>
      <li>safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Creed Virgin Island Water smells absolutely incredible but, and this is a rather large</li>
      <li>Superb masculine fragrance.</li>
      <li>Creed Virgin Island Water is the perfect summer fragrance for those who like a light clean fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful -- deep, substantial coconut/tropical scent that evolves over time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I haven&#x27;t received as many compliments with this one as I had hoped to, but when I asked others opinions, they say they love it.</li>
      <li>I thought it had more of a coconut</li>
      <li>I hope you also get authentic Creed.  </li>
      <li>Can be used as unisex, but better for females in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite Creed cologne but its in my top 5 favorite!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Love this unisex fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Wondering if this is authentic.&lt;br /&gt;Smells more &#x27;lemony&#x27; than I remember.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite Creed.</li>
      <li>This is my all-time favorite fragrance.  </li>
      <li>One of my top cologne&#x27;s in my collection Pina Colada, beach, salt water, lime margarita  </li>
      <li>I loved this fragrance the first time I received as a gift.  </li>
      <li>The only reason that I gave it 2 stars is because it smells incredible.</li>
      <li>I own Aventus and Original Santal, those are well worth the money.</li>
      <li>My very favorite cologne, expectations were high and they delivered.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a safe, fun summer scent.</li>
      <li>cologne embodies the spirit of a sunny summers day of fun!</li>
      <li>I receive many more compliments with the other Creed fragrances that I own (Original Santal/Aventus).</li>
      <li>Great quality as can always be expected by the Creed fragrance house.</li>
      <li>I love scent and the fact that you don&#x27;t need to wear so much of it.  </li>
      <li>Clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>quick notes...</li>
      <li>When I first got this fragrance, I loved it, and I sprayed a lot on me (6-8 sprays) and it still only lasted 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you can imagine yourself laying on the beach drinking rum out of a  coconut next to some sexy ladies, that what this cologne smells like!</li>
      <li>fragrance is great year round, even though it is a summer fragrance.</li>
      <li>+ hours later and could still smell it on my skin so the longevity on this is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>or so it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>believe something happened to the original Blue cap with the square emblem on top.  </li>
      <li>&quot; right underneath.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Mine came with a Silver cap with the emblem in a blue circle at the top.  </li>
      <li>but it seems that the blue-capped models have a slightly different formulation that gives it more of a parfum- styled length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I get compliments all the time from my wife and others of how understated and crisp is smells.</li>
      <li>For quality you just have to pay the higher prices.</li>
      <li>The product was as advertised, and the price was more reasonable than my last purchase at a perfume retail store!</li>
      <li>I am tempted to buy a second bottle right now in spite of the fact that my first is still 3/4 full.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m telling you, as much as it costs for this stuff, don&#x27;t do it, you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
      <li>Retails at $330,would not spend that much but for $150</li>
      <li>It smells absolutely divine n</li>
      <li>But to no prevail, it was to good to be true, the scent was not even close to what i have used in the past, sprayed some on, it only lasted about an hour.</li>
      <li>Most of the other Creeds are monsters at longevity and projection.</li>
      <li>Product didn&#x27;t have original blue cap.  </li>
      <li>It is almost as if the original blue cap was damaged or lost and someone unknowingly replaced it with the 1 oz.</li>
      <li>I was lucky to receive a newer bottle with blue cap.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend adding this to your collection.</li>
      <li>Upon the initial spray I thought it was too strong, BUT the fragrance developed from the initial &#x27;spicy&#x27; smell to a gentler scent that I can&#x27;t really describe.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of fresh coconuts, and a mild sea breeze; it&#x27;s also long lasting.</li>
      <li>Real juice just make sure you order from amazon direct and you won&#x27;t be disappointed smells great and lasts long</li>
      <li>If you buy directly from Amazon (it should say &amp;#34;shipped and sold from Amazon.com)</li>
      <li>purchased this fragrance directly from Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is definitely a mature (but not old-timer) cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I get more compliments with Virgin Island Water than I do with Green Irish Tweed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried a small vial of this prior to purchasing and just fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>but thats normal for creed especially virgin island water which isn&#x27;t supposed to choke people out</li>
      <li>It only last on my skin for about 4 hours max, and the projection is probably only for about the first hour or so.</li>
      <li>it has a lot of silver lettering everywhere on the outside and when you open the main \\&quot;flap\\</li>
      <li>Everything seemed legit, but once I opened the package, the color was noticeably different from the clear transparent color of the liquid I would see in retail stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone as far as contacting Creed to see if I can purchase the actual Blue cap to complete the \\&quot;look\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Very expensive though...just remind your husbands when their looking for a nice gift to give you!</li>

<li> But to spend a few hundred dollars on a bottle of cologne that you spray on before leaving for work and is gone by the time you walk out the door is down right foolish.</li>
<li> How long does it last?</li>
<li> it&#x27;s called set sail st barts, but it does not last very long.  </li>
<li> the accompanying leaflet is in english and IS folded in the Creed offset with the the 4 languages in gold lettering English, Francais (with the little symbol under the c), Italiano and Deutsch exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it has the single ball bearing and metal spring.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

<li> extremely embroidered with the creed name, swords crossing, and crown with feathers.&lt;br</li>
<li> Maybe less is more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it has the slight curve to the \\&quot;straw\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
<li> I would say that 90% of the fragrance is gone in less than 5 minutes.</li>
<li> Box looked a little beat.  </li>
<li> It had a yellowish tint, smelled like something was missing, and lasted for no more than 30 minutes once applied.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with longevity of the fragrance -</li>
<li> Too bad you&#x27;ll be the only one who knows it.</li>
<li> people claim Creed is a niche overpriced boutique brand and hate them, but I don&#x27;t mind wasting a few dollars every few months on them.</li>
<li> it has the white base when you take the nozzle</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed :/</li>
<li> If you think the longevity is bad, it may just be your nose.</li>

    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t sealed. Product didn&#x27;t have original blue cap.  Box looked a little beat.  Wondering if this is authentic.&lt;br /&gt;Smells more &#x27;lemony&#x27; than I remember.  I thought it had more of a coconut scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed :/</li>
    <li> This smells like coconut and lime, perfect for summer and the beach.  Retails at $330,would not spend that much but for $150 or so it is worth it.  Tommy Bahama makes a scent that is similar for under $30. it&#x27;s called set sail st barts, but it does not last very long.  I sprayed 2 spritzes on my hand while testing it, washed my hands and showered the next day 12+ hours later and could still smell it on my skin so the longevity on this is amazing.  If you want good smelling and cheap buy the Tommy Bahama if you want great smell and longevity buy this.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite fragrance.  I was lucky to receive a newer bottle with blue cap.  I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with longevity of the fragrance - but it seems that the blue-capped models have a slightly different formulation that gives it more of a parfum- styled length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people claim Creed is a niche overpriced boutique brand and hate them, but I don&#x27;t mind wasting a few dollars every few months on them.</li>
    <li> For as much money as we spent on this I would have expected it to not smell like tea tree oil for your hair.</li>
    <li> This was great. Just like the more expensive bottles I&#x27;ve purchased from Bergdorf. The smell is divine, just like you&#x27;d think you&#x27;d smell if you lived on an island in the Caribbean.</li>
    <li> Creed Virgin Island Water is the perfect summer fragrance for those who like a light clean fresh scent. I get compliments all the time from my wife and others of how understated and crisp is smells.</li>
    <li> One of my top cologne&#x27;s in my collection Pina Colada, beach, salt water, lime margarita  summer in a bottle ladies love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the produt for several years, I just got tired from buying it from highend retail stores, so when I found it online, I thought WOW what a bargain. But to no prevail, it was to good to be true, the scent was not even close to what i have used in the past, sprayed some on, it only lasted about an hour. For quality you just have to pay the higher prices.</li>
    <li> Its a great scent, but the longevity and projection just isn&#x27;t there for this one. It only last on my skin for about 4 hours max, and the projection is probably only for about the first hour or so. Most of the other Creeds are monsters at longevity and projection. For the price you pay, you want something that lasts, and this one just isn&#x27;t it. I own Aventus and Original Santal, those are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have bought Creed from Saks and I feel like this bottle I bought on amazon does not stay with me.  I feel like the fragrance disappears almost instantly.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I WAS CHARGED FOR THE CREED. I WAS NOT GIVE A TRACKING NUMBER.I HAVE WRITTEN TWICE WITH NO CONTRACTORS OR RESPONSE!!</li>
    <li> Creed Virgin Island Water smells absolutely incredible but, and this is a rather large BUT, it doesn&#x27;t last. How long does it last? I would say that 90% of the fragrance is gone in less than 5 minutes. I have tried anywhere from one to 6 sprays, same thing. It doesn&#x27;t last on my face, my body or even my clothing. And I know it&#x27;s not my skin or body chemistry because it&#x27;s the same on my girlfriend and my 5 or 6 friends who have it. For what Creed charges, if it lasted it, it would probably be worth it, at least to me. But to spend a few hundred dollars on a bottle of cologne that you spray on before leaving for work and is gone by the time you walk out the door is down right foolish. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars is because it smells incredible. Too bad you&#x27;ll be the only one who knows it.</li>
    <li> Interesting! Upon the initial spray I thought it was too strong, BUT the fragrance developed from the initial &#x27;spicy&#x27; smell to a gentler scent that I can&#x27;t really describe. I like it. I&#x27;m a female but this leans towards the male spectrum. It is definitely a mature (but not old-timer) cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE! If you don&#x27;t like it you cannot return it:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That goes for any perfumes/colognes ordered online.</li>
    <li> Tried it at a friends house and wanted it for ourselves.  Love this unisex fragrance.  Clean and fresh. We share it.</li>
    <li> Initial 2013.08.30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe something happened to the original Blue cap with the square emblem on top.  Mine came with a Silver cap with the emblem in a blue circle at the top.  It is almost as if the original blue cap was damaged or lost and someone unknowingly replaced it with the 1 oz. version cap.  Also, mine did not come \\&quot;shrink wrapped\\&quot;.  But hey, for a legit 4 oz. of Creed @ ~$160, I&#x27;ll take it.  Everything else checks out especially the scent and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some quick notes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 oz. Bottle:&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s serialized A6213P01.&lt;br /&gt;- it has the slight curve to the \\&quot;straw\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;- it has the single ball bearing and metal spring.&lt;br /&gt;- it has the white base when you take the nozzle off.&lt;br /&gt;- it has that Creed cloud spraying power.&lt;br /&gt;- everything is spelled correctly.  Hahahahaha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 oz. Box:&lt;br /&gt;- extremely embroidered with the creed name, swords crossing, and crown with feathers.&lt;br /&gt;- it has a lot of silver lettering everywhere on the outside and when you open the main \\&quot;flap\\&quot; right underneath.&lt;br /&gt;- the accompanying leaflet is in english and IS folded in the Creed offset with the the 4 languages in gold lettering English, Francais (with the little symbol under the c), Italiano and Deutsch exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase this on Amazon by Amazon and shipped via Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great purchase.  I&#x27;ve gone as far as contacting Creed to see if I can purchase the actual Blue cap to complete the \\&quot;look\\&quot;.  We&#x27;ll see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review at all helpful, please rate it as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2013.08.30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did Amazon revert its image policy???  Well, I uploaded like 12 pictures to help everyone out there on the fence.  This is the product I received on Amazon.Com by Amazon.  I hope you also get authentic Creed.  Again, If you found this review at all helpful, please rate it as such along with the pictures I uploaded.</li>
    <li> Everything seemed legit, but once I opened the package, the color was noticeably different from the clear transparent color of the liquid I would see in retail stores. It had a yellowish tint, smelled like something was missing, and lasted for no more than 30 minutes once applied. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have been a cheapskate and just purchased it at a retail location. I&#x27;m telling you, as much as it costs for this stuff, don&#x27;t do it, you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent fragrance from this very consistent house.</li>
    <li> My very favorite cologne, expectations were high and they delivered. I am tempted to buy a second bottle right now in spite of the fact that my first is still 3/4 full. GREAT stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful scent but it doesn&#x27;t flow with me.  It smells absolutely divine n my daughter so she will get another creed product courtesy of her mom.</li>
    <li> Smells great and like most Creed products it&#x27;s different each time you use it.</li>
    <li> I love scent and the fact that you don&#x27;t need to wear so much of it.  The scent lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this perfume.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Creed.</li>
    <li> The scent is gone in five minutes.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised, and the price was more reasonable than my last purchase at a perfume retail store!</li>
    <li> Like Aventus, this is a fragrance that will make you suffer from olfactory fatigue. If you think the longevity is bad, it may just be your nose. When I first got this fragrance, I loved it, and I sprayed a lot on me (6-8 sprays) and it still only lasted 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as time went on, I only put 3-4 sprays on me. I sprayed on my chest, back of neck, and my outer forearm. I could smell this fragrance after 8 hours, and it projected as well. Maybe less is more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are constantly putting your nose up to your arm to smell this fragrance, you aren&#x27;t going to smell it after a while. I know it&#x27;s an addicting scent, but try to resist the urge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is great year round, even though it is a summer fragrance. I like to wear it in the winter to remind me of summer. This reminds me of my vacations in Costa Rica: relaxing at a beautiful resort on the beach drinking pina colada. Great for the beach or when swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts out with a lot of lime, but after ten minutes the coconut starts to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t received as many compliments with this one as I had hoped to, but when I asked others opinions, they say they love it. I receive many more compliments with the other Creed fragrances that I own (Original Santal/Aventus). However, I get more compliments with Virgin Island Water than I do with Green Irish Tweed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, like many Creeds, makes a great blind-buy if you can afford it. It&#x27;s a safe, fun summer scent. However, I would not recommend if you do not like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this fragrance directly from Amazon. It was authentic and the price was great. This fragrance is often faked, so beware of who you buy it from. If you buy directly from Amazon (it should say &amp;#34;shipped and sold from Amazon.com) then you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Logevity: 5-8 hours (varies with weather)&lt;br /&gt;Projection: Arms length (also varies with weather)&lt;br /&gt;Compliments: Some&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great summer fragrance from Creed. I highly recommend adding this to your collection.</li>
    <li> If you can imagine yourself laying on the beach drinking rum out of a  coconut next to some sexy ladies, that what this cologne smells like! Defiantly a Summer cologne for sunny days! Not my favorite Creed cologne but its in my top 5 favorite!&lt;br /&gt;This cologne embodies the spirit of a sunny summers day of fun!</li>
    <li> Superb masculine fragrance. It reminds me of fresh coconuts, and a mild sea breeze; it&#x27;s also long lasting.</li>
    <li> I loved this fragrance the first time I received as a gift.  It smells amazing and I will always keep it in my fragrance collection.</li>
    <li> Real juice just make sure you order from amazon direct and you won&#x27;t be disappointed smells great and lasts long the projection isn&#x27;t beast mode but thats normal for creed especially virgin island water which isn&#x27;t supposed to choke people out</li>
    <li> Smells great and is offered at a great price an amazon</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful -- deep, substantial coconut/tropical scent that evolves over time. Great quality as can always be expected by the Creed fragrance house. Can be used as unisex, but better for females in my opinion. Recommend use during the summer/spring when it is warmer.</li>
    <li> I tried a small vial of this prior to purchasing and just fell in love with it. Makes you feel like your at the beach on a tropical island. Just lovely! Smells like sun tan lotion mixed with various tropical smells. Very expensive though...just remind your husbands when their looking for a nice gift to give you!</li>
    <li> This did not smell like the one in the department store. Very disappointed.</li>
