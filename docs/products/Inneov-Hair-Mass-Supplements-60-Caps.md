<ol>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Great vitamins help growth and thickness!</li>
      <li>Very good!</li>
      <li>Excellent results after 3 months of use of this product.</li>
      <li>and I noticed a very good results</li>
      <li>Dear Sirs,    My daughter has been using for two months and it made a great difference in her hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for good price.</li>
      <li>but i believe its good additional boost for my system to stop loosing hair.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>I would buy more of it.</li>
      <li>I wish that I had done more research before purchasing and saved some money.</li>
      <li>I fell that my hair is getting better.</li>
      <li>Biotin supplements works better .</li>
      <li>Amazon.com is my favorite internet buying site.</li>
      <li>It s a very good product, it works, but the problem is that take too long to work (about 4 months).</li>
      <li>Its is smooth and easy to moisture now</li>
      <li>Worth every cent!</li>
      <li>and I really need to keep each hair on my head :)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very aware of my hair&#x27;s health.  </li>
      <li>I had decided to give them a try a few months ago after reading about the successful research results.</li>
      <li>I have not used these long enough to give a good account of efficacy, but wanted to point out couple things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is published clinical evidence for the use of Taurine in protecting hair bulb integrity, and with the price of Taurine I would think it would be very worth while for people concerned about hair loss to try out.</li>
      <li>She back to use more times.</li>
      <li>I will buy for the next month for sure.</li>
      <li>couple of things I want to mention - first off, yes you can probably buy each nutrient separately and take a bunch of pills every day to save money.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I already have thick, full hair, however, since using Inneov Hair Mass Supplements, my hair feels healthier, thicker, and stronger.  </li>
      <li>I really wish the FDA would let them sell this product in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like the product and will continue to use for another 6 months.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Ricardo.</li>
      <li>Personally I prefer to take one pill twice a day with a meal, get the exact nutrients in the exact proportions as in the studies and not have to fuss with the rest, so the price is worth it for me.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I plan on continuing to take the original formula and not switch to Densilogie since I already take Omega 3 gels as well as a regular multivitamin.</li>
      <li>This is one product that truly works and should be advertised more in the US, but I know the hair clinics would not to share their profits for increasing hair volumne with the general public like they do in Europe.</li>
      <li>Personally I need the anti-hair fall action; fortunately Inneov Homme still has the same combination of Taurine, Catechins, Zinc and Grapeseed oil that&#x27;s in their hair loss studies (it also has plant sterols from pine).</li>
      <li>but I do like what I see so far.</li>
      <li>Is my second lot of this product, so I still can&#x27;t evaluate that much.</li>
      <li>I really like inneov and totally recommend.</li>
      <li>The actives in this formula(150mg Taurine, 15mg Zinc, 140mg Catechins or green tea polyphenols per two tablets daily dose) are readily available-</li>
      <li>But it seems to start to work lately, I still have to wait 2 full months to give my final opinion.</li>

<li> Thanks for refunding me the shipping amount I&#x27;ve paid unnecessarily.</li>
<li> nestle and loreal spent 600 million pounds to discover that&lt;</li>

<li> Her hair is growing thicker, is not falling down</li>
<li> I have significantly less hair fall when I use them</li>
<li> It does work, my har falls a lot less after i take this supplement</li>
<li> I think it arrived a little bit after the date, but I understand.</li>
<li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zinc, taurine, green tea, and grapeseed extract, can grow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Waste of money ..</li>
<li> but it takes at least three months.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months and I&#x27;m very happy with it. before I tried with Rogaine but the results wasn&#x27;t  what I expcted to be. I started using theses pills and combine it with Rogaine just one application by night and I noticed a very good results so definitely I&#x27;m going to use them regularly.</li>
    <li> It might work for some people but I used it for 4 months and did not see any change.</li>
    <li> Very good! Recommend.</li>
    <li> Ainda estou tomando o remédio, ainda no tenho uma opinio pq acho q ainda no deu tpo pra fazer efeito...</li>
    <li> This is one product that truly works and should be advertised more in the US, but I know the hair clinics would not to share their profits for increasing hair volumne with the general public like they do in Europe.</li>
    <li> Innéov Hair Mass works for me. I have significantly less hair fall when I use them and I really need to keep each hair on my head :) I had decided to give them a try a few months ago after reading about the successful research results. I really wish the FDA would let them sell this product in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things I want to mention - first off, yes you can probably buy each nutrient separately and take a bunch of pills every day to save money. Personally I prefer to take one pill twice a day with a meal, get the exact nutrients in the exact proportions as in the studies and not have to fuss with the rest, so the price is worth it for me. I don&#x27;t appreciate people who give it a lower rating just for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, if you are a woman Innéov has recently replaced your Hair Mass formula with Densilogie - an Omega 3 mix with Vitamin D and Zinc. They don&#x27;t claim to address hair fall but instead say it increases volume and hair diameter. Personally I need the anti-hair fall action; fortunately Inneov Homme still has the same combination of Taurine, Catechins, Zinc and Grapeseed oil that&#x27;s in their hair loss studies (it also has plant sterols from pine). I plan on continuing to take the original formula and not switch to Densilogie since I already take Omega 3 gels as well as a regular multivitamin.</li>
    <li> Dear Sirs,    My daughter has been using for two months and it made a great difference in her hair. Her hair is growing thicker, is not falling down and it is shinning too.  Thanks for refunding me the shipping amount I&#x27;ve paid unnecessarily. Amazon.com is my favorite internet buying site. Thanks, Ricardo.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a damn difference ... Waste of money .. Biotin supplements works better .</li>
    <li> I have no complains about this item, I read lots of reviews and then I decided to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see the results yet but it takes at least three months.</li>
    <li> Is my second lot of this product, so I still can&#x27;t evaluate that much. But it seems to start to work lately, I still have to wait 2 full months to give my final opinion.</li>
    <li> I am using it with Vichy Dercos Aminexil Pro Women 30 monodoses and&lt;br /&gt;Vichy Dercos Energising Shampoo with Aminexil 200 ml. I haven&#x27;t finished taking them yet but i believe its good additional boost for my system to stop loosing hair. My hair loss is happen due to pregnancy.Product arrived as described and on time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have not used these long enough to give a good account of efficacy, but wanted to point out couple things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is published clinical evidence for the use of Taurine in protecting hair bulb integrity, and with the price of Taurine I would think it would be very worth while for people concerned about hair loss to try out. The actives in this formula(150mg Taurine, 15mg Zinc, 140mg Catechins or green tea polyphenols per two tablets daily dose) are readily available- and very much less expensive than the Inneov. I wish that I had done more research before purchasing and saved some money.</li>
    <li> Excellent results after 3 months of use of this product. I liked it a lot. I would buy more of it. Thanks</li>
    <li> To be fair, I already have thick, full hair, however, since using Inneov Hair Mass Supplements, my hair feels healthier, thicker, and stronger.  Although I have a lot of hair, I&#x27;ve also noticed less daily hair loss. I wash and condition my hair daily and I&#x27;m very aware of my hair&#x27;s health.  I&#x27;ve already recommended this product to a friend.  I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I fell that my hair is getting better. Its is smooth and easy to moisture now and I&#x27;m using it for almost a month. Good product. I will buy for the next month for sure.</li>
    <li> nestle and loreal spent 600 million pounds to discover that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zinc, taurine, green tea, and grapeseed extract, can grow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;much cheaper to just get those capsules individually&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;absolute joke of a product</li>
    <li> I really like the product and will continue to use for another 6 months. It has improved my hair growth however Signature Required for shipping is a hassle since I work all day and will never be there to receive the item. I received the product 10 days later due to that.</li>
    <li> It does work, my har falls a lot less after i take this supplement, the only problem is that is a little too expensive, but overall it does work :)</li>
    <li> I really like inneov and totally recommend. I think it arrived a little bit after the date, but I understand.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It makes the hair re grown! It was recommended by my dermatologist! Run and buy it! Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I think it is still too soon for me to make a edged in stone rating just yet.  but I do like what I see so far.</li>
    <li> I like the result after those vitamins Inneov, but I feel nausea using them. Personally, I would try another product.</li>
    <li> Great vitamins help growth and thickness!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for good price. My wife use this and approved. I recommend it. She back to use more times.</li>
    <li> It s a very good product, it works, but the problem is that take too long to work (about 4 months).</li>
    <li> For minor seasonal hair loss perhaps</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product. I tried for one year, and I noticed that my hair is stronger. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the buzz about the product. Tried for tree monthes and did not wirk for me. The only thing I got was  dizziness, after a while I start developing nausea after taking the pills. Stopped and nsusea its gone, along with my money and my hair.  No improvement on my nails either</li>
