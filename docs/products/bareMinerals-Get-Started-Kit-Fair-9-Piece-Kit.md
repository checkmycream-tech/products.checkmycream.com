<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bare Minerals is a great product. I should have tried it sooner then I would have better skin sooner too. The makeup is so light, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing any. It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays all day long. No smears, runs, or creases. A fabulous product - thrown all my other expensive cosmetics out. Bare Minerals is it for me.</li>
    <li> i was very disappointed when i received this item. i have not even opened it up to use it yet. the containers of mineral makeup are so small they look like they will last me about 2 times. there is hardly anything in there. i am seriously thinking about sending it back because of this. maybe it is good makeup but this is a rip off. even the front of the box has pictures of containers that look like there is more makeup in them. it does come with brushes and brush conditioning shampoo but that is not the reason why i ordered this product. i wanted the makeup. i already have brushes i don&#x27;t really need more. i can&#x27;t believe i payed $50 for makeup that is not even going to last me a week.</li>
    <li> I am 50 + with bad skin. Large pores on nose. splotchiness, broken capillaries, too much prior sun damage. Bare minerals gives me good coverage because it has buildable coverage. Light all over and heavier where needed. It is a little drying though. Use a good moisturizer with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my bare minerals for about a week now and so far I love this makeup. My stepmom suggested it because she&#x27;s used it for years and won&#x27;t use anything else. Somehow, I think I&#x27;ll be following in her footsteps in this one.     In the past I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my makeup. I have very oily skin and over time my makeup would just melt away. I&#x27;ve played around with a few of the drugstore mineral makeups, most recently the Maybelline mineral powder foundation. Nothing would STAY on my skin.     Pros:  -It stays on all day. I don&#x27;t need to refresh unless I&#x27;m going out later that night.   -It sucks up the oil on my face, no more greasy days.   -It is very easy to apply and I don&#x27;t have to worry about making sure to blend out that makeup line on my chin.  -It covers very well.   -It looks very natural. Even when I apply it in a heavier coat, it just looks like I put powder on.  -Its not heavy. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve got this coat of gunk all over my face.  -Even though its only been a week, my skin feels better. I definitely had less of a hormone related breakout this month.    Cons:  -It is a little drying. I suspect it is even worse because of the cold spell we&#x27;ve got here in SC. I&#x27;ve been combating this with a slightly heavier moisturizer than I normally use.   -It actually covers a little too well. I have naturally rosy cheeks and mostly makeups don&#x27;t cover them enough for me to need a blush. I had to go out and buy a blush to put some color back in my cheeks.   -it isn&#x27;t as smooth around my eyes. Right now I&#x27;m just going back over it with a cosmetic sponge to smooth it out, but I think I will try a primer with it.    Over all I&#x27;m more than satisfied with it. It did help that I listened to some very good advice and stuck with it past the first few days. The first time I put it on, it didn&#x27;t seem so great. The second time it was a little better. After about the third day, I started to get the hang of it. By day 4, I was in love with it. I would definitely suggest this makeup to my friends.     Keep in mind though, this makeup is like anything else. It works very well for some people and not as well for others.</li>
    <li> I have been using bare minerals for a year or so now, I bought the starter set first time out, and when it came to replace the stuff I ran out of(blush seems to last forever, as you use so little of it) it ended up being comparable to just but another starter kit.Happily there is a little twist to open/protect you from spilling powder everywhere thingy on the inside of the containers, which was a great bonus, since my last set didn&#x27;t have anything of the sort and was kind of messy.&lt;br /&gt;this kit lasts me over 6 months, with daily application of makeup. It is a very good deal and I get compliments often on my make-up.</li>
    <li> I love my bare mineral kit.  It looks that I&#x27;m not wearing make up at all.  It&#x27;s very light, and won&#x27;t clog your pores.  Makes your face look radiant, and very natural.  I love the fact that it comes with two different shades of foundation, that you can combine to get a more acurate natural look.  Plus the brushes are absolutely perfect.  Another thing that I love about it is that I can cover dark circles under my eyes with it, and it looks so natural.</li>
    <li> I love mineral make up. It is wonderful because it looks great and does not feel like you&#x27;re wearing make up. This is my second bare minerals starter kit. I bought the second starter kit because I really like the bare minerals brushes and it is cheaper to buy the kit than the brushes individually. Bare minerals has changed what you receive in the start kit since I first purchased it. I think the old one was better.    The first starter kit I purchased had:  - Two shades of bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation (.06 oz/2g) in Light and fairly light  - bareMinerals Mineral Veil(.06 oz/2g)  - bareMinerals Warmth All-Over Face Color (.02 oz/.57g)  - bareMinerals Glee All-Over Face Color (.02 oz/.57g)  - Handi Buki Brush  - Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush  - Flawless Application Face Brush  - How-to DVD.    The new kit has:  - TWO shades of bareMinerals SPF 15 Foundation: Light &amp; Golden Medium (Size: Medium)  - Mineral Veil (Size: Medium)  - Warmth All-Over Face Color (Size: Medium)  - Full Flawless Face Brush  - Flawless Application Face Brush  - Maximum Coverage Concealer Brush  - Prime Time  - How-to DVD.    The really differences between the two products: the old kit had a Handi Buki Brush when the new kit has Full Flawless Face Brush. I think the Handi buki brush is the better of the two brushes but both do a good job of applying the make up. The second major differences the old kit had small Warmth All-Over Face Color and Glee All-Over Face Color the new kit has a Medium Warmth All-Over Face Color. Again I think the older kit was better. Warmth is a bronzer that gives your skin a natural sun kissed glow. Glee is also a great product, it is a plum shade blush. It gives your skin a touch of natural color as if you have been exercising. Both of these products are great but you need to be careful not to use too much.    Personally without Glee my face ends up looking pale, my face really needs a little bit of color beyond the foundation, warmth and mineral veil. Glee is my absolute favorite bare minerals product. Mineral veil is a great product that is a great finishing product. It gives your face an airbrushed look.    What I do not like about bare minerals is how it sits on top of your pores and makes them look bigger. Unlike the commercials claim you do not look like you are not wearing make up in fact your look like you are wearing tons. It is a natural look but still a make up look.    Frankly, there are better mineral foundations than bare minerals my favorite is E.L.F. (eyes lips &amp; face). It has a great mineral foundation which is better than the bare minerals foundations and a fraction of the price. I like it better because it does not make your pores look bigger. E.L.F. also makes a product called mineral booster which is like mineral veil.    My overall opinion is to buy the starter kit once to get the brushes because mineral make up needs special brushes. Use what come with it and switch to a different foundation and continue using Glee and Warmth.    Mineral make up last longer if you apply a moisturizing before the make up. One trick I have learn to minimizing the appearance of pores under mineral make up is to use a acne moisturizing and let it dry before applying the make up.</li>
    <li> I have extremely pale skin, and it seemed like every makeup I tried just made me look paler and powdery.  I had a friend who wears this brand of makeup, and she suggested it to me.  I have to say I&#x27;m extremely impressed. My co-workers noticed the difference right away and all were asking why I looked so different.  They all want to get this makeup now.  I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this makeup. I no longer look pasty.  Instead, this makeup makes my complexion look healthy and natural.  The makeup is also \\&quot;light,\\&quot; so you cannot even feel it on your face.  I also like the fact that you can&#x27;t see the powder.  It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re not even wearing makeup.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using bare minerals for years and really like the product.  I buy the start up kit sometimes because it is cheaper than buying new brushes by themselves.  My one complaint about Bare Minerals is that they make it very difficult to price compare the powders because they refer to the sizes in different ways (ounces, grams, s/m/l).  It makes it challenging to buy online...and going to the mall is not convenient for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The containers are small but since you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the product, it will last me a long time. This product also does a good job over covering blemishes and the dark circles under my eyes. It&#x27;s a great value on amazon. If purchased at the store you would spend $60 for the starter kit or about $18 for the individual foundation. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have used other mineral makeup before. I normally don&#x27;t wear makeup only because I have fair sensitive skin. My skin as i&#x27;m getting older (higher 20&#x27;s) breaks out more from stress and is very red and blotchy. Now this doesn&#x27;t hide everything but it does a very good job! I also may not be the best at putting it on. I did watch the video but I can&#x27;t seem to get my face to look at flawless as the models, oh well. I can work a 9 hour work day and my face still looks as good as it did when I left. It also helped clear my skin up in tow days. Now, I do sleep in it as I don&#x27;t really wear much. I bought the started kit and I use it all. I would recommend it if you want something light and good coverage</li>
    <li> I heard that mineral makeup was the best kind to use for your skin so after seeing an infomercial for bare minerals I had to try it! It goes on so smoothly and comes with everything you need for a perfect look. I ordered fair b/c I have light/pale skin and it matches great! Love it! :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BE foundation and products for over 10 years, and I still buy starter kits from time to time for the brushes, foundation and extras. This is an excellent value kit and a great way to get started with mineral make up without a big investment.     If you like mineral make up, you will probably want to supplement the starter kit with blush, as well as eye color. I mostly use BE products for eyes/lips/cheeks, but do use other products (I like CG smoothers lipliner better than BE&#x27;s options). BE brushes are a necessity in my book, and with care they will last for many years.      I don&#x27;t agree with a previous review about this make up making pores look larger. I&#x27;ve found the opposite to be true -- here&#x27;s my suggestion:    1. Start with a good moisturizer for your skin type -- this is necessary for the foundation to blend naturally with your skin. Give it time to soak into your skin before applying the foundation.     2. It&#x27;s important to \\&quot;buff\\&quot; the foundation into your skin. Like the video says, \\&quot;swirl, tap, buff\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve found that the \\&quot;heavenly\\&quot; face brush is the best choice for me because I like a little more coverage. I actually got it as part of a different kit a few years back, but they also sell it separately.    3. Use \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot; sparingly on fair skin b/c it can look muddy if you overdo it. I do like it in the summer but have to be careful not to use too much. I&#x27;ve also found \\&quot;Bare Radiance\\&quot; is a good alternative to \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot;, and Golden Gate blush works well too.    4. Use the Mineral Veil lightly to set the make up and tone done any oily areas throughout the day. I also use along my lash line after putting on eye liner to reduce smudging on hot summer days.     Other favorite BE items: Laughter (blush), Auburn (powder for brows), Amaretto and Couture (lipsticks) and the double ended shaping brush (I use the small end for eyebrow definition, and the shaped end for foundation as concealer as needed). Good luck!</li>
    <li> I purchased the starter kit after seeing Bare Minerals on television and reading reviews online.  I have very fair sensitive skin and have been using the same foundation for years.  I wanted to try something new.  I was excited about the idea of makeup improving my skin as well as providing excellent coverage and being easy to apply.    This product did not live up to any of it&#x27;s claims.  The makeup did not provide the coverage I was used to and took longer to apply.  I found that if I tried to build coverage it just looked caked on.  The powder just sits on top of the skin.  I was uncomfortable because it was so obvious I was wearing makeup.  Bare Minerals also dried my skin out and caused itching almost as soon as I put it on.  I would not recommend this product.    I wish I had bought it from another site so I could return it.  I will be going back to my old foundation immediately.  I used \\&quot;AnyWear\\&quot; multi finish compact foundation by Prescriptives.  It is fast, looks natural, and provides excellent coverage.</li>
    <li> The kit is a great value, I just wish it came with the Prime time like it did in the past, instead of the brush conditioner :(</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THE FAIR KIT WHICH COMES WITH FAIRLY LIGHT ALSO. WAS A LITTLE WORRIED BEFORE PACKAGE ARRIVED THAT I HAD ORDERED WRONG COLOR. RECEIVED MY BARE MINERALS &amp; THE FAIRLY LIGHT SHADE WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. I LOVE THIS MAKE UP SOOO MUCH. I HAD TRIED IT A WHILE BACK WHEN THEY HAD THE OLD FORMULA AND IT WOULD LOOK WASHED OUT AND BREAK ME OUT BUT SINCE THEY HAVE UPDATED THEIR INGREDIENTS, THIS MAKE-UP IS AWESOME!TAKES NO TIME TO BUFF ON AND LOOKS FLAWLESS, FIRST APPLICATION MAY BE A LITTLE ROUGH BUT IT TAKES TIME TO GET THE HANG OF IT.</li>
    <li> This make-up is simply perfect! I am 22 with very fair skin and of course I ordered the fair color and it is just the right shade. I love that this is the click lock go set of containers, so needed for travel! I have used bareMinerals in the past, but just a few weeks ago I tried a so called knock off brand from amazon and it was horrible. It smeared across my face and left a trail all over, it enhanced ever line, pimple, and pore of my face so the very next morning after receiving it in the mail I returned it. I realize that it is more expensive to order this make-up, but it is beyond worth it. This make-up is sure to boost your confidence I know it has mine! So by all means order this product and if it doesn&#x27;t really fit in your budget don&#x27;t use it for everyday where keep it for the weekends or special events. I love mine and I am so glad I have it every morning.</li>
    <li> This is the best brans of mineral e made. It lasts forever. It is also a good way to help your daughter when she&#x27;s ready to start using makeup because it&#x27;s so natural looking and healthy too.</li>
    <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER!!! LOVE IT!!! WOULDNT GO BACK TO REGULAR MAKEUP ANYDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KINDA EXPENSIVE BUT WELL WORTH YOUR MONEY THATS FOR SURE!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
    <li> Since seeing the commercial for the first time I have wanted to try Bare Minerals but didn&#x27;t want to \\&quot;waste\\&quot; the money on another product that made promises but didn&#x27;t deliver.  I tried some of the over the counter mineral makeups but found them a complete waste of money.     I finally gave in and bought the Bare Minerals starter kit.  I am completely amazed by this product.  I have very sensitive skin and a significant red flush to my complexion.  Bare minerals covers the flaws, hides the redness, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I forget I am wearing makeup at all until I look in a mirror.      This product is everything it promises to be.</li>
    <li> I purchased the original Bare Minerals starter kit about five years ago.  I like it so much better than this one.  The old kit had Glee, which I really liked.</li>
    <li> This set is amazing! The skin has a perfect cover with this foundation and its brushes. The mineral vail complete the perfect skin.</li>
    <li> I really liked this set when I first bought it a few years ago, and used up everything except the primer (which I felt was too heavy for daily use) and I still use the brushes now. I&#x27;ve changed to a more affordable brand of mineral makeup though, one I can wear *ahem* &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; without feeling like I&#x27;m buffing gold dust into my pores because of the price. Still, the brushes have held up beautifully!</li>
    <li> There is so much HYPE on this makeup...I DO NOT LIKE IT....I had a professional put it on and show me how to use it and I still like my L&#x27;Oreal better.....</li>
    <li> Just for the record, I&#x27;m over 40 and in that horrible in-between phase where you can still get a breakout now and again but have also started getting lines. It seems most reviews aren&#x27;t really targeted at my age group and we are just a tad different in how we have to approach make-up. Oh, and a little confession: I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie. No company, no matter how exalted or humble hasn&#x27;t at least found a temporary home with me. I&#x27;m also ruthless with them and will toss or return (depending on cost) anything that doesn&#x27;t do as claimed to at least some degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I began some corrective work for skin aging and sun damage. Hey, as a teen in the 80&#x27;s I definitely tanned too much. Anyway, after starting Obagi I had to change make-up. Regular make-up just slides right off and makes you look like a plastic doll someone put make-up on. Horrible. Their recommendation was mineral make-up...of any brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my local Target and got what looked like the closest thing to mineral that I could find just to try the concept. I wound up with Cover Girl Mineral. Believe it or not, it works pretty darn well for something that cost less than 10 bucks. Of course, the jar lasts only a short time, requires a lot of product and the brush feels like a toothbrush after about a week of usage so it wasn&#x27;t a permanent solution. But having tested the concept I decided minerals would work for me and I had to choose a better company and product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Navy Exchange where I&#x27;m stationed (yes, I love the NEX) they have a large Bare Escentuals display in the cosmetics section and a very knowledgeable sales associate (who was actually wearing it) helped me select the right kit. She recommended the Get Started Kit even if I knew exactly the shade I wanted and wanted nothing but that shade in order to get the brushes. Good brushes are costly and these kits do offer a substantial savings by essentially giving them to you for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Fairly Light as the foundation and the Light for the concealer. The small brush in the kit is absolutely perfect for using the powder as concealer. I did read many of the other reviews and was confused by those reporting it didn&#x27;t work as a concealer. It works exceptionally well as a concealer when used with the right brush. In particular, under the eyes and in the inner corners where those dark shadows lurk, in small red areas and over blemishes it covered perfectly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Obagi I go through days of red skin or really dry skin, irritated skin or even peeling skin. Hence, I need something that can put me back to a normal status no matter what Obagi is doing to me that day. This foundation absolutely covered but didn&#x27;t require a smothering quantity in order to do so. On the flip side, if you&#x27;re looking for that TV level of smoothness where you&#x27;d swear their face was sculpted from Playdoh and made up with a trowel, you won&#x27;t find it here. It leaves a good bit of the natural look behind. It also doesn&#x27;t set into fine lines for me, even after 12 hour work days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mineral Veil was one I felt fairly dubious about. I mean, it looks like rice powder from some Japanese Geisha show, doesn&#x27;t it? But lo and behold, it works! I&#x27;m not quite sure how it works but I think it reflects light in such a way that it just picks up your whole complexion. I think it does make the foundation just the tiniest bit more pale, however, so use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Warmth looks very dark in the jar and I wanted nothing to do with that one. Of course, no jar can ever remain sealed in your bin of goodies forever so one Saturday I figured I had enough time to wash up and start over if I made a mess and gave it a whirl. Used with the lightest of touches it really does exactly what it claims. It doesn&#x27;t tan so much as just bring out your color a little. But, if you go after your face with the same gusto you would on the foundation, you&#x27;re going to look like aFailblog example of a bad spray tan. Just exercise some caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are, as nearly everyone will agree, fabulous. Very soft and very high quality, they also clean up well and easily using the brush cleaning material that is provided in the get started kit. Personally, I think the change in the kit is a smart one by the company. Probably the least purchased, but really necessary, item is the brush cleaner. By adding it to the kit and removing the primer, you really do have a much better kit to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like every single thing in the kit and find it to be a stellar buy. Considering the crazy conglomeration of beauty products and make-up stuffed into bins under my bathroom sink, it is saying something truly positive when I say I went back and replaced almost all my make-up with BE/bM products and they have their own bin now...on the top of the counter.me caution.

    <li> After trying several of the Bare Escentuals shadows and reading favorable reviews, I went ahead and purchased the Get Started Face Kit in Light and I could not be happier that I did.  Bare Escentuals is now my go-to foundation and I can happily say I will be tossing out all my old foundations.  Also, I would like to point out that I do not work for Bare Escentuals or any other beauty company, don&#x27;t know anyone who does, and am not receiving any kind of compensation for this review.  I&#x27;ve noticed some reviewers saying that they only people who rate this product positively are people who work for the company - which is just untrue.  First, I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have very light, sensitive skin. I have suffered from psoriasis all my life and it can be difficult for me to find face makeup that not only covers well, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with harsh chemicals or fragrances.  I need gentle products that work well with the topical medications and moisturizers I use on my skin - and finding one that meets those needs and gives great coverage has been really frustrating.  After receiving my Get Started Kit in the mail, I decided to try it for one full week before reviewing, just to see if I had any of the adverse reactions (rash, redness) some other reviewers mentioned.  Here&#x27;s what I thought:  From the very first application, I noticed complete and even coverage on all my trouble spots, decreased overall redness, and a brighter, fresher complexion - without having to use a ton of product.  The \\&quot;light\\&quot; foundation matched my skin tone perfectly and didn&#x27;t leave any \\&quot;masking\\&quot; around my hair or jaw line.  I was worried that because the foundation is fine powder, it would cling to and accentuate the tiny hairs on my face - but it didn&#x27;t.  It also worked well with my moisturizer (though I would recommend letting your moisturizer or facial medications dry completely before applying the makeup).  As a person with chronically dry skin (and occasional psoriasis patches on myforehead and along my hairline) it was important to find a foundation that didn&#x27;t over dry my skin, or call attention to spots that were already dry and flaky.  In my opinion, it is really important to use a daily moisturizer with this (and any) make up product - it is one of the only ways to combat dryness and irritation associated with dry skin.  Do not expect your foundation to do a moisturizers job!  With that said, I do think that the Bare Minerals foundation might accentuate dry spots that aren&#x27;t properly moisturized - though I didn&#x27;t experience this particular problem.  Overall, I was really impressed with the coverage I received from the Bare Minerals foundation and the way it left my face feeling soft and fresh - as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all.  The coverage lasted most of the day and I didn&#x27;t really feel the need to reapply at all.  I am really glad I got the Get Started Kit because of the different products it came with, like the Warmth face color and Mineral Veil.  (This kit is worth it for the brushes alone!  The cost of the kit was a huge savings compared to if I had bought just the brushes individually.)  For me, the foundation gave such complete, even coverage, that my face almost looked washed out or one dimensional without some added color - especially since I am so light complected.  For me, the Warmth all over color is essential.  Just a tiny bit (no larger than my pinky nail) did the trick, and gave me a very pretty and subtle wash of color.  It was also very natural looking - not necessarily sun kissed (which screams tanning bed in the winter months where I&#x27;m from), but a very nice, fresh look.  For me, the foundation and the Warmth go hand in hand and I won&#x27;t use one without the other.  The Mineral Veil I&#x27;m a little iffy on.  Applied over my foundation and the Warmth, it does give a slightly more \\&quot;polished\\&quot; look, but I don&#x27;t think I would notice it if I wasn&#x27;t looking for it.  It did decrease some shine over my nose, but again, maybeonly because I know it supposed to.  I will continue to use the Mineral Veil, but I&#x27;m not exactly sure that it makes a huge difference or that I need it.  We&#x27;ll see what happens as I keep using it.  What really sold me on this kit was the way other people reacted when they saw me wearing it.  I definitely noticed a huge difference while looking in the mirror, but often what you see in yourself is different from what other people see.  Right away, my preschool aged daughter said, \\&quot;wow Mom, you look SO pretty\\&quot; and my older son kept asking me what was different about me.  Even my sister (somewhat enviously) told me I looked great and asked me if I had a facial.  But the biggest compliment came from my husband, who told me that this pregnancy looks great on me (I&#x27;m about 5months along).  He said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re always gorgeous but now I can see the glow everyone talks about\\&quot;.  I felt beautiful, which can be a hard feeling to come by for a psoriasis sufferer.  I haven&#x27;t yet noticed if the Bare Minerals make up is exactly improving the condition of my skin, but I figure that if it does down the line, it&#x27;s an added bonus, because the way it makes me feel when I wear it is worth it.    This product works for me, I will be a die-hard and devoted user from here on out.  I realize that it might not work for everyone, but for me, it really is as good as they claim.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> A dvd came with the product which includes two of your selected shades, mineral veil, warmth which is a bronzer, and a variety of brushes. It also comes with brush cleanser which is neat. I didn&#x27;t use the dvd because I&#x27;ve seen the infomercials alot. It really is as easy as swirl, tap, buff. Your face takes on a flawless, almost airbrushed finish and unbelieveably the makeup stands up well to heat and absorbs shine.</li>
    <li> After becoming pregnant at age 27, I experienced acne for the first time in my life.  I tried OTC medication, hippie concoctions, and different makeups trying to help remedy the problem.  While getting a facial, the aesthetician (double checked the spelling on that one)suggested using high quality mineral makeup.  Because the acne was the result of hormonal changes of pregnancy, medications weren&#x27;t going to be very successful ... and I was a pregnant hippie trying to get away from chemicals.  Even 6 months post partum, my nice skin hadn&#x27;t returned, so I bought this sample set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I wore this to work, FOUR different nurses came up to me and commented on how beautiful my face looked.  I&#x27;m a pretty natural girl, so this kind of improvement without me looking like I&#x27;m wearing a mask of coverup convinced me this was a great choice.  Because it is so non-irritating, I now keep my hands off my face, also helping to clear up skin.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 4 months now, and my skin is almost back to normal.  I am quite fair, especially during the winter, so the the fair color combo was perfect.  As the weather warmed up and I got a bit of sun, I could blend the two colors easily to make it match my skin tone.  I have enjoyed adding to my collection with different brushes and eye shadows.  Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last tip for the acne prone - do wash the brushes at least twice a week.  It takes no time at all and you will notice the difference in your skin.  You aren&#x27;t dragging yesterday&#x27;s dirt and makeup across your face again, plus it helps diminish brush shedding.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as described and delivery was faster than I expected. I love this product. I wear it practically everyday. It gives me flawless coverage with out making me look or feel cakey. The Warmth doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like some bronzers and feels extremely light on my face. I forget I&#x27;m wearing it most of the time. I love it, and recommend that everyone tries it.</li>
    <li> This seems to be the older version of the Get Started kit sold directly from Bare Escuentuals. The picture is misleading: there is no Prime Time primer included, but I did receive a tube of brush conditioner for cleaning the three included brushes. The makeup itself is great, and I was able to test out two different tones to find my better match before buying the full-sized versions. I would definitely recommend this to a first-time user of bareMinerals.</li>
    <li> I like both the light powder, all the brushes and the veil but not the Warmth All-Over Face Color,  I have freckles and when I apply this color over my face my freckles, everywhere I applied it are way more noticeable. Pink powder works better for me than brownish color in general and this Warmth All-Over Face Color is more brownish. Pretty good kit but since I cannot use all the powders I give it a 4 stars out of 5.</li>
    <li> All but the book on making puppets.  I would like to return that book.  How do I do that ASAP.</li>
    <li> I have normal to oily skin with acne. I want a foundation that will cover my blemishes, give the appearance of an even skin tone, and not look like I dipped my face into a pie a la Mrs. Doubtfire. I also want a foundation that&#x27;s idiot proof - makeup is not my forte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not been using moisturizer, but discovered I did need to use some with Bare Minerals to avoid a chalky look.&lt;br /&gt;I used a smaller concealer brush than the one included to get better coverage over problem spots - this works well, but I think it will work even better once I start using a primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I like the way my skin looks when I use Bare Minerals. I don&#x27;t look photoshop perfect, but this is the best my skin will look without hiring a pro. I have already suggested it to friends, and I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the nifty no spill lids Bare Minerals has switched to, they keep my makeup box nice and neat.</li>
