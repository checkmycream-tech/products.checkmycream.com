      <li>Love this very much!!!</li>
      <li>Hope this helps! :)</li>
      <li>I gave it four instead of five stars because I wish it helped control oil a bit more.</li>
      <li>I am not in love with the &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; however.</li>
      <li>Overall I couldn&#x27;t be happier and this is the best moisturizer I have ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s light, but nourishing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and works better.</li>
      <li>And this is one of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>I like this better than the tomato oil control gel.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh smell and minty feeling after!</li>
      <li>eye fine lines!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>also love the Eminence Stone Whip Moisturiser and the super greens skin serum.</li>
      <li>It smells and feels good and is all natural too!</li>
      <li>It feels light yet substantial, and it&#x27;s not sticky either.  </li>
      <li>Easily absorbed, and is right for most skin types.</li>
      <li>so I feel I haven&#x27;t gotten a full experience, but so far I love it!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for when your skin feels really full of zits and you don&#x27;t want to put your regular lotion on.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and seems to be doing its job.</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely, and very natural.</li>
      <li>I enjoy all eminence products because they are organic and gentle.</li>
      <li>But this product is completely 0 breakouts love it</li>
      <li>It is so refreshing, and is not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>Just the right combination of conditioning, thickness and spread.</li>
      <li>With the right cleanser and tonique...and REGIMENT</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been an AVID user of this product for over two years...</li>
      <li>I am a first time user of this product.</li>
      <li>It feels sticks at first</li>
      <li>It goes on easy, absorbs quickly, leaves my skin so soft and clear.</li>
      <li>the opposite is true but I will be ordering the full size product</li>
      <li>Easy purchase, quick shipping and product as expected.</li>
      <li>It has alleviated my rosacea and since I&#x27;ve been using it I&#x27;ve had no new redness or breakouts.  </li>
      <li>and wow what an improvement already!</li>
      <li>Still hoping it will clear up my skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 31 year young...</li>
      <li>My skin feels alive....</li>
      <li>I have alot of skin toned blemishes that my derm has said is adult onset acne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m addicted to the immediate minty fresh tingle followed by a super soft feel.  </li>
      <li>I wish it was offered in a jar similar to some of the &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; that Eminence offers.</li>

<li> I wish it was offered in a jar similar to some of the &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; that Eminence offers.</li>
<li> I live in Miami where the humidity is out of control, making the usual moisturizer experience a totally gross/oily feeling.  </li>
<li> I received a sample of this gel and decided to try it under my eyes as the skin around them was puffy ad dehydrated from a long flight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I&#x27;d rather use the Pink Grapefruit mask.  </li>
<li> not really oil oily.</li>
<li> Since I use this daily, this usually lasts me about 4-6 weeks.</li>
<li> It is a bit on the expensive side, but I don&#x27;t feel like I need a large amount at all.</li>
<li> can say that it did nothing for my dark circles</li>
<li> I replenish my supply every time I&#x27;m down to about half the product</li>
<li> (My skin does seem to react/redden slightly with exercise when using this product.)  </li>
<li> As this is a little pricey I want to get every little bit out of the container.</li>
<li> My derm recommended applying a vitamin C serum everyday before moisturizer to help with discoloration and to protect against the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there, and usually something works a while</li>
<li> I have finicky, difficult, combination skin and this product has never caused me to break out or clogged my pores.</li>
<li> I would NOT recommend it for winter if you have combo skin that runs &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; when it is cold out (as mine does).  </li>
<li> This item is pricey, but if you purchase - you will not be disappointed.</li>

    <li> My skin feels alive....</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I could not use any moisturizer because I always Breakout. But this product is completely 0 breakouts love it I won&#x27;t stop to use this product  at all...</li>
    <li> Easy purchase, quick shipping and product as expected.</li>
    <li> Love this very much!!! More than I thought I would!!!! Amazing product!! Will buy this forever! The fact that it has C-ester is a major win for me! I want to hug and kiss the creator of this product!! Life saver!!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy all eminence products because they are organic and gentle. There are no harsh ingredients &amp; they always smell wonderful. My derm recommended applying a vitamin C serum everyday before moisturizer to help with discoloration and to protect against the sun&#x27;s rays. I like this gel. It absorbs quickly and seems to be doing its job. I gave it four instead of five stars because I wish it helped control oil a bit more. This item is pricey, but if you purchase - you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have type 2 rosacea, which is the stuff that&#x27;s often mistaken for acne.  I&#x27;m 44 and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there, and usually something works a while and then it dries out my skin.  I use the Eminence Citrus Exfoliating Wash, the Rosehip Tonique, and then this last.  This stuff is awesome.  It has alleviated my rosacea and since I&#x27;ve been using it I&#x27;ve had no new redness or breakouts.  It feels light yet substantial, and it&#x27;s not sticky either.  I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough to folks with rosacea.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Only have been using it for 2 days and wow what an improvement already! Love the fresh smell and minty feeling after! My skin already has brightened up and blemishes are gone! I have alot of skin toned blemishes that my derm has said is adult onset acne. Microderm creams have not helped but this C gel is amazing! Will def cont to use and purchase this item!</li>
    <li> I have a roseacia type of condition on my cheeks and this makes it go away!!  It smells and feels good and is all natural too!</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect. Just the right combination of conditioning, thickness and spread. Not sticky at all, hence no messiness. Easily absorbed, and is right for most skin types.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I would recommend this product to anyone. I am now on my 4th bottle. I replenish my supply every time I&#x27;m down to about half the product so I don&#x27;t have any relapse. It goes on easy, absorbs quickly, leaves my skin so soft and clear. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer periodically on several occasions.  It&#x27;s great for the summer when I need a lightweight face moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  I would NOT recommend it for winter if you have combo skin that runs &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; when it is cold out (as mine does).  I have finicky, difficult, combination skin and this product has never caused me to break out or clogged my pores.</li>
    <li> Overpriced, a bit over drying for a moisturizer. It&#x27;s good for when your skin feels really full of zits and you don&#x27;t want to put your regular lotion on.</li>
    <li> Wonderful light gel that decreases the amount of outlines and breakout go me. Great for under any and all makeup brands. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather use the Pink Grapefruit mask.  It&#x27;s cheaper and works better.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user of this product. It definitely brings brightness to my skin. I use it as a layer in protecting my face from the elements. it works and spreads nicely.</li>
    <li> Excellent for tropical climate. I like this better than the tomato oil control gel. Felt both are very similar except this smells fresher.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for about a week so I feel I haven&#x27;t gotten a full experience, but so far I love it!  I&#x27;m addicted to the immediate minty fresh tingle followed by a super soft feel.  It feels sticks at first but this goes away as soon as it dries.  I live in Miami where the humidity is out of control, making the usual moisturizer experience a totally gross/oily feeling.  THIS however dries immediately and does not get oily when I go outside.  (My skin does seem to react/redden slightly with exercise when using this product.)  Overall I couldn&#x27;t be happier and this is the best moisturizer I have ever purchased.  Still hoping it will clear up my skin.  (Ceasing to pick at my pores also might help...)  I&#x27;m 25 and have normal/acne prone skin and am Hispanic/Caucasian.  Hope this helps! :)</li>
    <li> I love Eminence! And this is one of my favorite products. I use this each night after I get out of the shower. It is so refreshing, and is not heavy at all. The scent is lovely, and very natural. I have been using this product for a number of years and continue to go back to it. It is a bit on the expensive side, but I don&#x27;t feel like I need a large amount at all. Since I use this daily, this usually lasts me about 4-6 weeks. I am not in love with the &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; however. As this is a little pricey I want to get every little bit out of the container. I wish it was offered in a jar similar to some of the &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; that Eminence offers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an AVID user of this product for over two years...I&#x27;m a 31 year young...so I deal with dryness...but by 3pm have a sheen of dewiness...not really oil oily. Anyway, it&#x27;s light, but nourishing! With the right cleanser and tonique...and REGIMENT it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this gel and decided to try it under my eyes as the skin around them was puffy ad dehydrated from a long flight.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that it did nothing for my dark circles but it actually helps diminish under eye fine lines!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I have ever ordered a product after using a sample in fact the opposite is true but I will be ordering the full size product asap.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Eminence Stone Whip Moisturiser and the super greens skin serum.</li>
