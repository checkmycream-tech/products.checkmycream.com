    <li> just as i expected. Great product.</li>
    <li> Holds hair nicely.  Doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel.  Really like the way it holds my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray I like and it has been discontinued. What&#x27;s wrong with it Nioxin?</li>
    <li> This is a good hairspray. It has moderate holding power and I love the fact that you can still re-comb or touch up  your hair after spraying it without a sticky mess.</li>
    <li> Only use this product as it does not get sticky.  I definitely recommend this spray. I use this after shampooing and maybe once during the week.</li>
    <li> Love it, it is clean feeling and it holds especially during humid days and it is not sticky feeling at all.</li>

    <li> This &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; version of a great product just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  It is supposed to be the same formula as before repackaging......no it&#x27;s not.  I&#x27;ve used the previous product for 6+ years, the new product mats hair.  Yuck!</li>
