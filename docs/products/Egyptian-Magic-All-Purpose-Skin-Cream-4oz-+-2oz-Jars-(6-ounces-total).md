<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband refused to use Cetaphil for his chapped hands, as it was petroleum based. Then I bought this one at Costco recently. The package was $39.99, and even came with 0.25 oz mini cream.</li>
    <li> I had a very large 2nd degree burn on my front torso…the skin was raw. Someone told me about this product. I bought it, put on the cream and the next morning, the burn was 50% better, and within three days, the raw part was gone. This product is nothing short of a miracle of nature. It heals, it softens, it regenerates….in lightening speed. It should be in every persons medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> We use this for my daughters exzema it is the only think we&#x27;ve found that makes any difference. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My sister turned me onto it. At first I thought it was greasy &amp; stopped using it, but my wrinkles deepened &amp; skin dried. I now use a bit less in the summer months &amp; more in the winter, especially if I&#x27;m going outside. It&#x27;s a wonderful protectant against the cold, dry wind of Northern MI. I especially like that I know what all the ingredients are &amp; none are chemicals. If you&#x27;re looking for an all natural skin care product that works, stop, you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
    <li> I had a sinus infection and my skin under my nose was so chapped my skin was bleeding and bright red. Once the bleeding stopped I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the red skin under my nose. I put this cream on and overnight the redness was gone and my skin was healed. I had used all different kinds of medicinal creams to try to get the redness to go away for two weeks and nothing worked until Egyptian magic.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of moisturizers in my time. I prefer products that contain ingredients I can pronounce. Tis has nothing scary in it so I am giving it a try. I only use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very smoothly. It has virtually no scent. It feels good on my skin. Not heavy. I know heavy; I used to use Mary Kay years ago. I even use it as a hand &amp;body cream. It&#x27;s great for winter cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;The only real drawback is that it is greasy. It takes a while to soak in. It is fine for my hands because I can rub them together for a bit before sleep. My face on the other hand is not so easy. I feel like I can only sleep on my back so it doesn&#x27;t rub off or soak into the pillowcase.&lt;br /&gt;When I wake up in the morning my face does feel smooth and soft. It looks good too. I use this with other products, strivectin mostly.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good price and has many uses but once the jar is empty I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again. I may go back to one of the Eminence creams.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily and absorbs without a greasy feel! Very moisturizing ! I use this every day , my husband also!</li>
    <li> I use on face and body to moisturizer. Soothes cuts and scrapes. Cures many rashes. Even on tips of hair!</li>
    <li> I used this on myself and it helps alleviate itching and on my friends mom she came to visit all nasty and wrinkled and so I gave her the small one and sure enough over a month all the nasty wrinkles in her cheeks were fading (NEVER GOT A THANK YOU).  So after being hyped on putting natural vitamins on the skin (propolis is one of the most abundant forms of every vitamin you need) I had my cousin put some under his eyes which were inflamed and cracking due to eczema and BAM next day they were soft and not all nasty (damage that was done still remained but it wasn&#x27;t all nasty and crackling and scaly and shit).  There is no reason to not buy this product. (I read somewhere else a wart fell off someones face so now I&#x27;m going to try on my warts and I will repost to update.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the smell is so-so from the olive oil that is in it. I have extremely dry skin and have had improvement with use of this product. I can live with the fragrance just to have softer ~ smoother skin. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have the most sensitive face ever. I have spent so much money using this product or that product from expensive retailers.  Many times able to use the product once or twice before realizing that my face was irritated by it.  This product is so soothing and moisturizing that it makes me smile every time is apply it. Sound corny? I have been without it since first buying it at Costco months ago.  Then they discontinued it....😟!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad to find it here on Amazon. Arrived two days later and I am again a happy face😊</li>
    <li> I am 23. I&#x27;ve had mild acne and sensitive skin since I was 14. So over the years I&#x27;ve accumulated a few small acne scars. I&#x27;ve tried natural soaps. Proactive. Even aspirin powder. All of that worked to a point but it only got so far.&lt;br /&gt;I can put Egyptian magic on my mild acne on my face, neck and back at night and wake up without it. It really seems like magic. It even helps with razor bumps. It comes back if I stop using it. So I have to keep it around. I do recommend it. It calms irritated skin as well. I saw other reviews saying Egyptian takes away acne scars. I&#x27;m sure that takes time. I will give it more time and see for myself. So far I&#x27;m very happy with my results. I&#x27;ve recommended it to others as well. My sister says it takes away her adult millia on her arms. It&#x27;s definitely worth trying to see for yourself!</li>
    <li> Basically, this is organic petroleum jelly, with a dash of love added as an ingredient.  Great as a lip balm.  I buy the little travel pots and fill them with Magic to carry in my purse.  When I travel I use it as an all-purpose moisturizer as well.  Great for sunburns and a miracle worker on skin burned by acid nasal drip.</li>
    <li> I paid over $58.00 for what appears to be Vaseline Petroleum Jelly. However, Vaseline is much, much cheaper. I can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. I&#x27;m sorry I bought 2 jars.</li>
    <li> One of the only true magic creams. SWorks on our daughters diaper rash better than any other cream when combined with Desitin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Egyptian Magic for the last 12 years on my face. I have found no better product for me as a man. I put a little on before I shave, makes for a smoother shave and protects and nourishes my face for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;For me Egyptian Magic ranks Five Stars Plus, with all natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for asking-</li>
    <li> I never used a cream, but once I tried this and noticed a difference from blotchy to not blotchy and acne to no acne, I use it every day and night.  Knowing that all the ingredients are natural makes me feel better about the price and habit of use.</li>
    <li> Did not have good results with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Service was good from this vendor.</li>
