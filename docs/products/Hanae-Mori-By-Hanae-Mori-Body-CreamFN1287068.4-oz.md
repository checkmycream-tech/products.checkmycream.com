<li> and I think I will buy another one in a few months after this one is finished.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the perfume itself, I think it stinks and doesn&#x27;t last, but the body cream is magnificient!!!  </li>
<li> Product arrived in what looked like original packaging but upon use it is terrible smelling and unuseable.</li>
<li> His other products may be legitimate, but &#x27;m afraid to give them a try.  </li>
<li> I was a bit skeptical when I came across this hand cream and perfume for the price that I paid.</li>
<li> So, I would say that I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that Amazon would let a seller like thiis do business.  </li>

    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a very luxurious body cream. I love the scent and the feeling when i put it on. It was a great value.</li>
    <li> I received the order on time in perfect condition. I love this cream and this is already my second box and I think I will buy another one in a few months after this one is finished.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in what looked like original packaging but upon use it is terrible smelling and unuseable. Didn&#x27;t keep original packaging as never expected to have a problem. Company wouldn&#x27;t take it back after 15 days so I will just throw it out and buy from a different vendor. Have bought this many times before through Amazon and never had this problem.</li>
    <li> I searched the internet for the best buy for this product and found it at Amazon. I love the smell of this body cream. It is so soft and makes me feel very feminine. My husband loves the smell and he doesn&#x27;t like most perfumes or creams. Hanae Mori Body Cream is the best!</li>
    <li> This is great lotion at a great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bee using Hanae Mori for years and I KNOW THE REAL PRODUCT!!  This is a KNOCK OFF in a jar that isn&#x27;t even the same size as the real jar.  I&#x27;m very disappointed that Amazon would let a seller like thiis do business.  His other products may be legitimate, but &#x27;m afraid to give them a try.  I&#x27;m ttying to return the cream,(by the waay they did refund my money as soon as I compalined) however, I was given $5.00 for shipping and it cost more like $12.00 to return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the perfume itself, I think it stinks and doesn&#x27;t last, but the body cream is magnificient!!!  It&#x27;s rich, thick and creamy and has a lasting scent...you don&#x27;t have to freshen up with this, it&#x27;s there until you wash it off...love it!!</li>
    <li> Its a light fragranced body cream that smells freshly of gardenia.  She&#x27;s been wearing it for years so I ordered her some for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume, so I wanted to buy the lotion to double up. I don&#x27;t think it has great staying power though. It also has this sticky or tacky feeling for a little while ,maybe an hour or so after it&#x27;s put on.  It is not a super smooth feel b/c of that. I don&#x27;t regret buying it, but I don&#x27;t think it works as well as I would have liked.  The appearance of the jar is low end, but I like the plastic b/c I won&#x27;t break it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I came across this hand cream and perfume for the price that I paid. And some reviews said that the perfumes weren&#x27;t authentic, and had weak, short lasting scents that were a bit off. But, I have been wearing Hanae Mori for many years now and this one is the real deal.  Perfect. I will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years, it&#x27;s always a pleasure to be able to buy it online at better prices than the department stores!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance.  However, I find that  I cannot detect any smell on me soon after I have used it and no one has had any comment.  So, I would say that I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Great service.</li>
    <li> A dear friend bought this for me as a gift. I now buy this for my own use because it really works and smells great. I am a shopper that cuts coupons and watches for sales and thus I buy on Amazon. I will buy this  product and I will purchase it for family/friends if they appreciate a great product.</li>
    <li> The cream feels so good and I love how fragrant it is. I would recommend it to go along with the perfume.</li>
    <li> This is the best scent ever. I have been using it for 5 years now and it has never disappointed. I always get compliments and just loooove it on me after a nice hot bath!!!!!!!  :-D</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance as well as the thickness in the cream. It layers very well and it lasts all day, no need to apply more later in the day.</li>
    <li> It smells great.  the cream works as well as any other cream.  I feel really girly when I wear this product.  I use it when I go out with the spray and it lasts for quite some time.</li>
    <li> this was kind of easy...it&#x27;s my wifes favorite scent</li>
    <li> smells wonderful..... great body creme!</li>
