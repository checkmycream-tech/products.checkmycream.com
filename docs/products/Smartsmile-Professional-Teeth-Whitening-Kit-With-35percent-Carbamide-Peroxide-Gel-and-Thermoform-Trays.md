      <li>I really loved Smartsmile Teeth Whitening Kit.</li>

      <li>I never would have thought that an over the counter product like this one could be so effective</li>
      <li>Instead of having to go to the dentist or another specialist for theeth whitening you can do it in the luxury of your own time and on your own schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Smartsmile and will continue to use it as I enjoy coffee and wine. I used the syringe and filled my retainer trays with a sufficient amount for 5 nights in a row (approx. 4-6 hours each night.) The Smartsmile Teeth Whitening Kit is the best way to keep your teeth whiter longer! Gotta have my pearly whites for my wedding this summer! Thank you Smartsmile!!! Make sure you get this kit if you wanna keep your teeth sparkling white!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I can smile again. I was so down that my coffee and wine drinking had caused such stains.  Ugh. I tried baking soda, all white tooth paste, everything. Then a friend of mine said hey I&#x27;ve been using Smartsmile, uh maybe you should try it. So I did.&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with the results and the lack of sensitivity on my teeth. Really a clean cool feeling.  Since I have been interviewing for jobs I truly feel like a first impression is important. I think I am right on track.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest to use.  Put trays in warm water and place in your mouth. I did and it molded perfectly. Apply gel to trays and place in mouth. 15 minutes later, brighter, healthier looking teeth. I love it, use everyday for best  .  results. I do and I am completely satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;aroundt he black&amp;#34; with teeth whitening kits.  Anything from gels, to stripes, to lasers, and nothing seems to work.  I stumbled across this and figured i would just try it out.  The reviews were pretty good and now I can definitely see why. My teeth look great!  I used the 3 weeks ago and my teeth are still in tact.  I&#x27;m hoping the results last a long time.  That&#x27;s my biggest ticker with the other products I used.  I&#x27;ll keep an eye on this and let everyone know the results!</li>
    <li> I drink lots of soda and I am a big coffee drinker so I&#x27;m familiar with the yellowed teeth dilemma. I bought this in hopes that it would help me with that and to my surprise, it did! I don&#x27;t feel so embarrassed to smile with my teeth anymore, it&#x27;s a wonderful feeling.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!!!! My teeth are at least 3 shades whiter in just ONE WEEK! That&#x27;s crazy! I never would have thought that an over the counter product like this one could be so effective but boy, was I wrong. This product is easy to use, only requires a few minutes a day and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross taste or residue in your mouth after use. And the best part is that you get the same results that you would at a professional teeth cleaner for only a fraction of the cost! I fully intend on purchasing this product again in order to get even whiter teeth and then to maintain my pearly whites! I recommend you do the same! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Really amazing product. I&#x27;ve been a coffee drinker for years and I&#x27;ve started to notice its effect on my teeth. I started researching whitening kits to help my teeth look better and I found this one. Well. I&#x27;m a believer in it. It made my teeth look perfect. THey&#x27;re white as pearls. After a couple of weeks I could really see its effect on my teeth. I&#x27;m not afraid to smile anymore knowing my teeth look great now.</li>
    <li> I had braces for the past couple years. When they came off I had a couple stains from them. Not horrible but noticeable at least to me. I decided to try a kit instead of paying a lot of money to have someone do it. There are so many kits out there but I decided to try this one. It&#x27;s been working great so far.</li>
    <li> This is probably good but used it one time and it hurts my mouth!!! I&#x27;m going to try again. Didn&#x27;t whiten much after first try but have to wait until my mouth is no longer sore to try again.  Use strips</li>
    <li> The Smartsmile Teeth Whitening Kit is a very effective whitener for your teeth when you can&#x27;t afford the services of a dentist or when you need a quick solution for special occassions or that very hot date !  The ingredients are very gentle on your teeth and leave your teeth brighter after just the first uses.</li>
    <li> My goal was to obviously whiten my teeth as much as I could w/out having to schedule yet another appt at a doctor/dentist&#x27;s office (since it seemed like I was in &amp; out of them all month for botox, Venus Freeze, and smart lipo). So needless to say, I took a chance on the Smart Smile Whitening kit that I found.  I was very pleased and I will definitely be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I really loved Smartsmile Teeth Whitening Kit. It works fast and is so very easy to use. I would have to say this is the best product of its kind. Instead of having to go to the dentist or another specialist for theeth whitening you can do it in the luxury of your own time and on your own schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my friends and family have used it as well and have gotten great results. We all want to buy the product again when the time comes. Overall this is a great product which has brought excellent results. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, I am never using those pesky strips again! They are super inconvenient and slide around with goopy gel. The trays are much better; sometimes I forget that I have them in. The tray also covers more surface area and is flexible. Also, with the strips, I don&#x27;t feel that the gel gets into every nook and cranny of my teeth because it slides around so often.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in sensitivity, like the other reviewers have said but that&#x27;s neither a good or bad thing. I kind of expect that any products like these would add to some sensitivity anyway. And I only just switched to Smartsmile from the whitestrips so maybe I&#x27;ll notice it more later on.&lt;br /&gt;Carbamide peroxide is just as effective as hydrogen peroxide but the former remains active longer, which makes me feel like it&#x27;s still working long after I take the trays out. Also, carbamide peroxide products are known to have a longer self life as well.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are nice and white and I only use this product every other day but I did that with the strips anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Good product, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;!  I have been searching for a product that not only cleans my teeth but whitens them as well and I finally found it and got the extra bonus of an affordable product that I can purchase online!  This product has saved me a very expensive trip to the Dentist, I really care about my teeth and my sister referred me to this product, one of the best things she could have done for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink black coffee every morning and have been for 25 years now, I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks and not only did I notice the difference, my sister and mom noticed right away!  Talk about smiling with confidence, boy oh boy do I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re searching for a great product that not only works, but one that works fast and affordable, this is the only one out there that I could find that measures up! I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a smoker and drink about 4 cups of coffee per day and my teeth with looking dingy yellow. This kit works just as good as the ones dentists sell because my daughter paid $200 for one of those and her teeth went up the same amount of shades as mine did after using this. She is not a smoker either and hates coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for something inexpensive to whiten your teeth, I&#x27;d definitely give this product a try.</li>
    <li> After a week and a half of using Smartsmile, I can tell the difference.  My teeth are looking brighter.  I feel much better about myself.  I can smile alot more now.  This stuff really works. I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> The thing that makes this product different from other teeth whitening products, in my opinion, is that it actually tastes very good. I never thought that that would be a big thing for me, but once I had this in my mouth, it really made a difference ! The trays were easy to use and size, and it only takes at most 15 minutes. My teeth are very white and I constantly get complimented on my teeth and smile. The product is easy to use, not messy, and doesn&#x27;t cause my teeth to hurt. And did I mention that it tastes great ? :)</li>
    <li> This product works really well, but be careful and don&#x27;t apply too much into the trays so that it touches your gums.  I made that mistake in the lower tray and it literally turned my lower front gums white and burned for about 12 hours.  It eventually went away but it burned and irritated my gums so just be careful.</li>
    <li> Got this kit for my brother because he wanted one for X-Mas. He tells me it works well and he has a brighter smile. Brother likes it, I like it, you should try it out.</li>
    <li> I tried this and a few other products, and this one has been my favorite so far. One of the best kits out there, and it&#x27;s affordable compared to other ones I had looked at. Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> The trays are very difficult to fit and the amount of &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; was no better than when I used Listerine&#x27;s Teeth Brightening mouth wash for a week. Granted it only took two uses of the trays to achieve those results,but I think using a mouth wash for one minute a day as opposed to drooling all over hell and back for 15 minutes two days in a row is not worth the effort. Also, if you aren&#x27;t careful the bleach in the trays can seriously mess up your gums, making them whiter than your teeth!</li>
    <li> Excellent product... I was impressed. I have tried several similar solutions to avoid a trip to dentist but smartsmile was the best. I love that it uses all natural ingredients so I am not putting any harmful chemicals in my mouth. I was especially intrigued because this product didn&#x27;t cause any discomfort. Smart Smile Whitening is easy to use and comes with the instructions in plain, easy to follow English.You don&#x27;t need to be dentist to apply this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth looks and feel much better. After trying pretty much every other at home teeth whitening solution in the market, I recommend Smart smile. I told the same to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. I have used many tooth whitening systems, and this is a good one. My favorite thing about it is that it is non-toxic. I sometimes worry about all the chemicals my body is exposed to in the form of tooth whiteners, hair dye, etc. Anyway, if your teeth are very stained like mine, you are going to want to use the product more than just once. I started really liking the way my teeth looked on the third day. The treatment does not take long and it&#x27;s comfortable, so don&#x27;t worry. I love the results.</li>
    <li> Smartsmile has given me the confidence to smile around others once more. After years of drinking coffee and tea, my teeth are very stained, and I was in need of something beyond a normal whitening toothpaste. The thing that makes this product different from other teeth whitening products is that it actually tastes very good. I never thought that that would be a big thing for me, but once I had this in my mouth, it really made a difference ! The trays were easy to use and size, and it only takes at most 15 minutes. My teeth are very white and I constantly get complimented on my teeth and smile.</li>
    <li> I am very conscious about the health and appearance of my teeth and been on outlook for a great product like Smartsmile Professional Teeth Whitening Kit. It really is smart and brilliant. I can feel my teeth turning whiter and whiter with its regular use. It is much cheaper than many other teeth whitening stuff in stores and really easy to use. Great buy and great results. You can&#x27;t be more happy with any other product for your teeth. Two thumps up</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these teeth whitening formulas. They all work to some extent. This one is certainly worthy. I found the tooth mold very comfortable. The solution itself is gently on your gums and the taste of it is not objectionable. The treatments themselves were fine, and I noticed a small difference at the end of the treatment in the color of my teeth. Since none of these tooth whitening kits work drastically, a small difference that is noticeable gets a big thumbs up from me. Check this one out if you want to try and lighten your teeth.</li>
    <li> As a smoker and lover of coffee, my teeth can get pretty stained. Extra trips to the dentist get expensive and burdensome, so I have been trying to find a good at home solution. I&#x27;ve used just about every kind of at home tooth whitener available, but from now on, I&#x27;m sticking with Smart Style. It offers a few advantages over the competitors .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, Smart Smile uses only natural ingredients and that helps cuts down on or eliminates totally any pain or discomfort. I didn&#x27;t feel any discomfort using Smart Smile. In this case &amp;#34;natural ingredients&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean &amp;#34;reduced performance&amp;#34; like it so often does in other products. The quality of my results was far beyond what I expected- in fact, this is hands down the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried just about every at home teeth whitening solution available, I recommend Smart smile above them all.Great results, easy to use, no pain and a super value!</li>
    <li> Smartsmile is a great product and I highly recommend it. Having a great smile is an important part of life. One of the first things people notice is your smile. Being embarrassed about your smile can lead to self confidence issues. I am a smoker and I drink lots of coffee. This can leave horrible stains on my teeth and whitening toothpaste just does not do the job effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Smartsmile is great for dental maintenance and keeping my smile bright between office dental cleanings. I am finding that my check-ups and cleanings from the dentist are improving. This saves me time and money. I love the tray. It keeps the solution in place during the recommended time and ensures the solution gets between my teeth. Between my teeth is an area that is the hardest for me to maintain with brushing alone. I do recommend following the directions carefully for best results and I am sure you will be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> and I am very reticent to use these type of products. So I decided to use this one because of the second gel they include for sensitive teeth. I still only use it twice a week, sometimes once a week if I feel paranoid. Either way, my teeth are noticeably whiter now than when I started. I am happy with results and will continue.</li>
    <li> Everyone does. But I used this for a month and it is so much better. Like tons better. This was in my price range so I bought it, itÃ¢(tm)s a good bargain.</li>
    <li> UNBELIEVEABLE that anyone would allow SCAM products like that with SPAM reviews to be the top rated product for teeth whitening!!! i took one look at the &amp;#34;most helpful&amp;#34; positive review - and immediately knew it was spam. the reviewer posted 3 comments on 3 different teeth whitening products on the same day and said the same thing for all 3 of them - that they did a great job whitening his teeth!! and guess what?? the next reviewer just so happens that he reviewed THE EXACT same 3 teeth whitening products too!! SPAM!!! PLEASE REPORT THIS SCAM!!!</li>
    <li> and I think a toothpaste company would rip it off but they havenÃ¢(tm)t so you can only get it here. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Had trouble with the tray at first but it was worth it</li>
    <li> I wore braces during those terrible teen years where one is careless and forgetful. After I got them off my teeth were really really stained and smiling became a terrible thing for me to do, I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of inexpensive alternatives and the results lasted shortly... then I came across this product! SmartSmile has freed my teeth from those terrible stains and the effects last for a great period of time, even after its effects are long gone, the stains have seized to appear. SmartSmile worked great for me!</li>
    <li> Instead of putting the gel in trays I rolled a q tip into the gel and applied it directly to my teeth. You canÃ¢(tm)t do that with strips because they are on strips and you canÃ¢(tm)t separate them. I find this method is useful if your teeth are sensitive to this sort of thing and itÃ¢(tm)s very easy for me to control. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Tray system is revolutionary</li>
    <li> and I am very confident in my smile. My coworkers have commented, not on my teeth per se but just that I seem happier. Sometimes all it takes is a little boost of confidence and I think after using Brilliant only a handful of times my teeth look great and feel whiter. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Used for ten days and did not see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive teeth but wanted to brighten my smile a bit due to all of the coffee I drink. I ordered the product and wasn&#x27;t expecting much the first time but boy was I surprised. I whitened 3 shades after the first use (picture attached) !!! I did not find the mouth trays difficult to use or mold at all because the directions for them are pretty straight forward. I have not experienced this kind of whitening from strips or any other product I have used.  I have had no sensitivity as of yet and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Great! That would be better if could provide one extra mouth tray, in case one of them not shaped by mistake.</li>
    <li> finally found a product that actually got rid of my coffee stained teeth. I hate whitening products because they just hurt my teeth and don&#x27;t whiten within a reasonable timeframe but this one really works</li>
    <li> First time using this product. I followed the instructions to the letter and the product still got onto my gums on my lower jaw. It stayed on for 5 seconds before i had to yank it out and wash my mouth for about 10 mins. My gums were completely &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; (for lack of a better word). I was so scared and in so much pain. My gums changed color and stayed white and extremely painful for close to 45 mins. I am so scared that i am not going to use it again.</li>
    <li> I knew I had made a mistake when I first saw that my whitening kit had been placed in &amp;#34;Smartsmile professional nightguard for bruxism&amp;#34; packaging. Despite the wrong packaging, it did contain the whitening kit. Sadly the packaging is where the instructions are, and when I reached out and asked for instructions, I received no reply. Not being one to give up so easily, I watched several videos online of other similar products in order to know what to do. The first time I used the whitener in the nightguard, it was annoying and I couldn&#x27;t speak, but not terrible. The second time was so painful on my gums and roof of my mouth, I had to stop after 5 minutes. Needless to sat my experience with this product is a poor one and I urge everyone to avoid it. Instead, get a product which is well known, or go to your dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing. If you still feel inclined to buy this, you should investigate the people who highly rate this, they all seem to buy and rate the same products quite highly (meaning they are fake reviewers and have possibly been paid to write the reviews).</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time. That was the only good thing. Instructions are very vague and short. Numerous misspelling on box. Used it once as directed for 10 minutes and couldnt use again. This product left my top gums bleeding and peeled a layer of skin! My gums burn and now I hope this product hasn&#x27;t caused serious problems to my gums.  I&#x27;ve never had any gum disease or teeth problems. My last dentist visit 2 months ago was very good with a clean bill of teeth health. Please do not use this cheap terrible product! Buy a reputable name brand.</li>
    <li> There is nothing easy about this system. You are supposed to put the molds into boiling water, but if you don&#x27;t time it just right, the mold may end up sticking to itself, and it is impossible to straighten out. Then applying the gel is a trick in itself. It&#x27;s very difficult to get it on the mold &amp;#34;just so&amp;#34;, and then if it spills over onto your gums, you can feel it or taste it. They may work (after doing it 10 times) but it sure is a hassle. I cannot recommend this.</li>
    <li> The overall procedure is not documented in details.</li>
    <li> :D Smartsmile Professional Teeth Whitening Kit  Is true to it&#x27;s word! I have been using this for many mouths now, and seem just keeps getting better, and is outstanding when it comes to riding my teeth of stains and leaving my mouth feeling clean and fresh for hours. I also enjoy how it uses pure ingredients and nontoxic chemicals. And the fresh winter-mint taste is a true plus! I highly recommend this :)</li>
    <li> I tried this a while back because I could not find my go to whitening kit and I was desperate. I am a coffee addict and I had a weeding to go to, plus I didnt have the cash to go to my dentist for a whitening  treatment. So I bought ghis out of desperation, and I must say I am glad I did! I am very satisfied with the results! I had never tried Thermoform Trays before but after using them I believe every whitening kit should use Thermoform Trays instead of the stiff flat ones! The trays in this kit are so comfortable and they allow for more mobility while doing the treatment. As far as the results, the coffee stains were gone, and my teeth were at least 4 shades lighter, they even shone in the dark!</li>
    <li> wanted to try this product out because it is so much cheaper than crest whitestrips. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and my teeth look great. I will stuck to this product now. Thank you</li>
    <li> Fairly easy to use.  Found the mouth guards a little tricky when trying to get a good fit.  Think my teeth were brighter after 10 days.  Next time I will leave the gel on for 15 minutes not just 10 each time as the result was not that noticeable.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best bang for your buck when it comes to teeth whitening. I was worried at first that the mouth trays would be hard to mold to my teeth, but it is very simple and quick. The only part I found difficult was to not swallow any of the gel during the 5-15 minutes the trays need to be in your mouth. That is more of a problem of me than the kit. I would definietly recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap effective way to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> They are maybe two shades lighter now after a month of treatments and I enjoy using the product. The gel has a little bit of mint taste and there is a second gel to help build enamel and keep the teeth strong after use.</li>
    <li> Tried using the product once. Tossed it in the trash after seeing that many words were misspelled on the packaging. Made me nervous to use any sort of chemical product by a company that couldn&#x27;t even use spell check.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. After 10 applications I saw no noticeable difference in my teeth color. The majority of the positive reviews on this product are all suspiciously made on the same days, which made me worry initially. After I received the product I tried to pull up the manufacturer website, and it was basically a blank template will latin text filler. Couldn&#x27;t find any other information about this product anywhere on the internet. Kinda scary. I would stick to Dr Song or Crest White Strips, honestly. Hopefully I didn&#x27;t damage my teeth with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this teeth whitening kit. The taste is very good, and my teeth look whiter after using this for four days. I have an event to go to tonight and my friend commented on how white my teeth look. Amazing!!</li>
    <li> Great, once the trays were properly molded!</li>
    <li> This whitening kit is very good . The peroxide in it helps whiten your teeth . The kit works better than others which surprised me. And it very affordable . Will definitely keep using .</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical, but then I snapped out of it and said what the hay. I tried it and wow. I cannot believe the results I got in just days, so I had my friend to try it, who is a bigger smoker and coffee drinker than me to see how much of an effect it will have him. I wish I would have taken a picture. I mean after only 2 days, I said woah. Most products Ade just all talk, but this product... 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Lower tray too small.</li>
    <li> Here’s a tip: if you don’t want to use the trays, you can also apply it using a cotton swab or other method, whoever your choosing. Just make sure you apply it for ten to fifteen minutes before discarding. But I use the trays, personally, just so I can keep it all in my mouth and not all over my lips and tongue.</li>
    <li> Whitening seems to work, but the process is too complicated. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I got Smartsmile I admit I was a skeptic.  Man was I wrong!  Smartsmile is exactly as advertised and certainly one of the best products on the market for those tough-to-remove stains.  If you want your smile back, then this product is for you.  It&#x27;s affordable too.  My dentist couldn&#x27;t believe it was an over the counter product!</li>
    <li> Wow does this stuff work! I love these trays, the paste can hurt your gums a little bit but over all I have no sensitivity after I use this on my teeth. I use this product every week to keep my teeth white and sparkling (ha-ha) this product really is better than the strips. Save your money on those and buy this product. The results are breathtaking.</li>
    <li> do not put the mouthpiece in boiling water it will become unuseage.</li>
    <li> So far so good..my teeth look a couple shades lighter, and it&#x27;s only been a few days. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I noticed that my teeth were looking a little yellow in some pictures and so I decided to do something about it. I saw that this product had a lot of good review so I tried it out and I was not disappointed! Within just two times of using this product my teeth were looking a lot whiter and now I just use it every once in a while when I start to notice some coffee stains starting to appear and they disappear immediately! I would definitely recommend this product, you only have to shape the mouth guards once in the beginning and after that all you have to do is apply the gel and wait!</li>
    <li> Are these reviews fake or are other reviewer&#x27;s teeth that yellow?  This product is no different that most of the other useless whitenings you can buy at a store. Meaning &#x3D; it doesn&#x27;t work! My shade of white move by half a tone using their provided chart. And their so-called &amp;#34;patented mouth tray&amp;#34;, its just like any other brand&#x27;s and that includes how uncomfortable they are. And yes, I left them on for over 20 min a day for two whole weeks. Its a waste of time! Also, I love how the manufacturer sends an email explaining their award design packaging, like I cared about that, make a product that actually works before worry about the package.</li>
    <li> The guard is so easy to use and actually stays in place unlike the strips. I like to make sure my entire front teeth are covered and that makes this product even better</li>
    <li> WORST PRODUCT EVERY!!! BURNED MY GUMS AFTER ONLY SECONDS!!</li>
    <li> Been using it since it arrived. So far so good, I&#x27;ve noticed a good improvement in color. Doesn&#x27;t appear to make my teeth sensitive. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> not as good as expected</li>
    <li> I got this last week and I started using in it for 5 days already.  I noticed the difference the 3rd time I used it so it works fast. The sensitivity is a bit of an issue because the tray has to stay in my mouth for 15 minutes but it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
    <li> Smartsmile Profession Teeth Whitening Kit was a great success! It worked fast, easily, and didn&#x27;t cause pain or discomfort (which is a problem with most whitening kits). As someone who used to smoke and drink an obsessive amount of coffee, my teeth were stained and embarrassing... But even worse, I have a hard time enjoying ice cream due to that ever present sensitivity...So, I expected some intense pain from this. However, after coming across this whitening kit, not only are those stains are gone, but I didn&#x27;t even feel like my face was kicked in.... and I was pretty happy about that. Thank you Smartsmile for this awesome kit of wonder. :D</li>
    <li> The Smartsmile Professional Teeth Whitening Kit was just the thing I&#x27;ve been looking for! As someone who cares very much for my teeth (both health and appearance), I am always on the lookout for quality products. I&#x27;ve tried several teeth whitening brands, and the Smartsmile is THE best!&lt;br /&gt;While other teeth whitening brands use harmful ingredients in their products, which may cause pain and does cause damage, Smartsmile uses natural ingredients and nontoxic chemicals. While using this product, not only did my teeth become whiter, but I had no pain in my teeth or gums! The gel and tray are not messy like other brands, and is super comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this if you want a whiter, brighter smile!</li>
    <li> Excellent product... I was impressed. I have tried several simillar solutions to avoid a trip to dentist but smartsmile was undoubtedly the best. I like the fact that it uses all natural ingredients so I am not putting any harmful chemicals in my mouth. I was specially happy because this product didn&#x27;t cause any discomfort. Smart Smile Whitening is easy to use and comes with the instructions in plain, easy to follow English.You don&#x27;t need to be dentist to apply this:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth looks and feel much better. After trying pretty much every other at home teeth whitening solution in the market, I recommend Smart smile. I told the same to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> After years of drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes, I was so proud of myself when I finally quit smoking. The only problem was, I was reminded of the years of damage to my teeth every time I looked in the mirror. Obviously, it&#x27;s hard to feel attractive when I am self-conscious about my smile. I started looking into teeth-whitening options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a couple of the other big name brands for teeth whitening, but the results were less than optimal. My teeth just went from really yellow to slightly less yellow, it definitely was not worth the money I spent. Then I tried Smartsmile, and I witnessed results immediately! It only took one treatment to take years off of the smoking and coffee damage I had done to my teeth. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Professional teeth whitening is so ridiculously expensive these days. Who has an extra couple hundred dollars to drop every six months at the dentist? Especially when there are great products like this one you can use at home for a fraction of the price and which work much better than those whitening strips (which I&#x27;ve found to be a waste of money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who smokes and drinks too much coffee, I was skeptical that I would see results on my dull teeth after one application, but lo and behold there was a noticeable difference. The trays were easy to use and stayed in place snugly. Two more applications and my poor stained teeth were shining bright once more. Friends and family noticed the difference and complimented me on my smile, for the first time in years! No more wasted money on whitening strips and toothpaste, this is the only product you need.</li>
    <li> Smartsmile Professional Teeth Whitening Kit is the ideal teeth whitening kit.  Compared to dental costs, the kit is priced just under $30.  Furthermore, it leaves a fresh minty after taste.  Smartsmile whitens your teeth, beginning with the first treatment.</li>
    <li> To me, the most important part of your face is your teeth. The teeth tell people a lot of you. It is how people communicate a smile with one another and what shows when we laugh. Take care of your only teeth with this great product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and was afraid to buy these whitening kit. I have tried so many other whitening kits and products and everyone said they would not cause sensitivity, but had no result or had problem with pain. After I used these Smartsmile Professional White kit I have really white teeth and absolutely NO sensitivity.  I am getting so many compliments every day on how nice my teeth look and I&#x27;ve just been smiling a lot !! Great product and definitely good price.</li>
    <li> Smartsmile has really whitened my teeth fast, and the directions were very easy to understand.The thermotrays are very easy to use and formed to my teeth easily and fit them perfectly. Tea stains on my teeth that I have had on my teeth for a while has seemed to quickly disappeared, and my smile is definitely brighter. I can not believe how wonderful this product has been on my teeth. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> My dentist actually recommended this whitening kit to me on my last semi-annual visit. I was talking to him about how I was uncomfortable with my smile but unsure if I wanted to spend a lot of money on getting them whitened. He recommended this kit to me and I have been using it ever since. I have noticed a big difference and I look much healthier and more attractive with my whiter smile. Highly recommended for anyone who is the least bit uncomfortable with their appearance or smile. Worth it!</li>
    <li> What more can I say? It works exactly as listed. I was scared to try a DIY whitening kit but after this I am sure anyone else can do it successfully!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it is total scam. Do not be cheated like me. Look at the reviews, all of them are written buy the same writer.</li>
    <li> Just used one treatment and can already tell a difference.  My teeth indeed appear whiter, and I feel better about my smile as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product because you can achieve the same whitening results in ONE treatment than like 7 treatments combined of whitening strips.  Saves a lot of time!  No bad taste. No burning gums (my gums burned with whitening strips). Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> If you are wanting a different approach to whitening strips, Smartsmile Teeth Whitening Kit  may be for you.  Instead of those nasty strips, this whitening kit uses thermoform trays with Carbamide Peroxide Gel.  It&#x27;s also considered &amp;#34;Dentist Professional&amp;#34; which is a definite plus when using a product designed specifically for teeth whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you have a large or small mouth, the tray seems to fit any size mouth without that horrible discomfort.  It&#x27;s very simple to use and you can keep the tray in your mouth between 5 and 15 minutes.  Perfect for someone with a busy schedule.  I think the best thing about this product is that it has a lovely winter taste with none of the nasty aftertastes.</li>
    <li> Use it about twice a week</li>
    <li> Picked this up because of the good reviews and the low price. However once in my hands I noticed the instructions on the back of the box appear to have been written by a non-English speaker. Hmm ... which is weird, considering how &amp;#34;Made In The USA&amp;#34; is printed on the carton (and all over their web site too). Started to get suspicious. Some copy from their web site : &amp;#34;...we believe we will grow to be as large and well known as the biggest teeth whitennig brands out there. All of our products are made in the USA, never china.&amp;#34; (spelling mistakes left intact)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started to notice that many of the Verified reviews appear to have been written by people who got this kit for free .. and then their web site boasts that they&#x27;re the &amp;#34;#1 top reviewed whitening kit on Amazon&amp;#34; .. hmmm. Many of the reviews are also &amp;#34;English questionable&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho .. because you form the plastic tooth molds by first dropping them in boiling water (where they sort of melt and get sticky) I wanted to make sure they weren&#x27;t loaded with BPA (good for making plastic malleable) but of course there&#x27;s no info anywhere. And once I started to put the brakes on I&#x27;m realizing that this is exactly the kind of product I know better than to use. If I&#x27;m going to be trusting a company with my health, and trusting that there won&#x27;t be any long-term consequences, I need your product to feel less ... fishy. So at this point I&#x27;m either going to toss it or send it back.</li>
    <li> Being a coffee, red wine and soda drinker, I feel like I need to take extra steps to keep my teeth white. I am always searching out new and innovative whitening solutions. I found the Smartsmile Professional Teeth Whitening Kit easy to use, effective and a good price. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This a great product that you can easily use from home for that MEGA WATT SMILE.  I use this product on a monthly basis to keep my smile super charged.</li>
    <li> Feels very professional and I actually see results write away . Best whitening product I have used  . I love to drink caffeine. So this product helps with that tremendously .Definitely worth the price !!</li>
    <li> These whitening strips have changed the way I view myself! As a single woman I have been judged for my hygiene and these strips help give me confidence I never knew I had! It&#x27;s simple to use and works in a manner of hours!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use: simply apply gel to trays and insert for between 5 and 15 minutes each day.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all you have to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works within HOURS! Simple to use, gives you a confidence boost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: As your teeth whiten you may feel you can stop treatments, DON&#x27;T keep going for a little while longer.</li>
    <li> Never, never, never again. Never again. Never.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the whitener from the dentist.</li>
    <li> This has also happen to be I e one of my favorite I have started to become a coffee drinking and I don&#x27;t want my teeth to stain so I have been using this it also has peroxide so it gets them really white which I love I get compliments almost everyday and people ask me who&#x27;s my dentist lol I recommend them this</li>
    <li> So i was on amazon looking for the teeth whitening that i always buy and ended up buying this one as the other was taking too long to ship.I am very happy with this one also. The best part about this one is it has all natural ingredients.It covers most of the teeth.I used it 3-4 times already and dont see any problem.I did read the reviews before buying and did not see any sensitivity issues.I think it all depends on how healthy your teeth are.&lt;br /&gt;This is good and economical than dentist visit.I like this one and will continue to buy .Will recommend this product !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an ongoing problem with tooth color because of a medication I take, so I&#x27;ve tried several tooth whitening methods. The strips that you buy in a drug store left my gums sensitive and barely changed the color of my teeth. The whitening kit from a dentist worked well but was very expensive. For me, Smartsmile has worked out the best. It&#x27;s similar to the tooth whitening kit from a dentist&#x27;s office, but at about one tenth of the price. The whitener goes in the tray and then the tray fits around your teeth.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to use and takes a few minutes a day for about a week. And unlike the whitening strips, it doesn&#x27;t make your gums or teeth painful or sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my dentist gave me a take-home whitening kit, my teeth were noticeably whiter in about 5 days. I&#x27;ve gotten the same results with this whitener...in the same amount of time. Before spending a lot on a dental tooth whitening procedure, try this product. It works!</li>
    <li> Since my teen years I&#x27;ve always been in search of the perfect whitening product for my teeth. I&#x27;ve tried it all. Whitening strips, whitening mouth washes, expensive dentist visits, I&#x27;ve even tried oil pulling! By far this product has been THE best I&#x27;ve tried and I will continue to use it.    The natural ingredients are a plus and there are absolutely no side effects or discomfort especially if you have sensitive teeth. It is very simple to use with no confusing instructions. You will notice results right away!    For anyone who is looking to improve their smile and gain their confidence back, I highly recommend you use Smartsmile Professional At Home Teeth Whitening Kit :)</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using Smartsmile, I have actually been complimented on my teeth...by my dentist AND hygienist. I will never go back to using whitening strips after using this product for the last two weeks. You can actually feel it working and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it affecting your taste. I&#x27;ve tried every whitening strip I could think of and always ended up with either irritated gums and/or a bad taste the affected everything I ate. If you ever used those strip before then you can relate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing about this product is there is not a lot of effort you have to put in to see results. I&#x27;d say after a full week of using you yourself will clearly see the difference. If you are a coffee lover or cigarette smoker, this is the best solution for those stains. I tried crest white strips for 2 months straight and it still couldn&#x27;t compare to one week results of smartsmile. It also has natural ingredients so you know exactly what your are putting into your body. SO if your want a product with good results and a comfortable fit, your looking at it. Hands down the best whitening product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Never tried a teeth whitener before this one.  After much research I found this one.  I liked the thought of it being natural because the thought of accidents swallowing a bunch of chemicals made me uneasy.  The positive reviews of this product made me decide to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions. Applied and watched a show.  It didn&#x27;t taste bad and wasn&#x27;t too uncomfortable and when I removed it. My teeth looked great.  Better than they had in years.  My teeth werent super yellow before but I didn&#x27;t realize just how stained they were  I can&#x27;t wait to try it again and see if  I can get them even whiter.  I definatly recommend smart smile to anyone trying to get the glow back in their smile.</li>
    <li> Has not been working for me. Directions are short and not very helpful. The thermotrays, while interesting in application, don&#x27;t conform to my teeth easily or fit as snug as other reviews imply. There is an email provided for support, but there is no official site that I&#x27;ve found, no youtube reviews, etc...almost worried that this product is a scam, especially since there are only 5 star reviews. Will continue to try and use this product, if anything they do give you a ton of solution to use, although I have yet to see any difference in teeth whiteness.</li>
    <li> After the first use I must say that my gums are burning. I am quite nervous about all the 5 stars reviews.</li>
    <li> After a couple uses my smile is brighter and I am happy with the results. I will continue to use it and I think it will be just as good a month from now.</li>
    <li> ...a lot more and itÃ¢(tm)s because my confidence is up due to this product. I am smiling right now actually. The product is easy and pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a week since I began whitening and I can already see the beginning of dramatic results! My teeth are already 1 shade lighter on the shade chart. I use this system by using a Q-Tip to apply the gel onto my teeth, then I put the trays on over my gel covered teeth. I let it sit for 15 minutes each time with no issue. I have very sensitive teeth but have experienced no pain. I&#x27;ll update my review with pictures when I&#x27;ve reached my desired shade.</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening kit is great! I have used a great variety of products but this one is in my top ranking that I really like. It is really simple and easy to use and results show very quickly. Another great thing about this item is the price! The price is pretty low for a great effective way to brighten your teeth and strethen your confidence to smile. I would greatly recommend this teeth whitening product to anybody who is in search of a teeth whitening solution</li>
    <li> I gave this to my Aunt who drinks a lot of coffee and tea. She wanted whiter teeth. We both noticed how fast it worked for brightening her teeth. She told me that the tray fit her teeth well. Furthermore, she also liked the fact that it had a mint flavor instead of the one I use that has no flavor. I am happy for her and I will probably get it for her again sometime.</li>
    <li> Love this product a lot. This product does wonders to your teeth by making them pearly white in just a few uses. It uses dentist-grade professional whitening gel, plus, applicator syringes, top and bottom mouth trays, and whitening gel. It comes with Thermoform trays that are adaptable to fit a range of mouth sizes; simply follow the instructions and submerge in warm water and fit to your teeth. Easy to use; simply apply gel to trays and insert for between 5 and 15 minutes each day and you can see the results. Begins whitening from first treatment, and whitens a few shades within days. Fresh winter-mint taste; no sour aftertastes. Try it, you won&#x27;t have regrets.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing product and I would recommend to everyone who are facing this issue of yellow teeth. It is important to have a great smile. This product has helped me to have a proper dental maintenance and great smile. I have saved a lot of money as well as time. The tray is simply amazing. It is recommended to follow the specified directions and enjoy the definite results. Have a great smile with Smartsmile Whitening Kit!</li>
    <li> My teeth have always been hard to manage, simply because I could not get it to the pearly whites that most of my friends and family has. I was blessed with straight teeth and never needed braces but it came at a price yellow teeth. Honestly, its been so long that I had given up hope and was desperate enough to try anything. I went through many instant &amp;#34;Teeth Whitening&amp;#34; products and it was all pointless. However, a friend of mine had let me try this product knowing of my pitiful dillemma and from then on, I&#x27;ve continued to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t the same disgusting yellow I had grown so accustomed to seeing in the mirror. When I first realized my teeth were actually whitening I was near tears, it was amazing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other whitening products because most DO NOT WORK and this is the only one I&#x27;ve had results for. Of course it doesn&#x27;t give you good breath so brushing is still a necessity but it still saved me. 5/5 Amazing!</li>
    <li> I have tried countless products over time and none of them have been satisfactory. They&#x27;re either hard to use, uncomfortable on your teeth, or just flat-out don&#x27;t work. However, Smartsmile was the answer I was looking for all along. Strips are always difficult to talk with and your mouth begins to water - just all around discomfort. Smartsmile on the other hand, is a gel and tray combination (which I have used before), and are easy to use and comfortable on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a coffee-drinker, smoker, didn&#x27;t brush your teeth for a stretch of years, whatever your excuse may be --the Smartsmile Professional Teeth Whitening Kit is what you need. It works and your teeth will be pearly white. Well worth the cheap price and free shipping! It&#x27;s a great deal and a great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, Smartsmile Professional Teeth Whitening Kit, last week with the hope that it would whiten my teeth and let me tell you this product is awesome. I care alot about my appearance and the first thing people see when you approach them are your teeth. I have tried a few other products but had no success, it was amazing how my wife was the first to notice the difference in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I also have sensitive teeth and the other whitening products I have tried really irritated my teeth, I did not have that problem with this Smartsmile kit. The product is overall at the top of its field, its very easy to use, directions were simple and the thermotrays fit as if they were specifically made for me. Dont go to the dentist for a whitening, save your money and do it yourself at home.</li>
    <li> I drink A LOT of coffee and it definitely affects my teeth. But this kit really helped me! It&#x27;s really easy to use and my teeth started looking whiter almost immediately. There are a lot of options for these whitening kits but this one really works.</li>
    <li> Smartsmile works so well.  I need my teeth to be whiter for my job as a salesman, and this product is excellent.  I have been using it for the past few weeks.  All I do is apply the whitening gel to the trays, and put them on my teeth for about 10 minutes every day.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and I can see my teeth looking so clear and white again, like they did in my youth.  Try this product, you will find like me that expensive trips to the dentist are no longer necessary.</li>
    <li> The rubber on the plunger had eroded inside of the bleach container and one of them had exploded open in the mail, could not get a hold of the seller to get a refund. Complete waste of money. Not sure if they actually work if sent properly, and I will likely never know.</li>
    <li> This product claims to be able to whiten your teeth after one treatment and I found that it did just that!  I found it extremely easy to use as well; just put the paste into the trays, pop it into your mouth and wait the recommended time. Also there wasn&#x27;t a nasty aftertaste as with some products that I have tried in the past. I would recommend this product to anyone who was looking for a easy convenient way to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> I drink coffee like most people drink water. I know ita crazy. But I love it. Several products i have tried make my teeth slightly whiter but you can clearly still see the coffee stains..until this. After 1 use, i could see a huge difference! Excited to use again.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Beautiful smile completely perfected. This works! I love when products can back up their claims.</li>
    <li> Tried everything including strips trays to make my teeth whiter and the trays work the best. It does such a better job than strips because they fall off. My teeth seem to be a lot whiter with this product.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is nice to have white teeth again, I am not embarrassed to smile anymore. It was pretty easy to use, the directions are simple to follow. I was happy that my teeth looked at least a few shades whiter. It tastes pretty good too! Happy customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many teeth whiting products, while some of them worked none of them surpassed this teeth whitening product. My pearl white never looked better and the coffee stains have disappeared. All in all I am very pleased and give this product a two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products and have had little or no results. So I decided to try this kit. It arrived quickly, and I tried it that same night. It was easy to use, and I felt no discomfort on my teeth. The difference was noticeable after the 2nd use. I am very pleased and happy. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like that they are so confident in their product that they guarantee your money back if you are not satisfied. That is how you know you will be more than satisfied. This stuff is really professional grade, and gives you those pearly whites you deserve to have. I like this product and it doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth super sensitive afterward.</li>
    <li> You have to get the hang of the trays. My teeth weren&#x27;t really stained, just not bright as a TV star ones. There&#x27;s peroxide in the product so it&#x27;ll whiten - and it did whiten mine. They don&#x27;t look like the model&#x27;s teeth on the box but they&#x27;re whiter. My only word of advise is that you have to get the trays to work properly so they fit snug to your teeth otherwise the gel won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have very healthy teeth and gums. I have only used this product once since buying and I have just one word to sum up this product, painful. Left my gums pulsing with pain. Had to remove after just five minutes because of the irritation and, as instructed, I used a very small amount of product. I&#x27;ve used other whitening strips and gels in the past and never had this problem.</li>
    <li> You have to get the hang of the trays.  If you soften them too much, they won&#x27;t stick properly and if you don&#x27;t soften them enough, they won&#x27;t stick properly either.  My teeth aren&#x27;t weren&#x27;t really stained, just kind of blah.  There&#x27;s peroxide in the product so it&#x27;ll whiten - and it did whiten mine.  They don&#x27;t look like the model&#x27;s teeth on the box but they&#x27;re whiter.  My husband and kids have commented on it and my daughter also wants to try it.  My only word of advise is that you have to get the trays to work properly so they fit snug to your teeth otherwise the gel won&#x27;t work.  The taste is good and it didn&#x27;t upset my stomach.</li>
    <li> What I LOVE about SmartSmile is that it is all natural. I am a smoker, and my teeth turned yellow because of that. I was looking around amazon for teeth whitening products when I cam across SmartSmile. First of all the packaging attracted me a lot. It looked professional. Little did I know that the result was professional too. When reading about the product in the descriptions, it all made sense, and was not difficult. Pretty straight forward. When I tried it for the first time, lets just say I was VERY pleased with my purchase. 5 stars, although deserves a 6th one.</li>
    <li> First and foremost you have to get the trays to work properly so they fit snug to your teeth otherwise the gel won&#x27;t work. That being said this product definitely has had a positive effect on my teeth. I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues using this kit. I have been able to smile with a new confidence.</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening kit is outstanding. It removes all the stains from my teeth in just a few uses. My teeth are gleaming white. I prefer this kit to the strips, and it does not make my teeth ache. The gel is minty and fresh. I will never use another brand again!</li>
    <li> This product left me teeth feeling shiny and sparkling it&#x27;s like I could see the change immediately would try again</li>
    <li> I got a few whitening treatments and gave this one to my friend. She loves it! Her teeth are so white, and she&#x27;s a regular coffee drinker. Thank you Smarsmile!</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes awful and there is no way to keep it from seeping out of the trays and into your mouth where you have to taste it and try not to swallow or gag.  I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> My husband, as an every morning coffee drinker,  was in need of a brighter smile :)  He had gotten past treatments in the dental office, but we were in between insurance and he needed to do it himself.  I looked around and did some research online which lead me to purchase Smarsmile.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did!  His teeth look as bright to me as as a pro whitening!!  And Of course safety is of the most importance, and the natural ingredients are super effective (why do other products have to have such harsh chemical levels when efficacy can be achieved safely and naturally?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says his teeth feel good and he was not left with sensitive teeth, which is a common result of other brighteners.  I knew he wouldn&#x27;t fuss with a complicated process, so after reading the reviews here,  I trusted that the directions were straightforward and he could do the process without error.  I&#x27;m not a coffee drinker or smoker, but I could use a little brightening and I just ordered a kit for myself!!  My husbands results were noticeable the same day he applied it, I&#x27;m hoping for the same!!  I&#x27;ll attach my before and after pics after I receive and apply it.</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal. I have always had yellow teeth, and with the recent inventions in dental technology skyrocketing I was very skeptical about purchasing teeth whitening products. I looked around and I found smartsmile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It states that I should see a difference in jusy days of use. I have seen a difference, a huge difference. I am no longer ashamed to smile with teeth for photographs and otherwise. My teeth are actually beginning to look like those of celebrities in commercials. Will definitely buy again and will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome I had to write a review. I never went to the dentist much growing up because of no insurance so as an adult I do whatever I can to maintain healthy teeth. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of whitening products but I&#x27;m so glad I found this one! It&#x27;s easy, simple, and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other products that just don&#x27;t match up to this one. I recommend trying this product. Especially over those pesky crappy other products out there that do not work as well as this one! I can see a major difference in my teeth and I&#x27;m so pleased with my results. Thank you Smartsmile!!</li>
    <li> Like the name implies, this is a professional level kit, so you can expect professional level results. I have sensitive teeth, and this product did not irritate my teeth or gums. There was no mess involved, and there is a customer service email provided in case you have any questions about the product. Try this product before spending money at the dentist on expensive whitening treatments!</li>
    <li> This product is a great product for when trying to whiten your teeth. I think this was a great opportunity to  whiten my teeth with minimal effort. i would recommend this to anyone trying to make their smile a little brighter.</li>
    <li> since i grind my teeth at night it&#x27;s hard for me to find a nice fitting kit just because  my teeth are really flat at this point :( but this was really easy to mold to my teeth and it fits perfectly. there are none of those weird sharp edges or after it dries there wasn&#x27;t that one part that just doesn&#x27;t fit, it&#x27;s super comfortable. It also has a minty taste to it which i like because most of the teeth whitening I&#x27;ve tried has a really weird after taste to it</li>
    <li> I love these trays for my teeth. They are easy to use and unlike the strips these actually get the job done since my teeth aren&#x27;t straight. These are cheaper than most white teeth products so their worth the buy.</li>
    <li> My mom recommended this kit. I love it. It took a min to get used to the trays but once I did they are comfortable. The taste is good, I love how white my teeth look after using this for five days. I highly recommend this product Its Amazing!!</li>
    <li> The instruction are not clear. If any amount of gel touches the gums, it will cause temporary discoloration, and sensitiveness. I stopped using it because it caused blisters on my gums, since its inedible not to get the whitening gel on the gums. I did see whitening after the first 2 days of using it twice a day for two days.</li>
