<li> For my hair it seems a little too heavy.  </li>
<li> This spray holds your hair without it being stiff or sticky.</li>
<li> Do you have dry, thin, frizzy hair?  </li>
<li> The horrible, acrid, unbelievably foul odor didn&#x27;t really set in until it was too late for me to rewash my stupid crazy curly hair that takes HOURS to dry and start all over with something that didn&#x27;t smell like a chemical refinery.  </li>

    <li> Love this hair spray!  It holds without drying your hair out, also seems to add body to fine hair, such as mine.  Can be a bit pricey at some stores or sellers, but feel the product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love all the other Agadir products but this one dries my hair out.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair but it is thin and straight.  Like all other hairsprays, cheap or expensive, it weighs my hair down and I lose the curls immediately if it&#x27;s humid out.</li>
    <li> best smelling hairspray EVER</li>
    <li> Nothing special won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Great hold &amp; great shine!  This is one of the few hairsprays that will not dry out my hair!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Best hairspray ever I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and continue to be very happy with it</li>
    <li> I love this product and I always receive it within 3 days always have great experience with them. love it</li>
    <li> Great for frizzy hair.  Good way to make your hair not so bushy.  Use shampoo. Hair spray. Conditioner. Spray treatment.</li>
    <li> I found this hair spray on Amazon about a year ago and have not used any other brand since. This spray holds your hair without it being stiff or sticky. You can even brush thru your hair and it will go right back in place! I hope they never stop making this product! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I have Red, natural curly hair, and this product does not make my hair the least bit frizzy. It is a god shot for sure. I am such an Agadir fan. Shampoo and Conditioner and oil and now this! wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed Agadir products ad nauseam --- but, hey, they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lighter hairspray that washes out very easily.  Smells pleasant, lasts, and does as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used this hairspray for 2-3 years and plan to continue to do so.</li>
    <li> It leaves my baby fine hair in place and shiny!  I recommend that customers give it a try.  Body and shine !</li>
    <li> Do you have dry, thin, frizzy hair?  This is wonderful!  My colorist suggested it and I won&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> For my hair it seems a little too heavy.  The scent is different, don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray ever and love the natural scent</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like their shampoo but this hairspray is amazing. Makes my hair feel super soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is just a preference about the smell- I&#x27;ve used Moroccan oil hairspray and loved the smell-- I visited my mom last week and she told me my hair smelled like &amp;#34;her house in Kansas when she was 4&amp;#34; which I don&#x27;t think was a compliment.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well. No residue.</li>
    <li> The only negative is the heavy odor after spraying.  I goes away pretty quick though.  Watched another argon oil product being demonstrated on TV and the stylist tousled the hair while spraying, giving a lot of volume without the plastered look. Gives hair a good shine.</li>
    <li> love,love,love this hairspray.Leaves my hair soft and holds it in place.I have fine curly hair that tends to be dry on the ends.Helps with frizz too.</li>
    <li> I have started using all the Agadir Argan Oil products and they have greatly improved the condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite some time an love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and tried it for the first time on Christmas Eve, right before leaving the house to collect my mother, gather my kids and husband, and traipse over to my husband&#x27;s parents house for the evening.  At first, I thought, hey, I can feel the oil on my fingers...maybe this is the hairspray I&#x27;ve been waiting for! Then about 10 minutes later, the scent hit me.  Now I dunno about the rest of you, but scent is a large part of how worthy I deem a product.  If the orange doesn&#x27;t smell good, you don&#x27;t eat it.  If the milk doesn&#x27;t smell good, you don&#x27;t drink it.  And if the beauty product doesn&#x27;t smell good, you don&#x27;t put it on.  This stuff though...this stuff was TRICKY. The horrible, acrid, unbelievably foul odor didn&#x27;t really set in until it was too late for me to rewash my stupid crazy curly hair that takes HOURS to dry and start all over with something that didn&#x27;t smell like a chemical refinery.  My only saving grace was that I was the only one close enough to smell my foul locks that night.  It was a long night. When I got home I tossed the rest.</li>
