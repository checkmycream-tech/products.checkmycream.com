### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product manly scent!</li>
      <li>I have loved this cologne for YEARS!!!</li>
      <li>Great price as well!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just GREAT!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent service</li>
      <li>Great smell and easier to spray sometimes rather than splash.</li>
      <li>This was a very good value and was delivered promply,It was bought for someone else,but i was told he loved it and was so glad we were able to find it for him.</li>
      <li>Great after a shower, right out of bed or to head out for the day.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been well pleased both times.  </li>
      <li>My favorite cologne.  </li>
      <li>I AM SATISFIED.</li>
      <li>So glad Amazon now sells it.  </li>
      <li>Nieman Marcus used to carry this , but I am glad I found it online.</li>
      <li>Send me more please.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
      <li>Still love this one.</li>
      <li>Has been my favorite cologne since that visit.  </li>
      <li>wish that was better equipped to describe the aroma but both are in the citrus/pine/mint family.  </li>
      <li>And much better in my estimation.</li>
      <li>Still, if you liked the original, you will enjoy this and if you never had it, I&#x27;m confident that you will find it pleasing to the nose.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad it is still available in the United States.</li>
      <li>Aqua Di Silva is just a good old favorite</li>
      <li>My order was filled by Parfum 1.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s kind of known as a classic, but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to appreciate it.  </li>
      <li>I believe the original manufacturer was  &amp;#34;Victor&amp;#34; and I have not been able to distinguish the two, but of course, I have not had the Victor brand for many years, so I am going on a distant memory.  </li>
      <li>For me, this frangrance is like a morning in a field of grass or clover - fresh and invigorating</li>
      <li>but I lose the smell pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>Possibly the chemical composition of our bodies cause some to linger while others fade more quickly.  </li>
      <li>It is OK, but I much prefer the old formulation which was much more evocative of an Italian barbershop.  </li>
      <li>Back in the 60&#x27;s &amp; 70&#x27;s, Aqua Di Selva was King and it was around much longer than that, although I cannot speak for its popularity way back then, but it must have been very popular to last so many years.  </li>
      <li>It is long lasting to feel clean for the most of the day</li>
      <li>I have a very primal reaction to this cologne.  </li>
      <li>The Acqua Di Selva is a very heavenly woodsey cologne for men.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>but this must be the real thing since it smells like the real thing and lasts well too.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Parfum 1 and Amazon.</li>
      <li>However, to me, the new formulation is more modern and perhaps formulated to appeal to a new or younger generation.  </li>
      <li>This is not a very strong cologne, but rather a delicate pleasant scent that is very unique.</li>
      <li>My wife likes it better than any other.</li>
      <li>The bottle that arrived today was slightly shorter and more square and had a chrome cylinder cap over the spray nozzle.  </li>
      <li>A classic lemony scented cologne.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this cologne.  </li>
      <li>and I noticed that the older bottle was distributed by Orlane, Inc. in New York city, whereas the newer bottle was distributed by EBPD, LLC in Bayonne, NJ.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy the new formula by Visconti di Modrone</li>
      <li>I will use this new bottle, but I will probably not purchase another one.</li>
      <li>The old bottle looks like the one in the photo (i.e. the one with the green top).  </li>
      <li>AdS actually gets a lot of positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>Oddly, it must not really go away as others still comment on how nice it is a couple of hours after I no longer know it is there.  </li>
      <li>Was searching for a Madrone scent that I had in the early &#x27;70&#x27;s</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or too light.</li>
      <li>Soothing and relaxing scent that does not overpower your sense of smell or offend those with sensitive noses.  </li>
      <li>much longer lasting.</li>
      <li>recently I have been very disapointed with the product.  </li>

<li> Hard to find.  </li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t necessarily scrubber bad, but I can&#x27;t imagine myself every purchasing this.  </li>
<li> The worst part is the audition process for a new scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how the smell of this scent effects me, because they would probably censor it.  I have a very primal reaction to this cologne.  I warned my husband to use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne.  Hard to find.  An outdoors smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using aqua di selva for about 35 years.  I have always gotten rave comments from every female I come in contact with including my wife.  recently I have been very disapointed with the product.  My wife doesn&#x27;t want to be in the room with me when I put it on and in fact says it is terrifle.  I have to agree.  I read another review recently that says they have changed the formula... why would they change something that has been so great?&lt;br /&gt;any chance you could point me in the direction of the company that has the orginal formula?&lt;br /&gt;disapointed in del mar,&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
    <li> I received my order today and sampled it.  IMO, this is not the same formula.  I&#x27;ve used ADS for years and placed this order to back-up my last  &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; bottle which I received 4 years ago.  The 2 are similar but not identical.  I had my wife test the two and I simply asked her to tell me whether she thought the two smelled identical.  She said they were not identical.  Both bottles had a similar sticker on the bottom of the bottle and I noticed that the older bottle was distributed by Orlane, Inc. in New York city, whereas the newer bottle was distributed by EBPD, LLC in Bayonne, NJ.  The old bottle looks like the one in the photo (i.e. the one with the green top).  The bottle that arrived today was slightly shorter and more square and had a chrome cylinder cap over the spray nozzle.  Both bottles are approximately 3.3 fluid oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both bottles indicated that they were made in Italy by Kelemata of Torino.  I checked the Kelemata website www.kelemata.it.  No ADS listed among Kelemata&#x27;s product line, but there was something called &amp;#34;Victor&amp;#34; which based on the product description appears to have been borne out of ADS.  My guess is that this bottle is the Victor formulation in an ADS bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that was better equipped to describe the aroma but both are in the citrus/pine/mint family.  However, to me, the new formulation is more modern and perhaps formulated to appeal to a new or younger generation.  It is OK, but I much prefer the old formulation which was much more evocative of an Italian barbershop.  My parents, both born in Italy, introduced me to ADS which I believe is akin to Italy&#x27;s &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; -  ubiquitous, affordable, mass appeal.  There is a reason why ADS has been around since 1949 and I wish they hadn&#x27;t changed it.  I will use this new bottle, but I will probably not purchase another one.</li>
    <li> Excellent service although I reviewed this long ago. Hope I don&#x27;t have to keep repeating reviews. I AM SATISFIED. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The Acqua Di Selva is a very heavenly woodsey cologne for men.  So glad Amazon now sells it.  My order was filled by Parfum 1. This is my second order from them and I&#x27;ve been well pleased both times.  I&#x27;m always concerned when I order cologne at a discounted price that it&#x27;s a rip-off and will not have the staying fragrance that the real product has but this must be the real thing since it smells like the real thing and lasts well too.  Thanks Parfum 1 and Amazon.</li>
    <li> A classic lemony scented cologne.  I was introduced to this scent in 1975 while on a trip to Spain.  Everyone seemed to use it.  Has been my favorite cologne since that visit.  Great after a shower, right out of bed or to head out for the day.  Soothing and relaxing scent that does not overpower your sense of smell or offend those with sensitive noses.  Highly recommend this cologne.  Great price as well!</li>
    <li> Perhaps our bodies change as we age even in how long frangrances last on us.  Possibly the chemical composition of our bodies cause some to linger while others fade more quickly.  For me, this frangrance is like a morning in a field of grass or clover - fresh and invigorating but I lose the smell pretty quickly.  Oddly, it must not really go away as others still comment on how nice it is a couple of hours after I no longer know it is there.  Still love this one.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cologne, you&#x27;ve got to have your husband/boyfriend/father/brother etc. try this one. It does not have that &amp;#34;furniture polish&amp;#34; smell to it. It&#x27;s not too heavy or too light. It&#x27;s just GREAT!</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I had expected fragrance-wise but it&#x27;ll do.  Was searching for a Madrone scent that I had in the early &#x27;70&#x27;s but this wasn&#x27;t it.  Never received the 0.2oz EDC Splash Mini.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for over fifty years, sometimes with the Victor name, sometimes with the Acqua Di Selva name, this formulation is NOT the same as the past formula. The brand holder Perlier Kelemata (www.perlierkelemata.it) states on it&#x27;s website &amp;#34;a legend that is RENEWED for the dynamic man of today.&amp;#34; Emphasis added. I was quite dissapointed and will not buy this product again. The worst part is the audition process for a new scent.</li>
    <li> Great smell and easier to spray sometimes rather than splash.</li>
    <li> The formula has definitely changed since it was sold by Victor of Milano. Their&#x27;s was a somewhat heavier scent and much longer lasting. And much better in my estimation. I won&#x27;t buy the new formula by Visconti di Modrone any more.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Nieman Marcus used to carry this , but I am glad I found it online. My wife likes it better than any other.</li>
    <li> Excellent product manly scent!</li>
    <li> my wife hates this stuff.  says I smell like a whore.  Send me more please.</li>
    <li> This was a very good value and was delivered promply,It was bought for someone else,but i was told he loved it and was so glad we were able to find it for him.</li>
    <li> Back in the 60&#x27;s &amp; 70&#x27;s, Aqua Di Selva was King and it was around much longer than that, although I cannot speak for its popularity way back then, but it must have been very popular to last so many years.

Still, if you liked the original, you will enjoy this and if you never had it, I&#x27;m confident that you will find it pleasing to the nose.  This is not a very strong cologne, but rather a delicate pleasant scent that is very unique.</li>
    <li> We received the aqua di selva &amp; although it seems to be the sane cologne,  it was not the like the bottle shown in the picture. I felt it may smell a little different as well. Im not sure why. Maybe bc i was expecting the one in the picture. This was a present for my uncle &amp; he also expected the taller bottle with the dark green cap. If you send me the correct bottle i will adjust my review. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I should say up front that I only tried a sample of this.  But I definitely did not enjoy it.  AdS actually gets a lot of positive reviews.  I guess it&#x27;s kind of known as a classic, but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to appreciate it.  It wasn&#x27;t necessarily scrubber bad, but I can&#x27;t imagine myself every purchasing this.  It was just way too green &amp; piney for my taste.  I suppose if that&#x27;s something you like, then this might be the scent for you, though.</li>
    <li> The smell does not last, ....it is not what is was years ago...they changed something...I would not order this again....</li>
    <li> Personally, I like a little bit sweeter smell, but this one is close enough. It is long lasting to feel clean for the most of the day</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes. My sons wear it almost exclusively. I have loved this cologne for YEARS!!! It&#x27;s the best!!!</li>
    <li> Aqua Di Silva is just a good old favorite and I&#x27;m glad it is still available in the United States.</li>
