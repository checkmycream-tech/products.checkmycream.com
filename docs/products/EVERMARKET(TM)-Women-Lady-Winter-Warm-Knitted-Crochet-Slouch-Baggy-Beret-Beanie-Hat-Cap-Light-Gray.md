      <li>I think the only thing the picture doesn&#x27;t show is that there&#x27;s creases on either side of the hat that kind of stick out if you wear it as shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.  </li>
      <li>when they both arrived on the same day, I was incredibly satisfied to find it was made of a nice, warm, and thick knitted material.</li>

      <li>and I will put them on and still look great in my clothing on a bad hair day</li>
      <li>I was a little worried that it would not look right on me because I have short curly hair</li>

    <li> Love..Love... Love.. the hat and I will put them on and still look great in my clothing on a bad hair day</li>
    <li> The hat is very cute and fits nicely. I like the fabric a lot, and I feel as though it doesn&#x27;t have to just be worn in the winter since there are spaces for air to flow through. Overall, I can&#x27;t complain with my purchase, especially since it arrived more than a week earlier than the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Was happy I ordered it, would again next season. Even gave one as a gift..Well made and good quality. More colors please.</li>
    <li> The hat is smaller than represented in the photo but still enough material to get the slouch look. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> The ending stitch is loose and is unraveling so im afraid the hat will completely fall apart but its pretty and soft and exact color as purchased.</li>
    <li> Very impressed. It is a think woven hat. Very warm. Wearing it on a daily basis. Will get some as presents.</li>

    <li> It is cute and well made. However it doesn&#x27;t sit on your head like the picture suggests it would.</li>
    <li> I adore this hat and have had many compliments on it. It&#x27;s not very warm so it&#x27;s a style thing :) it took about 3 weeks to get though so be prepared to wait.</li>

    <li> you can buy hats like this for about $25-$30 in the store and I got this one for under $4, its super cute and warm, Im going to buy more colors :)</li>
    <li> It arrived late - much later than they said. Then when I opened it, the hat has a huge hole in it. It is so big it cannot be hidden. It is also not as baggy as they described. Guess you get what you pay for! It cannot be used. I gave it one star as the colour is great!</li>
    <li> I love the hat.  Fit is great.  Knit is nice.  Would buy it again.</li>

    <li> Love the hats. They look good and most all of all they stay on my head and don&#x27;t fall off. :)</li>
    <li> Its cute even on my super curly hair. Fits well. The color of the hat is the same as what is pictured. Its light heather grey. Its really pretty. I think the only thing the picture doesn&#x27;t show is that there&#x27;s creases on either side of the hat that kind of stick out if you wear it as shown in the picture. But it still looks good as a slouchy beanie.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her hat</li>
