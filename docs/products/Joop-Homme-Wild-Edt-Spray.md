      <li>Smells pretty damn good.</li>
      <li>I do prefer original Joop, but I have tested many versions of joop and maybe this is the best one after the original red one.</li>
      <li>Strongly suggested if you are a fan of semi sweet fragrances that will grab someones attention... 5 STARS FOR ME.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be something like the original \\&quot;Joop Homme\\&quot; cologne which I LOVE very much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the original \\&quot;Joop Homme\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I received the product in a timely manner but do NOT like the smell-nothing like the original..</li>
      <li>Good staying power like joop slightly less potent.</li>
      <li>Love it, so does everybody else, highly recommended</li>
      <li>I like the tobacco notes, it&#x27;s more masculine than the original.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is pretty much it !!!</li>
      <li>I have used Joop products for 15 years, but just recently, I discovered that there are so many fragrances available.</li>
      <li>This product is a far better gift idea than pens, letter openers, and magnets.</li>
      <li>I LIKE THE PRODUCT VERY MUCH</li>
      <li>I purchased this fragrance because im a big fan of the JOOP house and was pleased with the delivery and the product.</li>
      <li>The customer loves this better than the regular Joop!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Review: I&#x27;d say this has huge influences of coconut with a tiny bit of tobacco</li>
      <li>So much, in fact, they buy it for themselves, to wear.</li>
      <li>This was a real winner for us, as he will continue to give us business.</li>
      <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND &amp;#34; JOOP !  </li>
      <li>I have over 60 different scents &amp; Joop Homme Wild is now in my top 10.</li>
      <li>Sweet tobacco aroma with some rum mixed in there.</li>
      <li>This scent is delicate enough that it smells great on a woman.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone wanting a masculine cologne.</li>
      <li>I like Joop Homme Wild!</li>
      <li>First Joop I would wear if I&#x27;m trying to be different...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, floral, and slightly musky.</li>
      <li>HOMME - WILD -</li>
      <li>the dry down is pretty soft and sweet and kinda musky.</li>
      <li>Not to mention that 3 sprays doesn&#x27;t last for more than 4-5 hours on my skin and it&#x27;s not really appealing.</li>
      <li>I like Joop in general because its so underrated!</li>
      <li>No other smell like this from Joop</li>
      <li>But apparently does not have coconut in the notes!</li>
      <li>I ENJOY SHOPPING ON LINE AND NOT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE MALLS AND PEOPLE AND ALL THE RUDE TRAFFIC.  </li>
      <li>I was excited at first like always when one goes for a blind buy and sprayed it on a tissue.</li>

<li> I was excited at first like always when one goes for a blind buy and sprayed it on a tissue.</li>
<li> I decided to jump on this one because of the reviews on how Joop: Wild was different compared to the others i was looking up on amazon and other sites.</li>
<li> Joop Wild is a extremely pleasing fragrance.</li>
<li> a long while(5-9</li>
<li> How: I was browsing TJ Maxx&#x27;s limited cologne section (yes they have cologne) and they had this several bottles of this sitting up on the shelves in protective casing along with other brands of cologne i have never heard of.</li>
<li> /&gt;Overall i was expecting something a bit more masculine, but hey smelling like coconut isn&#x27;t half bad</li>
<li> But when you are feeling a little different want to step onto the unorthodox side for a day its there</li>
<li> I will be wearing Joop Wild at least once a week.</li>
<li> It is worth a blind buy and you will not be dissapointed.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not really an expert in colognes.</li>
<li> No thanks to this \\&quot;Joop Homme</li>
<li> Blind bought it because I seen alot of positive reviews from other Fragrance Sites and a couple of YouTube Reviews.</li>
<li> Yes with heavy tones of coconut followed by the intoxicating cloud of rum and pepper.</li>
<li> , is it a everyday scent?</li>
<li> Long-lasting and complex aromas.</li>
<li> We gave this to a customer as a late Christmas gift.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like $ex panther by odeon, it works 60 percent of the time every time and should be illegal in 3 countries.</li>
<li> You cannot fail with this one.</li>
<li> :-(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Quick delivery .. very happy</li>
    <li> Smell very good, although perfumes for party are not so much my style, the price is well worth it! My girlfriend had praised him! The smell seems to coconut. But apparently does not have coconut in the notes! The projection is fantastic and the setting too! Recommend. The bottle is pretty much it !!!</li>
    <li> Just by the name, &amp;#34;Joop&amp;#34; anyone familiar&lt;br /&gt;with their brands of scent should be intrigued. And trust me, the intrigue pays dividends. 9 different strangers said basically the same thing: Oh, god, what are you wearing?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE PRODUCT VERY MUCH AND I FEEL THERE SHOULD BE SALES OR COUPONS FOR CUSTOMERS LIKE MYSELF WHO BUY THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS.  I ENJOY SHOPPING ON LINE AND NOT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE MALLS AND PEOPLE AND ALL THE RUDE TRAFFIC.  GIVE ME A DEAL ON 6 , SIX BOTTLES AND I WILL ORDER THEN FOR CHRISTMAS PRESIDENTS FOR MY FAMILY.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND &amp;#34; JOOP !  HOMME - WILD - TO EVERY GUY IN THE PLANET. iT HAS AN AWESOME, FRAGRANCE.  THANK YOU,  JOHN ESTES,  18075 102ND WAY S.

    <li> I like the tobacco notes, it&#x27;s more masculine than the original.  It&#x27;s like $ex panther by odeon, it works 60 percent of the time every time and should be illegal in 3 countries.</li>
    <li> Great scent.  Reminds me of Liz Taylor&#x27;s &amp;#34;Passion&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I thought it would be something like the original \\&quot;Joop Homme\\&quot; cologne which I LOVE very much. No thanks to this \\&quot;Joop Homme Wild\\&quot; it&#x27;s a bummer!!! (Dissatisfied). :-( I&#x27;ll stick to the original \\&quot;Joop Homme\\&quot;. (My Favorite).</li>
    <li> very nice and fast shipping...</li>
    <li> Women love the scent...It&#x27;s different...First Joop I would wear if I&#x27;m trying to be different... No other smell like this from Joop</li>
    <li> As another reviewer noted: women do love the scent. So much, in fact, they buy it for themselves, to wear. This scent is delicate enough that it smells great on a woman. It&#x27;s light, floral, and slightly musky.</li>
    <li> I do prefer original Joop, but I have tested many versions of joop and maybe this is the best one after the original red one.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty damn good. Sweet tobacco aroma with some rum mixed in there. the dry down is pretty soft and sweet and kinda musky. Definitely a manly cologne :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;last a long while(5-9 hours)but does not cloy and overpower.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
    <li> Its from Joop so i expected and it delivered a great scent with pleasant after notes.</li>
    <li> The stuff was to &amp;#34; young&amp;#34; for me.  I am of the old(er) generation.  I gave it to a friend who is (much) younger ... he likes it.</li>
    <li> Love it, so does everybody else, highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  I bought a second bottle for backup.  Long-lasting and complex aromas.</li>
    <li> I like Joop Homme Wild! Blind bought it because I seen alot of positive reviews from other Fragrance Sites and a couple of YouTube Reviews. I like Joop in general because its so underrated! It&#x27;s recommended as a Night-Out Clubbing Scent. I havent wore it to a club, though. FYI It&#x27;s pronounced Yoop! because Joop! is German.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites for date nights with my girl!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> You can tell it is from the joop family without a doubt but is it different? Yes with heavy tones of coconut followed by the intoxicating cloud of rum and pepper. I like it, is it a everyday scent? No. But when you are feeling a little different want to step onto the unorthodox side for a day its there and it gets noticed. Good staying power like joop slightly less potent. I got the 4.2 ounce bottle will last me forever.</li>
    <li> Happy  with  purchase</li>
    <li> I received the product in a timely manner but do NOT like the smell-nothing like the original.. Don&#x27;t know tell you try...</li>
    <li> We gave this to a customer as a late Christmas gift. The customer loves this better than the regular Joop! that he&#x27;s been wearing since the mid 90&#x27;s. This was a real winner for us, as he will continue to give us business. This product is a far better gift idea than pens, letter openers, and magnets. I would highly recommend this product for anyone wanting a masculine cologne.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent and quality.</li>

I decided to jump on this one because of the reviews on how Joop: Wild was different compared to the others i was looking up on amazon and other sites. I was excited at first like always when one goes for a blind buy and sprayed it on a tissue. My initial thoughts were on how Joop: Wild was going to be sporty, spicy, or ever peppery smelling.. but no it is sweet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: I&#x27;d say this has huge influences of coconut with a tiny bit of tobacco but I&#x27;m not really an expert in colognes. Not to mention that 3 sprays doesn&#x27;t last for more than 4-5 hours on my skin and it&#x27;s not really appealing. However i can smell it on my wrists when i type on my computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i was expecting something a bit more masculine, but hey smelling like coconut isn&#x27;t half bad i guess &#x27;^&#x27;</li>
    <li> I have used Joop products for 15 years, but just recently, I discovered that there are so many fragrances available.</li>
