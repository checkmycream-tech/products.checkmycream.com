      <li>For those of you who tan indoors, this is a great silicone bronzer to use before your indoor tanning session.</li>
      <li>It smells really good.  </li>
      <li>this is a great lotion awesome color right out of the bed even could see some color before you even tan</li>

      <li>Love this tanning lotion!</li>
      <li>Has a nice smell to it and also has a nice bronzer.</li>
      <li>Definetly recommed this lotion to anyone, also has a nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>Excellent service product was new and as described.</li>
      <li>The pump on the bottle is also a nice touch and makes it easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Having been a tanning salon patron for many years, I&#x27;ve stuck with this brand because..</li>
      <li>What I don&#x27;t like is telling me how many damn words to use in a review.</li>
      <li>It is like Luminary but better.</li>
      <li>Very surely my favorite.</li>
      <li>Plus they also sent me a free sample packet of lotion and chap stick that I wasn&#x27;t expecting, so that was nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions</li>
      <li>this is the best lotion ever but be aware use a paper towel to put it on or your hands will turn very brown  love it and love the smell</li>
      <li>so you dont have to switch between lotions to keep a nice golden tan..</li>
      <li>It has a bronzer in it as well which makes for easy tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Spreads on easy</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an awfully sweet girly smell like most tanning lotions do.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is Fantastic..</li>
      <li>It was great have tried different kinds of lotion</li>
      <li>Full of great ingredients to help keep your skin moisturized and 1/2 the price you will pay for the same product at your tanning salon.</li>
      <li>My skin leans towards the irish fair side though.</li>
      <li>For the same and get more then double the amount of a lotion that works just as well if not better, devoted makes some awesome lotions and this is one of them but needs to lower the price or give more</li>
      <li>runs right off in shower</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s boosted my tan tremendously, but I haven&#x27;t been tanning as much either.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Not very much in this container</li>
      <li>however I do not see an amazing difference in this product and the other products I have used from the tanning salon.</li>
      <li>But this lotion helped so much, and I&#x27;ve never seen faster results.</li>
      <li>Remember less is more</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY lotion that gives me that golden brown look.</li>
      <li>I first bought my devoted code at the salon for double the price.</li>
      <li>Received it extremely quick sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>provides a natural glowing tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia J.</li>
      <li>how soft it makes my skin</li>

<li> how soft it makes my skin</li>
<li> so i go into a UVB bed anywhere from 4-7 minutes (its a 9 minute stand up UVB bed) depending on how long it&#x27;s been since i last tanned.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t make a major comment on how well it does compared to the other tanning lotions.</li>
<li> Product was packaged well and recieved earlier then expected.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t frequently go tanning and usually get roasted.</li>
<li> I am half Irish, half Italian.</li>
<li> Plus, if you pull out the inside bottle, you&#x27;ll realize how little is actually in the bottle.  </li>
<li> I also find that it gets me darker than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is the bottle.  </li>
<li> 7 oz is not worth $40 when you could get jwowws or pauly Ds lotion</li>
<li> Stays dark for days!</li>
<li> You get a small amount of lotion for the price.  </li>
<li> but it is always difficult to ensure that your back has an even coat.</li>
<li> I hate a love-hate relationship with this bronzer tanning lotion...</li>
<li> I use this once my base is well established</li>

<ol>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion! Has a nice smell to it and also has a nice bronzer. Would order again when needed</li>
    <li> This lotion is Fantastic..It is like Luminary but better. This lotion is also plateau breaking so you dont have to switch between lotions to keep a nice golden tan.. Definetly recommed this lotion to anyone, also has a nice smell to it.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this tanning lotion and how soft it makes my skin however I do not see an amazing difference in this product and the other products I have used from the tanning salon. I can&#x27;t make a major comment on how well it does compared to the other tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> this is a great lotion awesome color right out of the bed even could see some color before you even tan but the amount you get for the amount  of money is unreasonable. 7 oz is not worth $40 when you could get jwowws or pauly Ds lotion For the same and get more then double the amount of a lotion that works just as well if not better, devoted makes some awesome lotions and this is one of them but needs to lower the price or give more</li>
    <li> Really awesome product. It has a bronzer in it as well which makes for easy tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that someone helps you put it on so you have even coverage. Spreads on easy but it is always difficult to ensure that your back has an even coat.</li>
    <li> It was great have tried different kinds of lotion also I would refer this item to every one. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am very pleased I bought this product.  It works great.  Plus they also sent me a free sample packet of lotion and chap stick that I wasn&#x27;t expecting, so that was nice.</li>
    <li> this is the best lotion ever but be aware use a paper towel to put it on or your hands will turn very brown  love it and love the smell</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for men.  It doesn&#x27;t have an awfully sweet girly smell like most tanning lotions do.  I also find that it gets me darker than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used.  The pump on the bottle is also a nice touch and makes it easy to apply.  The reason it gets 4 stars is because of the price.  You get a small amount of lotion for the price.  I use this once my base is well established and I just need a weekly maintenance session.</li>
    <li> I am half Irish, half Italian. My skin leans towards the irish fair side though. This is the ONLY lotion that gives me that golden brown look. Remember less is more so i go into a UVB bed anywhere from 4-7 minutes (its a 9 minute stand up UVB bed) depending on how long it&#x27;s been since i last tanned.</li>
    <li> I first bought my devoted code at the salon for double the price. I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions I cannot name them all. The only one that comes close may be devoted obsession. Very surely my favorite. Stays dark for days!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I ordered, it smells great, and I cant wait to try it out!! Product was packaged well and recieved earlier then expected.</li>
    <li> Having been a tanning salon patron for many years, I&#x27;ve stuck with this brand because..&lt;br /&gt;a)  it smells like a perfume rather than a lotion&lt;br /&gt;b)  provides a natural glowing tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia J.</li>
    <li> Excellent service product was new and as described. Received it extremely quick sooner than expected. Product was well below cost found at salons</li>
    <li> For those of you who tan indoors, this is a great silicone bronzer to use before your indoor tanning session. Full of great ingredients to help keep your skin moisturized and 1/2 the price you will pay for the same product at your tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I hate a love-hate relationship with this bronzer tanning lotion...&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;You get great color fast.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It wipes off on clothes..transfers onto clothes quickly.&lt;br /&gt;color runs right off in shower&lt;br /&gt;Not very much in this container/bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now switching to another brand...</li>
    <li> This is the best color that I have gotten from a mail order company yet! I will definately order again!</li>
    <li> My girl told me to check out this lotion and buy it for her. I don&#x27;t frequently go tanning and usually get roasted. But this lotion helped so much, and I&#x27;ve never seen faster results. I had a tan after 3 trips!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the hope that it would be like another Devoted Creations lotion that I had purchased from the tanning salon.  It smells really good.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s boosted my tan tremendously, but I haven&#x27;t been tanning as much either.  My only complaint is the bottle.  The last bottle I had like this one broke and it was a pain in the butt.  This one shows the same signs of starting to break.  Plus, if you pull out the inside bottle, you&#x27;ll realize how little is actually in the bottle.  The packaging makes it seems like you get a lot of lotion because it&#x27;s so heavy, but you really don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Worked just as advertised, i recommend it and will purchase again. What I don&#x27;t like is telling me how many damn words to use in a review.</li>
