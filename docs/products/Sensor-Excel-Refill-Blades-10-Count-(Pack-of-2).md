      <li>Great price for sensor excel razor blades.</li>
      <li>Nice price- great product.  </li>
      <li>– they fit perfectly onto the Gillette handle</li>
      <li>and I’ve found them to be just as good.</li>
      <li>The price was good though.</li>
      <li>Good value.</li>
      <li>Good for 10-15 shaves before they start to knick.  </li>
      <li>The blades are kind of okay.</li>
      <li>Better value than retail and even warehouse prices including Sams.</li>
      <li>I have tried newer razors over the years and feel the the Gillette Sensor Excel is simply the best.</li>
      <li>The warm water will evaporate off the warm blade pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Their conclusion is that the energy used to heat the water is the largest carbon cost when shaving with disposable razors and that therefore electric razors win (but that either way the carbon cost is not that high).</li>

      <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Using recyclable Using Preserve razors will help too.they really are good blades) and 2/5 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing them.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I much prefer 2 blades to 3 blades.</li>
      <li>Preserve have done a lot to promote recycling #5 plastic (at their Gimme5 recycling centers at Whole Foods) and their razors handles are made with recycled (and recyclable) plastic.</li>

      <li>What I do: after shaving, rinse the blade briefly with warm water to remove all remaining soap and hair, then shake off the water and the briefly blot on a towel.</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers I think these blades are as advanced as razors need to be, the extra blades and features are more for marketing purposes – you don’t need any of them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Disposables have a high landfill impact also (2 billion disposable razors are dumped each year in the US)</li>

      <li>The packs are 10-count each; I got exactly what was expected very promptly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Sensor Excel blades for a few years now and they do a perfectly fine job.  </li>
      <li>Great price for what has become very expensive to buy in the store.</li>
      <li>Look up “extending life of razor blades” to get the story – companies like Gillette have no interest in telling you how to make their blades last longer, but it’s pretty simple; the key is to avoid the oxidation (rusting) that occurs through contact with water.</li>

    <li> I’ve used these blades for a few years and find them to be very effective and pretty long-lasting. I only have to shave 2-3 times per week and now that I dry the blades after shaving, each blade lasts for at least 4 months before I need to change it (i.e. it nicks me). Look up “extending life of razor blades” to get the story – companies like Gillette have no interest in telling you how to make their blades last longer, but it’s pretty simple; the key is to avoid the oxidation (rusting) that occurs through contact with water. What I do: after shaving, rinse the blade briefly with warm water to remove all remaining soap and hair, then shake off the water and the briefly blot on a towel. The warm water will evaporate off the warm blade pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two-blade cartridges give a close-enough shave that I can’t imagine how adding an extra two or three blades to each cartridge could help improve the shave. I’ve tried the Schick Quattro and they were no better than the Sensor Excel blades. Like other reviewers I think these blades are as advanced as razors need to be, the extra blades and features are more for marketing purposes – you don’t need any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve now switched to [[ASIN:B000S83JY8 Preserve Triple Razor Refills - 4 PK,(Preserve)]]  – they fit perfectly onto the Gillette handle and I’ve found them to be just as good. Preserve have done a lot to promote recycling #5 plastic (at their Gimme5 recycling centers at Whole Foods) and their razors handles are made with recycled (and recyclable) plastic. Another reason for switching to Preserve is that the company does no animal testing, while Gillette have had long battles with PETA over their animal testing and, although the Gillette razors don’t involve animal testing (to my knowledge), the company is owned by P&amp;G which still does some animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I’ll give the Sensor Excel blades 5/5 gold stars for quality of the product (because they really are good blades) and 2/5 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing them. They lose 1.5 green stars because Gillette make little effort to conserve materials compared to a company like Preserve (the hard plastic case housing the blades is unnecessary; nothing is recycled or recyclable) and lose another 1.5 green stars because of Gillette’s and P&amp;G’s poor track record on animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Slate magazine has an article on comparing the carbon footprint of disposable razors versus an electric shaver. Their conclusion is that the energy used to heat the water is the largest carbon cost when shaving with disposable razors and that therefore electric razors win (but that either way the carbon cost is not that high). Their assessment doesn’t factor in the material waste of broken electric razors, and landfill waste is arguably a bigger issue when comparing the options.

    <li> Great price great delivery</li>
    <li> As described.  Quick delivery.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Caveat Emptor! Blades manufactured in Poland not Germany as listed.  Returned and got credit for blades and for shipping as PROMISED in their email.</li>
    <li> Great product and service!</li>
    <li> Very good blades at a very good price.</li>
    <li> The blades are kind of okay. Some are only good for a day or two and then others seem more normal and can last for about 6 days or so. The price was good though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sensor Excel blades for a few years now and they do a perfectly fine job.  Good for 10-15 shaves before they start to knick.  You can get cartridges with 3, 4, 6 blades these days, and I personally can&#x27;t tell the difference.  As long as they keep making this model I&#x27;ll keep buying them!</li>
    <li> The packs are 10-count each; I got exactly what was expected very promptly.</li>
    <li> I have tried newer razors over the years and feel the the Gillette Sensor Excel is simply the best. Good value.</li>
    <li> I got sensor blades.  NOT the Excel like the photo shows.</li>
    <li> Great price for sensor excel razor blades. Better value than retail and even warehouse prices including Sams.</li>
    <li> I expected 2 packs of 10 blades, NOT what I received!</li>
