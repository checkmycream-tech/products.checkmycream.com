      <li>Clean hairbrush means healthier scalp.</li>

      <li>Fell apart with first use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also not even sure what that part is for, as even when I put it back in place</li>
      <li>First time I&#x27;ve found a brush cleaner that does.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a brush come so clean before I found this magical little item.</li>
      <li>The comb keeps catching on the little balls and will pull the tines out if I use it to comb through the brush.</li>
      <li>So it filled a need I had trying to clean my oddly designed combs.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>She hasn&#x27;t stopped talking about how much she misses it</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Makes cleaning out my vent and paddle brushes much easier than using a comb.  </li>
      <li>but it is much easier cleaning the brush with this than without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush/ comb cleaner really does the JOB.</li>
      <li>Much needed.</li>
      <li>Decent design.  </li>
      <li>The little brush certainly helps clean combs.</li>
      <li>We used it so much, the plastic got brittle and finally fell apart.</li>
      <li>Very good I strument to clean those nasty hair brushes.</li>
      <li>This thing would likely work well on combs IF they would put a decent brush/bristle into it - - - as it is this thing is so &amp;#34;wimpy&amp;#34; that it does nothing at all for a comb.</li>
      <li>I can only assume it is for comb cleaning because it does nothing for my hair brush, it skims along the surface of the brush, not doing much at all other than turning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Minor detail</li>
<li> Mine is made of black plastic not white, but that does not change the function, though I would have preferred white.</li>
<li> When I towel dry my hair the lint from the towel gets into my hair</li>
<li> The picture shown on the Amazon web site differs from the product received, which is black and of flimsy plastic and a different design.  </li>
<li> In essence, it did not clean my brushes, as the roller does not extend into the entire brush area.  </li>
<li> thing turned out to be a total waste after a couple of weeks.</li>

<li> This is not very helpful for cleaning hairbrushes.</li>
<li> When I ordered an additional product,  I expected to receive the product in beige again</li>
<li> I ordered this item previously and received a beige brush /comb cleaner.  </li>
<li> seller should change the color of the picture, it should be black.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t figured out what a the black brush is for.</li>
<li> it does not clean my combs at all</li>
<li> I soak my combs in shampoo water and then use the little brush to finish cleaning.</li>
<li> i had trouble cleaning my bristle hair brush, but when i tried this, it worked like a charm.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It did pull all of the loose hair out of the brush but does a poor job at removing lint, the bush in the center is a pointless thing for cleaning a hair brush.</li>
<li> I gave this device an &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; because it is not easy to use on the bushes with plastic bristle tips.  </li>
<li> This does the job but little hard to use.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
<li> I am not sure why the color makes a difference, it doesn&#x27;t to me, but it does to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and I can&#x27;t waste our money on something that&#x27;s no good.</li>
<li> but it is apparently making people mad.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job, at least on combs.  </li>
<li> Her hair spray and rinses leave a dark and difficult to remove residue on her combs.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on it my husband got laid off from his job</li>
<li> I was disappointed with this brush/comb cleaner.  </li>
<li> I hate this brush and comb cleaner</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Decent design.  Maybe it works on hair brushes (I have my doubts, though) but, I don&#x27;t use a hair brush.  This thing would likely work well on combs IF they would put a decent brush/bristle into it - - - as it is this thing is so &amp;#34;wimpy&amp;#34; that it does nothing at all for a comb. Don</li>
    <li> I would give this just an ok. Needed something like this. This does the job but little hard to use.</li>
    <li> My mom had one of these from Fuller Brush from the &#x27;70s. We used it so much, the plastic got brittle and finally fell apart. She hasn&#x27;t stopped talking about how much she misses it and I never saw one like it in the stores. So glad I found it here!</li>
    <li> Actually works! I&#x27;ve never had a brush come so clean before I found this magical little item. Clean hairbrush means healthier scalp. Easily cleaned brush means longer brush life. Win. Win.</li>
    <li> Used these in cosmetology school, works just fine.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I read the great review and when I received it I expected a lot.  It simply did not work for me.  I could not get the hair or the lint out of my paddle hair brush.</li>
    <li> I am not very sattisfied with this but it is much easier cleaning the brush with this than without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-&lt;br /&gt;This thing turned out to be a total waste after a couple of weeks. The inside roller thing keeps coming off and you may hurt yourself trying to fix it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  Very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Much needed. Works well.</li>
    <li> got all the hair and yucky stuff off all my brushes. Nice product</li>
    <li> This is not very helpful for cleaning hairbrushes. A fishtail comb works better. I haven&#x27;t figured out what a the black brush is for.</li>
    <li> Fell apart with first use. No way to secure the brush from falling out. Tossed it.</li>
    <li> This cleans combs and brushes quite well. I just add a little soap and water and use this under the tap and the combs/brushes seem to clean up nicely. Wish I&#x27;d known about these sooner.</li>
    <li> I hate this brush and comb cleaner it does not clean my combs at all I&#x27;m very disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on it my husband got laid off from his job and I can&#x27;t waste our money on something that&#x27;s no good. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like having comb and brush cleaner on same tool rather than separate cleaners for both.  Good quality</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush/comb cleaner.  I didn&#x27;t have one.  So it filled a need I had trying to clean my oddly designed combs.</li>
    <li> This brush/ comb cleaner really does the JOB. Two or three swipes and brush/ comb looks as good as new. So happy to have found this little item, that does such a BIG job!</li>
    <li> This is not a five star cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller should change the color of the picture, it should be black. Minor detail but it is apparently making people mad. I am not sure why the color makes a difference, it doesn&#x27;t to me, but it does to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason this is not a five star cleaner is that the cleaning tines do not flex enough to get around the tiny tip balls on the plastic tines in the hair brush. The comb keeps catching on the little balls and will pull the tines out if I use it to comb through the brush. I am using it sideways so it doesn&#x27;t catch on the tine balls and this works moderately well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did pull all of the loose hair out of the brush but does a poor job at removing lint, the bush in the center is a pointless thing for cleaning a hair brush. I can only assume it is for comb cleaning because it does nothing for my hair brush, it skims along the surface of the brush, not doing much at all other than turning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleaner only does a \\&quot;decent job\\&quot;, half of the lint is still there after ten minutes of trying to remove it.</li>
    <li> It works. First time I&#x27;ve found a brush cleaner that does. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job, at least on combs.  Marginally better, but not close to clean.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Mine is made of black plastic not white, but that does not change the function, though I would have preferred white.</li>
    <li> This product is very useful for cleaning brushes and combs which have accumulated hair and crud from hair gels and styling products.</li>
    <li> Best brush cleaner ever. When I towel dry my hair the lint from the towel gets into my hair then I comb my hair and the lint goes into the brush so this device cleans the lint from the brush.</li>
    <li> does the job well- cleans the combs very nicely</li>
    <li> I ordered this item previously and received a beige brush /comb cleaner.  When I ordered an additional product,  I expected to receive the product in beige again AS SHOWN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I received the product in Black which is not an ideal color for cleaning purposes.  I do not intend to use it.  If a product  is not the color shown or comes in more than one color, the purchaser should be offered a choice.</li>
    <li> Very good I strument to clean those nasty hair brushes. Brought one for my sister. Great product and quite durable.</li>
    <li> cleaner for my triple-bladed comb. Workes great with brush, too</li>
    <li> When using tines, hair gets into brush and must be combed out by another comb.  Kind of defeats the purpose, almost.  It is more useful than not, and I truly think that if it was removing longer hair, mine is short, it would be greatly helpful.  The little brush certainly helps clean combs. I soak my combs in shampoo water and then use the little brush to finish cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also not even sure what that part is for, as even when I put it back in place it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything (and proceeded to fall out again and again).</li>
    <li> I purchased this to clean the combs my mother uses in Assisted Living.  Her hair spray and rinses leave a dark and difficult to remove residue on her combs.  This product helps to remove the build up nicely.  I still have to bleach her combs to lighten the staining though.</li>
    <li> I gave this device an &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; because it is not easy to use on the bushes with plastic bristle tips.  It works but not as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> i had trouble cleaning my bristle hair brush, but when i tried this, it worked like a charm.  definitely recommend it. thanks</li>
    <li> I had been looking all over for a comb-cleaning brush like my mom had way back when. This one does the trick!</li>
    <li> works well.  I like clean brushes and this really helps.</li>
    <li> Makes cleaning out my vent and paddle brushes much easier than using a comb.  Great product that I didn&#x27;t know I needed.</li>
    <li> Love this- I had something like this for years and it broke- I was glad to find this one and ordered more - so easy to use and works great</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this brush/comb cleaner.  The picture shown on the Amazon web site differs from the product received, which is black and of flimsy plastic and a different design.  In essence, it did not clean my brushes, as the roller does not extend into the entire brush area.  The comb on it was a joke, as it wouldn&#x27;t even remove hair from a brush.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an item like this for a long time, then I remembered that Amazon has all kinds of good things to sell some of it through sellers. The order arrived in time and in good condition and it does it&#x27;s job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;In addition it is so inexpensive that there&#x27;s nothing to consider.</li>
