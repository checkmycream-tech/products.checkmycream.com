      <li>After a good scrub skin is so smooth.  </li>
      <li>They feel great and they smooth your skin easily.</li>
      <li>This is a perfect, natural way to get healthy, exfoliated skin.</li>
      <li>and I have not been able to find them in the area.  </li>
      <li>The white color is perfect.</li>
      <li>Love these gloves.  </li>
      <li>I even use them on my face and love the result.  </li>
      <li>and I love how they were packaged in sets of 4.</li>
      <li>Gloves\\&quot; and had to immediately order 4 more pair (which I plan to keep all to myself).  </li>
      <li>They last longer and suds better than loofa and are all in all an awesome product.</li>

      <li>My teenage children love them!!!</li>
      <li>The exfoliation is perfect as I do not use chemicals or products on my face due to allergies.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using those cheap nylon gloves that are sold by Walmart and Target for years.</li>
      <li>But, the washcloths were smooth, these are rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When a few friends felt my skin, I gave them each a pair of these great \\&quot;Love</li>
      <li>and my skin feels like rose petals, soft, smooth, and velvety.</li>
      <li>These gloves are so cool to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, if you want some serious exfoliating, these would be great!</li>
      <li>and they arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The first time I used them, I remember I was quite surprised by how &#x27;abrasive&#x27; they felt but after a couple of uses, I became used to it - and now I just absolutely love them!</li>
      <li>I use them daily in the shower to stay looking sexy!</li>
      <li>These are way better than the typical drug store kind, with just a little bit of soap they get very foamy and go a great of cleaning.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft all the time now, and I feel super clean and fresh whenever I get out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>laugh*&lt;br /&gt;You can use them VERY GENTLY on your face (avoid eyes) as a mini-dermabrasion session.</li>
      <li>But the result is smooth, clear skin.  </li>
      <li>Better than all those gritty sand things that leave grit in your ears or hair</li>
      <li>I rotate between using these and using the Earth Therapeutics back scrubber poofy thing (which I also love).  </li>
      <li>They do work well, but it&#x27;d be nice if they lasted a little longer (the elasticity goes out of the wrist after about a year or so).</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>I use these every day and my skin is much softer.  </li>
      <li>These gloves remove that dead skin better than anything.  </li>
      <li>When they arrived, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
      <li>While they did the job, they wore out quickly and stretched out immediately.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are big and puffy unlike the cheap ones you find in the local drug store.</li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t expect it get exceptionally soft.</li>
      <li>and I feel much cleaner than using a traditional cleaning method</li>
      <li>I use it daily and see a major improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>Nice and thick!!!  </li>

<li> Other dyed gloves fade and wear unevenly.</li>

    <li> The stores in our area use to sell something like theses gloves then they started carrying another type and I have not been able to find them in the area.  They are perfect!! Perfect fit!!  Great exfoliating glove!  My teenage children love them!!!</li>
    <li> These gloves are so cool to use. They feel great and they smooth your skin easily. Great price for them and they arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought a 4 pack of these gloves after succumbing to itchy, flaky winter skin.  When they arrived, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but I was pleasantly surprised!  The gloves are fairly rough and they take a little while to get used to, but my skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft in recent memory.  Even my elbows are smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order these.  They have solved my problem of winter skin.</li>
    <li> Oh.....My.....God.....I have used exfoliating bath/shower gloves, but none as wonderful as these!!!  I&#x27;ve been using Dove Moisturizing body wash with these and my skin feels like rose petals, soft, smooth, and velvety. When a few friends felt my skin, I gave them each a pair of these great \\&quot;Love Gloves\\&quot; and had to immediately order 4 more pair (which I plan to keep all to myself).  My husband put them on and exfoliated my back and, I swear to God, I swooned... It felt so good and tingly. Then I used them on his back and the next day I got a dozen long-stemmed red roses from him, delivered by a florist. These gloves are great!</li>
    <li> Great for exfoliating.  Use them everyday and just throw them in the wash like wash cloths. Also handy for travel.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years, and am always happy to have them once I forget how much they cost... They do work well, but it&#x27;d be nice if they lasted a little longer (the elasticity goes out of the wrist after about a year or so).</li>
    <li> These scrubby gloves are so awesome to me!  I rotate between using these and using the Earth Therapeutics back scrubber poofy thing (which I also love).  My skin is so soft all the time now, and I feel super clean and fresh whenever I get out of the shower.  They save a lot of time too, because all you have to do is soap &#x27;em up then rub all over with them.  The first time I used them, I remember I was quite surprised by how &#x27;abrasive&#x27; they felt but after a couple of uses, I became used to it - and now I just absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> I love how these gloves come in a 4-pack. They are excellent exfoliators and they get the job done quickly. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> these gloves rock! I use them daily in the shower to stay looking sexy! *laugh*&lt;br /&gt;You can use them VERY GENTLY on your face (avoid eyes) as a mini-dermabrasion session. Better than all those gritty sand things that leave grit in your ears or hair *blech*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are big and puffy unlike the cheap ones you find in the local drug store.

    <li> Best exfoliating gloves I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I use Retin;A on my face, neck and chest so I have some flaking and peeling.  These gloves remove that dead skin better than anything.  I even use them on my face and love the result.  At first I was afraid they weren&#x27;t doing anything because they feel soft, not scratchy.  But the result is smooth, clear skin.  I love them!!</li>
    <li> I use these every day and my skin is much softer.  Great for pre-shave loosening and bringing up hairs.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> I know there was a lot of debate about whether or not these were too rough: I think they&#x27;re a little too rough. I thought these would be comparable to the washcloths I got from a Korean spa I went to recently, since the washcloths were also made out of nylon-like materials. But, the washcloths were smooth, these are rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, if you want some serious exfoliating, these would be great!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, this product is a little rough at first and softens after a few uses. But don&#x27;t expect it get exceptionally soft. It works very well. I use it daily and see a major improvement in my skin. It&#x27;s smoother and softer. It is now one of my must haves.</li>
    <li> Affordable and good usage life.</li>
    <li> Great gloves. Just what I was looking for. Amazing lather and better than what you can buy at target or Walgreens.</li>
    <li> The white color is perfect. Other dyed gloves fade and wear unevenly. I do not like dyed products. The exfoliation is perfect as I do not use chemicals or products on my face due to allergies. This is a perfect, natural way to get healthy, exfoliated skin.</li>
    <li> I think these are great. I use them every time I shower and I feel much cleaner than using a traditional cleaning method</li>
    <li> Love these gloves.  After a good scrub skin is so smooth.  Works well.</li>
    <li> These are way better than the typical drug store kind, with just a little bit of soap they get very foamy and go a great of cleaning.</li>
    <li> These are the best shower gloves I have used. Nice and thick!!!  My family loves these and I love how they were packaged in sets of 4.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using those cheap nylon gloves that are sold by Walmart and Target for years. While they did the job, they wore out quickly and stretched out immediately.
