      <li>No powder can provide good coverage without concealer or foundation, but most powders I&#x27;ve tried are not as effective as this one.</li>
      <li>For daughter her favorite kind.</li>
      <li>I use alone or on top of liquid/cream foundation, depending on what kind of makeup look</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Dream Matte powder for over a year and absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I hope Maybelline brings this back into stores, as it is the best powder I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this powder.</li>
      <li>But over my foundation it&#x27;s like I took an airbrush diffuser and went from okay</li>

      <li>love it</li>
      <li>I love this powder and hope Maybelline never discontinues it.</li>
      <li>The price was also better than in store.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this powder.</li>
      <li>I love this powder.  </li>
      <li>sure I can indicate to another friends</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Dream Matte powder for over a year and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product, I already knew that and ordered it bc</li>
      <li>i have heard a lot of amazing things about this powder, but i didnt liked it that much, i will use it but wont repurchase</li>
      <li>This powder keeps me shine free for hours with out &amp;#34;caking&amp;#34; up.</li>
      <li>and I happened to come across it on Amazon since it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>It goes on light &amp; matted.</li>
      <li>This powder keeps me shine free for hours with out &amp;#34;caking&amp;#34; up.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and light, not cakey at all.</li>
      <li>cheap drugstore matte powder</li>
      <li>My face doesn&#x27;t look like a paper canvas, just shine free smooth skin.</li>
      <li>but still the same product I know &amp; LOVE!!</li>
      <li>Maybelline has discontinued this product, and I was beyond excited to find it still on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love this powder so much!</li>
      <li>It looks soft, and best of all matte but not flat.</li>
      <li>I have oily, acne prone skin and can achieve great looking skin with the help of a good skincare routine, thin layer of foundation.</li>
      <li>I purchased several color choices and this one is good one for beige skin tone in winter weather, whereas summer I have olive tones.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
      <li>It keeps me matte all day long, and I haven&#x27;t found a good product to replace this.</li>
      <li>The price was so low, that the shipping and handling, turned out to be the most extravagant price!</li>
      <li>It gives me a natural airbrushed look and it&#x27;s very light in wear (as in I can&#x27;t feel it on my face, not as in color hahaa)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem totally pigmented, but it&#x27;s great to make my face look less shiny and more smooth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of matte powders, but this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>looked great but got slightly cakey towards the end of the day!</li>
      <li>and my makeup looks just as fresh as when I first put it.</li>
      <li>But hey, the product is what really matters, and guys think the swivel effect makes a cool gadget.</li>
      <li>It makes you look so smooth and pores almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin that gets pretty oily in the t-zone.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have combination skin that gets pretty oily in the t-zone.</li>
      <li>It just takes up more space while actually using it.</li>
      <li>It was matte when I first put it on but within the hour face was oily looking and feeling.</li>
      <li>and it keeps me very matte skin!</li>
      <li>I have a pretty oily t-zone</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and this powder certainly tames the beast!</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>The powder itself works wonders by instantly absorbing oil and mattefying the skin.</li>
      <li>Light moderate tone in the sand range.</li>
      <li>When I apply it in the morning, it lasts 6-8 hours before I need to touch it up (unless the weather is very humid).</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>It sets your makeup for the whole day without leaving any color on your face.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>like so much this product and was delivery faster</li>
      <li>Sand and Honey are usually tones for people with medium/medium light complexion, but these are way too light.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and stays on for a long time</li>
      <li>; When the product arrived, I left it sitting in my makeup drawer for about a month since I have so many products to go through and one day out of the blue</li>
      <li>Love the packaging, i just throw it in my purse everyday</li>
      <li>face is not oily today and the makeup looks nice&amp;#34;, and this is huge to me because my face is extremely oily.</li>
      <li>The new one that replaced it is a joke.</li>
      <li>Small design thing, which doesn&#x27;t in anyway impact my love of the product.</li>
      <li>and I was so surprised already!</li>
      <li>This powder is pretty smooth, blends well and kept me matte for several hours (it wasn&#x27;t until after work that I noticed a little shine poking through, so I&#x27;d say 8 hours).</li>
      <li>On it&#x27;s own it blends well and leaves that silky look finish behind.</li>
      <li>So, my only complaint or suggestion is please wrap more safely next time.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for years and the local stores near me don&#x27;t carry this shade anymore.</li>
      <li>For my average routine of going to work, gym, and straight to dinning out-- I need to use this 3 times (morning, lunch, after gym).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dream Matte powder for over a year and absolutely love it. This powder gives just the amount of coverage and stays on longer than any other drug store brands on the market. I have combination skin that gets pretty oily in the t-zone. This powder keeps me shine free for hours with out &amp;#34;caking&amp;#34; up. Love it!</li>
    <li> I kept investing in high-ends powders such as Laura Mercier, Smashbox, Makeup Forever HD, Tarte, etc. (you name it), and the search continued...until now! It is unfortunate that Maybelline discontinued this powder and I happened to come across it on Amazon since it was so cheap. So I thought &amp;#34;Why not..&amp;#34; When the product arrived, I left it sitting in my makeup drawer for about a month since I have so many products to go through and one day out of the blue I just opened it up to use it on a date with my boyfriend. I put it on around 10 AM and usually after about 4 hours (with other products) I&#x27;d have to blot but since we were watching a movie and shopped around I didn&#x27;t attempt to blot my face until around 5PM. And when I was using the back of my hand to test out the oil on my face (does anyone else do this or I&#x27;m just weird...?), there was very minimal oil and I was so surprised already! To add to that, my boyfriend commented &amp;#34;Your face is not oily today and the makeup looks nice&amp;#34;, and this is huge to me because my face is extremely oily. And as I&#x27;m typing this review, its 7 PM and I put on makeup at 7:30AM this morning and I haven&#x27;t blot once and my makeup looks just as fresh as when I first put it. Sorry for the lengthy and grammar-filled review, I&#x27;m just excited to have finally found a powder that works.</li>
    <li> the product didnt go well on the powder thingy it came with</li>
    <li> I am very happy, thank you, good quality.</li>
    <li> Tanto la marca como la calidad de producto me encantan así que todo es perfecto. El vendedor es muy cumplido y todo llegó en perfecto estado. Volveré a comprar sin duda alguna.  Gracias</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powder. I use alone or on top of liquid/cream foundation, depending on what kind of makeup look I&#x27;m going for. It keeps me matte all day long, and I haven&#x27;t found a good product to replace this. Maybelline has discontinued this product, and I was beyond excited to find it still on Amazon. I hope Maybelline brings this back into stores, as it is the best powder I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I am only giving it 4 stars b/c this color was lighter than expected.. but still the same product I know &amp; LOVE!! (in a darker shade).. I ended up using it as a base setting powder for my eyes only before applying makeup and it works well for that!! Helps my makeup stay on all day!!</li>
    <li> Light moderate tone in the sand range. U-tube videos kept saying to get this at all cost. We will see. It goes on light &amp; matted. I am still in consideration of the coverage. I purchased several color choices and this one is good one for beige skin tone in winter weather, whereas summer I have olive tones.</li>
    <li> love !!!! matches my foundation perfectly</li>
    <li> Sand and Honey are usually tones for people with medium/medium light complexion, but these are way too light. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> i have heard a lot of amazing things about this powder, but i didnt liked it that much, i will use it but wont repurchase</li>
    <li> I love this product, I already knew that and ordered it bc it has been discontinued.  I was a bit disappointed though&lt;br /&gt;that 2 of them came slightly cracked bc they were setting outside of the bubble wrap instead of inside and looked like&lt;br /&gt;they had a little bit of a hard ride.  So, my only complaint or suggestion is please wrap more safely next time. Thanks! (:</li>
    <li> I love this powder.  It goes on smooth and stays on for a long time and I never see any shine on my face!</li>
    <li> Ever since Maybelline discontinued this and replaced it with a horrible orangey Dream matte powder wannabe, I ordered a buncha these online to stock up. &amp;#60;3 They last forever and actually covers my oilyness unlike that stupid replacement.</li>
    <li> This product was indicate for me by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I like so much this product and was delivery faster&lt;br /&gt;For sure I can indicate to another friends</li>
    <li> This is literally the best matte drugstore matte powder made and now I&#x27;ve found out it&#x27;s been discontinued. :-( Why take away a GREAT product Maybelline? The new one that replaced it is a joke.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this powder! It goes on smooth and light, not cakey at all. It looks soft, and best of all matte but not flat. My face doesn&#x27;t look like a paper canvas, just shine free smooth skin. On it&#x27;s own it blends well and leaves that silky look finish behind. But over my foundation it&#x27;s like I took an airbrush diffuser and went from okay to Oh Heeey!&lt;br /&gt;The only small thing that I don&#x27;t care for is the packaging. It swivels open for the mirror and puff area, while the powder part flips up. It just takes up more space while actually using it. Plus the mirror underneath the puff means if you are using the mirror without needing a powder touch up you have to hold the puff. Small design thing, which doesn&#x27;t in anyway impact my love of the product.</li>
    <li> So sad this is discontinued. I&#x27;m happy I found some here to stock up on until I find a replacement.</li>
    <li> looked great but got slightly cakey towards the end of the day! still i suggest!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to set my makeup, without leaving any color. It does it&#x27;s job! It sets your makeup for the whole day without leaving any color on your face. It&#x27;s basically a translucent powder, but pressed! haha</li>
    <li> I use it over bb cream and it&#x27;s awesome!  It doesn&#x27;t seem totally pigmented, but it&#x27;s great to make my face look less shiny and more smooth.  It gives me a natural airbrushed look and it&#x27;s very light in wear (as in I can&#x27;t feel it on my face, not as in color hahaa)</li>
    <li> It did what it said it would, went on without being cakey, if applied with a press and blot motion with a powder puff!  The price was so low, that the shipping and handling, turned out to be the most extravagant price!</li>
    <li> love it and now I cannot find it in the stores!!!!!!</li>
    <li> DUST LADIES  .... dust !  DO NOT CAKE ITON AND YOU WILL HAVE GREAT RESULTS .....&lt;br /&gt;i use the liquid dream mousse as well over a Loreal primer ( must use primer for that smoot flawless finish ! ) .....</li>
    <li> When I got it, I wasn&#x27;t really happy because it didn&#x27;t have an expiration date.</li>
    <li> I love this powder so much! It delivers excellent coverage and does not make you break out. I have very oily skin and this powder certainly tames the beast! I was extremely disappointed that maybelline stopped making this powder so I am forced to buy it wherever and whenever possible. Bought 7 of these babies  so they will last me a while. Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> It covers without making you feel like you got punched in the face with flour. lol I break out easily but this this doesn&#x27;t seem to make my skin freak out.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found my face powder in the color needed.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty oily t-zone so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good powder to keep me matte. This powder is pretty smooth, blends well and kept me matte for several hours (it wasn&#x27;t until after work that I noticed a little shine poking through, so I&#x27;d say 8 hours). I will definitely repurchase this!</li>
    <li> ...but it did not do that. It was matte when I first put it on but within the hour face was oily looking and feeling. I tried it along with different foundations, moisturizers and nothing put powder and all resulted in oily look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cheap drugstore matte powder I suggest Rimmel Stay Matte, which I purchased afterwards. It is very matte though, so a little goes a long way. But doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily at all.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this powder. It makes you look so smooth and pores almost completely gone. I have very oily skin and it keeps me very matte skin! The price was also better than in store. Will keep buying!</li>
    <li> I love this powder. It provides long-lasting matte coverage without looking fake. When I apply it in the morning, it lasts 6-8 hours before I need to touch it up (unless the weather is very humid). I&#x27;ve tried a lot of matte powders, but this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this powder and hope Maybelline never discontinues it. The powder itself works wonders by instantly absorbing oil and mattefying the skin. It covers blackheads and small blemishes well. For my average routine of going to work, gym, and straight to dinning out-- I need to use this 3 times (morning, lunch, after gym). I have oily, acne prone skin and can achieve great looking skin with the help of a good skincare routine, thin layer of foundation. and this powder as icing on the cake (without the cakey part of course). No powder can provide good coverage without concealer or foundation, but most powders I&#x27;ve tried are not as effective as this one. You also cannot beat the price! I can see why some are turned off by the packaging. But hey, the product is what really matters, and guys think the swivel effect makes a cool gadget.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have been using it for years and the local stores near me don&#x27;t carry this shade anymore. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dream Matte powder for over a year and absolutely love it.

    <li> Good! For daughter her favorite kind. Can&#x27;t find any where but amazon.</li>
    <li> Hols your foundation very good also gets rid of blemish. Love the packaging, i just throw it in my purse everyday</li>
