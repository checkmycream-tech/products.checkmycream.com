### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very happy.</li>
      <li>Remarkable!</li>
      <li>Work great will be ordering more when needed</li>
      <li>Use it exactly as directed, it is a great regimen.</li>
      <li>/&gt; and to top it off</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using almost more than 8 months....</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>do I have to lose to try one more thing?&amp;#34</li>
      <li>My toe never looked better.  </li>
      <li>Every week you file away the top layer of the toenail then apply the liquid.  </li>
      <li>will not buy more.</li>
      <li>My nailbeds seem more pink, and I&#x27;m looking forward to springtime, and sandals perhaps.  :D</li>
      <li>it works, tried many products this one has been the best one, but the process is slow.</li>
      <li>I have a drawer full of meds dedicated to the dreaded fungus&lt;br</li>
      <li>what&#x27;s in this product, but as long as I don&#x27;t start growing moles or extra toes, I&#x27;ll be happy just to heal my nail bed!</li>
      <li>Seems to be working well, even though I messed up the instructions for the first couple weeks (my fault!).  </li>
      <li>This works after trying hundreds of dollars worth of treatment that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>; Reluctantly, I started using this product Oct. 2014, applying it everyday immediately after a hot shower (I read skin and nails are softer right out of the shower, so I assumed the product could penetrate and be more effective).</li>
      <li>This clears it right up.  </li>
      <li>After almost a month of using it, all of my toenails are much improved!</li>
      <li>Also, I strongly believe drinking 1 teaspoon of organic apple cider vinegar twice daily diluted in water has aided in the decline of fungal growth in my body and in the recovery of my nail infection.</li>
      <li>The fungus on my large toe was so severe, I was contemplating having the nail pulled.</li>
      <li>; Buy this liquid toenail treatment, a tube of antifungal cream and large bottle of apple cider vinegar and give it an honest try for a few months.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know it really kills fungus..</li>
      <li>This REALLY works</li>
      <li>It was very simple to use and worked quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually hopeful I&#x27;ll be able to put my feet on beach sand in public this summer!</li>
      <li>After trying many different over the counter medications, home remedies and speaking with several doctors I just gave up  and resorted to the idea of never wearing sandals ever again.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This has worked where no other has and I am not ashamed of showing my toes for the first time in years.</li>
      <li>Early use seems promising.</li>
      <li>In fact it looks quite normal.  </li>
      <li>the toe looks perfectly normal.  </li>
      <li>I discover it is quiet easy to correct by pass over the brush head over the over for 1 or 2 second</li>
      <li>I  have tried everything under the sun Vicks, apple cider soaks, acid, zeta clear, ALL home remedies and over the counter.  </li>
      <li>Because this is a long-term treatment program, I am hopeful that both nails will clear in another four to six weeks.</li>
      <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t discuss my toe fungus on line, but I have tried a podiatrist along with several medicines to rid myself of this toe fungus that afflicted one toe,  </li>
      <li>I have to write again because I found out most or all generic brush head, I mean each nylon thread, is not round, it is being cut thru.</li>
      <li>Works better than any other over the counter product  that I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on month 6 and for the first time in 16 YEARS, my nail is growing flat, smooth and the natural healthy pink nail bed color!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my big toe is 90% clear.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did nothing for me .  will not buy more.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Seems to be working well, even though I messed up the instructions for the first couple weeks (my fault!).  My nailbeds seem more pink, and I&#x27;m looking forward to springtime, and sandals perhaps.  :D</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know it really kills fungus.. I&#x27;ve been using almost more than 8 months....</li>
    <li> Does not work, actually got worse!</li>
    <li> This worked well on a nail that had been damaged and then became infected. It was very simple to use and worked quickly. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working--- the only treatment that has worked for me--  but you need to persist &amp; I&#x27;m on my third bottle.</li>
    <li> it works, tried many products this one has been the best one, but the process is slow.</li>
    <li> the only treatment that I have found to work.</li>
    <li> This stuf actualy works! Remarkable! I couldnt believe it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product at first because I&#x27;ve used so many products in this past for my toenail fungus.  All of my toes had some type of toenail fungus on it with one severe.  This product relies on using a nail filer to help the liquid penetrate into the fungus.  Every week you file away the top layer of the toenail then apply the liquid.  You apply the liquid throughout the week.  After almost a month of using it, all of my toenails are much improved! I also used a teatree oil bath for my feet.  Using this combination has finally started to get rid of the toenail, and hopefully forever.</li>
    <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t discuss my toe fungus on line, but I have tried a podiatrist along with several medicines to rid myself of this toe fungus that afflicted one toe,  It has been three years to no avail.  I bought this along with a &amp;#34;My manicurist professional sander &amp;#34;  that helps keep my nail down.  It has cost me hundreds of dollars in the past.  These two items were less then 25.00 together.  My toe never looked better.  I know I need to keep it up for a year, but I have noticed that there isn&#x27;t that icky build up between polish and filing it down.  In fact it looks quite normal.  I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other over the counter product  that I have used in the past. I have been using this for a few months . There are signs of improvement.</li>
    <li> I saw this in London, but waited to get it back in the States because Amazon has it at half the UK retail price. I was resigned to having ugly disgusting toes, but am now happy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a prescription pill to treat the fungus, but I can&#x27;t take it because of my liver.  I have tried a prescription topical solution equivalent of the pill - no success.  I have tried Piggy Paste (recommended by my dermatologist) - no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for nearly two months and am past the daily application and into the weekly application - the toe looks perfectly normal.  This has worked where no other has and I am not ashamed of showing my toes for the first time in years.</li>
    <li> I was so not happy with this product and too find out it was not the original dr.scholls was very upsetting,but I still gave it a chance and put it on everyday and filed the toenails as directed,but did not even see improvement,I was very disappointed and dissatisfied,I even ended up having to purchase 2boxes of the Scholls due to not being able to run my acct and paying 2.00 more for the other box from another distributor and ended up using both bottles and no results :(</li>
    <li> Finally- This works after trying hundreds of dollars worth of treatment that doesn&#x27;t work.  This REALLY works</li>
    <li> Early use seems promising. After three weeks of use, one of my two problem toenails appears to be clearing.  The other, which has been infected for nearly ten years, is not showing improvement-yet.  Because this is a long-term treatment program, I am hopeful that both nails will clear in another four to six weeks. I plan to re-evaluate at the eight-week mark.</li>
    <li> I have to write again because I found out most or all generic brush head, I mean each nylon thread, is not round, it is being cut thru. I discover it is quiet easy to correct by pass over the brush head over the over for 1 or 2 second then it become round.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with toe nail fungus for the last 15 years. I had it bad. My big toe nail was yellow, thickened, brittle, and lifted. I  have tried everything under the sun Vicks, apple cider soaks, acid, zeta clear, ALL home remedies and over the counter.  I have a drawer full of meds dedicated to the dreaded fungus&lt;br /&gt; and to top it off it was starting to spread to the other nails. I was so embarrassed by it, I only wore closed toed shoes in public. Nothing seemed to work, and ran into this. I said; Why not? I&#x27;ve tried everything else. I followed the directions to a&lt;br /&gt;T. I filed the nail bed paper thin and applied religiously. To my shock and amazement this was the miracle I was looking for.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and my big toe is 90% clear.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t go to the doctor and spend a pile of money.  This clears it right up.  Use it exactly as directed, it is a great regimen.</li>
    <li> Not complete solution. Still trying it, but results are not there yet.</li>
    <li> This review is all about &amp;#34;paying it forward&amp;#34;. As someone who&#x27;s suffered from toe fungus for half of their life, I was doubtful any product known to man would cure my toenail fungus issue. The fungus on my large toe was so severe, I was contemplating having the nail pulled. The fungus had reached the base of my toenail bed where it meets the skin and I was starting to have shooting pain in the toe. I was thinking my nail was about to fall off.  After trying many different over the counter medications, home remedies and speaking with several doctors I just gave up  and resorted to the idea of never wearing sandals ever again. Then, randomly I saw a review on Amazon about this product and I said, &amp;#34;what do I have to lose to try one more thing?&amp;#34; Reluctantly, I started using this product Oct. 2014, applying it everyday immediately after a hot shower (I read skin and nails are softer right out of the shower, so I assumed the product could penetrate and be more effective). I&#x27;m on month 6 and for the first time in 16 YEARS, my nail is growing flat, smooth and the natural healthy pink nail bed color!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It seems as soon as I gave up all hope to cure my toenail fungus, I found this miraculous product. I have no idea what&#x27;s in this product, but as long as I don&#x27;t start growing moles or extra toes, I&#x27;ll be happy just to heal my nail bed! I should stress that I&#x27;ve stayed committed to using the product as directed and I&#x27;m now on my second bottle. I assume, I&#x27;ll need a couple bottles still to finish out the nail growth. Also, I strongly believe drinking 1 teaspoon of organic apple cider vinegar twice daily diluted in water has aided in the decline of fungal growth in my body and in the recovery of my nail infection. Lastly, after seeing progress, I was motivated to treat the dry skin around my toes with antifungal cream. With the combination of fighting fungus both, internally and externally, I have made progress that I&#x27;ve neverseen before. I&#x27;m actually hopeful I&#x27;ll be able to put my feet on beach sand in public this summer! All I have to say is, &amp;#34;what do you have to loose?&amp;#34; Buy this liquid toenail treatment, a tube of antifungal cream and large bottle of apple cider vinegar and give it an honest try for a few months. Coming from someone who has done this, I can truly say it has worked for me! I&#x27;ll update this review with before and after photos soon.</li>
    <li> Work great will be ordering more when needed</li>
