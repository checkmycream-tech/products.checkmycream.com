<li> holds style all day long and doesn&#x27;t leave hair white or sticky!</li>
<li> Last a long time.</li>
<li> hair is already dry and this product has not helped with that or shown any other benefit as far as the anti-aging aspect is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
<li> would not use any other spray for by baby fine , thin hair.</li>
<li> leaves hair hard for one second but then dries soft.</li>
<li> I expected it to smell like the shampoo, but this was not the case.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I have never found any other shampoo and/or conditioner that compares to Alterna Caviar.  </li>

<li> This hair spray was a waste of money.</li>
<li> I like the way it has my hair without making it feel stiff.</li>
<li> Do not like it stiff</li>
<li> I love Alterna Caviar products, however, I was very disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> maybe it was the seller not sure but</li>
<li> Unfortunately, with my thick coarse hair, it does not hold&lt;br /&gt;it in place.</li>
<li> I have used it twice and both times my hair looked dull and lifeless.  </li>
<li> Whatever the propellant is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be irritating when sprayed.&lt;br</li>
<li> The scent was also disappointing.  </li>
<li> I felt like maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
<li> I wish I could get a refund :(</li>
<li> Boy... was I extremely disappointed.</li>

    <li> I love this hairspray. A little goes a long way. Very pleased</li>
    <li> I would give any Alterna product 5/5 star</li>
    <li> Great hold, nice (not overpowering) smell, product is great (fine, thin, limp hair).  Delivered fast, too!</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray, does not stay stiff yet holds really well.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairspray assuming it was excellent like most of the other Alterna Caviar products. Boy... was I extremely disappointed. This product did not perform at all like stated, even after having my hair set in curlers overnight. I have had better results with drug store products costing me $20.00 less. I wish I could get a refund :(</li>
    <li> Good hair product.  It is just right for my hair.  It gives volume and strength to my thinning hair and I can wear the younger styles with it.</li>
    <li> The only hair  spray recommended  by my hair stylist for my  human hair piece.and my natural hair..</li>
    <li> definitely love this hairspray. leaves hair hard for one second but then dries soft. holds style all day long and doesn&#x27;t leave hair white or sticky! love itt!!</li>

    <li> New go to hairspray.!  Keeps the pouf, not sticky.  Smells like honey, which is OK.  Would prefer unscented over scented.</li>
    <li> Great Holding spray without stiffness.</li>
    <li> A perfect hairspray.  It never dries my hair which is color treated.  Most others leave my hair like straw</li>
    <li> This puts a nice hold on hair when styling but does leave a residue on the curling iron. I do like the fragrance of it.</li>
    <li> This is the best I have ever used. Not sticky, just perfect and gives body/volume to your hair as a bonus to hold! I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>

    <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used. Just the right hold . Love it</li>
    <li> Love when need a little more hold then the working hair spray.  I live in Texas and when really hot or, and humid.  I finish with this spray.  I either  use the bamboo humidity  hair spray or  the caviar working hair spray(depending on our weather) then if needed I  put a small amount of this on top.  Do not like it stiff so use lightly and will set all day.  Last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Alterna Extra Hold has a flexible hold that lasts all day.  I have heavy hair and this is the best hair spray I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This Hair Spray is very effective in styling and holding my hair.  I have used it for many years and it is not available locally.  I am happy I was able to secure it through Amazon.  It is also a spray that contains ingredients that are not damaging to my hair.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t anything to write home about.  It doesn&#x27;t have very good hold, it doesn&#x27;t smell very good.  For me, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite hairspray.  It goes on nicely and dries quickly.  The price through Amazon beats the local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Feels good and does not get that dry look.  Unfortunately, with my thick coarse hair, it does not hold&lt;br /&gt;it in place.</li>
    <li> would not use any other spray for by baby fine , thin hair. Style stays all day. nice scent, no build up. This is one of my beauty staples!</li>
    <li> great for my thin hair...gives volume without any residue or sticky film throughout  my hair...I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I recommend ii.</li>
    <li> Gives my fine hair some volume.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner... This hair spray was a waste of money. I felt like maybe I got a bad batch? It maybe it was the seller not sure but either way this stuff just sits in my closet now.</li>
    <li> Love this product. You don&#x27;t have to use much for holding and it is never sticky - even when weather is humid.</li>
    <li> The price of this product is fantastic. I love the smell and hold of this product. I will definitely buy more.</li>
