      <li>My original screen lasted a while.</li>
      <li>First, let me review the product: 3 stars.</li>
      <li>Tried several products over the years and this is the best, so far.</li>
      <li>Makes feet super soft and very smooth!</li>
      <li>basic tool&#x27;s design is a brilliant concept, simple design and easy to use!</li>
      <li>My husband is on steroid medicine that causes callus to build up quickly on his feet.</li>
      <li>I started using this tool bi-weekly (as that is all I have time for) and it has helped out tremendously.  </li>
      <li>sure head over to the huge box store to search for screens to make yourself in terms of screen replacement...or gift yourself the expense and live large by buying the replacement screens also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>would suggest that you can cut your own screens, a ten pack of \\&quot;drywall sanding</li>
      <li>Simple but effective.</li>
      <li>For the price, this tool is well worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>I did manage to hurt one foot pretty quickly by being too aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this because of the reviews and man were they right.</li>
      <li>and they were so baby soft smooth.</li>
      <li>I have ordered and received several more to give as gifts.  </li>
      <li>Anyone looking to keep feet soft, supple, and smooth should use this product.</li>
      <li>After four uses, I am still using the first screen.</li>
      <li>Well my husband&#x27;s feet always challenges me and I have tried so many files in the past and never really found one that I thought worked great.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt like the other grater kind.</li>
      <li>The handle is very simple, does the job, but I don&#x27;t see it being better than many other products listed here.</li>
      <li>I filed so much callus from my husbands feet and was amazed how unworn the file screen was once I finished.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t want to use anything else because it really works.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the beauty of YouTube browsing</li>
      <li>This really works.</li>
      <li>These really work to remove calluses.</li>
      <li>It does hurt if you use it to much.  </li>
      <li>Highly rate both product and business!</li>
      <li>I simply tap them on a towel to clean, or run them under the faucet.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Smooth them out in minutes with minimal force.  </li>
      <li>You use this on clean dry feet.</li>
      <li>I know the shipping (that they paid) was more than the value of the screens; I didn&#x27;t want to keep the extra screens especially, but I&#x27;m surprised FootSmart didn&#x27;t just say \\&quot;keep them, here&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Not sure when to use it for best results, when feet are wet or dry?  </li>
      <li>, that had been my experience when searching for, buying and using EVERY other pedicure tool available ...</li>
      <li>I had used my screen on my callus reducer until I needed a new one.  </li>
      <li>The screens are open enough to allow the particles through, but they&#x27;re coated like sandpaper, so they do a finer job of sanding, leaving my feet extremely smooth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the exact same stuff.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I&#x27;m not sure what I should have expected, as I&#x27;d never used one of these products before.</li>
      <li>So far no complaints.</li>
      <li>I ordered the handle and two sets of replacement screens at the same time, theoretically saving enough on shipping (by hitting the free shipping threshold) to justify it.</li>
      <li>Bring in the one with the Sof Feet to compare grit with, then buy one sheet, use an old pair of scissors to cut to size.</li>
      <li>Wow is all I can say.  </li>
      <li>The handle is long enough to easily reach my feet and the unit is curved, not flat, so it can be used at angles.  </li>
      <li>the cvs pedi egg products are just lame and not as effective, ditto for pumice boards, and bricks, and fancy cure alls from walgreens, or rite aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Having used at least 20 other different products, I feel confident stating this is the one.  </li>
      <li>In fact zero stars if you have smooth but thick callus!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Strongly recommend best product</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all. In fact zero stars if you have smooth but thick callus! It may work well for rough cracked feet!</li>
    <li> I learned about this product through a review on You Tube. This lady swore by this product and said that she loved it so much that she even buys them for her friends as gifts. Well my husband&#x27;s feet always challenges me and I have tried so many files in the past and never really found one that I thought worked great. Well, until the other day when my Sof Feet callus reducer arrived and I had a chance to put it to use. I absolutely love it! It is the best file that I have ever used. My husband is on steroid medicine that causes callus to build up quickly on his feet. It is a tedious job and not only does it take a while, I have to do his feet in sessions. I threw a sheet down on the floor to catch the shaving residual and went to town. I did both of his feet in about 25 min time and they were so baby soft smooth. We both were so tickled. He told me that he can not remembered when his feet looked so good and felt so wonderful. The callus reducer comes with 3-4 replacement screens. I filed so much callus from my husbands feet and was amazed how unworn the file screen was once I finished. I just washed the reducer and let it air dry. I also purchased a 12 pack of replacement screens so that I would have plenty on hand for a while and got them for a really great price. Some times it is the small things that can make such a difference. I am very pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt like the other grater kind. It gently shaves the peeling, hard areas.  I recommend sitting on the floor with a towel underneath for the flakes. You use this on clean dry feet. Yes DRY feet!  This is key.  You have to use it  a couple of times until you get the area totally smooth but it works.  No accidental cutting or going too deep.  It is a heavy screen material that gently scrape the area.  Made a huge difference on my feet.  I recommend using okeefe foot cream at night before bed to help the heels.  My feet feel and look soooo much better.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> These really work to remove calluses. It&#x27;s good that you can buy the replacement screens when they wear out from usage.</li>
    <li> This callus reducer is amazing.  I can easily and painlessly make my feet smooth at home instead of being tortured in a salon getting a pedicure.  It has become the most effortless thing I do at home.  Wow is all I can say.  Thank you for making this product that WORKS !!</li>
    <li> Terrible product, not at all what I thought it was capable of.</li>
    <li> Tried several products over the years and this is the best, so far.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you just HATE the time you spend being INEFFECTIVE!!!??? :-( :-( :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that had been my experience when searching for, buying and using EVERY other pedicure tool available ...PRIOR to this little beauty! I have had manual, motorized, egg-shaped &amp; devices akin to WOODWORKING planers (lol) etc. but all they were was a waste of my time and effort compared to this little pedicure tool. NO MORE!!! Thanks to the beauty of YouTube browsing, I came across a woman who proclaimed this was THE BEST pedicure tool she had EVER used and she was 100% correct!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It perfectly, evenly and WITHOUT DAMAGE renders not-so-perfect, ill-treated doggies (feet) into soft, smooth, creamy fetish-worthy tootsies! :-)&lt;br /&gt;If you EVER do your pedicures at home you MUST, MUST, MUST replace every other outdated, hazardous-to-health tool in your collection and upgrade to the Sof Feet Callus Reducer---the LAST pedicure tool you will EVER buy!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sof Fee for years and would purchase the refills at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. Sally&#x27;s no longer carries  Sof Feet and I don&#x27;t want to use anything else because it really works. I need more refills and thank God I found them on Amazon.com. You will not be disappointed using Sof Feet!!</li>
    <li> Nothing compares to this callous remover it&#x27;s unreal! I have pedi&#x27;s every other week and this truly works it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> Your feet must be in good condition before using it. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but will keep the dead skin from being to much when used weekly. Anyone looking to keep feet soft, supple, and smooth should use this product.</li>
    <li> My Podiatrist complimented me on the condition of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;I love this sander</li>
    <li> I had used my screen on my callus reducer until I needed a new one.  These screens will last a while and aren&#x27;t expensive.  I love the way the Sof Feet Callus reducer works.  I use it at bedtime and then put lotion on my feet.</li>
    <li> If you use the Sof Feet Callus Reducer, you HAVE to use the replacement screens. The screen is the only thing that fits and works with the reducer. Nothing wrong with that since this rasp works extremely well.</li>
    <li> These are just what they said they were so there isn&#x27;t much more I can say about them. They go with the callus reducer.</li>
    <li> Worked as described, which meant a lot to me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many methods for callus removal; this system is by far the best unless you go with an electric device with costly refills. The screens are sturdy and last quite a while and you can reverse them when one side begins to get worn and ineffective. This takes off the stubborn stuff and does a great job doing so.</li>
    <li> This does the job but I don&#x27;t know that I will buy it again.  It is a little messy working with.</li>
    <li> This was a great find, did some research and this was the best there is, will be buying more replacement screens too.</li>
    <li> The callus on my feet became a problem when I was diagnosed with Diabetes. I needed something to help me control the callus build up between visits to have my toe nails cut. This product works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews and man were they right. This really works. I have tried just about everything. It works GREAT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from simply pumice stone, to battery operated callus removal devices.  I never found anything that I really liked to remove calluses from my feet.  I&#x27;ve owned this for quite a while now.  It sands off the calluses finely.  It doesn&#x27;t leave rough areas like the Pediegg type devices.  It doesn&#x27;t clog up after one use like the battery operated sanding devices.  The screens are open enough to allow the particles through, but they&#x27;re coated like sandpaper, so they do a finer job of sanding, leaving my feet extremely smooth.  I simply tap them on a towel to clean, or run them under the faucet.  I purchased replacement screens but I&#x27;ve not had to replace the screen that came with it.  The handle is long enough to easily reach my feet and the unit is curved, not flat, so it can be used at angles.  After all the money I&#x27;ve spent on other callus removal systems, this is the one that works.</li>
    <li> These tool is amazing. Best one I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I had hard skin on my feet due to wearing flip flops here in florida, my feet are looking fantastic. thank you</li>
    <li> Best product on the market.  I have ordered and received several more to give as gifts.  Everyone who got them LOVES them.  The business that sent these products was excellent.  Highly rate both product and business!</li>
    <li> This is just OK.  It works when you use it properly, if I can figure out what is proper.  It does hurt if you use it to much.  Not sure when to use it for best results, when feet are wet or dry?  It&#x27;s just not that great.  You have to change the screen often.</li>
    <li> I purchased these 5 replacement \\&quot;screens\\&quot; when I also ordered the rasp that they are used in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that you can cut your own screens, a ten pack of \\&quot;drywall sanding screens\\&quot; from Amazon costs less than $1 per sheet.  You can cut a total of 10 \\&quot;replacement screens\\&quot; from a single sheet &#x3D; 100 pieces.  The cost therefore being less than 10 cents per piece, instead of the $1.38 each, from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic tool&#x27;s design is a brilliant concept, simple design and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Having used at least 20 other different products, I feel confident stating this is the one.  if you are the type to melt down wax to make new candles then sure head over to the huge box store to search for screens to make yourself in terms of screen replacement...or gift yourself the expense and live large by buying the replacement screens also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the cvs pedi egg products are just lame and not as effective, ditto for pumice boards, and bricks, and fancy cure alls from walgreens, or rite aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool works alone singularly unlike the prior 20 I have used.  I wished i had started with it years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never mind what cream, salve, or soak you use.  Use a no brand anything generic by the pound for those things.  For the implement itself, get just this.</li>
    <li> These replacement screens are very easy to install. My original screen lasted a while. I just opened this pack to replace it like a day ago. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A friend let me try hers, it really does a great job, and I have told friends and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Makes feet super soft and very smooth! I would recommend this product for someone who has rough feet.</li>
    <li> Love this product, sawva review of it on you tube, tried it, works great.  Can be used on dry feet. Easy to store as well.</li>
    <li> If you are used to going to the spa/salon, this is not going to replace a professional…but it does help with the removal of dead skin.  You use this product dry which is a plus for me.  I am currently deployed to Afghanistan and my feet were so hard and crusty.  I started using this tool bi-weekly (as that is all I have time for) and it has helped out tremendously.  I went from snagging my sheets to about a 90% solution.  After four uses, I am still using the first screen.</li>
    <li> The tool is well built and easy to use. Simple but effective. For the price, this tool is well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It has cured my cracked heel issues that I have had for 20 years. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I wish they were a little easier to change out.</li>
    <li> These replacement screens fit and work perfectly on my Sof Feet Callus reducer handle.  Next time I may try the suggestions to use the dry wall screen from Lowes or Home Depot.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful!  Best item for rough heels. Smooth them out in minutes with minimal force.  Better than anything I have ever used!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The description of this product and the photo (not the title) leads you to believe you are getting the tool. You don&#x27;t. This is just replacement screens. You can cut replacements yourself from drywall sanding sheets. The description and photo is misleading.</li>
    <li> Very easy to get rid of extra skin on your feet and make your feet look great. So far no complaints. I would definitely by it again. With the refills that I got this should last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> First, let me review the product: 3 stars. To be fair, I&#x27;m not sure what I should have expected, as I&#x27;d never used one of these products before. The handle is very simple, does the job, but I don&#x27;t see it being better than many other products listed here. The sanding screen itself: grossly over-priced. Here&#x27;s a suggestion: order one handle w/ screen, then head over the Home Depot and check out sanding screens in their rental department for use on floor sanders. It&#x27;s the exact same stuff. Bring in the one with the Sof Feet to compare grit with, then buy one sheet, use an old pair of scissors to cut to size. You&#x27;ll end up with -- I dunno -- 200 replacements screens. Enough for a lifetime for a few bucks. As for the tool itself: it works, but isn&#x27;t nirvana. I did manage to hurt one foot pretty quickly by being too aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, let me review the retailer I got this from, FootSmart. Two stars. They are NOT smart. They don&#x27;t have their act together. I ordered the handle and two sets of replacement screens at the same time, theoretically saving enough on shipping (by hitting the free shipping threshold) to justify it. FootSmart sent the handle only. I waited, thinking a second package would arrive. It didn&#x27;t. I finally called. First time, the service rep was utterly confused. The second call, a few days later, got me some help. Days later, TWO envelopes arrive, each with replacement screens. Seems like there was something screwed up with on of those, too, but in any case they were billing me for both of them without considering that I&#x27;d already paid via Amazon. I had to call again, get a credit, and then arrange to return the extra set. I know the shipping (that they paid) was more than the value of the screens; I didn&#x27;t want to keep the extra screens especially, but I&#x27;m surprised FootSmart didn&#x27;t just say \\&quot;keep them, here&#x27;s your credit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use this retailer again, but to be fair they did give me a credit without much fuss, so they get more than one star.</li>
