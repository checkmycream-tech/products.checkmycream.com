      <li>The applicator and ease of use for revitash ot brow is excellent as well.  </li>
      <li>This product is great!</li>
      <li>After trying Revitalash and growing great lashes, I ordered the brow formula to try to grow thicker brows.  </li>
      <li>The eyelash formula works great as well.</li>
      <li>excellent product give the brows nice colour&amp;look</li>
      <li>best price found on amazon and best yet it really works!     </li>
      <li>I am very happy with the price and satisfied with the results of this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product and am so glad I bought it!!!!</li>
      <li>They have grown more fully and more beautifully.</li>
      <li>The latissee is way pricey and not as effective for me.</li>
      <li>They are filling in nicely...</li>
      <li>- quite effective.  </li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I would love to try the product for lashes, but I do not have those funds yet.</li>
      <li>so maybe I need to have more eyebrows to \\&quot;condition.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I have noticed more thickness with the brows that I have,not necessarily more hair, as of yet.  </li>
      <li>THANKS !!!!</li>
      <li>Would have preferred more detailed explanation of usage and expectation.  </li>
      <li>I have a full set of eyebrows now!</li>
      <li>Easy to use,</li>
      <li>but doubt if that&#x27;s available anywhere.</li>
      <li>BUT I&#x27;m happy to report that this product definitely works.    </li>
      <li>I decided that I should always buy this conditioner because it really helps and is very easy and quick to use.</li>
      <li>I am pretty satisfied thus far with the product, I will have to see how things continue to go to know if I would purchase it again.  </li>
      <li>While the product from Amazon.com is probably marvelous, the tube I received was dried up and only lasted for a week.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this product from a salon in Atlanta.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I think the brows are much finer and lighter</li>
      <li>I have very sparse eyebrows, as well as eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m questioning if it is the real thing because I had bought one at my beauticians shop and it was not liquiding like this one</li>
      <li>I agree with other reviews that it doesn&#x27;t make more hair grow per se but that it makes the hair you do already have darker and thicker.      </li>
      <li>actually found this product at my hair salon and was going to purchase it there, but decided to try Amazon and am glad I did, as it was definitely cheaper!</li>
      <li>any one sees you thinksthat u have coloured your eyebrows very natural look</li>
      <li>The first time I used this product, my brows became darker, fuller, and where I had over plucked in my earlier years, some newer hairs grew in.  </li>
      <li>I like how natural my lashes look.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for maybe 6 weeks now and there is a marked and noticeable difference.  </li>
      <li>I will add to be careful not to set the tube down without tightly securing the top, as the consistency is very liquid and will quickly pour out.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled when I heard about this product but also had doubts that it would work due to few and mixed reviews.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell if I am getting any new eyebrow hairs and the outside part of my eyebrows</li>
      <li>This apparently is intended to lengthen the hairs one has.</li>
      <li>I developed hypothyroidism about 3 years ago and the outside part of my eyebrows (the parts closest to my temples)have fallen out - the remaining parts have thinned.  </li>
      <li>Product came on time and was what I expected, but I haven&#x27;t seen much results.</li>
      <li>It has not been dramatic (yet), but after only using the product for a month, I am pleased and would definitely buy this again.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have only been using this product for about a month now and I was trying to grow out my overly tweezed brows.  I have noticed more thickness with the brows that I have,not necessarily more hair, as of yet.  I am pretty satisfied thus far with the product, I will have to see how things continue to go to know if I would purchase it again.  I would love to try the product for lashes, but I do not have those funds yet.</li>
    <li> excellent product give the brows nice colour&amp;look any one sees you thinksthat u have coloured your eyebrows very natural look</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was what I expected, but I haven&#x27;t seen much results. I&#x27;ve tried a few brands over the years, so it may just be my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! After trying Revitalash and growing great lashes, I ordered the brow formula to try to grow thicker brows.  They are filling in nicely...</li>
    <li> While this product did not grow hair where there was never any before, it did fill out my increasingly thinning brow line.  I have actually needed to start tweezing again.  Be patient, it took me over 3 weeks to see results.  It has not been dramatic (yet), but after only using the product for a month, I am pleased and would definitely buy this again.  I will add to be careful not to set the tube down without tightly securing the top, as the consistency is very liquid and will quickly pour out.</li>
    <li> I finally found something that actually works! I have tried more expensive products than this one and less expensive ones as well, but this does actually grow hair and I&#x27;m beginning to have some shape to my eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;I actually found this product at my hair salon and was going to purchase it there, but decided to try Amazon and am glad I did, as it was definitely cheaper!</li>
    <li> Even though it is pricy, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. This is my 2nd one and the person that does my brows is amazed at what my brows look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t want to use brow pencil, I apply it on in the morning &amp; at night, so I would say in about two months you will see results.</li>
    <li> I have thin brows and have been dying my eyebrows to make them look thicker for years now.  I was thrilled when I heard about this product but also had doubts that it would work due to few and mixed reviews.  BUT I&#x27;m happy to report that this product definitely works.    I have been using this for maybe 6 weeks now and there is a marked and noticeable difference.  I no longer need to dye my eyebrows and now use a lot less powder filler.  I agree with other reviews that it doesn&#x27;t make more hair grow per se but that it makes the hair you do already have darker and thicker.      Love this product and am so glad I bought it!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very sparse eyebrows, as well as eyelashes.  I have been using the Revitalash product for several years.  I haven&#x27;t seen any \\&quot;miracles,\\&quot; but I do notice that when I stop using the lash conditioner, my eyelashes seem thinner.  I was hoping for the same result with the Revitabrow - but I&#x27;m not sure anything at all is happening.  I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement when I was using the Revitabrow and I didn&#x27;t notice any loss of eyebrow hair when I stopped using it.  This product is advertised as an eyebrow \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; so maybe I need to have more eyebrows to \\&quot;condition.\\&quot;  It may work for other folks, but I don&#x27;t plan to purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product, my brows became darker, fuller, and where I had over plucked in my earlier years, some newer hairs grew in.  However, this was my third purchase of the product, and what was initially darker is now lighter, and no new growth accompanies the initial ones.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product from a salon in Atlanta.  Within 8 weeks, I had noticeably darker, fuller, and thicker eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I use to buy Librow (had the same effect), which was double the price of Revisitbrow. I am a victim of very thin eyebrows (pretty much non-existent). Within two weeks of using this product, my eyebrows were noticeably thicker and darker. I have a full set of eyebrows now! I am very happy with the price and satisfied with the results of this product. I definitely recommend this product for everyone with the same problem as me.</li>
    <li> I developed hypothyroidism about 3 years ago and the outside part of my eyebrows (the parts closest to my temples)have fallen out - the remaining parts have thinned.  My hair resoration doctor suggested that I try this product and told me that it would take at least 2 months to start working and I would have to use it for approximately a year to see full results.  I have used it 2 months now and the eyebrow hairs that I have appear thicker.  I can&#x27;t tell if I am getting any new eyebrow hairs and the outside part of my eyebrows still are not growing any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this in 4 months to let everybody know what progress I have seen at the 6 month mark</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m questioning if it is the real thing because I had bought one at my beauticians shop and it was not liquiding like this one and it was working by now.  This one does not seem to be working.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few months. A few thoughts. Easy to use, best price found on amazon and best yet it really works!     I have alopecia totals and lost all of my hair.  Thought I could not have lashes or brows again. I got them back!    I think the brows are much finer and lighter so I went to get a brow tint. It totally worked.     The eyelash formula works great as well. I like how natural my lashes look. The latissee is way pricey and not as effective for me. I also hate the amount   of  packaging and disposable applicators with that product. The applicator and ease of use for revitash ot brow is excellent as well.  THANKS !!!! love this stuff.</li>
    <li> While the product from Amazon.com is probably marvelous, the tube I received was dried up and only lasted for a week.  Much disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like it. It did help with my eyebrows. They have grown more fully and more beautifully. I decided that I should always buy this conditioner because it really helps and is very easy and quick to use.</li>
    <li> I decided to give the product a try, but I can&#x27;t see any definite difference.  There may be a few new hairs but nothing in the areas I&#x27;ve been concentrating on, and it&#x27;s been over a month of use, sometimes 2X a day.  Not a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> It has been 3 weeks still haven&#x27;t receive the item order yet. Contact DailyDeals for 2 weeks now &amp; still haven&#x27;t yet receive. Never order anything from this company again.</li>
    <li> Still waiting to pass verdict. I expected something that would help thicken my eyebrows.  This apparently is intended to lengthen the hairs one has. Long process - several weeks - before any noticeable change will take place.  Would have preferred more detailed explanation of usage and expectation.  The eyelash product was used by my daughter, plus extensions! - quite effective.  Guess I need \\&quot;eyebrow extensions\\&quot; but doubt if that&#x27;s available anywhere. There is a larger expense involved than your usual brow products.</li>
