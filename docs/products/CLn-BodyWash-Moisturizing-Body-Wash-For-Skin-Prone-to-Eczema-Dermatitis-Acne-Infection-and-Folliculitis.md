### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Thank you to the manufacturing company, this product is just marvelous</li>
      <li>friend recommended this product to me and it works great!</li>
      <li>This product was recommended by our dermatologist and it has worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>She picks CLn over a bleach bath any day, and our dermatologist is very happy about that.</li>
      <li>This works so wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Cln body wash is very good for eczema.</li>
      <li>ON MY SKIN, THIS HELPS GREATLY TO KEEPS THE BREAKOUTS TO A MINIMUM</li>
      <li>and I am so happy with the results.</li>
      <li>So - the soap is great</li>
      <li>This is a great alternative.</li>
      <li>works great for my husband who has severe eczema</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>So get a good cream (I like neosporine eczema cream or cera ve), a good Rx lotion from your dermatologist that you put on when needed to combat flares, and get Cln.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for about two months and have been very pleased.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s over-the-counter, safe and effective!</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
      <li>I have tried every kind of lotion/exfoliation combo for the cystic bumps on the backs of my arms.</li>
      <li>Might work best with oily skin since it really strips the oil out.  </li>
      <li>I could not be more pleased!  </li>
      <li>CLn is the best for this last prong.  </li>
      <li>I just bought four more bottles</li>
      <li>Research shows that some people with eczema are more prone to staph</li>
      <li>Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>(I would never take that many baths).</li>
      <li>But, I found that a charcoal sugar scrub worked much better.</li>
      <li>and I have very much enjoyed the results.</li>
      <li>I hope the company was able to address the concerns about packaging, etc that others posted?</li>
      <li>if you buy 3 or more bottles from their website you get it cheaper than on amazon, and free shipping too.</li>
      <li>It is not a cure, but I am excited to be able to pull this out when I have a flare up which tends to occur before I go out in a sleeveless dress.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use</li>
      <li>As it is easy to use, you can use it once or twice a day and get results  </li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I will always have CLn Body Wash by TopMD available in my home.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately,  CLn allows you to take a bleach &amp;#34;bath&amp;#34; in the shower.</li>
      <li>After three uses she is about 95% eczema and itch free.</li>
      <li>so I can have it available in each bathroom and in my travel bag.</li>
      <li>At this point we couldn&#x27;t be happier with the CLn product, its very nice to have something that actually does what it claims to do.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen significant difference.  </li>
      <li>This company has such a great product and there are so many kids these days with eczema, i feel like they need to start giving out free trials!- because anyone who has eczema or a kid with eczema KNOWS the frustration of trying out a million different products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have not used an OTC or rx item with this quick of a result.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not always easy to keep healthy skin with all the different mats we wrestle on each week.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I still think it&#x27;s worth the money on the cln body wash</li>
      <li>It is pricey but after all of these years trying every product on the market it is well worth the price</li>
      <li>Agree that it&#x27;s pricey, but for now it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone Who is about to have surgery or to clean certain wounds like blisters.</li>
      <li>If I use it in the evening my skin always looks much better the next day and feels fresh.</li>
      <li>I found a bottle at a local pharmacy and figured it might be better than the antibacterial soap cleanser I had been using.  </li>
      <li>Actually I love the product - I ordered this 2nd one to have when the first one ran out.  </li>
      <li>I get fewer infections, and I have been able to cut down on using my prescription medicine significantly.</li>
      <li>It works great, I used it every week 3 days only and my eczema was gone in less than 2 weeks</li>
      <li>I have an area of skin that is prone to infection and this body wash has helped really helped me.  </li>
      <li>As you probably know,  the treatment of eczema is three prong:  some sort of medicine to calm the inflammation,  some sort of lotion to smooth the skin to keep it moist and soft, and finally, killing the bacteria on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Bleach baths help, but are work to get ready--</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any difference between usimg this or using a gentle bar of soap.</li>
      <li>It is much easier than taking a bleach bath.</li>
      <li>So yeah if you have tried eventing and nothing has really helped, TRY THIS STUFF.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Our high school wrestling team and club team began using this product two years ago and we have dramatically reduced the number of skin infections in our mat room.  </li>
      <li>However, when I went to use this new one about a week ago it pumped out soap once or twice and then wouldn&#x27;t pump at all.  </li>
      <li>I really like that this wash doesn&#x27;t have a thick feel or heavy scent, just leaves my skin nice and clean.</li>
      <li>(yep, pretty gross</li>
      <li>Some of the product oozed out a small hole in the bottom of the container, however, it is not enough to tell whether the product is effective or not.</li>
      <li>While benign and maybe not even noticeable to some, I always wondered how to get rid of these bumps and make my arms clear up.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>I am surprised it did not spill or accidentally sprayed in the box.</li>
      <li>The condition has almost cleared up completely.</li>
      <li>I started using this product for my 2 year old son about 8 months ago.</li>
      <li>She is almost 13  years old and has severe eczema and skin infections.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it to bathe my 10 month old daughter since she was 5 month old.</li>
      <li>After using this stuff twice a day for just 2 days, my hand almost completely healed.</li>
      <li>But it gets rid of the major cause of itching.</li>
      <li>This wash is great for my skin when it gets irritated, which it often does because I have a bad habit of scratching my face.</li>
      <li>Especially for a 13 year old who&#x27;s &amp;#34;too old&amp;#34; to take a bath.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise and delight, the sores were closed in 7 days.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t consider my ezcema completely healed, but it is definitely relieved by this product.</li>
      <li>This product seriously has had a huge impact on my son&#x27;s condition.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything to clear up my son&#x27;s eczema and bumps on the back of his legs, and folliculitis on his back.</li>

<li> I have tried everything to clear up my son&#x27;s eczema and bumps on the back of his legs, and folliculitis on his back.</li>
<li> It is just hard to justify this high price.</li>
<li> I tried it on my 12 year old daughter who has eczema on the inside of her elbows and it made it red , dry, and irritated and overall much worse.</li>
<li> I have had bad ezcema on my finger for over 10 years and tried many different products and lotions with no real relief.</li>
<li> I had small open sores that simply would not heal.  </li>
<li> There is only a slight purplish discoloration where each sore had been.  </li>
<li> I did it and it as long as you use it every day and leave it on for about 2 mns, you will start to see results!!!</li>
<li> Product is great for keeping my Folliculitis from flaring up real bad.</li>
<li> However, it is not real powerful at reducing flare ups.</li>
<li> I bought this a few months back at the suggestion of my son&#x27;s pediatrician.  </li>
<li> We have been using this product and the rest of the family has had no issue and his infection healed a lot faster than the doctors expected.</li>
<li> our only weapons were sun and pool everyday to lower bacteria levels and boost his immune system.</li>
<li> Bottle size is only 2.5 oz, i.e. very small for the price and one bottle may last just for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never left an Amazon review before, but this stuff was unbelievable.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s $30+ down the drain.</li>
<li> I had worked with Dr. Azam Anwar in Cardiology in the remote past and recalled that he had worked on a product for eczema.  </li>
<li> It was embarrassing because the little sores that covered my forearms would bleed onto my long-sleeve shirts that I wore.</li>
<li> other words: 10 oz (usual body wash bottle size) costs $100</li>
<li> I had a frustrating rash on my forearms for at least 6 months after doing some yard work last fall, perhaps due to contact with dead sago palm fronds and Mediterranean palms.  </li>
<li> I used the bottle in a out a week and a half and just have two small spots of ezcema.</li>
<li> This really helps when my skin is bad.</li>
<li> the last thing you want to deal with when you are uncomfortable.</li>
<li> so we are anxious to hear what the Dr. says.  </li>
<li> I can still hardly believe it.</li>
<li> Basically the product helps his skin to get rid of the common skin infections people with eczema or atopic dermatitis experience.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have really bad eczema. This really helps when my skin is bad.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist swears by this product but I didn&#x27;t see any improvements in the month my child has been using it.</li>
    <li> I have an area of skin that is prone to infection and this body wash has helped really helped me.  I get fewer infections, and I have been able to cut down on using my prescription medicine significantly.</li>
    <li> This product would not dispense.  Some of the product oozed out a small hole in the bottom of the container, however, it is not enough to tell whether the product is effective or not. Will never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a game changer if you have severe eczema. Research shows that some people with eczema are more prone to staph infections- since I&#x27;ve started using this, I went from going on antibiotics for staph infections once every couple of months to no staph infections.</li>
    <li> It works great, I used it every week 3 days only and my eczema was gone in less than 2 weeks it cleared up. Besides using this and another ointment!</li>
    <li> It did it&#x27;s job. I would probably order it again.</li>
    <li> Bottle size is only 2.5 oz, i.e. very small for the price and one bottle may last just for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words: 10 oz (usual body wash bottle size) costs $100+ !! It is just hard to justify this high price.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen significant difference.  The bottle leaks from the bottom and difficult to dispense.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about two months and have been very pleased. I have had bad ezcema on my finger for over 10 years and tried many different products and lotions with no real relief. CLN actually helps to relieve the cracking and bleeding on my finger. I don&#x27;t consider my ezcema completely healed, but it is definitely relieved by this product. I just bought four more bottles so I can have it available in each bathroom and in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> CLn was recommended to me by my Doctor and I have very much enjoyed the results. Thank you to the manufacturing company, this product is just marvelous</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, bumed I wasted that much money.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by our dermatologist and it has worked wonderfully. The product was delivered by the delivery date and I will defiantly order this again from them.</li>
    <li> Please be careful when using this on sensitive skin. I tried it on my 12 year old daughter who has eczema on the inside of her elbows and it made it red , dry, and irritated and overall much worse.</li>
    <li> Skin infections can wreck a season and it&#x27;s not always easy to keep healthy skin with all the different mats we wrestle on each week.  Our high school wrestling team and club team began using this product two years ago and we have dramatically reduced the number of skin infections in our mat room.  The wrestlers know to use the product each day after practice and after tournaments.  Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I have eczema and eczema opens the skin to being invaded by staph germs.  CLn gets rid of the germs.  As you probably know,  the treatment of eczema is three prong:  some sort of medicine to calm the inflammation,  some sort of lotion to smooth the skin to keep it moist and soft, and finally, killing the bacteria on your skin.  CLn is the best for this last prong.  So get a good cream (I like neosporine eczema cream or cera ve), a good Rx lotion from your dermatologist that you put on when needed to combat flares, and get Cln.  Doctors often recommend taking bleach baths.  But I hate baths.  Fortunately,  CLn allows you to take a bleach &amp;#34;bath&amp;#34; in the shower. As it is easy to use, you can use it once or twice a day and get results  (I would never take that many baths). The result, for me, has been to get rid of almost all itching within a week and redness within a month.  Of course, it does not cure eczema so flare ups are always possible.  But it gets rid of the major cause of itching.</li>
    <li> This works so wonderfully. Would recommend to anyone Who is about to have surgery or to clean certain wounds like blisters.</li>
    <li> It arrived without the white cap. I am surprised it did not spill or accidentally sprayed in the box.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I HAVE ISSUES WITH BACTERIAL INFECTIONS ON MY SKIN, THIS HELPS GREATLY TO KEEPS THE BREAKOUTS TO A MINIMUM</li>
    <li> This product is being used by my husband, he has folliculitis on his head for over 2 1/2 years and has been treated by a dermatologist during this time. He has prescribed various prescription shampoos and and creames and to some degree has helped.  On his last  visit to the Dr. he prescribed a Efudex 2 week treatment followed by CLN body wash daily.  This was approximately 4 months ago, well there seems to be no sign of the folliculitis anymore its fantastic. He has another appointment in a couple of months so we are anxious to hear what the Dr. says.  He specifically wanted me to us the body wash on the head not the shampoo.  At this point we couldn&#x27;t be happier with the CLn product, its very nice to have something that actually does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Remember Matthew 7:21</li>
    <li> This wash is great for my skin when it gets irritated, which it often does because I have a bad habit of scratching my face. If I use it in the evening my skin always looks much better the next day and feels fresh. I really like that this wash doesn&#x27;t have a thick feel or heavy scent, just leaves my skin nice and clean. I&#x27;d definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> For months the eczema on my hand was so severe, I was in pain every second of the day. I couldn&#x27;t hold a fork or a pencil or make a fist. After using this stuff twice a day for just 2 days, my hand almost completely healed. I can still hardly believe it. All of the cracks and scaly, itchy skin and everything, gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never left an Amazon review before, but this stuff was unbelievable. Now I only have to use it sporadically when my eczema starts getting bad. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used (over the counter or prescription) that has helped at all. So yeah if you have tried eventing and nothing has really helped, TRY THIS STUFF.</li>
    <li> Have suffered from eczema and head to toe infections since a teenager. Bleach baths help, but are work to get ready-- the last thing you want to deal with when you are uncomfortable. This is a great alternative. Agree that it&#x27;s pricey, but for now it&#x27;s worth it.  I hope the company was able to address the concerns about packaging, etc that others posted?</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve had a problem with crusty skin (yep, pretty gross I know) on the forehead just at hair line.  Been using the CLn body wash 2-3X a week for almost a month.  The condition has almost cleared up completely.</li>
    <li> Terribly drying to skin.  Might work best with oily skin since it really strips the oil out.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> This wash does wonders for my son&#x27;s skin. I was doing bleach baths all summer until I found this soap. After the fist wash his skin improved drastically and after using every day for about a week his skin cleared up. Now I use it when his eczema flares up.</li>
    <li> I will always have CLn Body Wash by TopMD available in my home.  I had a frustrating rash on my forearms for at least 6 months after doing some yard work last fall, perhaps due to contact with dead sago palm fronds and Mediterranean palms.  I had small open sores that simply would not heal.  My doctors tried oral medicines topical medicines, and multiple cultures to no avail.  It was embarrassing because the little sores that covered my forearms would bleed onto my long-sleeve shirts that I wore. It was too embarrassing to wear short-sleeves.  I had worked with Dr. Azam Anwar in Cardiology in the remote past and recalled that he had worked on a product for eczema.  I found a bottle at a local pharmacy and figured it might be better than the antibacterial soap cleanser I had been using.  Much to my surprise and delight, the sores were closed in 7 days.  There is only a slight purplish discoloration where each sore had been.  I have been sharing the news with my doctors and friends.  I could not be more pleased!  I recommend CLn Body Wash to be used as directed to anyone who has a stubborn rash who has been working with their doctors.  It&#x27;s over-the-counter, safe and effective! I cannot thank TopMD enough!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference between usimg this or using a gentle bar of soap. Did not improve skin at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter. I have been using it to bathe my 10 month old daughter since she was 5 month old. The purpose of using it is to alleviate her eczema. After several months of use, her eczema seemed improved by  40% to 50%.  Her eczema still keeps coming back. This product seems to help alleviate the condition but can&#x27;t treat my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  We have been using this product in combination of steroid cream to treat my daughter&#x27;s eczema. Nevertheless, I still think it&#x27;s worth the money on the cln body wash given it helps reducing the dosage and frequency of using the prescription cream.</li>
    <li> I have regular acne outbreaks on my neck and back. This product has eliminated that problem in just a month.  I use the product when i feel something starting under the skin and it never breaks the surface.  Within a day my issue is gone.  I have shared this product with friends with finger cuts, eczema, and acne.  I have even used it on my dog when she was scratching.  We all are big fans. If I see a bump, I hit it with the CLn.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months back at the suggestion of my son&#x27;s pediatrician.  I can&#x27;t rate it on how it works because the dispenser simply never worked.  I watched videos and searched for reviews, not finding any others with the same issue.  Just bad luck I guess.  By the time I gave up, the return date had passed.  I tried everything but nothing comes out of the dispenser pump.  All that&#x27;s left to do is drill a hole in the bottle, but it&#x27;s squeeze proof so that still may not yield any product.  Thanks Amazon.  That&#x27;s $30+ down the drain.</li>
    <li> Wowza! It&#x27;s a very small bottle for the price. Bleach baths are wayyyyy cheaper. I used the bottle in a out a week and a half and just have two small spots of ezcema. I was hoping to get away from bleach baths and just use this but $28 is too expensive for me&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it did  any miracles either. Just not impressed.</li>
    <li> My 2.5 yo has severe eczema on her hands, wrists and elbows. She would itch until the point of breaking skin until it bled. After three uses she is about 95% eczema and itch free. I have not used an OTC or rx item with this quick of a result.</li>
    <li> I have tried every kind of lotion/exfoliation combo for the cystic bumps on the backs of my arms. While benign and maybe not even noticeable to some, I always wondered how to get rid of these bumps and make my arms clear up.&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended this product to me and it works great! It is easy to use and I could see results in 2-3 days. I use regular hand lotion the next day and I am so happy with the results.It is not a cure, but I am excited to be able to pull this out when I have a flare up which tends to occur before I go out in a sleeveless dress.  (of course)&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  My son has severe eczema and it has definitely helped to improve his skin.  It is much easier than taking a bleach bath. Especially for a 13 year old who&#x27;s &amp;#34;too old&amp;#34; to take a bath. I learned about CLn through the Eczema Foundation website.  It is pricey but after all of these years trying every product on the market it is well worth the price</li>
    <li> Actually I love the product - I ordered this 2nd one to have when the first one ran out.  However, when I went to use this new one about a week ago it pumped out soap once or twice and then wouldn&#x27;t pump at all.  You can&#x27;t just spread this soap on your skin - it only suds up and works when it aerated through the pump.  So - the soap is great and I have to order another one and hope it works because I can&#x27;t use this one at all.</li>
    <li> I started using this product for my 2 year old son about 8 months ago. It has been a LIFE SAVER for us. My son had severe eczema ( which has now been reduced to moderate eczema ) This product seriously has had a huge impact on my son&#x27;s condition. He is now sleeping through the night ( before he was always up at night scratching ) Basically the product helps his skin to get rid of the common skin infections people with eczema or atopic dermatitis experience.  (like staph) Once the infection is gone, his skin can heal better.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I use this product, with occasional steroid use, and aquaphor to help maintain my sons skin. GIVE this product a chance. I did it and it as long as you use it every day and leave it on for about 2 mns, you will start to see results!!! This company has such a great product and there are so many kids these days with eczema, i feel like they need to start giving out free trials!- because anyone who has eczema or a kid with eczema KNOWS the frustration of trying out a million different products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TAKE MY ADVICE! TRY IT! YOU WONT BE SORRY!!!!! Also just an FYI if you buy 3 or more bottles from their website you get it cheaper than on amazon, and free shipping too. Thats where i buy it for my son!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> works great for my husband who has severe eczema</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommend this for my butt acne. But, I found that a charcoal sugar scrub worked much better.</li>
    <li> This product has made a big difference in my daughter&#x27;s skin care.  She is almost 13  years old and has severe eczema and skin infections.  She picks CLn over a bleach bath any day, and our dermatologist is very happy about that.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to clear up my son&#x27;s eczema and bumps on the back of his legs, and folliculitis on his back. This stuff is amazing! After two weeks, there is a noticeable difference in the appearance of his skin.</li>
    <li> Product is great for keeping my Folliculitis from flaring up real bad. I have to start using it as soon as I notice it. However, it is not real powerful at reducing flare ups. I still have to do bleach treatments now and then.</li>
    <li> We are so thankful for this wash!  My husband does works in attics and ended up with a staph infection.  We have been using this product and the rest of the family has had no issue and his infection healed a lot faster than the doctors expected.</li>
    <li> Our son has eczema which leads to impetigo ... our only weapons were sun and pool everyday to lower bacteria levels and boost his immune system. This lotion achieves the same result and our son has had no bouts with skin bacteria infections in months !!! Get this and the face wash ...</li>
    <li> Cln body wash is very good for eczema.</li>
