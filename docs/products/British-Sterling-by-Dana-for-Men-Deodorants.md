### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>PERFECT!</li>
      <li>This deodorant smells and works great.  </li>
      <li>but it does a great job.</li>
      <li>Seller was very nice about return.</li>
      <li>It is good that it can be coordinated with soaps, aftershave, cologne, and deodorant.</li>
      <li>Smells really good.  </li>
      <li>So glad I have found a place to get it online!</li>
      <li>This is a very light scent.</li>
      <li>It works ok as a deodorant</li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did I just like it</li>
      <li>Just ok though.  </li>
      <li>Product is ok.  </li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem as potent, as strong as the original.  </li>
      <li>If a number of items are shown as being available for purchase and they take your money, then no problem if they deliver.</li>
      <li>In any case, I don&#x27;t have much of a choice, since I have not been able to find another deodorant that does not give me a rash.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t discolor the white t shirts.</li>
      <li>It does a pretty good job of keeping you dry.</li>
      <li>Many deodorants irritate my skin, but British Sterling does not.  </li>
      <li>showed more then enough products to meet my order and then some.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product by a friend who swears by it and refuses to use anything else.</li>
      <li>My guess is that it wears off quickly, although my relatives and co-workers have not complained about any armpit odor (though perhaps they&#x27;re just being polite).  </li>
      <li>British sterling is not available at regular wallgreen and other stores that carry every brand made in the us and elsewhere only available online which is a pitty found it on line at a good price with free shipping which saves a lot of money since many times shipping is more than the product... another pitty</li>
      <li>Give it a try, you make like it as much as we do.</li>
      <li>The new scent is somewhat different, though not bad.  </li>
      <li>It keeps you dry all day long and it has a nice smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I expected to get the original British Sterling in the original &amp;#34;blue tube&amp;#34; but received this colored tube which has a different scent from the original British Sterling.  </li>
      <li>With the new formula, at the end of the day my arm pits stink.  </li>
      <li>I proceeded with a direct withdraw from my checking account and was told my order would be shipped with in 5 days.</li>
      <li>They never did with the old</li>
      <li>The fragrance smells nice, but it&#x27;s very weak.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps its nearly the same after the alcohols evaporate, but it seems slightly different.  </li>

    <li> Many deodorants irritate my skin, but British Sterling does not.  The fragrance smells nice, but it&#x27;s very weak.  My guess is that it wears off quickly, although my relatives and co-workers have not complained about any armpit odor (though perhaps they&#x27;re just being polite).  In any case, I don&#x27;t have much of a choice, since I have not been able to find another deodorant that does not give me a rash.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells and works great.  My husband is a big fan.</li>
    <li> Product is ok.  Just ok though.  I may be wrong but this deodorant \\&quot;....By Dana\\&quot; could be a different formula than the one I remember by British Sterling.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem as potent, as strong as the original.  Could be my imagination though.      If anyone knows the British Sterling story please let us know.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product by a friend who swears by it and refuses to use anything else. I have no complaints myself. Give it a try, you make like it as much as we do.</li>
    <li> This is a deodorant and not an anti perspirant but it does a great job. It is healthier than the anti-perspirants. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t discolor the white t shirts. I&#x27;ve used it for a long time!</li>
    <li> GOD BLESS YOU! PERFECT! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> This is a very light scent. It does a pretty good job of keeping you dry. But you need the spray and after shave to make it work fully</li>
    <li> British sterling is not available at regular wallgreen and other stores that carry every brand made in the us and elsewhere only available online which is a pitty found it on line at a good price with free shipping which saves a lot of money since many times shipping is more than the product... another pitty</li>
    <li> I always like British Sterling and had a hard time locating it but I&#x27;m glad I did I just like it</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s preferred scent for deodorant and Aftershave.  He has been using it since the 1980s but now it&#x27;s impossible to find locally.  So glad I have found a place to get it online!</li>
    <li> According to the label, the perfume essence is made in the US and the product assembled in China. I love this scent.</li>
    <li> I like British Sterling It keeps you dry all day long and it has a nice smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to all men.</li>
    <li> Like I wrote before and will write again if you keep contacting me, very poor system!!When I tried to order the account showed more then enough products to meet my order and then some. I proceeded with a direct withdraw from my checking account and was told my order would be shipped with in 5 days. The money was taken from my checking account and all I was doing was waiting to receive my items. Well after 5 days I was notified that they where out of my item and my checking account would be reimbursed. All my money came back but I was almost a week without my items. If a number of items are shown as being available for purchase and they take your money, then no problem if they deliver. BUT when they advertise that they have the items and take your money, but do not have it, that causes a big waste of time and makes you wonder just how creditable the businesses really are.</li>
    <li> I expected to get the original British Sterling in the original &amp;#34;blue tube&amp;#34; but received this colored tube which has a different scent from the original British Sterling.  It works ok as a deodorant but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> The formulation has changed.  I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for the at least a decade.  It used to come in the blue plastic shown (at the time I posted this), but my last order came in gray plastic.  The new scent is somewhat different, though not bad.  I&#x27;m attributing it to the alcohols used, or something other than the fragrance.  Perhaps its nearly the same after the alcohols evaporate, but it seems slightly different.  The big difference is this...  While this is not an antiperspirant, I never had a problem with body odor.  With the new formula, at the end of the day my arm pits stink.  They never did with the old formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 15 sticks.  I guess I&#x27;ll try this until I run out and then I may have to switch deodorants.  I hope they get enough negative feedback that they go back to the old formula.  I just have to figure out who to plead to.  I used to get a lot of complements on how I smelled, and I don&#x27;t want to give that up.</li>
    <li> Smells really good.  Husband has used British Sterling off and on for years.  It is good that it can be coordinated with soaps, aftershave, cologne, and deodorant.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula. No longer smells like British Sterling.  Seller was very nice about return.</li>
    <li> Sent silver not blue and it smells different</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how often I get asked, &amp;#34;What are you wearing?&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m wearing this DEODORANT. Just keep the lid screwed TIGHT as it will dry up.</li>
