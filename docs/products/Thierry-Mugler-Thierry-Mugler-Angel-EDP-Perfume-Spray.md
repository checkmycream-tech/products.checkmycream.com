      <li>My husband found it on Amazon, for a much better price, so I now get my perfume more frequently.    </li>

      <li>My favorite fragrance, that is classy and timeless!  </li>
      <li>But, I think she used to put it on after going to the gym on her way to work, so that may be why it wasn&#x27;t so fresh.</li>
      <li>It arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>this was was fast, easy and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>They are both beautiful and delicate fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recently discovered &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; at Macy&#x27;s and immediately fell in love with the scent.</li>

      <li>I have been using Angel since it first came on the market.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great perfume..love it..I get so many complements on it and everyone even knows the scent...</li>
    <li> OK...well, since I happen to love this fragrance, maybe I&#x27;m biased.  But, given as a gift, it makes he happy...and her wearing it, makes me happy!  Win/Win situtation everytime, and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg!!  Will buy again when necessary!!!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely, without a doubt, the most sensual and delicious perfume I have ever enjoyed on my woman. She introduced me to it and I can&#x27;t get enough of it now...</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the story... A woman I worked with used to work with used to wear this. I though it was too masculine (and, this is coming from a tomboy who used to wear Cool Water for men, so that&#x27;s sayin&#x27; somethin&#x27;) But, I think she used to put it on after going to the gym on her way to work, so that may be why it wasn&#x27;t so fresh. Anywho, since my beloved True Star by Hilfiger has been discontinued and I&#x27;m giving up Chanel no. 5 because of Mme. Chanel&#x27;s association with Nazis, I&#x27;ve been looking for a new scent. In doing so, I&#x27;ve made several trips to Sephora. This past weekend, there was something that kept seducing my nose, but the only bottle I noticed in the vicinity of the scent was...Angel. \\&quot;Something over here smells WONDERFUL!...Ugh! I know THAT&#x27;s not it\\&quot;, I&#x27;d say regarding Angel. I later Googled Angel&#x27;s notes. Chocolate, vanilla, caramel... Hey, maybe Angel *is* what&#x27;s blessing my nose cos the seductive scent definitely had a delicious quality to it.    A couple of days later, I&#x27;d received a magazine in the mail with a few perfume samples; one of which is Angel eau de parfum. I tried a couple of the sample scents on. Meh. Then I decided to give the Angel sample a whiff. Mmmm! Decided to wear it to work today just to see... Now, I don&#x27;t think the name, Angel, fits. The smell is not angelic by any stretch. But, it is yummy. I&#x27;m getting the chocolate and caramel. But, then I&#x27;ll get another whiff of it and get the floral notes. What the heck kinda weird concoction of a scent is this!? It&#x27;s definitely warm and cozy. Something I&#x27;ll wear during Winter.    The scent that I&#x27;d dismissed for so long has grown on me! I&#x27;m not ready to invest in a large bottle, so I may start with the rollerball. I&#x27;ve seen others say that this is a scent that one either loves or hates. I was definitely put off before, but I&#x27;m ready to give it a try now.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume I have found... I use it every day.  You can spray as little or as much as you want, by pressing the sprayer gently or harder.  The star-shaped container is not refillable, but it is very pretty.</li>
    <li> My favorite over all others in my possession. Whenever I wear it(which is most of the time) someone will ask what I&#x27;m wearing or recognize the fragance. The lotions and creams are also wonderful.</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I dont buy much perfume.  Most of them I dont really like.  But this one is great.  I received a free sample from Sephora and loved it.</li>
    <li> I have bought this perfume at the mall many times and this bottle is just as great, and a much better price.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years, but it is very expensive, so I usually get a bottle for a Christmas Present.    My husband found it on Amazon, for a much better price, so I now get my perfume more frequently.    It is the kind of perfume that you never smell on yourself, and every time I have it on someone comments about how wonderful the perfume smells, and how fresh and light it is.    Sherry</li>
    <li> I love it, and the price was perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance it smells really good.happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using Angel since it first came on the market.  My husband uses Angel for men. They are both beautiful and delicate fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  MARGERY</li>
    <li> It is my favorite and enjoyed the price as well as the ease of getting it.  I have been shopping on line for it for sometime and this was the best price.</li>
    <li> Great price  and fast shipping. Thank you</li>
    <li> My wife asked for this after smelling it on someone else. It&#x27;s now her scent; for several years I could only get it online.</li>
    <li> It is smaller then it look on line...I thought it was a spray jst smaller,I will not recamend to buy..!</li>
    <li> I have actually returned this perfume because it did not smell like other bottles of Angel I have purchased.  It was sent to me in a timely fashion, and appears to be the product I purchased, but it does not smell the same at all.  The bottle looks the same, but it definitely isn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> I samples Angel over the years in various stores.  The fragrance stayed forever.  I finally decided to buy it here.  I bought the same Eau De Parfum as I have sampled in stores but this one does not stay at all.  There is something different in the potency.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it should be authentic via Amazon but perhaps it is not.  I have wasted my money and am not happy.  It does not have the same potency.</li>
    <li> The smell is really bad. I have been wearing Angel for over five years and this is the worst smell ever. I wish I could return it!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this fragrance recently and have searched every website I could think of for the best price. Amazon has the best selection, so I was able to select a small bottle with a price I could afford. Very happy with this purchase! it smells MUCH better than the samples in Macy*s.</li>
    <li> This fragrance was a gift for my dear friend who covets this fragrance. He mixes it with another and smells divine. Although this is typically a woman&#x27;s cologne, he indicates he has other male friends who also use it. If he likes it, I love it.</li>
    <li> Totally fake. Should have known better. Do not order if you want the real thing. the code was also cut out of the box.</li>
    <li> Loved Thierry Mugler Angel perfume. Don&#x27;t care for the bottle though.  Been using it for years. Purchase it for my mother for Christmas.  It arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It is not overpowering and last a long time.  I have been using this fragrance for a long time.</li>
    <li> I received this fragrance for my birthday a few years ago and just loved it. Everyone else does too. Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I had read others reviews about this perfume smelling like poison or it being too strong for use.  In my case it smells wonderful and I love it.  The initial spray does have a distinct smell...almost like raw honey.  It soon changes into something warm and exotic.  I have not found it to be overpowering and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> On behalf of my family member that uses this stuff, there is no other scent that she would rather use.</li>
    <li> I get a lot a lot of compliments on this</li>
    <li> loves this, my favorite fragrance to wear  I always receive compliments, not too over powering</li>
    <li> This perfume is great smelling and last for so long! Even after showering the fragrance was still very! The price you pay at the mall was much more than here at Amozon!!!</li>
    <li> Had a chance to try Angel 5 times. I just cannot understand... From the notes, this should be my signature perfume. But on the test strip and my skin, it smells like a nauseating \\&quot;Off\\&quot; insect repellant. I try and I try but I can&#x27;t smell ANY of the notes listed, except after 2-3 hours of torturous stink, I end up with a heavy, musky vanilla/patchouli mess.     God I wish this worked for me. I&#x27;m shocked but pleased to see it&#x27;s working for so many people however.     All I can recommend is that you don&#x27;t buy this blind, based on the listed notes. I almost did. SO happy I didn&#x27;t.    I think the name of this perfume is quite misleading. Such an earthy smell (patchouli) cannot belong to the heavens, can it?</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife...  it&#x27;s her favorite, and I dig it too.</li>
    <li> Gave this one as a gift to a friend who coveted my perfume. Have worn it for over 10 years. No other scent like it!&lt;br /&gt;Many compliments!</li>
    <li> Not sure yet on this one.</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling perfume, it is a small bottle and would suggest you consider a larger size for value and some are refillable. Much better value than retail stores.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this many times from here and have always been happy.  Until I  the took off wrapping and opened the box top looking for the code that is inside the box top.  It was removed.  Those of you who purchase Angel know of the code.  You go to Thierry Mugler web site for his fragrances and enter the code.  Yes, I&#x27;m very unhappy the code was torn off.  I WANT MY CODE!!!!!!!!!!  I love this perfume and will go back to the Thierry Mugler web site unless I get my code.</li>
    <li> Great Product.. super quick shipping.. amazing seller!</li>
    <li> This perfume is not the original.  I waste my money  purchased it. Next time I prefer to buy at Macys</li>
    <li> I was notified 8 days later that the product shipped from the day I purchased it.  The actual box looked like it had been re-used, with tape all over it.  A child&#x27;s Nintendo DS game was stuck in the box as well.  My wife said it does not even smell like Angel perfume and that the seller probably reused the bottle.  Never using this scammer again.</li>
    <li> A friend let me have the very last bit of her Angel perfume and 10 years later it is still my favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;A few of my friends now wear Angel. we always leave a little in the bottle to pass on to others.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this perfume at a local dept. store and loved it. I bought this on amazon for a much lower price than the store. It is now my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for over 20 years. I have the entire collection. It&#x27;s the only one I wear... I always get great complements....&lt;br /&gt;It has hints of vanilla, and chocolate...very pleasant smelling, and it&#x27;s very sexy!!</li>
    <li> Truly feminine and sexy!  My favorite fragrance, that is classy and timeless!  The beautiful star bottle is an added touch of elegance!</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering just the .8oz bottle of perfume for $38.  Instead I received a set with full size lotion, small body wash and .8oz bottle of perfume. Perfume is true to it&#x27;s divine scent. Excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> i had been looking for Angel by Thierry Mugler for years.</li>
    <li> Something seems off. It has an odd lingering smell, and does not seem the same as what my husbands aunt wears. I got a scent sample card from the department store, and the product I was sent is not the same. Refillable bottles either leave room for deception, or it is old. The code on the card worked at the website for Thierry Mugler, but I was sent a gift set and I ordered a bottle. Makes me think it is old stock. Not sure though.</li>
    <li> Great price. Saved a ton vs. purchasing it at a retailer store.</li>
    <li> Love the scent but it doesn&#x27;t last considering the price of purchase. I also got the body lotion. Same issue</li>
    <li> This was a gift and was well received.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this on Amazon for such a great price and ordered it right away.  I received my order very quickly, opened the bottle and sprayed.  I didn&#x27;t understand - the packaging was right, the bottle was right, but there is definitely something off with the smell.  It smells \\&quot;kinda like\\&quot; Angel, but is not the Angel I know and love.  Unlike the other reviewer on here that sent her bottle back, I am keeping mine because it can be my \\&quot;like but not\\&quot; Angel.  I will go to the department store for the smell I know and love.  Such a shame.  I would be interested to know if the reviewers that gave this 5 stars have smelled the &#x27;real&#x27; Angel perfume.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife. She absolutely loves this perfume. She normally only puts on one or two sprays in the morning and last all day. Has a nice pleasant scent that is not overpowering which is great for me!</li>
    <li> This has been my signature fragrance since shortly after it came out.  Ordering it this was was fast, easy and reasonably priced.  It was shipped beautifully, as well.</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent - love it!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite. Exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> This is Fabulous, Wonderful and will make the Women in your life &amp;#34;Bow on bended knee to you!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I love this perfume.  It smells like Chocolate in a Springtime scented field...Every women that I&#x27;ve ever&lt;br /&gt;shared this with &amp;#34;Loved it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using Angel parfume several years now and love it, perfect winter smell.</li>
    <li> Indiscutível fragrância.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, it fits when I dress up at night, or during the day....the item arrived on time, and it was less expensive than in stores. I always have to have Angel, whatever other perfumes I use, this one is the best</li>
    <li> I recently discovered &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; at Macy&#x27;s and immediately fell in love with the scent. It&#x27;s wonderful for the summer. I love the unique design of the dispenser.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase! My signature scent! Love it!!</li>

    <li> This Eau De Parfum Spray was the same you get from Dillards. Love It!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again. Very Very pleased</li>
    <li> This smells so amazing. It&#x27;s just... I have no words. It&#x27;s sweet without being cloying, strong without being overpowering, and someone always says, &amp;#34;Wow, you smell good!&amp;#34; when I wear it.</li>
