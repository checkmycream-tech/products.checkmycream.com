<li> was missing a jewel but cannot tell when they&#x27;re on</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get it the stones didn&#x27;t even match color of the ear rings were different poorly made</li>
<li> And they turn my ear green.</li>
<li> They are so mismatched, I am really not sure I will ever wear them.</li>
<li> Very small.</li>
<li> they were broken when i got them</li>
<li> The bottom stones are arranged haphazardly &amp; not very attractively.</li>
<li> Ugly and came with no backs to them</li>

    <li> Very small. Cute for young girl.</li>
    <li> The earrings are light on my ears.</li>
    <li> was missing a jewel but cannot tell when they&#x27;re on</li>
    <li> Bigger then I thought. And they turn my ear green. Nit that always happens</li>
    <li> They are exactly like they are shown. I love them because they are very unique and intricate. They are my favorite pair if earrings!!!</li>
    <li> Ugly and came with no backs to them</li>
    <li> cheap looking and crummie quality</li>
    <li> Mine came in earlier and are very cute. The backings were a bit bent but it&#x27;s an easy fix. Overall happy 😍</li>
    <li> Very cute however they make your ear turn green right away</li>
    <li> Very upset about this purchase!!! It took 1month to revive and they were broke!!!</li>
    <li> All good. Excelent product</li>
    <li> they were broken when i got them</li>
    <li> Loved them but look different</li>
    <li> They seem cheaply made, BUT I love them and wear them every day! Five stars!</li>
    <li> they are big! but cute!</li>
    <li> Only wore them once bs they broke</li>
    <li> i brought these for my daughter and she weras them honestly and truly</li>
    <li> They came in two different colors..one has pink stones..tho other has red ones...  But the seller was very sweet and accommodating and i luv them.. I&#x27;ve gotten sooo many compliments on them..thanks</li>
    <li> The item does not exactly match the picture in ad. The bottom stones are arranged haphazardly &amp; not very attractively. They are so mismatched, I am really not sure I will ever wear them. If you don&#x27;t mind wearing jewelry that is put together in a tacky manner, go ahead.</li>
    <li> I honestly love these earrings. They&#x27;re everything I like. Crowns, gold, pearl, and jems. The only problem was one of the pearls came out the second time I wore them. Fixing them with a little glue never hurt If you know how to fix them correctly. But the quality of the product is overall cheap. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Save your money !!! Don&#x27;t get it the stones didn&#x27;t even match color of the ear rings were different poorly made</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give this product one star. Not only because it looks different from the pictures,  but also because I feel it&#x27;s dishonest to mislead someone about detail.&lt;br /&gt;I mean yes, it&#x27;s only under 3 bucks. But it includes colors and a cheap look that the picture definitely does not portray!&lt;br /&gt;It also took over a month to arrive! I don&#x27;t recommend these at all!!!</li>
    <li> Love them got a lot of compliments!!!!</li>
    <li> They are so cute. They are bomb.com 😍😍</li>
