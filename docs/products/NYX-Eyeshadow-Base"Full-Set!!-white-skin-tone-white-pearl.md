      <li>This is my second time buying this set of NYX eyeshadow bases, and I absolutely love them.</li>
      <li>Which comes off pretty easily without a proper base.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>

      <li>The beige works as well but, havent used it much.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointing.</li>
      <li>The skin tone has a golden undertone to it, so it really goes well with neutrals, and the white makes the colors pop.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without</li>
      <li>Excellent product, the eyeshadow base is creamy and really makes the eyeshadows pop</li>
      <li>i usually use this every day and I love it it stays on</li>
      <li>I use these bases just to hide bags and hide the dark circles and give very fresh look</li>
      <li>A little of this over top of my eyeshadow primer really makes my loose shadows pop!</li>
      <li>Totally not the sellers fault, but the product doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype of keeping my shadow on.</li>
      <li>I still get creases and it&#x27;s nothing like another eyeshadow base I used to use from another company that worked much better, but cost a lot more</li>
      <li>I mostly enjoy using the plain white.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it certainly does help your shadows to be bolder and helps with a smoother application.</li>

<li> Last a long time.</li>
<li> The white is also a good base for highlighting.</li>
<li> The only issue I have is the white pearl color tends to be a little gritty, as though it has glitter in it, and with all of them you gotta make sure you get a good helping of the base, so putting it on sheer doesn&#x27;t really help if you want its base color to help with the color of the eyeshadow.</li>
<li> Forms a good base for eye shadow.</li>
<li> The product was received when expected.  </li>
<li> Money well spent.</li>
<li> plain white, not pearl.</li>
<li> Other than that, timely delivery.</li>
<li> but you can&#x27;t find a base that works any better.</li>
<li> But also, with the white base, you can use less eyeshadow because it just brings out the true color in the shadow that you&#x27;ve been looking for. A+++</li>
<li> When using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed that it wears down in the crease, by the end of the day.</li>
<li> Maybe I just need to let it sit a little longer.</li>
<li> These bases are truly what I expected, they make my eyeshadow stay in longer and make the color PPP!!!</li>
<li> Sometimes, when I just have a few minutes to do my make up</li>
<li> You can find eyeshadow base that is more expensive</li>
<li> That is the color that I least wanted out of the three.&lt;br</li>
<li> I also use it under my eyes as a base for my powder coverup and that lasts much longer.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve worn my eyeshadow under water with the white one as a base, and my eyeshadow didnt fall off at all.</li>
<li> Well, I&#x27;m sorry...</li>
<li> Oh well, I&#x27;ll continue to use it, the product is just a bit disappointing.</li>
<li> very faint.</li>
<li> Anywhere I put this base</li>

    <li> This is my second time buying this set of NYX eyeshadow bases, and I absolutely love them. They make the eyeshadow stay on very well even if you accidentally scratch ur eyelids or something. I&#x27;ve worn my eyeshadow under water with the white one as a base, and my eyeshadow didnt fall off at all. It&#x27;s basically waterproof. But also, with the white base, you can use less eyeshadow because it just brings out the true color in the shadow that you&#x27;ve been looking for. A+++</li>
    <li> BUY IT...NOTHING ELSE TO SAY LOL ITS BOMB.COM.  NO CREASING, USE WITH PRIMER AND EYE MAKEUP LASTS FOREVER AND A DAY</li>
    <li> This set is great! It does what it says it should do!</li>
    <li> as advertised super fast shipping</li>
    <li> stays on, even works great with cream eyeshadow!-sarah</li>
    <li> I love it, and I still have them its been about 2yeas now</li>
    <li> I use this daily and the white is good for vibrant colors. The nude or skin tone is great for neutral colors. Sometimes I just wear it alone and it does great also. I put under my eyebrows as well for an added effect. Works great on all skin tones</li>
    <li> You can find eyeshadow base that is more expensive but you can&#x27;t find a base that works any better. When I am in a hurry I use the the flesh tone as coverup too. It happens to match my skin perfectly. I also use it under my eyes as a base for my powder coverup and that lasts much longer. Anywhere I put this base I can plan on my makeup lasting 10 hours. The white is also a good base for highlighting. I mix the white pearl with the skin tone before I put my eyeshadow on and having different bases emphasizes the color of my shadow. I am very happy with this purchase and willbuy more when it looks like I am getting low. No makeup kit should be without it.</li>
    <li> I ordered a set of three colors, but ended up with three of the same:  beige.  That is the color that I least wanted out of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return this, but the seller doesn&#x27;t accept returns.  The only good thing I can say is that Amazon gave me a full refund.  But I definitely recommend buying this product at a beauty store.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I&#x27;ve used NYX since 2012 and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. I end up buying everything from this brand. Primers, eye shadows, bronzers, powders, gloss... Very very good quality and not so expensive. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love NYX. A little of this over top of my eyeshadow primer really makes my loose shadows pop! Money well spent.</li>
    <li> Totally not the sellers fault, but the product doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype of keeping my shadow on. I still get creases and it&#x27;s nothing like another eyeshadow base I used to use from another company that worked much better, but cost a lot more that&#x27;s why I thought I would try this one instead. Oh well, I&#x27;ll continue to use it, the product is just a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good base for the eye shadow and the set is also good for the price. I haven&#x27;t tried the glittery one but the other 2 are great.</li>
    <li> I was excited about finding an eyeshadow primer for &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  Well, I&#x27;m sorry... but that&#x27;s what it is.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, when I put it on, it looks great!  After about 3 hours, give or take, I&#x27;ve got creases all over and end up just wiping off ALL of my eyeshadow.  Which comes off pretty easily without a proper base.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with this, spend the money and buy a good primer that lasts.</li>
    <li> Purchased this set for my pro makeup kit. Instead of 3 different colors, it came in 3 Milks. Very dissapointing. Other than that, timely delivery.</li>
    <li> I tried all of these and the best one I would say is the white one. plain white, not pearl. The pearl one actually provides no primer for me. It just seems like a light sparkly cream and provides no coverage or primer..... very faint. The beige works as well but, havent used it much. I mostly enjoy using the plain white. It just highlights my eyes and definitely lets eyeshadow colors show.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for a family of girls! With these and some help from my girls, I now know what I&#x27;m doing :)</li>
    <li> These primers are totally worth the buy! Goes on smooth and makes all types of eyeshadow stick and last all day and night! The white one makes all colors pop and especially neon colors!! Great for any makeup artist!!</li>
    <li> I love this product it is so creamy and it goes on smooth i usually use this every day and I love it it stays on and I do recommending getting this! I ordered it on the 20 and it was supposed to come the 27th but it came the 23rd witch I&#x27;m supper happy about! I love it buy it worth you&#x27;re money!</li>
    <li> The whole set is great! The skin tone has a golden undertone to it, so it really goes well with neutrals, and the white makes the colors pop. The only issue I have is the white pearl color tends to be a little gritty, as though it has glitter in it, and with all of them you gotta make sure you get a good helping of the base, so putting it on sheer doesn&#x27;t really help if you want its base color to help with the color of the eyeshadow.

Other than that, it certainly does help your shadows to be bolder and helps with a smoother application.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best stuff I have ever tried. I use it under eye shadow and 17hrs later it is still looks just like I just applied my shadow. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily and evenly with a brush or fingertip. Forms a good base for eye shadow. Cleans off easily. Last a long time.</li>
    <li> nicely packaged, it came in perfect state, they are creamy and slides like butter. perfect</li>
