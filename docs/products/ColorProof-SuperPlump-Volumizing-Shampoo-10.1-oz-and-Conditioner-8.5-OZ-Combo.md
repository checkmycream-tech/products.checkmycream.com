      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I also ordered it for my Grandaughter who has tree nut allergies as this was safe for her.  </li>
      <li>I love the shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this line for over a year now and still love it.  </li>
      <li>Wish it smelled a bit better but love how it works.</li>
      <li>the shampoo makes a very rich lather.</li>
      <li>I feel like you need to use more conditioner as it doesn&#x27;t spread easily.</li>
      <li>My hair feels wonderful and is never weighed down.  </li>

      <li>Product is good but bought these twice for my wife and both times the caps were broken in shpiping.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and I color treat it several times a year which can cause dry brittle hair.</li>
      <li>You only need a drop or two - really.  </li>
      <li>The product stretches a long way, and at first I noticed softer, shinier hair, but after about a month, the luster is fading again.  </li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t really bothered using color protection products since the color didn&#x27;t need to last for months.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner can be a bit heavy; use a minimal amount on ends only if you have very fine hair like me!</li>
      <li>very good quality products; my hair is thin and i am not sure that volume was added as hoped.</li>
      <li>It makes my fine limp hair actually manageable.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel soft  and volumized at the same time.</li>

    <li> This is great for volume but leaves hair a bit dry.</li>
    <li> Product is good but bought these twice for my wife and both times the caps were broken in shpiping.</li>
    <li> I love the entire ColorProof line of products., well except for the anti-humidity hair spray which was worse than no spray at all.  I get my hair colored every 4 weeks (I hate grey roots) so I haven&#x27;t really bothered using color protection products since the color didn&#x27;t need to last for months.  I had tried some color protection shampoos in the past and found that they left my hair limp, lifeless and often greasy.  Then my salon started using these products and my stylist convinced me to try them.  I alternate between the SuperPlump Volumizing products and the Anti-Frizz line.  I have to admit that my skepticism has been replaced by belief.  The volumizing products give my hair body and bounce.  I do find that after two or three uses, my hair becomes fly-away which is why I alternate between the volumizing and anti-frizz shampoo and conditioners.  This provides the perfect balance between providing volume and controlling fly-away and frizz.  Lots of times, I will try some products for a few months and then start looking for something better.  I&#x27;ve been using this line for over a year now and still love it.  I have coarse, curly hair and these products work for me.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite shampoo and conditioner! Pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment and product met expectations</li>
    <li> I find this shampoo helpful for my very fine, straight hair, in the hot and humid environment of Nashville.</li>
    <li> My sister loves this stuff, so I bought it...all it does is dry out my hair.  The hair spray is useless as well as the other products.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my wife wanted. Cheaper than the salon price.</li>
    <li> Just as promised.  Thanks!  Love this stuff.  My hairdresser says that my hair has been looking so much better since I started using this!</li>
    <li> I have use several products for my hair nothing has compared to ColorProof SuperPlump Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner. My hair is fine and I color treat it several times a year which can cause dry brittle hair. But mine is health bouncy and shining using these product .</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. Will buy from seller again, thanks!</li>
    <li> Cleans hair well but I don&#x27;t notice and volume difference and doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
    <li> Wish it smelled a bit better but love how it works. Only a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a pricey shampoo.  I am a hairdresser.  It was recommended.  I bought it. ITS MY FAVORITE! PERFECT FOR FINE HAIR TOO!  Secret of this shampoo is this : don&#x27;t use much! If your hair does not lather, DO NOT USE MORE SHAMPOO, JUST ADD MORE WATER TO YOUR HAIR!  THIS ONE BOTTLE LASTED ME over a YEAR!  I can not find it in any salons other than one. It&#x27;s cheaper here.  ( I am retired)  I also ordered it for my Grandaughter who has tree nut allergies as this was safe for her.  I will not buy any other shampoo and that&#x27;s nice to know!  My hair feels wonderful and is never weighed down.  You will LOVE it!  It will NEVER STRIP Color!</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo. I feel like you need to use more conditioner as it doesn&#x27;t spread easily. I wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair feel soft  and volumized at the same time. I also love the fact that a dime sized amount does the job!</li>
    <li> very good quality products; my hair is thin and i am not sure that volume was added as hoped.</li>
    <li> I like this.... the shampoo makes a very rich lather. The conditioner can be a bit heavy; use a minimal amount on ends only if you have very fine hair like me! Smells delicious! Some shampoos make my forehead break out, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  It makes my fine limp hair actually manageable.  Great on my color as well.</li>
    <li> My product arrived on time and is the expected quality.</li>
    <li> The product stretches a long way, and at first I noticed softer, shinier hair, but after about a month, the luster is fading again.  I&#x27;m off to the next non-animal tested duo!</li>
    <li> Always love this set for volume &amp; keeping my color vibrant longer!  Great price for the set too!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It lasts forever.  You only need a drop or two - really.  If you can train yourself to use just a drop of two, it will last a really long time.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this conditioner! It has a nice coconutty smell and made my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had. Not only does it smell great (one smells like cake, the other a little like lemon pound cake), but my hair seems to really like it too.</li>
