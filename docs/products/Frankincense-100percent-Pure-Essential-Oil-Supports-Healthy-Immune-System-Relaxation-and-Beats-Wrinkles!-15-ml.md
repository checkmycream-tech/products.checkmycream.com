      <li>Really love this oil.</li>
      <li>If you do any research, you&#x27;ll find that frankincense has many healing qualities.</li>
      <li>This was purchased as a test because I am the most &#x27;speckled&#x27; person you will ever meet.</li>
      <li>For me that&#x27;s ok, my skin can take it.  </li>
      <li>we love this frankincense we have used another company that cost alot more!!!!!!But</li>
      <li>We are SO glad we did.  </li>
      <li>The clean, fresh, woodsy scent of this frankincense is outstanding!</li>
      <li>Seems to help fine lines to a minimum.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say deSensua smells much better in that it is more earthy and warm compared to the other brand.  </li>
      <li>I do not like scents that are overwhelming or too powerful, and while this is a strong oil, it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm my senses.</li>
      <li>I have started to see a huge improvement in my skin.  </li>
      <li>A tad different than the young living version she was accustomed to,  but still excellent quality and even better value</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>An easy 5 stars,  the oil is pure and top quality.</li>
      <li>(only put on your skin what you;d be able to eat :)</li>
      <li>I have no negative recollection about this oil, but I have been using another brand which I love.</li>
      <li>Not bad but not my personal favorite.</li>
      <li>and I will certainly purchase again!</li>
      <li>I am planning to use it for as many things possible.</li>
      <li>The huge skin tag fell off in two weeks, my wrinkles are a little better and my fibrofolliculomas from BHD are not as pronounced.</li>
      <li>It feels incredible on the skin when mixed into (just a few drops on your palm) organic face cream</li>
      <li>This is a nice, strong but subtle oil.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with Frankencense, so I can&#x27;t give a comparison, but I do like it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;FRANKINCENSE - KING of essential oils, could be the most powerful essential oil in the world.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Worked real well.</li>
      <li>Also, the fragrance is very relaxing.</li>
      <li>This Frankincense oil is the real deal folks.</li>
      <li>Nice essential oil and DeSensua gave a ooupon for future discount</li>
      <li>This oil works every bit as good as Young Living and is about half the cost, while still being a high quality, wildcrafted oil.  </li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t wild about the smell until my oldest son (3) told me it smelled like Christmas.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is the bottle, when you try to get just one drop out most of the time you get more.  </li>
      <li>Too soon to tell if it works better on the dark spots.</li>
      <li>In addition, I am very sensitive to aromas due to my migraines and Frank doesn&#x27;t set me off or bother me, even though it can be overwhelming on my face.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>High quality oils.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been difficult to find quality oils for a reasonable price and this has been an amazing find!</li>
      <li>My skin also felt more firm.</li>
      <li>Boswellia has been regarded as a holy oil in the Middle East and has been used as anointing oil, well known as one of the precious gifts given to Christ at His birth, valued far above gold.&lt;br /&gt;Recent</li>
      <li>I have heavy eyelids and with age they hang more.</li>
      <li>So far I have just been using it in a diffuser to spread the aroma throughout my house.</li>
      <li>It works very well on the back - seems to reduce nerve pain quite well.</li>
      <li>I put a few drops of your Frankincense on my diffuser necklace pad and have been smelling all day - and I&#x27;ve been RELAXED and CALM all day!</li>
      <li>They are meeting our high Swiss standard and expectations in EVERY WAY.</li>
      <li>tested several therapeutic pure essential oils</li>
      <li>Some people with delicate skin may only be able to use 1 drop with their carrier oil.</li>
      <li>So far my eyes look brighter, it&#x27;s only been 3 days.  </li>
      <li>We had been using the Young Living brand, but they were completely out of stock, as well as being much more expensive.  </li>
      <li>I have tried Frank on a flat age spot, a couple types of different brown raised bumps you get with age, skin tags and some new genetic things I have called fibrofolliculomas.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use frankincense oil for anxiety and facial complexion.  It&#x27;s been difficult to find quality oils for a reasonable price and this has been an amazing find!</li>
    <li> I have no negative recollection about this oil, but I have been using another brand which I love. I think I used this all up in blends and it was satisfactory.  Not bad but not my personal favorite.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality frankincense! It smell so good!  I mix it with a little coconut oil for a moisturizer, and it does not aggravate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is amazing and smells awesome. It blends well with other essential oils and carrier oils. It helps me destress and go to sleep. The quality of the oil is very good and works well. I use it every night before I go to sleep. It also has greatly improved my skin complexion.</li>
    <li> The clean, fresh, woodsy scent of this frankincense is outstanding! It doesn&#x27;t smell fake and perfumed, nor does it smell adulterated by any means. I have used Frankincense for a few months for skin care and mental calming, but as I&#x27;ve been experiencing some heightened anxiety lately my brain has been CRAVING the scent of Frankincense. Enter deSensua to the rescue!!!!! I put a few drops of your Frankincense on my diffuser necklace pad and have been smelling all day - and I&#x27;ve been RELAXED and CALM all day! THANK YOU!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality</li>
    <li> it just a scam and I want to return it. Not tolerable smell, waist of money.  Useless.</li>
    <li> This Frankincense oil is the real deal folks. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheaper variants, as they do not come close to how good this smells and works. My only slight complaint would be the bottle tip as someone else mentioned, it could be made better. An easy 5 stars,  the oil is pure and top quality.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. A tad different than the young living version she was accustomed to,  but still excellent quality and even better value</li>
    <li> Exceptional! This amazing oil has surpassed my expectations!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I use this for facial skin care.  Seems to help fine lines to a minimum.</li>
    <li> I would say this is the &amp;#34;big daddy&amp;#34; of all the oils. If you do any research, you&#x27;ll find that frankincense has many healing qualities. I have been using this oil daily on my entire family for a couple of weeks. At first I wasn&#x27;t wild about the smell until my oldest son (3) told me it smelled like Christmas. Now I&#x27;ve grown to appreciate the smell...especially because it&#x27;s uses are endless. This may seem like an expensive oil, but I can tell you that even after using it daily on four people for two weeks, we&#x27;ve maybe used a fourth of the bottle...maybe.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! I mix drops into my nightly face moisturizer and I love how it makes my skin feel and look! Also, the fragrance is very relaxing. I received a list of tips with the oil and I plan to try other suggested uses. Great quality oil and I will certainly purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great product!  It was recommended to me as a remedy for cysts and it works!</li>
    <li> It is of great quaility and they shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil and service.  Oil is wonderful for stress relief and also for my son who has asthma.  Even my husband requests it in our diffuser!!  I also put a drop in my lotion as it is very good for the skin.</li>
    <li> I could tell an immediate difference on my face; I mixed a few drops with shea butter and the wrinkles in my face were less noticeable.  My skin also felt more firm.</li>
    <li> I bought the frankincense for my mom, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> we love this frankincense we have used another company that cost alot more!!!!!!But this is as good and lower price.would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Started using this in the morning on my face.  Mix 1 drop tea tree oil, 3 drops Frankincense, 6 drops argan oil.  I have started to see a huge improvement in my skin.  My only complaint is the bottle, when you try to get just one drop out most of the time you get more.  For me that&#x27;s ok, my skin can take it.  Some people with delicate skin may only be able to use 1 drop with their carrier oil.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I use it for lower back pain due to a bulging disc, and I have just started using it to eliminate moles and dark skin patches. It works very well on the back - seems to reduce nerve pain quite well. I have used another brand prior to trying deSensua and I can honestly say deSensua smells much better in that it is more earthy and warm compared to the other brand.  Too soon to tell if it works better on the dark spots. I may try adding oregano oil. Thanks&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Really love this oil. I&#x27;ve been using the frankincense oil for a while, but with the quality one is really expensive, I&#x27;m glad that I tried out this, the smell is almost the same compare the pricy brand, but it&#x27;s half price. I will order my next bottle soon.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  We had been using the Young Living brand, but they were completely out of stock, as well as being much more expensive.  We decided to try a less expensive brands that was actually in stock!  We are SO glad we did.  This oil works every bit as good as Young Living and is about half the cost, while still being a high quality, wildcrafted oil.  We are very pleased</li>
    <li> Worked real well. put on my ear after  a shower. In about 2 weeks the pre skin cancer was gone.</li>
    <li> We love it.we use it every day.I can breath so much better because of this.</li>
    <li> DESENSUA - This is, by far, one of the best products on the market. It is everything the reviewer claimed.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tested several therapeutic pure essential oils but this one excels them all.&lt;br /&gt; It feels incredible on the skin when mixed into (just a few drops on your palm) organic face cream (only put on your skin what you;d be able to eat :)&lt;br /&gt; My family has pale and very sensitive skin. The entire family loves it, whether mixed in facial creams or balm (rub) mixed with bees wax, thyme, myrrh, cedar, lavender etc. THis is THE Superfood for your skin. Amazing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highest grade with greatest healing properties&lt;br /&gt;FRANKINCENSE - KING of essential oils, could be the most powerful essential oil in the world.&lt;br /&gt; Boswellia has been regarded as a holy oil in the Middle East and has been used as anointing oil, well known as one of the precious gifts given to Christ at His birth, valued far above gold.&lt;br /&gt;Recent research (Journal of Oncology )has found Frankincense to kill cancer cells better than chemotherapy.&lt;br /&gt;Apply this wonderful moisturizer all over face and body, over heart, it provides a calming, protective buffer when feeling stressed or oversensitive to your surroundings.it helps to stay centered &amp; balanced throughout the day.You can safely use it on your children as well.&lt;br /&gt;The designer for this blissful label has been very creative &amp; talented.&lt;br /&gt;We really highly recommend this product and company ( we experienced a most courteous &amp; loving communication) They are meeting our high Swiss standard and expectations in EVERY WAY. Excellent, trustworthy service. Divine.&lt;br /&gt;Alexandra Elisabeth</li>
    <li> Too thin and pours out of dropper too quickly, thus making me waste it. Too expensive to waste like that. Smells nice, though, and does make a difference in breathing when I use on chest and/or feet at night. Probably won&#x27;t buy again, unless I can get it for less.</li>
    <li> Aging skin around eyes, using it with jojoba carrier oil.  So far my eyes look brighter, it&#x27;s only been 3 days.  I have heavy eyelids and with age they hang more. I am hoping the Frank will tighten and restore elasticity</li>
    <li> High quality oils. Great customer service. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice essential oil and DeSensua gave a ooupon for future discount</li>
    <li> This is a nice, strong but subtle oil.  I don&#x27;t have much experience with Frankencense, so I can&#x27;t give a comparison, but I do like it.  I do not like scents that are overwhelming or too powerful, and while this is a strong oil, it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm my senses.</li>
    <li> So far I have just been using it in a diffuser to spread the aroma throughout my house. I am also planning to use it in baths as well. I&#x27;ve been doing some research and others are saying they use it with a carrier oil for massages and to treat ailments. I am planning to use it for as many things possible. DeSensua makes top quality oil and are a great company. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I use it in my car in one of those car diffusers....so soothing and smells soooooooo great!! I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a test because I am the most &#x27;speckled&#x27; person you will ever meet. I have tried Frank on a flat age spot, a couple types of different brown raised bumps you get with age, skin tags and some new genetic things I have called fibrofolliculomas.  The huge skin tag fell off in two weeks, my wrinkles are a little better and my fibrofolliculomas from BHD are not as pronounced. In addition, I am very sensitive to aromas due to my migraines and Frank doesn&#x27;t set me off or bother me, even though it can be overwhelming on my face.  Even though it is pricey, I&#x27;m sticking with my buddy Frank.  No change on the other spots so far, am only using it twice a day and am at three weeks...</li>
    <li> Too expensive for the amount. though. Not much  fragrance .</li>
    <li> I like to add Frankincense essential oil to my homemade skincare products that I make. Just a few drops go a long way. It seems to be good for my skin.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderfull</li>
</ol>
