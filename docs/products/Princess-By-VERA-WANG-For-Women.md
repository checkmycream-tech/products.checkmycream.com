<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> makes a good gift for a girly-girl. it&#x27;s pleasant, light and feminine but nothing amazing IMO although the person i gave this to liked it (but not loved it). the cap can be worn as a ring and the bottle looks very nice on her boudoir</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift - three times to date - so obviously she loves it.</li>
    <li> Always get compliments. Probably my favorite scent of all time.</li>
    <li> Love my Princess Perfume!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume and the price point is the best that I have found&lt;br /&gt;it all arrived to me with no broken glass and the scent is heavenly</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. I bought a small roll-on of this fragrance and fell in love with it. I spray it on in the morning and still smell it many hours later.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom&#x27;s 77th birthday, and she loved it. All us girls in the family thought it smelled great and the bottle it comes in is beautiful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase, would recommend to anyone looking for perfume that is good enough for a princess!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. The recipient loved it. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Great price but it stays on for two mintues literally and then smells like baby powder. This perfume is discontinued though so you can&#x27;t buy it at the department store anymore so stock up. I&#x27;m not sure it was the real thing....but it seemed like it. i read lots and lots of articles on how to tell if it&#x27;s a fake vera wang princess and it looks and feels authentic so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> She loved it, so there&#x27;s nothing really to &#x27;review&#x27;. If you&#x27;re buying this stuff, you already know what it smells like.</li>
    <li> Seems the product is a bit watered down.  I actually went to Ulta and sprayed this perfume on my wrist a few days ago and was able to smell it all day.  I sprayed this product 4 hours ago and I can barely smell it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for over a year. I love it. This was the best size and price that I have seen anywhere.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, and a good price.</li>
    <li> My daughter was hoping for it for a Christmas gift and it is not only a fragrance she likes but everyone enjoys it including my husband who doesn&#x27;t like most perfumes.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected.  Happy with purchase.  :)</li>
    <li> Just as described, in plastic sealed box.  Great scent at a super price.</li>
    <li> The product picture is incorrect and it has no description.The bottle is Eau de Toilette, 3.4 oz and the box is pink it is hard to tell from the picture. This is the second year I have bought this for my daughter and she loves the scent. UPDATE I just bought a third bottle and the item came in quickly and undamaged. Thank you ( Update ) bought again for $23.00 WOW what a great price !!!!!</li>
    <li> Wife loved the perfume. Shipping was quick, great value too. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My wife loved this perfume. Got her a gift bag that had a princess on it and it was a great combo.</li>
    <li> Purfume smells amazing! Plus, the price is much cheaper than buying it from a department store! Meaning that, you can still feel like a princess without emptying your pockets!</li>
    <li> I love the vera Wang perfume. Thank you amazon for delivering this product to me so fast</li>
    <li> This is a BEAUTIFUL smelling product but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I think for the price the scent should stay with you more than an hour.  I love the fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I will never buy anything without looking at Amazon.com first! I looked at Ulta and would have paid double this price and only gotten 1/2 the perfume. I orderd it and it was here 4 days later! GREAT price and very quick shipping. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the scent of this perfume!  If you couple it with Ralph Lauren Hot lotion, you&#x27;ll have everyone asking what is that your wearing.  LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a christmas gift.  They loved it.  Shopping Amazon was so much easier than searching the stores for it and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and extremely affordable. Same size bottle you&#x27;d buy at a department store, but half the price. I honestly feel like I&#x27;ve stuck gold!</li>
    <li> Exactly like buying from the store.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Package was in great condition and contained the correct product. Wife loved it as its her favorite. Thanks for the good price on a great product.</li>
    <li> Always a hit with the mom :)</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the perfume. Its a watered down version with very weak smell and very light pink in color. Not satisfied at all. Received it 5 days back and tried returning it today but it seems its not eligible for return either since it requires special transportation and handling which seller can’t provide . $33.20 gone down the drain :(</li>
    <li> I am a 56 year old woman who probably has no business with a teeny-bopper scent, but who cares?  While shopping recently at Ulta, I thought that I would give some of their fragrances a try.  I smelled almost everything in the store; tried very hard to focus on the fragrance and not the bottle or the price--and Vera Wang Princess was the scent that I liked the most.  I liked it so much that I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing my wrist as I made my way home.  I waited a couple of days, and then went back to make sure that I still wanted to stick with Princess--it works so well with my body chemistry I felt that I just had to have it!  Checking prices--Amazon was the most reasonable, however there are a number of complaints about shoppers getting \\&quot;old\\&quot; fragrances. I ended up getting mine on Ebay, brand new and sealed, 3.4 oz for $28.  I am very happy with my purchase, and feel like this cold be a signature scent.  Floral and fruity, with added chocolate and vanilla notes, Princess doesn&#x27;t go for the jugular, which makes it workable for casual wear.  If you like Viva La Juicy or Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy, this may work well for you.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied and received in time for Christmas</li>
    <li> After seeing an ad for this perfume in a magazine as a teenager and thinking it was probably too florally/stuffy/girly, I smelled it anyway.  Wow!  From that moment on, I knew this was the perfume for me!  It is the first and only perfume I have ever used.  I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  However, it lasts a really long time and makes me happy every time I wear it.  The scent is light and not over-powering.  The bottle is gorgeous, too!</li>
    <li> This product is fake and not worth a cent. So bummed to have wasted my money</li>
    <li> Very nice perfume!  Wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and smells great!</li>
    <li> Vera Wang is my sister in law&#x27;s favorite perfume. I am so glad I ordered it from you. I got excellent value for my money. The service was great. It was a great experience shopping with them.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This was the real deal, for a fraction of the price! It shipped quickly and the fragrance is identical to the pricey department store bottle I just finished. I&#x27;ve long been a fan of this wearable and fesh scent from Vera Wang, and I&#x27;m thrilled to find it at such a great price. I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> seems not to hold scent very well ...</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Princess for years and was very excited to find it on Amazon for so cheep. However, when my product arrived it didn&#x27;t have the charecteristic Princess smell and I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume but did not want to pay $75 for it at the mall.  I was nervous about buying it online without seeing the actual product but was happy that it came completely sealed and was not a knockoff.  I will never buy perfume at full price again.</li>
    <li> She likes it. A soft smell,  and not an over powerful fragrance.</li>
    <li> Definitely a good investment if you&#x27;re a fan of Vera Wang. This fragrance is a light floral that has a long scent life.</li>
    <li> I have tried this before and was never disappointed, its a heavenly fragrance and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was said to arrive on May 27th and it actually came on May 20th. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my sister as a Christmas gift and it was exactly as I expected and much less expensive than the department store. I will definitely be ordering scents from Amazon again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> |Wonderful.Had a little trouble with the shipping but once it got here it was well worth it</li>
    <li> Arrived today. Packaging was great-no chance for breakage. Great price too! Bought as a Christmas gift for my niece, hoping she likes it!</li>
    <li> I Purchased the Perfume as a gift for my mother based on reviews that were positive, as it turns out they were correct! She loves it!! :-)</li>
    <li> Great price for all you get. In a store you&#x27;d pay at least $20 more for just the perfume.</li>
    <li> Vera wang smells wonderful ! sometimes I&#x27;m a work for 16 hours and people ask me what do i have on it has a soft lily smell .</li>
    <li> This perfume smells absolutely amazing. I love it. Not overpowering at all yet still has a lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> A soft sweet smell that will linger. Not powerful and harsh but very feminine and subtle.</li>
    <li> Great. The shipping was great also</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, and to be frank, I can&#x27;t smell it on her without being immediately turned on! It lasts all days, and definitely is alluring!</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to perfume for years. Amazon offers the best price. Big bottle and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The price was fantastic. The product was brand new. The shipping was fast.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The item was in the original box, but it was obvious that it had been re sealed. The bottle wasn&#x27;t secure in the box as it would be if purchased from a store. The perfume wasn&#x27;t the same color as the original perfume is. It should be a lilac color, instead it was a strange grey color. The smell is similar but does not last as long on the skin or clothing as the original that I had purchased from a department store. I&#x27;m not really sure what I purchased but it was definitely not Vera Wang princess. Needless to say I was a little disappointed, this was also my first purchase on amazon. Better luck next time I suppose.</li>
    <li> I disagree with other reviewers that this is scent for \\&quot;teenage\\&quot; or \\&quot;little\\&quot; girls. It has a slight baby powder scent, but it&#x27;s also floral and soft-it&#x27;s not an overpowering scent. I wear it daily, but I must agree with the other reviewers that the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last long. I typically can&#x27;t smell it on myself after a few hours, but perhaps I&#x27;ve become too accustomed to the scent. Either way, it&#x27;s still a beautiful, feminine scent to wear every day and I&#x27;d buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Vera makes some of the best perfumes for women. Purchased for my wife. Great value for terrific fragrance. Very light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This particular Vera Wang not only entertains my favorite olfactory \\&quot;hues\\&quot; but it&#x27;s just plain pretty and has a fun spirit:  not too bold and not too subdued.  It&#x27;s a radiant and whimsical fragrance that brings out the playful and unpredictable.  Go to a trusted seller, Cyber Planet, and soon you will meet the princess!</li>
    <li> it delivered fast, the perfume smells really good but it doesnt last. so you have to be constantly applying it in order for you to smell.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> It is beautiful! I love the scent and how it is so fresh and wonderful. It reminds me of love spell, but it is better and lasts longer. :)</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase and arrived in a timely manner.  The gift set was great!  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for Christmas for my daughter who loves sweet smelling perfume that is not overpowering! Loved it ! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product. My wife loves the fragrance,as do I. Lol. Great price and was delivered as promised. Thanks Oxkom. Now this elf has to hide it until Christmas</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this perfume.  The name caught my attention.  How could you go wrong with Vera Wang, right?  I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  This is by far my favorite perfume.  I love it.  I get so many comments on how nice it smells.  I will continue to buy this one.  Thanks Amazon for listing a great product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the service,</li>
    <li> No issues and product arrived on time</li>
    <li> My current girlfriend had mentioned that she loves this fragrance, so that&#x27;s what I had thought about getting her. When I mentioned to other girls or her friends my idea, they all told me how much they loved it too. So, I went ahead and got this for her, and she was ecstatic. And, I have to say, I like the smell for her too...</li>
    <li> Took about 10 days to get to me, but the weather was horrible across the country and shipping was free so...I&#x27;ll let it sliiiiide. I was really freakin&#x27; nervous that the product might be fake, but it&#x27;s legit from BeautyEncounter if anyone is worried on that. As far as Princess itself, It&#x27;s a soft, calm, happy, sweet, young, warm smell. I&#x27;m 23, I personally am obsessed with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume awhile ago at a department store for over $85 ..!! When I found this on amazing I thought it was too good to be true, but believed the 300&#x27; some reviews and ordered it... recieved it the other day and it is LEGIT!!! Love this perfume and you cannot beat the price. Seems to stay on for a long time and it is the same bottle/product you would buy in the expensive deparment store! I will forever buy my perfumes on amazon! (from a legit seller)</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed as I was really expecting the scent to be very Florwery &amp; fruity. Please strike t&lt;br /&gt;Out the 2stars.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It is soft not a strong scent.  I&#x27;ve received compliments when I&#x27;ve worn it.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing!  It smells sweet, but sexy and is hard to pull your nose away from the scent!  Always get compliments when I wear this perfume. A \\&quot;Gotta-Have\\&quot; Perfume! The Shipping was VERY fast! It arrived a day before the earliest estimated date.  Fast service! Love it!</li>
    <li> great price, fast shipping !</li>
    <li> Great price and product came promptly!</li>
    <li> Soft pleasing scent.  My daughter and I both really like this.  Not overpowering, and good for all ages.</li>
    <li> beautiful container...alluring scent...was a great gift to give</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect. Thanks much.</li>
    <li> It not the original I&#x27;m very upset</li>
    <li> My favourite perfume that I can&#x27;t seem to find anywhere anymore. The price is a steal in my opinion and the smell is exactly what it says it is. Recommended for a girly girl that doesn&#x27;t like overly flowery perfumes.</li>
    <li> You can definitely smell the vanilla and chocolate. But in a great way! It&#x27;s not too heavy and not too light this fragrance lasts roughly 6-8 hours on me. For any of you who have allergies or are very sensitive to scents, my father has the scent of a bloodhound. Every time I spray perfume on me he complains about it being strong. I sprayed this perfume on one day (he did not know I had bought perfume) he asked me what the nice scent was. I told him that it was my perfume and he looked at me shocked and said great choice. I recommend this perfume to whomever loves a feminine scent. I&#x27;m 18 years old also.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance and I love that I can buy it at an affordable price and use my Prime Membership.</li>
    <li> The price was so great for the size of the bottle I had to buy it. Owned it a few years ago and was really excited to get it again. It came very quickly, completely sealed, brand new, smelled exactly like I remember! Great buying experience!</li>
    <li> What a amazing deal!! A fraction of the price at retail store, smells perfect!!!</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite perfume, I was very upset when Sephora and most major department stores stopped carrying it for some reason and only Ulta (I have none by me) or Kohl&#x27;s (which was always out of stock) were selling the perfume. I originally was looking for a roller ball to take on vacation with me but I found a full sized bottle at a great price. I was certainly nervous that the perfume could be counterfiet but it smells just like like my definitely authentic bottle. The only issue I had was that the crown/ring bottle topper had come off and were rattling around and I think some perfume came out of the bottle due to that. I don&#x27;t know if it was a packaging flaw or because of shipping but it did make my doubt the authenticity of the perfume a little bit more.</li>
    <li> Super good got it the my wife&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Is perfume smells wonderful but it has taken forever for it to come in the mail.  But love the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the bottle. Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Years ago I received this from an old boyfriend &amp; loved it. I finally wanted to get it again. It is for sure one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
    <li> there is no problem to buy in this site. On time, tha&#x27;s what I expected. Recomended site.  Satsfied!  You can buy.</li>
    <li> When I saw the review that said this perfume is better than Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Angel, I was so excited because it&#x27;s my favorite scent. I thought I would LOVE Vera Wang&#x27;s Princess. Well, I spray it on and for 2 seconds I smell a baby powder type scent and then, absolutely nothing. Uuggh!! I was thankful that I only paid $28.00 including shipping for an unopened box from Ebay.  Update: The key to hating this fragrance was the fact that I got a fake on ebay. I purchased the rollerball of Vera Wang Princess and it smells great!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and I was thrilled to find it for sale for such a great price! I received the perfume a few days after purchase and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It is the exact same perfume and bottle as the one you could buy at the store for $70. I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> soft , sweet, love this scent.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more.</li>
    <li> Gift for my sister. They delivered on time and it was all in its original packaging.</li>
    <li> I initially saw this perfume bottle and immediately thought of my sister-in-law, a self-proclaimed \\&quot;Princess\\&quot;. She absolutely loves everything Princess. So I sprayed it in Sephora, just to see how it smelled in case I decided to get it for her. I thought \\&quot;okay that&#x27;s pretty nice.\\&quot; Then after I got home, a few hours later, I smelled my hand where the perfume had hit it, and it smelled amaaaazing. I was hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a bottle for her and a bottle for me. However, at first I thought I must have been confused or purchased a fake, because it sprayed on smelling strongly like rubbing alcohol and Baby Soft. I thought, \\&quot;how could I have ever liked this?? What am I going to do, giving my SIL this disgusting perfume??\\&quot; But then a few moments later it began to smell like water-lily and apricot. I thought, \\&quot;okay, this is better but still not what I thought it would be...\\&quot; After a couple of hours, it dried down into a beautiful sugary smell with vanilla and chocolate undertones. I then realized that this WAS the perfume I had originally fallen for in Sephora, but that it changes its smell throughout the day until it finally becomes this beautiful base scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I purchased this perfume on Amazon. I got a much cheaper price, and the shipping was extremely fast - I ordered it on Friday evening and it was in my hands Monday evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this will become my signature daytime/office scent. It gets really hot here in Florida and so I can&#x27;t wear any of my usual spicy, musky, oriental scents during the day after March. I also can&#x27;t wait to give my SIL her bottle for Mother&#x27;s Day. I&#x27;m sure she will love it and love sharing it with her own daughter, the \\&quot;little Princess\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;d like to add one thing - I went to Sephora after this purchase and smelled Princess while there. I sprayed it directly on my wrist. It had the EXACT scent, even the alcohol-type scent when you first spray. Completely identical, so rest assured that this product is NOT a fake.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this fragrance! This romantic floral scent gets me complimented everywhere I go (my boyfriend especially enjoys it). I don&#x27;t think I could ever get tired of Vera Wang Princess--ever!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product I received, as it is my favorite perfume. It arrived ahead of time as well.</li>
    <li> used as a gift ........ they love it... smells great .. last long throughout the day.</li>
    <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t fade so it&#x27;s worth the money. She wears it almost every day. It was the perfect birthday present for her.</li>
    <li> This is a brand that a family member uses.  I was a little concerned that it could be a knock off.  It turned out to be the real thing and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; fragrance and I found it ! I purchased Princess without ever smelling it . I read all the reviews on it and took a chance . So happy that I did !! This fragrance is everything I was hoping it would be and the price was right :)</li>
    <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
    <li> The perfume was way too strong..please purchase from the store instead</li>
    <li> Fantasic price! And received shippment as promised!!</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I&#x27;m a guy, and no, I haven&#x27;t tried this perfume on myself.  But my wife loves it, and I love it on her.  I think that qualifies me to review it, don&#x27;t you?  Great price, Amazon, and I like the cool bottle as well.</li>
    <li> I have worn Vera Wang Princess for years now and ran out a couple months ago. I&#x27;ve always purchased it at Macy&#x27;s but didn&#x27;t want to pay the $80++ for it this time. When I received this perfume in the mail, everything looked correct so I decided to keep it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same. It&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s a very watered down version of the actual perfume. (Which is maybe why it was so much less expensive?) I used to get compliments all the time on how my perfume smelled and now no one can even tell I&#x27;m wearing it. I&#x27;m just a bit unsure as to what I actually received in the mail.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I got this for my mom for Christmas and then I bought another bottle for myself, because it smells so good!</li>
    <li> I was SO hoping.... that Vera Wang would, above ALL designers, knock it out of the olfactory park with a fragrance. Instead, this is Thierry Mugler&#x27;s ANGEL revisited with a bit more vanilla. Waaaayyyy too cloying! Would hate to have this step into an elevator. Very disappointed. Can NOT believe she gave this a &#x27;pass&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Took perfume out of the box and it is broken. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought it for our maid. she was happy with it</li>
    <li> bought this for my kid, she loved it. the smell is very nice, vera wang always puts out great products and the price on Amazon is so much better than the stores</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! It is so cheap on here in comparison to how much it is sold for in stores!!!</li>
    <li> I Love this fragrance..... I get a lot of compliments on it...Its turned out to be my favorite fragrance since I used to wear Obsession...</li>
    <li> I ordered this bottle AGES ago and have not even gotten halfway through it.  When I smelled this in the store I absolutely LOVED the scent and could not wait to order it.  When I received it, the perfume was pink, not purple, and the scent was not AT ALL what I remembered.  I did not like it at all.  I thought maybe it was me, so I just let it sit.  The other day I came across it in the store again and decided to smell the tester.  I was DEFINITELY hoodwinked.  The perfume in the store instantly reminded me of the scent I loved.  Will not reorder from this seller.</li>
    <li> Soft and light- not overwhelming but springy. Perfect for the springtime weather. I needed a new scent and this perfectly suited me.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance bought as gift.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter - she loves it.  Wears this scent every day.</li>
    <li> got this for my girlfriend and she LOVES IT! smells incredible and is very cheap in comparison to in stores</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful scent that is definitely worth trying. The larger bottle is a good value. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> As expected and delivered by USPS . Smells great and the size is great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I had initially ordered this and my mom loved it so much that she took it for herself! This is my second order</li>
    <li> Thank you so much! I am in love with it! ❤</li>
    <li> I love this scent! I&#x27;m so happy with the product and the great price! My boyfriend really enjoys this scent!</li>
    <li> If you buy Vera Wang perfume than you know what your getting. So far all my Amazon purchases through Amazon have been good.This one being no different. I&#x27;ve bought Princess perfume &amp; paid more than here. Only concern if perfume would be authentic as far as smell &amp; strength. Wife has had no complaints, &amp; she smells great as usual.</li>
    <li> it smells really nice.... I wish however that it lasted longer... ??? it seems to fade away too soon.&lt;br /&gt;I do not care for the two pc cap over the spray.nozzle.. its inventive and cute but not very practical.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rewriting my review because initially I didn&#x27;t like this very much. I felt like the guava was too strong, and dominated the fragrance. I didn&#x27;t get much chocolate which was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after using this a few more times I fell in love with it. And this happened with some other perfumes as well. I don&#x27;t know if my chemistry changes on a frequent basis, or if I just get used to the perfume? Maybe a combination of both. Whatever happened, I love this now!!! It&#x27;s so soft and sweet, and just a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do detect a little chocolate and vanilla and lots of guava, but now I love the blending of the three. Definitely happy with my blind purchase.</li>
    <li> I was first skeptical about buying the product, not because I had a doubt on its quality but because I read mixed reviews about it like fake fragrance, not the original one and so on..... And also a huge price difference... But I gave it a try and I am glad that I did..... The fragrance is so fresh and appealing.... Its not too strong but a nice sweet smell that u really adore.  It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. You will feel fresh day long after spraying only a little of it. Personally I am loving it....and oh yes..... Price is also just half of what you pay in the big stores.....for me it is a big hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that was the product review now let&#x27;s talk about the packaging and delivery part.  I ordered this product on 16 jan and after a long wait I received it on 28 jan. , but the packaging was perfect.  I ordered two fragrances one for me and one for my husband.  Both the items  were in good condition and were worth waiting for... Thanks amazon..</li>
    <li> Best price I could find for my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. I will definitely buy it again as long as this offer remains.</li>
    <li> I have used Princess for years and have never experienced an issue with the fragrance.  It&#x27;s definitely not authentic. I find I can&#x27;t even wear it,  so it was a waste.  I am  very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and was so happy to find the 3.4 oz size for such a low price! Still haven&#x27;t run out! But when I do, I&#x27;ll be sure to buy it from here again.</li>
    <li> I like this perfume, it is ideal for every day, for your work! thank u!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume it is my favorite! I have a collection and this is by far the one I keep running out of</li>
    <li> Awesome! Love it, and the top is the cutest accesory.Smells amazing! Came within a few days. Makes an awesome decoration.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great price that&#x27;s all I can. Bought as a gift n I hope she would love it! My only concern is if its real. The price is So good to be true.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price, order  frequently during the last two and will continue to order from this site for years to come.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I have been wanting to purchase this fragrance for awhile.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this perfume and the price on Amazon is so much better than anywhere else that I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> great smelling stuff, my wife loves it and I love when she wears it😉</li>
    <li> Item as described. Quick delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this perfume for a couple years after smelling a sample of it in Belk&#x27;s department store. I really love the heart-shaped container and this crown top is super cute. I got it today so I haven&#x27;t sprayed any but you can literally smell it through the box. I&#x27;m pretty sure people will ask where I bought it. Thanks, Amazon. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Love the fragnance, more than expected.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this at Sephora.  I LOVED the smell.  I wanted something more mature but wasn&#x27;t too strong or old grandma.  I LOVE This.  It smells amazing. It comes in a super cute heart shaped bottle with a cute crown at the top.  If you like the smell you should buy this.</li>
    <li> on a whim, I smelled this perfume while perusing the perfume department at a macys some years ago, and I have never wanted to smell another perfume. This is my go to perfume. Occasionally, I will mix it up with Ralph Lauren Bleu, but Vera Wang Princess, will be my go to perfume for the rest of my life. Buy it! You will love it!</li>
    <li> Packaging was great and the bottle was larger than expected. Smells wonderful. Will be a gift for a friend, and it&#x27;s her favorite. Didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money that you&#x27;d have to pay in a store. Very happy!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me as a Christmas gift. I received the package and immediately opened it to find that the perfume was packaged in a brown box, with a sticker on the box stating the content that&#x27;s in the perfume. Also, the bottle had no top and the spray pump was bent. This is not Vera Wang by any means. It&#x27;s all fake. It does smell good though. I will never order any perfumes from Amazon again. You want to buy products at a good price but who wants to get ripped off in the end.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter at Christmas and she loves the &amp;#34;princess&amp;#34; and the smell. Of course I spoil her, I&#x27;m a grandma!</li>
    <li> Our daughter was very happy to receive the perfume and really likes the scent. Fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering for her</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my 24-year-old sister, and she loves it! I looked around for a good price on this, and amazon had the best deal by far. I was nervous after placing the order that the delivery schedule looked like the gift would not arrive on time, but customer service assured me it would, and it did. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Order was PERFECT. Delivered amazingly fast and at a great price. Very happy with transaction!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best by Vera Wang and it smells heavenly</li>
    <li> quick shipping, product as described. No complaints whatsoever. expectations met on all levels. The product was much less expensive than buying in a store.</li>
    <li> Many of the notes in this perfume are really pretty- I like the fruity and floral notes. The overall effect of them is fresh and feminine. The one thing I&#x27;m not happy with is the vanilla note- it doesn&#x27;t blend well with the others, so I go back and forth between smelling fruity/floral and smelling vanilla, and it&#x27;s heavy and powdery on me. For me, the vanilla ruined what would have otherwise been a very nice perfume.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly what I expected.  Perfect size. Same scent that I am used too and greatly priced.</li>
    <li> For some reason it didn&#x27;t smell as good as I remembered when I smelled it at the store...</li>
    <li> I like the smell, you do not need to use a lot and last just the right time until your next shower.</li>
    <li> When I wear Vera Wang Princess I always get asked what I am wearing. This is my favorite spray. I always have some on hand. Nice price too!</li>
    <li> got it for mom, she like it</li>
    <li> I was happy with this purchase, it cost about half as much as I paid previously at department stores like Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my favorite scents. I have heard that she is no longer making this scent and if this is true I am upset. I was forced to purchase from Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores so I do partially believe it. I just can&#x27;t understand why. Any who, it smells so good. Very light floral scent, but there is something else mixed in that I could never put my finger on. I have been wearing this for about 6 years and will for as long as I can buy it!</li>
    <li> love this smell is sweet but not too sweet and very fun to wear for all occasions. I had to buy this size for the price was a steal and all my friends use it too</li>
    <li> Great service will order again thanks</li>
    <li> Smells great! Packaging was very good and bottle came without any leaks :) looks great in my collection of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The scent on me is a nice light sweet but flirty scent. I believe any age can wear this of course it smells different on different ppl but this is a must</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so dissapointed with this purchase. The product is so adultered with alcohol that the original fragance is almost imperceptible. This is my second Vera Wang Pincess bottle. I bought the first one at amazon.com too and I loved it, so my husband bought another one for me as a gift. We&#x27;re so sad, the product is totally falsified.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister-in-law for Christmas.  In stores it was fairly pricey but on Amazon it was a pretty good deal.  It is a very nice scent, mildly floral but not very over-whelming.  My sister-in-law is a young professional so it was perfect for her.  She wears it when she is going out with friends and it isn&#x27;t overbearing so she doesn&#x27;t smell like an over perfumed teenager.</li>
    <li> One of my all time, favorite go to perfumes. Its soft and sweet, not overpowering. There will always be a bottle of Princess by VW on my vam</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how big of a bottle I was ordering so was so excited when it came and it was bigger than what I thought I had ordered. :-) Going to make a little girl very excited when she gets it for Christmas. :-)</li>
    <li> Decided to try a new perfume then I typically wear, and let me tell you it wasn&#x27;t a mistake! This perfume makes me smell like a princess, and lives up to the name. It has a wonderful scent, and it&#x27;s not too strong. Shipping was fast, and on time. A+++</li>
    <li> One of my favorites!  I caught it at a great price and bought 4 bottles.  Shipping was fast also.</li>
    <li> I love it! Its fullsized. It smells amazing. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments over this past weekend from guys and girls asking where that scent was coming from that it smelled really good:)  worth every penny:)&amp; cheaper on here instead of sephora or ulta which is. Great f or my wallet and why I purchased from this seller.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and lovely! What a great price for Vera Wang! So happy to have found this seller!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping on authentic product</li>
    <li> Amazing scent and amazing price.  Very happy with this purchase.  The bottle is adorable and the perfume is one of my favorites.  The scent lasts all day for me.</li>
    <li> My mother in law loves this scent!</li>
    <li> Great price for this amazing purfume</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly! I adore the bottle and ring that come with as well. I have gotten so many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasant sweet floral perfume. It suits my younger sister and is my go to gift for her. It is probably suits to a girl/young woman 16 to 25.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the quality of this perfume!!  I had been wanting it for so long, but had to wait to spend $60.00 on a bottle of perfume, to be so let down!! It smells really good but only for a few minutes!!!! Vera Wang must not put any oil in her perfumes!  For the cost one would expect it to last for awhile!!!  Will not purchase again!!!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas Gift that was scheduled to deliver Dec. 22nd.  I have Never recieved it.Tracking pacage says that it is on the truck for delivery ever since Dec.22nd. UPS says that they can&#x27;t help me, that Amazon has to request help. Problem is that I can&#x27;nt get hold of anyone at Amazon to help me. This is the last time that I purchase from them!!!!</li>
    <li> It came fast and was nicely secured in the package! And a great buy as well!!</li>
    <li> This has a very soft smell. I first purchased in a department store, but didn&#x27;t want to pay their price a second time.</li>
    <li> Best price I have ever gotten on this fragrance. It came promptly woth everything that comes with in in the store (crown ring, decorated box etc) I should have bought two!</li>
    <li> For the price I got it for holy smokes! Talk about deal! Smells amazing try it</li>
    <li> I LOVE this fragrance!  I get many compliments when I wear it.  Sexy, Sophisticated,  yet Playful!</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS SO DELICIOUS AND LASTS THE ENTIRE DAY. WILL BUY AGAIN! HIHGLY RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned that it may be a perfume for a teen, however the scent is incredible.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  I have worn it for 5 years. It is light and sweet and last pretty much all day.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing (: I took it to a department store just to make sure that it was authentic, and it is! The scent lasts throughout the day, and I receive tons of compliments on it!</li>
    <li> Get many compliments on this perfume. What else to say? It&#x27;s a great sweet exotic smell, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap sweet perfume. It&#x27;s just a great scent.</li>
    <li> Makes a great gift for the special lady in your life, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, and to be frank, I can&#x27;t smell it on her without being immediately turned on! It lasts all days, and definitely is alluring!</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells wonderful! Nice and light for the summer. The company delivered it fast and without and complications! Great purchase and I would recommend it to women looking for something to ward while it&#x27;s warm that isn&#x27;t overpowering!</li>
    <li> I adore this scent on my wife. I am very pleased with the fast shipping and excellent packaging from this  company. I will be looking to buy more when she has used this. Thanks so much. I hope your company does well. Not many out there are as good as you have been to us.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting :)..smells great..</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, which I wear as my signature scent.  Don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;little girl\\&quot; bottle fool you - this is a very sophisticated light floral scent with hints of fruit and vanilla, suitable for a woman of any age.  It is VERY light.  If you like heavier scents this may not be for you.  The top note fades quickly, and after that it&#x27;s a very subtle scent.  But anything that \\&quot;clings\\&quot; for too long gives me headaches anyway.  You can still smell it on the skin, but it does not \\&quot;broadcast\\&quot;.  Because I think perfume should be a reward, not an announcement, that&#x27;s fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is fantastic, and the perfume arrived quickly.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was described and exactly what I wanted! Great price, fast shipping! Love this scent!!!</li>
    <li> Procduct arrived as expected, on time, and in good condition.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Smells so good I finished the bottle in one month. Will buy bigger bottle next time</li>
    <li> Love the smell, good price, and it&#x27;s authentic. How can you beat that?</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she loves it. Can&#x27;t find a bottle this size for this cheap anywhere else.</li>
    <li> bought from seller OxCom. she loved it. seems like the real thing or close enough that we cant tell the difference. great deal compared to department store price!</li>
    <li> This perfume has a beautiful scent. It is quite lovely without being overpowering. I have never been able to wear perfume because of my alergies but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me. This makes me quite happy.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite scent!  I have to stock up on it if it is ever discontinued.  It&#x27;s my go to scent.  I think it&#x27;s perfect for both the summer and the winter months.  I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong for office-wear, it won&#x27;t overcome your co-workers.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it! I was pleased with the reasonable price and the speedy delivery!!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I live the bottle that the perfume comes in. This is my favorite perfume!! And my husband picked it out!!</li>
    <li> One of my best friends in college always wore this perfume and I couldn&#x27;t get enough of it -- I would always spritz a bit on my neck every time I went to her apartment -- so after senseless procrastination I finally decided to purchase a bottle for myself. It is super feminine and sexy, and makes me feel more beautiful every time I wear it. My husband loves it, I love it, and I receive compliments on it all the time. I will definitely purchase another bottle from Amazon when this one runs out. The price was great in comparison to everywhere else I looked and it arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. recived it on time as expected.i would recommend this to my friends and family</li>
    <li> fast shipping no damage and just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this very classy perfume.You will turn heads when you walk by other women cause they are going to want to know what the name of that perfume that your wearing that smells so good.</li>
    <li> Have been a fan of this fragrance for several years.  It never gets old and I receive many compliments when wearing it.  It is subtle and not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Smells great ! A great classic perfume that is extremely affordable. Have a very fresh floral smell. Its great for day to day. I would buy it more someone younger than older.</li>
    <li> She loves this perfume and it is a pity that apparently it is not produced anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I snugged three bottles while they were still in stock. :)</li>
    <li> I just ordered this item and was very disappointed. I&#x27;ve used Princess for many years and the bottle I was sent was very old, not the right color, and didn&#x27;t smell fresh AT ALL. I also cannot return the item because it&#x27;s classified as \\&quot;flammable\\&quot; and they won&#x27;t take it back. Great perfume, but very, very unhappy with getting it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, great product!</li>
    <li> Great perfume, love the way it smells. This is a great price for the 3.4 ounce bottle. Love!</li>
    <li> COMPLETELY FAKE. Smells nothing like the real product. DO NOT BUY. SUCH A RIP OFF!</li>
    <li> Product was not Princess by Vera Wang.</li>
    <li> Grandaughter was very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I love the floral scent. I switch around a bit, but this is my favorite fragrance. Seems like so many fragrances these days smell like grapefruits; this one smells like flowers.  I always receive compliments. It&#x27;s not over powering either.</li>
    <li> It smells okay, nothing to die for. It actually reminds me of one of those gap body sprays or something of that sort. It doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot of effort went into making it. But I have smelled worse. I will use the entire bottle, but I would never re-purchase it.</li>
    <li> Great product.Fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product smells nothing like Vera Wang Princess, it smells like alcohol.</li>
    <li> This review for the specific bottle of Princess I bought on Amazon from Trendsetters, not the perfume in general. I&#x27;ve purchased 2 bottles of Princess from the department store and I love it. I found it on Amazon for half what I pay at Macy&#x27;s and thought it was worth a shot. The perfume itself should be pink in color; the bottle I received contained a clear liquid with a slight bit of pink (only if you hold it to the light). When I sprayed it, it had no scent whatsoever. Nothing. The nozzle on the perfume bottle smelled sort of like black pepper. Basically, its not perfume, its just water and food coloring. I wanted to return it, but perfume is on the list of non-returnable items because its a flammable material. I filed a claim with Amazon and contacted the seller in hopes I can get a refund. Don&#x27;t waste your money and don&#x27;t buy anything from Trendsetters; they&#x27;re only here to cheat you. I assume most of these positive reviews are from people who work for Trendsetters.</li>
    <li> this is the real thing. If you wanted to get this perfume don&#x27;t hesitate ! I did at first but after a while I decided to give it a try and order on here on amazon. It came and it&#x27;s the real thing. Smells just the way it&#x27;s suppose to and lasts all day just like I remember.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my girlfriend. Apparently it is not longer sold in stores so she was quite surprised and very happy.</li>
    <li> She seems to like it and the price was excellent</li>
    <li> I usually buy this same product from sephora for about $20 more!! Its exactly the same! I am so happy I found it!</li>
    <li> Great Value can&#x27;t go wrong with Vera Wang</li>
    <li> A great gift to give to a close  friend that you truthly care about. An excellent gift for valentine Day !</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Sunday and it got to my house on Tuesday. AND WHAT A PRICE!!! I&#x27;m super excited about this purchase!</li>
    <li> The product is not a fake and smells as expected.  However the spritzer head stopped functioning randomly and now I can only spray out huge thick streams of the perfume.  Not good! It&#x27;s really too expensive to have cheapo hardware!  Oh and the top is very secured to the glass bottle so there is NO option to pour some into a travel atomizer.</li>
    <li> Great price on this perfume!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and I love Vera Wang Princess&#x27; soft scent.  The price was right for my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume ever, and amazon always has the best price on it!</li>
    <li> All of Vera Wang fragrance line is a must have. I&#x27;m trying to get my hands one them one bottle at a time. Especially this Princess one, smells sooooo good</li>
    <li> Well nothing much to say other then my girl loves it, fast service as well, she got it right on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years, and I cannot break the habit. The sweet, clean scent makes everyone ask me what I have on and the name. Thank you Vera Wang! Haha :P Boyfriend approved.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Shipped on time without damage. Was still in plastic wrapping. Would definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This is my second time buying this perfume from this buyer. I plan to continue to do so. Perfect Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> my wife love the flavor,good product,i recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had 3 other Vera Wang Princess products (the smaller bottle, larger bottle, and roll on). This product appears completely different than the quality of my other Princess products -- see the color, fragrance (this one smells strongly of alcohol for a while), and bottle quality (the ring/crown metal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return this product in a heartbeat. Do not purchase it if you have had experience with the original (real, is this product a fake or did Vera Wang butcher her popular scent?).</li>
    <li> This perfume smells beautiful and my husband loves it.  reece@roadrunner.com  He doesn&#x27;t really like the smell of a heavy scent and that why he likes this Vera Wang so much. Plus the bottle design is cute to.</li>
    <li> Real deal. Just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Great product for a great price.  It was shipped quickly as well.</li>
    <li> Great aroma - great service</li>
    <li> Its a nice soft fragrant.  Have been using it for a few years. It seems to last the full day as well.</li>
    <li> She loves it and good price I got it for her birthday. . Very satisfied wth it and 2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> Love my Princess by Vera Wang. Received the order in a timely fashion and the quality is no different than what I&#x27;ve purchased in the department stores.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance at a great price!</li>
    <li> What a value!  3.4 oz vs the 1.7 usually found for just as much in retail stores!</li>
    <li> I was happy that the product was sent to me in all of its original packaging. The product was priced reasonably.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! True to form and past experiences with Vera&#x27;s &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34;. Ooooh lala.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. She has been using for years, now she is 17 at the university studying Architecture and her friends always ask what she is using. The package arrived pristine and fast. I recommend the seller.</li>
    <li> So, Vera Wang Princesa has been a favorite of mine for 10+ years. The first time I discovered it, was a christmas gift for me with my name engraved on the back. (Still have the bottle!) It was the newest perfume out at the time and the first spray, I was completely in love.  This is a fragrance that smells absolutely lovely -  fresh but not too overpowering or flowery. Its hard to describe the actual scent, all I know is this is a very feminine and versatile perfume and can be worn every day for almost any occasion. That is what I love most about it.  I have bought it so many times and I will continue to over and over!  By the way, it is insanely cheaper on amazon. In Macy&#x27;s I have seen it go for like 60-80!!! Of course in the same size!! Get it from amazon!!  I recommend this to any women from young to old age for something that makes you feel and smell fresh &amp; pretty :)  Will forever be my favorite perfume :)</li>
    <li> Great price and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. Thank you. My favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 bottles of this and LOVE it. I always recieve compliments when I wear it. Beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, everyday perfume. I was so stoked to find it on amazon for this price, and it is the big bottle! I love everything about it, and the shipping was fast! :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent for a good price, not to over powering</li>
    <li> I am a repeat buyer of this item and this was a gift. I do also have this item for myself. It is hard to find locally anymore. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed that Vera Wang Rock Princess was a limited supply but having Vera Wang Princess readily available is great! This perfume has a fruity, woodsy scent and has received many compliments whenever I wear it. I seems to &amp;#34;adapt&amp;#34; to the user which is wonderful! A great price as well, the bottle is large and even with daily use lasts over 6 months :)</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. I love it on her too. It&#x27;s a very seductive smell :) won&#x27;t regret buying it if you never bought it before. Promise.</li>
    <li> I love the sensation smell of Vera Wang! it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> I Love This Fragrance. It Came In The Mail Promptly With Excellent Packaging. Would Buy Again!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells horrible. I threw the bottle away. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and she loves it. Fast service.</li>
    <li> I love it. Everyone always telling me how good I smell</li>
    <li> love this scent and have been complimented several times while wearing it.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful fragrance</li>
    <li> I love the smell. Cheapest place I&#x27;ve found this.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.. I  Buy it for her yearly.  I have no complaints and would recommend it highly</li>
    <li> great fragrance.  lovely smell. will buy again.  great price and fragrance and many asked what it was and where to get it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and was very pleased.  She loves it and that made me one happy husband.  Great product</li>
    <li> First off, I am a man. I bought this for my wife. I was skeptical at first by this perfume because of the name. I was thinking &amp;#34;Princess? who wants to be a princess?&amp;#34; You would think princess would smell something like your daughter, sister or niece but this doesn&#x27;t give that scent at all. I think women of any age can wear this and not worry about it not matching their appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you are reading this right now, go ahead and buy it. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this. BTW, my wife loves it, especially the crown cap.</li>
    <li> Great product. pleasure doing business with you.</li>
    <li> Nice size bottle, long lasting smell.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume so much.  Great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this perfume.  Bought her some last year and it just ran out before Christmas so ordered her another bottle.  She was thrilled.</li>
    <li> good quality, good service</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and was as described.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  Great savings.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, it smells wonderful! I always get so many compliments when I wear this perfume! And for a price you can&#x27;t beat anywhere!</li>
    <li> twice the price at other locations...</li>
    <li> Love this scent and i love amazon pricing!</li>
    <li> I got this for someone as a gift and they were so happy and loved the scent. It was packaged new and no problems with shipping or handling.</li>
    <li> You will feel like a princess ! I love this scent. Very fresh, floral and not too heavy. Not as mature as her other fragrances. This is something that I can wear every day and never tire of it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend because it&#x27;s her favorite. She has been wanting to get it but it was way too expensive in the store. The price was right and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of a floral sent. I can&#x27;t handle a strong smell because of sinus problems and this smells so wonderful</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume when you first spray it has a strong scent but then after it sits it smells soft I love it I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before for full price at a dept store and I can assure you this is the real thing. This size bottle is currently $75 at a major retailer. It&#x27;s a wonderful long lasting scent without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> I recommend this perfume to all women. When Vera Wang came out with this product I brought a small bottle. Loved it so much I bought another bottle. This is the larger size and I am enjoying it.</li>
    <li> the scent not strong at all, it seem to be watered down.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and fits right every year!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! I fell in love with the smell when my mom gave it to me. I have been looking for it and found it to be quite pricey, came on Amazon and saw that the price was half of what it is at my local mall.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived the packaging was nice and the smell was as great as I remember it to be.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great buy. :)</li>
    <li> Extremely dissatisfied!  Doesn&#x27;t smell like the original.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> smells so good.  still have it after months. worth the money</li>
    <li> Perfect. This is my favorite, great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My daughter  was very happy to receive this gift.  I had no problems ordering or receiving this  item.</li>
    <li> Not joking everyone that walks past me always says mms what&#x27;s that lol. Sooooo get it cause it smells great and lasts ALLLLLL DAY LONG!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent and when I can get it at a good price it is a win win for me</li>
    <li> When I finally got the perfume I was very happy. Then I sprayed it and it did&#x27;nt smell the same as when I had tested it before and loved it enough to buy it. Lets just say it grows on u and I usually like smells with a little sweetness in them, but this one is the least sweet of all of my perfumes. Let me tell you I have several at least 50 different sents mabe more. I am A perfume addict.  Anyway as the day went on I kept smelling it and it kept changing. Now I love it like I knew I did. It&#x27;s a must have and a great gift because I think it fits probably everybody older, and younger people. I would&#x27;nt expect a teen to like it , but u never know. Now I know what to gift woman when I am not sure. The only problem I had was this perfume took longer to get here than any others I have purchased. It was a little annoying to see it sitting at the same place for two whole days mabe longer. Ordering from amazon and the few others that I did it came in three to five days, but not this specific sender. Ohwell thats my only complaint and I guess since I love it. It was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> very happy with purchase!!</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing the perfume for years now and I love it. Its the perfect smell. And last long :) will buy more</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> Great value, package well for shipping. My wife&#x27;s favorite scent!</li>
    <li> My wife and my girlfriend both said they loved it. I gotta say, it smells good on them both.</li>
    <li> I really have used this perfume on &amp; off since my husband first purchased for me as a birthday present in 2006. I have also tried glam princess, rock princess, pink princess &amp; night princess. I have been happy with all but this, night &amp; pink princess seem to be my favorites ! I am over 40 &amp; I love this perfume!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for a long time and I&#x27;ve always loved it but refused to pay $50 for a small bottle in store. I went to by my mom perfume and thought to buy this since I already had free shipping. I was skeptical because I know a lot of perfumes so cheap from their store counterparts are fake or watered down.&lt;br /&gt;The first spray of this perfume on my skin I knew it wasn&#x27;t the perfume I&#x27;ve been wearing for years. I was really sad and debating if I should deal with the return or just use it because it didn&#x27;t smell that bad and would still be a perfume I would wear. But after I had the perfume on for an hour or so and started moving around the smell of the in store Vera Wang Princess perfume was noticeable and the smell straight out the bottle was gone. There is still something different (like the perfume smells sweeter than normal) but not so different that I would spend $50+ on the perfume in store.&lt;br /&gt;My perfume is the same light purple color of the perfume and the bottle is the same. The only thing I notice about the bottle is that the ring at the top of the bottle that makes the base of the princess crown came off with the top. But super glue can fix that, not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I am very picky when it comes to perfumes, I dont like anything harsh, or over powering, and alot of scents give me headaches. I bought this not knowing what it smells like, but the reviews are good, so I had to buy it. I&#x27;m glad I did! It smells very feminine and sexy! It&#x27;s sweet, but not super sweet. I can smell the vanilla and the chocolate in it. My boyfriend loves this smell. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> Smells just like the one in stores and is half of the price. I am not a perfume person but this perfume is just strong enough to last all day amd the scent in amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been out of this fragrance for a while. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed it until I smell it again! The tones are not heavy and it is a fresh smell. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought Vera Wang Princess for my wife a few years back from a local store. For any guy that&#x27;s tried buying perfume, it&#x27;s not an easy feat finding one that they will like. I lucked out however, my wife loves this perfume. The local store stopped carrying it, so then I had to start driving around to find it, nearest place is a good 45min drive away and they charge $78.00 for this. I&#x27;ve bought it there a couple times but decided to give a quick look on Amazon. Much to my surprise and delight, it&#x27;s here and almost half the price it is in the retail store. (and I don&#x27;t have a 1 1/2 h round trip to get it) I will definitely buy it from Amazon from now on. (I noticed there are a couple other versions on amazon too. Rock Princess, Night Princess, etc.. none of which I&#x27;ve seen in any store around here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Far cheaper than the local retail stores, almost half the price compared to my area.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It is one of the few sugary sweet fragrances I can tolerate, perhaps because it is so gentle. I think this is what a princess would actually smell like: fluffy, sugary candy, soft nectarines and sweet apples, creamy chocolate, and delicate florals lingering from the garden she walks through each morning. To me this feels like one of those cotton candy body sprays you&#x27;d buy at the drugstore as a young girl matured into it&#x27;s 20&#x27;s. It is sweet, gourmand, and girly, but also sophisticated and mature.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites scents.  I gave it to someone as a gift and she loves it too.  The scent is light and stays with you most of the day.  Also, the price is great.</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Not too strong.</li>
    <li> I would do the perfume an injustice if I tried to accurately describe it here, but it is one of those scents that gets better as the day wears on. I would recommend, if possible, to pop over to your local department store and try it on your own skin since everyone&#x27;s skin chemistry creates a slight variation in the perfume. I am actually very picky with my perfumes, and this is one you can wear to work or the evenings. It is a clean, classy scent. I often get compliments on how wonderful I smell but that it is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight hints of floral and vanilla. It is not overly floral at all. I love this perfume, and if it puts it in a context, I loved Escada&#x27;s Ibiza Hippie and Armani&#x27;s Diamonds.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this fragrance, I absolutely love it! I will buy this one again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> This made a great Christmas gift. It made my daughter happy, and that made me happy. Nice deal, would buy again.</li>
    <li> got this for christmas, this is a great smell, not too overpowering yet lasts all day.  i have enjoyed it</li>
    <li> This is by far the best perfeum ever. Smells like you just took a shower. It&#x27;s lightly sweet. It&#x27;s perfect. Every one asks me what I have on. My grandkids like to snuggle with me because they say I smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Xmas present, daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> It looks fabulous, smells elegant. my friend loves it!far exceed my expectation. Besides, the price is very good. Such a nice product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about perfume, but my wife loves this.  Really, that&#x27;s all I need to know.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell. Although it seemed cheap, it&#x27;s clearly authentic. I&#x27;ve bought this perfume from department stores before and I can&#x27;t tell any  difference. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift and kept it for myself!  ;)</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells amazing! Very quick service!</li>
    <li> This perfume has kind of been my &#x27;signature scent&#x27; for a few years now and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;ll be changing any time soon! Smells amazing, lasts a good amount of time, etc. What else can I say that hasn&#x27;t already been said? Great product.</li>
    <li> Perfect :-) shipped right on time and it&#x27;s the real deal for those of you wondering.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, sweet and tender, suitable for everyday wear, for evening and day-time also. Lasts for 4-5 hours. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have bought this 2x for my niece and she loves it!  I have never used it but I keep buying it for her because it&#x27;s her favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was very prompt and it was well packaged.</li>
    <li> I bought this directly from Amazon to make sure I was getting the real thing and this is it! Before getting this, I tried an &amp;#34;inspired by Princess&amp;#34; scent that was nice, but was missing the strength of the vanilla base.&lt;br /&gt;This became an instant favorite after a couple sprays. I wear it on my wrists, nape, and spread one more spray from behind my ears down to wear my necklaces usually fall near my collarbones. The fragrance lasts all day and plays nicely with the honey scented lotion I use. There is an excellent vanilla bottom note that gets more sensuous as the day goes on, but the top and middle notes linger for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day since I got it. My fiance and male friends love the way it smells on me, and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, the crown and jeweled band make for interesting novelty jewelry, though I keep mine perched on the bottle because I like the way everything looks together.</li>
    <li> She loves this perfume, it&#x27;s the only one that she likes the smell of.  It&#x27;s a reasonable price here on amazon considering how expensive some perfumes can be so if I had to give it a review based on her opinion then it would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> On time . New package. My favorite scent!!</li>
    <li> Despite some of the bad things said about ordering online, Vera Wang princess smells WONDERFUL! Makes me feel like a princess :0)</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Smell as expected.</li>
    <li> great scent but the bottle was cracked</li>
    <li> It smells AMAZING and last like forever. if your kind of girly and sweet it is perfect for you :)</li>
    <li> A great deal! Saved $10 buying online, shipped quickly, and it much larger than expected. It will make a great gift.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter this Christmas and she is thrilled. I paid half the price I would have if I had bought it at my local drug store.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this for Christmas, I was thrilled to be able to get this at a wonderful price and have it come well before Christmas.  So much easier that heading to the mall</li>
    <li> I loved it since I first saw it!! First of all , the bottle is just beautiful, but after I tried it on I loved it even more! It smells so fresh and elegant! I totally recomend this product</li>
    <li> yaaasss! I so love this scent! it&#x27;s fresh and sexy!</li>
    <li> very happy I get scared buying perfume off line but iam very happy with what I got</li>
    <li> I myself do not wear this perfume, but my girlfriend does and I love the smell of it. It has a very attractive scent too it, which is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> very good! thank you.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what my daughter wanted.  It came well packaged and she is happy with the scent.</li>
    <li> My signature go-to scent :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Love the smell &amp; price. One of my favs &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> My wife loved it.. Period. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Good stuff... my wife loved it</li>
    <li> A very refreshing fragrance. Price is good for the quantity. Loved it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents ever. It is always a &amp;#34;staple&amp;#34; in my perfume collections!</li>
    <li> Loved price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Smells exactly as it should. I don&#x27;t know where the reviewers from before say it smells like alcohol. Such a great deal for my favorite perfume. I haven&#x27;t purchased it for at least 5 years because of the price. Once I found this supplier, I was soo happy! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> perfume is being enjoyed right now, I have already referred this fragrance to several friends.  Everyone always asked me what am I wearing!</li>
    <li> arrived as expected and as ordered</li>
    <li> My wife loves the smell of this perfume. It has become one of her favorites. It is hard to describe the smell, but all I know is that it smells good on my wife. She also wears guilty gucci, rose the one, lancome midnight tresor, mademoiselle and a ton more, but if you have similar taste to those types of perfume then I think you will like this as well.</li>
    <li> Scent dosent last at all.  Have not smelled the ones in the store, but I am not sure if this is legit or not.... most of my perfumes last much longer...</li>
    <li> the scent didn&#x27;t last very long for the price it smells better in the lotion form and last a lot longer</li>
    <li> This is the real deal!  At $33.00, couldn&#x27;t beat the price!  My husband LOVES the smell, and I do too!  Delivery took about a week &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Cute packaging but smells cheap</li>
    <li> Normally I purchase this perfume (as my everyday scent) from the Ulta store,&lt;br /&gt;but decided to give it a shot on Amazon.com (a bit hesitant that it was not going&lt;br /&gt;to be the same as what I was used to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally shocked as it came within a few days ordering and was exactly what I expected&lt;br /&gt;for a fraction of what I pay at the Ulta store ~ Going to continue to buy from here ~ Why not, and SAVE!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter.  It&#x27;s smell good.  Not over powering.</li>
    <li> I think I thought this smelt a bit off when I first got it, really alcoholly but then I realized the perfume I had just finished had been around a while and as things age/breakdown the smell changes. Smells as it should now and matched the roller ball perfume I also have.  No complaints. I would recommend :)</li>
    <li> My favorite. Arrived fast.</li>
    <li> What a great price on this bottle of perfume. Now I know how department stores make their money. This bottle of perfume is $70.00 at kohl&#x27;s plus you get a much smaller bottle. I know the days of buying stuff tax free are going to end because I am sure congress will pass a bill so that online merchants will make us pay sales tax. But I will take advantage of this while I can. Great price and my wife loves the smell and I even have money left over to buy some fishing lures</li>
    <li> THIS SCENT IS SO CLEAN AND FRESH I GET TONS OF COMPLIMENTS &#x3D;D DEFINITELY GOING TO  BE ORDERING AGAIN!! IT&#x27;S PERFECT!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x60;t smell like i thought it would.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. I wear it daily.</li>
    <li> Great value! Smells terrific!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume as a gift for my sister and she loves it. It&#x27;s got a nice floral scent and pretty refreshing.</li>
    <li> Never know what perfume to by my wife without the chance to smell it. Read lots of reviews and this perfume passed both the female preference test as well as the hum-an-a hum-an-a can&#x27;t wait to get my wife home test for guys :)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances - I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It&#x27;s a light smell that lasts all day if you want it to. I generally apply a little bit at my ankles so It makes its way up my body all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my wifes Birthday. This product looks awesome on how it is made. It is unique in a heart shaped glass with a little crown as the top cover. It smells really good. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this exact same perfume at Sephora and in a smaller size for twice as much as it is here. From now on I&#x27;ll be going to Sephora to same and Amazon to buy.</li>
    <li> This is actually one of my favorite perfumes therefore I have nothing bad to say about it.  The scent lasts all day and I get compliments all the time on how I smell.</li>
    <li> this was a gift and the top broke off-very disappointing</li>
    <li> Sweet smell nice for everyday use!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a Monday and was delivered to my house 2 days later. Will order again and again. Very satisfied!!!!</li>
    <li> Great scent fulfilled quickly</li>
    <li> I read the reviews here and decided to take a risk, and it was definitely worth it!  The scent is just lovely, and I look forward to using it  daily once classes begin.  The perfume bottle is also super cute! The only problem is that it does wear off within a few hours, so it needs to be applied multiple times a day.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this scent. It&#x27;s not quite spicy, not quite floral, somewhere in between. It is a wonderful scent to put on for a night out. My husband compliments me every time I wear this. The crown on the top comes off and you get a pretty gold ring with pink crystals on it. It&#x27;s too big for me to wear, but if your into jewelry, I think it would make a fun addition to your collection.</li>
    <li> Nice and perfect for those special times!  Great packaging and a very good price.  Delivered on time.  No problems, whatsoever!!</li>
    <li> Always loved Vera Wang Princess perfume but this time my husband decided to buy it on Amazon since they had a good deal compare to any other store but I&#x27;m having second thoughts on this product if it&#x27;s Original or not...so far it smells great and you can&#x27;t beat that price.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely perfume for a great price!</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING!!!!!!! Great size bottle, great price, completely full, and box in good condition! I use to work at TJ maxx and I had the pink princess in 1.7floz and it was literally the same price.... I&#x27;d say I like both scents equally but I am not very picky with perfume. Definitely worth the money because it&#x27;s only 2-3 dollars more than 2.4 more ounces!</li>
    <li> Much lighter in fragrance than I am used to but it is okay.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> My favorite, so sad that it was discontinued.  Soft, sweet and delicate, LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Item deliver as promised in great condition.Thanks</li>
    <li> This scent is outstanding and lasts without being overbearing.</li>
    <li> I received the purfume. Well, 1.7 Oz of it. The description says 3.4 I belive. Kinda let down. Change the description  please it is very misleading.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived on time and as listed. Recommended seller.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this perfume. This is my new signature scent! It has a warm sweet and sort of chocolatey scent with a hint of florals. It also arrived fast and in perfect condition. I will definitely repurchase in the future...</li>
    <li> I love this scent, is so sensual</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. Great for any occasion! I would definitely recommend this perfume to anyone looking to try out a new scent.</li>
    <li> The perfume I received is not authentic or of very poor quality.  My wife has used this same perfume for many years and this bottle smells nothing like it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product came earlier than expected my gd loves it and she wants another one after she finishes this one.</li>
    <li> Looked high and low for best price for this perfume and this was the best price, pre-Christmas. Came just as expected,</li>
