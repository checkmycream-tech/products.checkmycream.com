    <li> MY WIFE LOVE IT SHE TRY IT IMMEDIATELY ON MY DAUGHTER THEY LOVE IT. REALLY WORTH YOUR MONEY TRY IT.</li>
    <li> I purchased this four months ago, and it is fabulous.  On the ionic setting, this thing gets HOT.  It does cut down drying time and you can adjust the height of it.  I can sit on my laptop at my desk while my hair dries, which I love.   My hair is relaxed, and I do not have the time to air dry anymore with my busy schedule.  This dryer allows me to preserve the health of my hair by not using the blow dryer.  My hair was shoulder length in January.  Now, it is creeping towards the middle of my back.    The only drawback seems to be storage.  It&#x27;s too big to fit in my closet, so I have to stand it in front of the wall which is not the most attractive interior decorating.  It is kind of pricey, but think of it as an investment.  Being beautiful takes sacrifices.</li>
    <li> I like the hair dryer.  It dries very well and the design is very modern and updated.  It is adjustable and it get really hot with and  it has a ionic straightener that helps your hair dry you hair straight.</li>
    <li> As far as I know so far this thing is better than anything my wife has tried before. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this Hair Dryer twice.  The dryer gets just as hot as the ones in the salon</li>
    <li> It is well priced.  It does an amazing job at drying hair.  The product performs as advertised. The only negative is the plastic base (legs) are not sturdy (strong, firm) enough to hold the weight of the entire equipment and they will tend to bend a litle.  Pity to build a nice product and have it downgraded because the cheap construction of the base.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get very hot at all</li>
    <li> I used to style my hair with brush ,blower and iron. Too much work and it was never too good. Now I half dry my hair then put self adhesive rollers go under it and in 20&#x27;  my hair is ready. Take the rollers off,a little blow with the hand dryer to even it and &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> The dryer was easy to assemble. Gets hot very quickly, and the cord is long enough for me to move around with ease. Sometimes it does feel a little bit top heavy, but overall it&#x27;s a great dryer!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dryer! It gets really hot on the highest setting which I prefer using because it will dry my hair faster. I like that it is adjustable and you can get a chair and slide it right over. Overall, it did the job of drying my hair and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer for my mother, but it did not last long.  Not a good buy.</li>
    <li> Loud and cumbersome, the head part of the dryer falls off the base to easily. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Are they available at france? Because i want this but i don&#x27;t know if i can used this hood dryer in france ..</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift in 2013 and LOVE IT!!!!  easy to assemble, not really loud, and super convenient because you can set it up any where in the house.  not restricted to sitting at a table to get your hair done.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer at the recommendation of my stylist.  I have THICK, curly hair that takes hours to dry.  I let my hair air-dry because conventional blowdryers (even with a diffuser) only add frizz and uncurl my spiral curls.  Having a wet head for hours in the winter is uncomfortable.  This dryer is fabulous.  I can dry my hair while working at my home office.  The results have been terrific.  I read the other reviews before purchasing, and use the pole and casters to move it to the appropriate spot.  So far, so good.</li>

It&#x27;s now being held on with zip-ties.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money!!!! I had to purchase another dryer and I didn&#x27;t own this one for a year. The heating isn&#x27;t even it only heats and the very top of my head where the back and sides are still damp after sitting under the dryer for over an hour. Poor quality don&#x27;t recommend this dryer at all.</li>
