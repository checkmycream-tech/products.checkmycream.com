      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and if you&#x27;re the same, or even if you aren&#x27;t, this is a wonderful soap!</li>
      <li>Enjoyed the coconut soap.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s interesting that this is called a soap, rather than a cleanser.</li>
      <li>You could also add some essential oils to it for a great aroma!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
      <li>note when you go to pour that it flows very quickly.</li>
      <li>I use the unscented which is especially pure.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled that this is almost exactly what I had been using.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately my soap dispenser is screwed onto my sink...</li>
      <li>A great way to eliminate harmful chemicals almost always found in soaps and replacing them with one product with multiple uses.  </li>
      <li>This is perfect and you don&#x27;t feel dried out after using.</li>
      <li>I wish it was available in a concentrated form</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great liquid soap, very pure, totally fragrance free.</li>
      <li>It gets your hands really clean without drying them out.  </li>
      <li>The soap is mild and pure--it can be diluted and put into a foaming dispenser.</li>
      <li>Great clean product and one of the few without the chemicals and zeno estrogens which can disrupt hormones and wreak havoc with women who are already suffering from estrogen dominance.  </li>
      <li>Seems to stay fresh indefinitely.</li>
      <li>I keep it in the shower and spray it directly on makes it quick and easy to apply and no waste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This soap, which I use in a foaming lather dispenser, is just right.  </li>
      <li>it runs right through their fingers, so they try again and again...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mild and completely unscented.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s uncented and very gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t begin to guess how many different things I have tried and broke out from.  </li>
      <li>My hands look ten times better</li>
      <li>I almost love this soap and the reason I don&#x27;t is likely just me.</li>
      <li>leaves skin soft and clean feeling.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pure with no chemicals added.  </li>
      <li>But it does produce a lot of lather and cleans very well.</li>
      <li>After much searching for soap that didn&#x27;t give my skin rashes, a friend gave me a sample bottle of Nutribiotic Soap.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this soap for head to toe cleansing!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m outside for hours in the winter most days (as a ski instructor) and it does not make my skin sensitive or flaky.</li>
      <li>you like clean simple productive without all those ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce this is one for you!  </li>
      <li>Its a very watery soap, not nearly as thick as Dr. Bronner.</li>
      <li>but it lathers good and pumps from dispensers with a little orange essential oil</li>
      <li>The only thing I am not crazy about is how runny it is.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Natural soap without chemical additives!</li>
      <li>When I read the label and saw how pure and simple the ingredients were I was hopeful.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and this stuff helps a lot.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and a sensitive nose</li>
      <li>your skin is extra sensitive consider using Nutribiotic Nonsoap Skin Cleanser which is a completely neutral skin cleanser.</li>
      <li>It lathers up quickly and lots of fluffy bubbles.  </li>
      <li>Its very watery BUT a little bit lathers up enough to wash your whole body.</li>
      <li>it leaves absolutely no residue and comes off very cleanly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this soam because it is non irritating.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance and so many other common things for sensitive skin.  </li>

<li> I have very sensitive, dry skin and allergies.  </li>
<li> This is clearly not a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; in the traditional sense.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this soap for several years.  </li>
<li> It is very neutral and has very little odor</li>

<li> Very thin and requires only a FEW DROPS to have a satisfying hand washing.  </li>

<li> My little ones (ages 3 and 5) have a hard time getting soap on their hands..</li>
<li> A small amount lathers well.  </li>

    <li> Enjoyed the coconut soap.  It lathers up quickly and lots of fluffy bubbles.  Use it on hair, face, and body.  Stings slightly in intimate area, but otherwise wonderful!  Will order product again just won&#x27;t use it on my puka nani anymore.</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own hand soap refills for a foaming hand soap pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;Recipe:&lt;br /&gt;1/2 Coconut Oil Soap&lt;br /&gt;1/2 Filtered Water&lt;br /&gt; + Secret Ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Ingredient for keeping skin hydrated instead of drying out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food Grade Vegetable Glycerin:  ~2 tsp per 10oz soap dispenser container.</li>
    <li> Its a very watery soap, not nearly as thick as Dr. Bronner. And it&#x27;s not very fragrant, I can hardly smell the coconut oil. But it does produce a lot of lather and cleans very well.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so, glad when I found this product.  I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance and so many other common things for sensitive skin.  I was so happy I came across this product! It&#x27;s been a godsend.  My skin was getting so hyper-sensitive that I was desperate for a soap that I could use.  I can&#x27;t begin to guess how many different things I have tried and broke out from.  When I read the label and saw how pure and simple the ingredients were I was hopeful.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over three years  with no problems - it&#x27;s one thing I can count on!&lt;br /&gt;For those of you out there that commented it was too watery making it wasteful when poring it, here is my secret use a small 4 - 8 oz spray bottle I keep it in the shower and spray it directly on makes it quick and easy to apply and no waste.&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate when my health food store stopped carrying it, thankfully Amazon had it and at a great price, wish I thought of them sooner!&lt;br /&gt;If you like clean simple productive without all those ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce this is one for you!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizing soap.  I use it three times per day and my skin does not dry out.  It&#x27;s mild, unscented, and leaves my skin feeling great.  I&#x27;m outside for hours in the winter most days (as a ski instructor) and it does not make my skin sensitive or flaky.</li>
    <li> I do appreciate that this soap has little to no scent.  The only thing I am not crazy about is how runny it is.  It is llike water.  My little ones (ages 3 and 5) have a hard time getting soap on their hands..it runs right through their fingers, so they try again and again...wasting an awful lot of soap.  Fortunately my soap dispenser is screwed onto my sink...because if it was off to the side of the sink, there would be a puddle of soap on the floor.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product! Natural and works great! leaves skin soft and clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I am not able to use soap with scents or dyes.  This is perfect and you don&#x27;t feel dried out after using.</li>
    <li> Great clean product and one of the few without the chemicals and zeno estrogens which can disrupt hormones and wreak havoc with women who are already suffering from estrogen dominance.  It is a great hand and body soap, dishwashing liquid and even laundry detergent.  A great way to eliminate harmful chemicals almost always found in soaps and replacing them with one product with multiple uses.  I use the unscented which is especially pure.</li>
    <li> I always struggled with dry hands after doing the dishes or cleaning the house. Not with this soap! It&#x27;s very mild and completely unscented. Great soap for any cleaning needs.</li>
    <li> I love this soam because it is non irritating. Its very watery BUT a little bit lathers up enough to wash your whole body. It&#x27;s uncented and very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap for sensitive skin!  I highly recommend this soap for head to toe cleansing!  Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> The caption says it all. It&#x27;s a great liquid soap, very pure, totally fragrance free. No unneeded additives of any kind. Seems to stay fresh indefinitely. It&#x27;s a very thin liquid, not as thickly concentrated as some, so note when you go to pour that it flows very quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great - love it!  I put it in one of those soap bottles that has a sudsing pump and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> We love this at my house and it is in dispensers at every sink.  Very thin and requires only a FEW DROPS to have a satisfying hand washing.  No smelly perfume either.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I wish it was available in a concentrated form but it&#x27;s still the best thing I&#x27;ve found.  It is very neutral and has very little odor and no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no moisturizers so expect it to dry out your skin if not using any else.  that&#x27;s what i like about it though.  it leaves absolutely no residue and comes off very cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it doesn&#x27;t have any glycerin in it it is quite thin- I&#x27;ve found a foaming soap dispenser works the best- then a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my body, my face and my hair.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for many people for all applications because it has no moisturizers.  My hair is very short so it doesn&#x27;t need any conditioners. I always moisturize heavily immediately after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is extra sensitive consider using Nutribiotic Nonsoap Skin Cleanser which is a completely neutral skin cleanser.</li>
    <li> A small amount lathers well.  Lather lasts.  Nice feel on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is a liquid, with no thickness.  Care needs to be taken to not spill it! I once lost quite a bit of soap when the dispenser fell over. I&#x27;ve thought of adding some agar sea vegetable to it to thicken it.  It&#x27;s interesting that this is called a soap, rather than a cleanser. I&#x27;ve avoided soaps for years because of allergies.  This is clearly not a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; in the traditional sense.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this soap for several years.  I have very sensitive, dry skin and allergies.  This is the best cleanser I have found.</li>
    <li> I wanted to stop using the drying, antibacterial soaps I&#x27;d used for years.  My skin looked terrible, dry and flaky hands.  This soap, which I use in a foaming lather dispenser, is just right.  My hands look ten times better and I don&#x27;t use lotions anymore!  It gets your hands really clean without drying them out.  I also really appreciate unscented aspect as I find the scented soap varieties disgusting.  I have sensitive skin and a sensitive nose and if you&#x27;re the same, or even if you aren&#x27;t, this is a wonderful soap!</li>
    <li> Makes great foaming soap.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner afterward even though I have thick, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> After much searching for soap that didn&#x27;t give my skin rashes, a friend gave me a sample bottle of Nutribiotic Soap. Finally, a natural product that lathers well and cleans without irritating side effects.</li>
    <li> I had gotten some liquid coconut oil soap from another manufacturer, but it was very expensive.  I was thrilled that this is almost exactly what I had been using.  I use mine in a &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; dispenser, that way there is no &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; to waste!  You could also add some essential oils to it for a great aroma!</li>
    <li> Love this soap! I use it for hand wash, body wash and to wash my hair. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Natural soap without chemical additives! It lasts forever with a little water in a foaming soap dispenser.</li>
    <li> The soap is mild and pure--it can be diluted and put into a foaming dispenser. My wife and I love it.</li>
    <li> I almost love this soap and the reason I don&#x27;t is likely just me. I have gotten used to thick soaps and this is a very thin soap almost like water but it lathers good and pumps from dispensers with a little orange essential oil it is very nice.</li>
    <li> Works well with essential oils.  No need to dilute. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue so it makes a great skin cleanser.</li>
    <li> I will never use another soap product on my skin again! This is the best!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Great value and great soap</li>
    <li> Love this product. Will not use any other soap.  It&#x27;s pure with no chemicals added.  Can&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have sensitive skin, and this stuff helps a lot.</li>
