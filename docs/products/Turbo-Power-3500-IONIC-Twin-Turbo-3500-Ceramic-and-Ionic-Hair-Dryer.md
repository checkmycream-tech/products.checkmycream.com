      <li>Love it, so easy to handle</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as I would&#x27;ve hoped for.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use it on high heat and low speed for you fine haired girls, it will just make the process of drying your hair quicker with great results!</li>
      <li>It is a good hair dryer, has a good size and gets enough hot.</li>
      <li>The best hair dryer I have ever owned, and I went through a few:</li>
      <li>It is very powerful and not too</li>
      <li>This is a very powerful blowdryer, it came before the estimated delivery date.  </li>
      <li>no longer dread the hair drying process since I know that I will be pleased with the results without too much effort.</li>
      <li>It is ideal for anyone, if you are straightening  curly, thick hair or have fine hair.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn the hair and the dryer itself is very well made and strong.  </li>
      <li>It makes styling my hair so much easier!!</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair that is very prone to frizz.</li>
      <li>The Turbo Power is light weight and it is quieter, but it is suppose to cut drying time and really does not, as it does not get as hot!</li>
      <li>This dryer is fast and light weight.</li>
      <li>Hope you enjoy your as much as I do mine.</li>
      <li>It is so powerful the electric switch pops if I have anything else on that circuit.</li>
      <li>So if anyone is contemplating a leap from mass-market brand hair dryers to upscale ones, it is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>3500IONIC Twin Turbo is without a doubt worth the money.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
      <li>Overall I think TwinTurbo products especially their blowdryers are really good buys!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really helped with that winter static electricity, which is the main reason I got it.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough compared to my old hairdryer, but it is very effective.  </li>
      <li>I have been using a hair dryer for over 35 years and have gone through most brands and types and by far this is the very best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>YES, I like it that much!  </li>
      <li>This is because it really blows a lot of air at a powerful burst.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
      <li>If it broke today, I would be willing to pay twice as much to replace it.  </li>
      <li>I love the different settings it offers, and it puts out a lot of heat but is still very gentle on my hair.</li>
      <li>Really like the size of it.  </li>
      <li>Blowdrying your hair with this blowdryer using that brush leaves a really straight and sleek look.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it dries fast and does what its supposed to do</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so different from those cheap things you get at Walmart.</li>
      <li>Its really little and so light but extremely powerful!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it should be a little more durable.</li>
      <li>It also does not have the annoying whine sound most dryers produce, this model is more of a hum.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful hair dryer, would highly recommend it .. dried my thick hair in 15mins!  </li>
      <li>This dryer made it almost as smooth as a professional blowout, in half the time, and I don&#x27;t need to use the hot air brush finishing tool.  </li>
      <li>It does have more power so it will pop breakers if your fuses are not a high enough capacity though that is no fault of the dryer-</li>
      <li>I was using a ConAir Infiniti and finishing with a ConAir hot air brush as a final smoothing tool.  </li>
      <li>it clearly states the wattage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a professional hair stylist for about 20 years.  </li>
      <li>I used it for home purpose only and just for me, so I didn&#x27;t give it as much use as in a professional salon, and this is suposed to be a professional hair dryer..</li>
      <li>I turned it off and finished drying my hair with my old ConairPro.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what the difference is, but my hair is not full of static or flat like it sometimes would be with the old one.</li>
      <li>If I had to guess I would say its dries maybe 25 to 30 % faster than my old conair 1800.</li>
      <li>If you want a really straight look, I would suggest also purchasing the Denman paddle brush (the big one).</li>
      <li>I have used just about every professional dryer that exists.  </li>
      <li>Nothing even comes close for me and if I use any other kind of dryer, my hair is a frizzy mess.  </li>
      <li>Now, I haven&#x27;t compared this dryer against the Sedu or the Harry Josh or any other upscale dryer, but I will tell you it is significantly better than a ConAir, Revlon (which I&#x27;ve also used) or any other mass-market brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would definitley recommend this blowdryer to a friend, but would advise to be careful because it can get really hot.</li>
      <li>Hope it is long lasting since the price is pretty high, but even if it only makes it a year, I would buy another one.</li>
      <li>I do have pretty short hair, but I can dry my hair in about two minutes now rather than the 6 with my old &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; quality dryer.</li>
      <li>too powerful and also a bit too heavy for the price.</li>
      <li>The cord is very thick and is a bit much to travel with and even put away in a cabinet, but for me it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>It takes the same time to dry my hair as my old Bluebird by ConairPro, which I bought around 1998!</li>
      <li>This one dries my thick curly hair quickly without any fear of damage.</li>
      <li>I find if I dry my hair with the dryer right on it for a few seconds it gets hotter.  </li>

<li> included)&lt;br /&gt;-highly flexible 3m long cable&lt;br /&gt;-ceramic &amp; ionic edition</li>
<li> do wish there were options for half-star ratings, because the two downsides of this dryer are that the cord is very unwieldy, and also it&#x27;s hard to turn the nozzle if you need a different angle to blow the other side of your head.  </li>
<li> On the other side, it is true that the nozzle is falling off very often, and the bad review is that it only lasted 1.5 years .</li>
<li> Other dryers before I had TwinTurbo lasted only about 4-6 months.  </li>
<li> for the money I spent on it, I would have expected it to last longer.</li>
<li> The mouthpiece is a little bigger than the previous models so the air flow is not concentrated making it a little harder to blowdry the hair straight.</li>
<li> I have only had this Twin Turbo dryer for less than two weeks, and I am hooked.</li>
<li> Feels like a solid build and heavy duty switches and cord.</li>
<li> I have long thick hair and it has cut my blowdrying time about 15 mins (used to be a total of 30-35 mins).</li>
<li> I have naturally blond (and thus thin) hair, but I have a lot of it.</li>
<li> This dryer helps give my hair volume and does not weigh it down at all, plus it helps minimize frizz.</li>

    <li> This is a very powerful blowdryer, it came before the estimated delivery date.  I would definitley recommend this blowdryer to a friend, but would advise to be careful because it can get really hot. I&#x27;m happy I purchased this twin turbo blow dryer!</li>
    <li> keep blowing the power out !!! in each apartment i go too. too powerful and also a bit too heavy for the price.</li>
    <li> This dryer is fast and light weight. If I had to guess I would say its dries maybe 25 to 30 % faster than my old conair 1800. Feels like a solid build and heavy duty switches and cord. Nice and compact size. It does have more power so it will pop breakers if your fuses are not a high enough capacity though that is no fault of the dryer- it clearly states the wattage.</li>
    <li> I have been a hairdresser for almost fifteen years and have used this brand for about ten. This is by far the best blow dryer in terms of weight, size and most importantly performance. It is ideal for anyone, if you are straightening  curly, thick hair or have fine hair. Make sure to use it on high heat and low speed for you fine haired girls, it will just make the process of drying your hair quicker with great results! Treat your dryer with care (do not allow it to fall on the floor) and it will last you forever!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I have ever owned.  Dries my hair in about 60 seconds.  My wife is half Syrian and half Italian and has extremely thick hair and this is the only dryer she will use.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to order this blowdryer given how expensive it is but it&#x27;s really a great blowdryer and worth the money. Its really little and so light but extremely powerful! I have long thick hair and it has cut my blowdrying time about 15 mins (used to be a total of 30-35 mins). If you want a really straight look, I would suggest also purchasing the Denman paddle brush (the big one). Blowdrying your hair with this blowdryer using that brush leaves a really straight and sleek look. I love it! Overall I think TwinTurbo products especially their blowdryers are really good buys!</li>
    <li> This is the dryer my hair stylist uses, so I decided to buy one.  I absolutely love it.  It DOES dry my hair in half the time of my old dryer (a cheap-o conair).  This is because it really blows a lot of air at a powerful burst.  It also does not have the annoying whine sound most dryers produce, this model is more of a hum.  Here are the specs written on the box:&lt;br /&gt;-output: 2000 watts&lt;br /&gt;-airflow: 73 cubic meters/hours&lt;br /&gt;-motor:  K-Lamination -watt 120&lt;br /&gt;  18mm brushes - life 2000 hours&lt;br /&gt;-motor fan electronic balancing&lt;br /&gt;-12x16 amp switches - solid silver contacts&lt;br /&gt;-2 speed, 4 temperature settings&lt;br /&gt;-microswitch operated instant cold air&lt;br /&gt;-built in nickel chrome heating elements and safety thermostat&lt;br /&gt;-air gap thermal insulation&lt;br /&gt;-two unbreakable nozzles (included)&lt;br /&gt;-highly flexible 3m long cable&lt;br /&gt;-ceramic &amp; ionic edition&lt;br /&gt;-Made in Italy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is much more healthy looking, even after just a week of use.  I highly recommend this hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE****2/2014 ---still use this hair dryer after every shower and still love it.  I hate to use dryers at hotels and friend&#x27;s homes because I have become a complete hair-dryer snob by using this exceptional tool.  Nothing even comes close for me and if I use any other kind of dryer, my hair is a frizzy mess.  All dryers are NOT created equal....If it broke today, I would be willing to pay twice as much to replace it.  YES, I like it that much!  :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair dryer, would highly recommend it .. dried my thick hair in 15mins!  Check out this link and follow me for skin care tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> For years, I was skeptical about whether a fancy expensive hair dryer really made a difference.  I was using a ConAir Infiniti and finishing with a ConAir hot air brush as a final smoothing tool.  My hairdresser recommended this dryer, and after having used it twice now (once on a pouring, humid day), I will 100% vouch for the fact that it DOES make a WORLD of difference!!  I have fine, curly hair that is very prone to frizz. This dryer made it almost as smooth as a professional blowout, in half the time, and I don&#x27;t need to use the hot air brush finishing tool.  So if anyone is contemplating a leap from mass-market brand hair dryers to upscale ones, it is worth the money.  Now, I haven&#x27;t compared this dryer against the Sedu or the Harry Josh or any other upscale dryer, but I will tell you it is significantly better than a ConAir, Revlon (which I&#x27;ve also used) or any other mass-market brand.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish there were options for half-star ratings, because the two downsides of this dryer are that the cord is very unwieldy, and also it&#x27;s hard to turn the nozzle if you need a different angle to blow the other side of your head.  Otherwise, a brilliant device.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as I would&#x27;ve hoped for. It is lightweight and I do recommend it for a beginner. The mouthpiece is a little bigger than the previous models so the air flow is not concentrated making it a little harder to blowdry the hair straight.</li>
    <li> Love it, so easy to handle and it comes with an extra nozzle. I&#x27;ve owned a lot of expensive salon-quality hair dryers. This one dries my thick curly hair quickly without any fear of damage.</li>
    <li> It is a good hair dryer, has a good size and gets enough hot. I was very pleased with that. On the other side, it is true that the nozzle is falling off very often, and the bad review is that it only lasted 1.5 years . I used it for home purpose only and just for me, so I didn&#x27;t give it as much use as in a professional salon, and this is suposed to be a professional hair dryer.. for the money I spent on it, I would have expected it to last longer. It just stopped working one day.. and it was dead. I will reconsider spending again on this pricey model. Ths is the reason why I don&#x27;t give it 4 or 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I do have pretty short hair, but I can dry my hair in about two minutes now rather than the 6 with my old &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; quality dryer. I&#x27;ve been using this one about a month. I don&#x27;t know what the difference is, but my hair is not full of static or flat like it sometimes would be with the old one. Hope it is long lasting since the price is pretty high, but even if it only makes it a year, I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> I ordered the twin turbo 3500 in may 2012 and it was a great hair dryer for 5 months. It slipped out of my hand while I was using it and broke. I think it should be a little more durable.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely happy with my purchase of the Turbo Power 3500IONIC Ceramic and Ionic Hair Dryer. Wish I had done this years ago. I have been using a hair dryer for over 35 years and have gone through most brands and types and by far this is the very best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, curly, wavy hair and this dryer does what it says it will do. It dries my hair in significantly less time and I need/use less hair product. It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and smooth. It does not raise the hair shaft and it definitely does not heat my hair so that I see smoke. I go over one piece of hair once and don&#x27;t need to go over it again and again until I get the result I want. It definitely reduces the frizzies, a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3500IONIC Twin Turbo is without a doubt worth the money. It&#x27;s not even that expensive and remember you save on hair product. It is very powerful and not too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer dread the hair drying process since I know that I will be pleased with the results without too much effort. Hope you enjoy your as much as I do mine.</li>
    <li> I have really long, thick hair and I love this dryer.... I have had it a year so far and its the BEST dryer I have ever used. No problems to date.... I was on here reviewing a product that I didnt like and saw the request for this review!!! GREAT STUFF</li>
    <li> In the last two years I have gone through two CHI dryers. Within one year each of the heating components stopped working. Needless to say I will NEVER purchase another CHI dyer, so I did some research on other dryers. I have only had this Twin Turbo dryer for less than two weeks, and I am hooked. I love the different settings it offers, and it puts out a lot of heat but is still very gentle on my hair. I have naturally blond (and thus thin) hair, but I have a lot of it. This dryer helps give my hair volume and does not weigh it down at all, plus it helps minimize frizz. I would recommend this dryer to anyone! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It does not work as it should. It takes the same time to dry my hair as my old Bluebird by ConairPro, which I bought around 1998! The Turbo Power is light weight and it is quieter, but it is suppose to cut drying time and really does not, as it does not get as hot! I have used it about 5 times and the last time I used it I turned it off and finished drying my hair with my old ConairPro.</li>
    <li> i use it at work everyday and i havent had any problems with it yet.&lt;br /&gt;it dries fast and does what its supposed to do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one flaw: wish the cord was a lot longer</li>
    <li> This blow dryer works well, is quiet and has a commercial electrical plug!  My only disappointment with this product is the weight. I find it hard to use because it&#x27;s so heavy.</li>
    <li> This dryer makes such a difference when blowing out my hair.  It makes styling my hair so much easier!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional hair stylist for about 20 years.  I&#x27;ve worked in salons and work on photoshoots around the world.  I have used just about every professional dryer that exists.  This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn the hair and the dryer itself is very well made and strong.  I recently had to replace my other TwinTurbo after 2 years of every day use and different electricity connections around the world.  Other dryers before I had TwinTurbo lasted only about 4-6 months.  I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
    <li> I have been using the TwinTurbo 3500 Ceramic and Ionic Hair Dryer for 1-2 months now.  My hair has never been easier to style, and it comes out looking great every time.  It didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough compared to my old hairdryer, but it is very effective.  I find if I dry my hair with the dryer right on it for a few seconds it gets hotter.  Definitely recommend this hair dryer if you want to step up from the drug store brands.</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer I have ever owned, and I went through a few: elchim, solia and the like. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> wife loves it, if she is happy I am happy&lt;br /&gt;she knows her hair dryers&lt;br /&gt;she swims Mon - Wed and Fri, year round for the past 20 years</li>
    <li> It is so powerful the electric switch pops if I have anything else on that circuit. It looks like a power tool. But it is a powerhouse!</li>
    <li> I almost couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay a hundred forty dollars for a hair dryer, but I did it and I am thrilled with this purchase. It&#x27;s so different from those cheap things you get at Walmart. Night and day. My hair feels healthier, dries faster without drying out, and it the unit feels so well made I know it will last for years. It&#x27;s really helped with that winter static electricity, which is the main reason I got it. I love it!</li>
    <li> Really like the size of it.  You can hold your hand closer to your head. I have thick hair and this gets the job done; probably cutting 5 minutes off my dry time from my previous drier.  The cord is very thick and is a bit much to travel with and even put away in a cabinet, but for me it&#x27;s worth it.  I have no worries about this one breaking.</li>
    <li> Works great and my hair looks great!!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Best investment ive made in a blow dryer!</li>
