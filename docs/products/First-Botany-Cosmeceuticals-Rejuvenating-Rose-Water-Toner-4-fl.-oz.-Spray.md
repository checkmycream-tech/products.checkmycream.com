      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I was able to try out First Botany Cosmeceuticals Rejuvenating Rose Water.</li>
      <li>I have used rose water as a facial spray for many years and this is so nice!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used different brands of rose water before and loved the results.</li>
      <li>My first is Youniques rose water.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
      <li>I tested this out for free in return</li>
      <li>Rose water is a gentle smell with a cooling aspect to the skin.</li>
      <li>I had a light sunburn</li>
      <li>Its fantastic.</li>
      <li>I love to use this right before I get into bed.</li>
      <li>With First Botany Rose Water Toner I can make cleaning my face fun and quick.</li>
      <li>Your Rose Water is lovely it simply isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>This is my second favorite rose water that I have tried.</li>
      <li>The claims are true.</li>
      <li>I am an avid toner user!</li>
      <li>This is such a multipurpose product and I love it!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what rose toner was but thought it would be fun to test and try something new.</li>
      <li>I really like that the sprayer itself puts out a fine mist of the product.</li>
      <li>It’s excellent for skin and leaves a very delicate scent in my hair.</li>
      <li>I was definitely looking forward to the opportunity to review this Rose Water by First Botany.</li>
      <li>So, I was exited to try the First Botany</li>
      <li>I heard it was good for itching, so I sprayed a few mosquito bites I had on my foot as soon as I opened it.</li>
      <li>but it seems to have more of a lasting effect than other rose water sprays I have used.  </li>
      <li>It has a little extra something which makes it not only smell great and feel nice</li>
      <li>and I actually liked the sprayer vs a dropper like other products.</li>
      <li>since I have really sensitive skin and most products either don&#x27;t do anything at all or completely wreak havoc.</li>
      <li>and I love that it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;*I got this product discounted, but I would definitely order again at full price!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s replaced all of my refreshing face mists, and this one has multiple benefits that most the other brands don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot.</li>
      <li>I recently came across this rose water facial toner</li>
      <li>It is nice prior to moisturizer, as a mid day pick me up and just after make up application to set my make up.</li>
      <li>I used a bit in my hair for a little extra shine, being a red head they say rose hip oil and rose water bring out the natural tones and highlights.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the way it smells too,  it totally transported me back to gardening with my mom which added a soothing factor to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used so many spray beauty products that the nozzle shoots heavy droplets; who needs that?</li>
      <li>These are mild ingredients that are recommended for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, it also uses Phenoxyethanol and Tetrasodium EDTA which are a stabilizer and preservative respectively.</li>
      <li>Now back to the review, I love the Luxurious Cosmetic line that you are striving to become, but more luxury items mean I will no longer be in the same atmosphere.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I was able to try out First Botany Cosmeceuticals Rejuvenating Rose Water. The rose water makes a great toner for your skin.The toner is very refreshing and it feels light. There was an internal seal under the cap. After attaching the spray nozzle so that I  can spray it directly on my face. You don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot. The aroma smelled of a rose garden. The aroma stayed on my skin and I don&#x27;t mind, because I love the smell of roses</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! it&#x27;s replaced all of my refreshing face mists, and this one has multiple benefits that most the other brands don&#x27;t offer!&lt;br /&gt;i received this for review</li>
    <li> After I shower or wash my face I was told it was very important to apply a Toner to restore the Ph Balance, hydrate, and rejuvenate your face.  If your face is too dry or tight like a fist, add Red Rose Water Toner, but only US Roses because the FDA approved them, true or false who knows.  Now back to the review, I love the Luxurious Cosmetic line that you are striving to become, but more luxury items mean I will no longer be in the same atmosphere.  My Toner is strictly used for the reasons I mentioned above and doesn&#x27;t have a smell because I (women in general) tend to layer themselves with deodorant, other makeup smells, perfume, mouthwash, coffee out the door, and the list could continue.  Your Rose Water is lovely it simply isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I received thia product in return my my honest opinion. Id like to say that I am in love with this product. Makes my skin feel smooth. Not oily either. This product comes with a spray cap, so I must the air in front of my face to apply it and pat it in. Works great. Thank you!</li>
    <li> *Disclaimer - I received these at a promotional price.  I have used rose water as a facial spray for many years and this is so nice!  It has a little extra something which makes it not only smell great and feel nice but it seems to have more of a lasting effect than other rose water sprays I have used.  It is nice prior to moisturizer, as a mid day pick me up and just after make up application to set my make up.</li>
    <li> This Rose Water by First Botany Cosmeceuticals is remarkably versatile! I was definitely looking forward to the opportunity to review this Rose Water by First Botany. The face toner and its anti-inflammatory properties make it soothing for dry skin. Mix with argan oil for a homemade makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;As a Hair Rinse - I incorporate rosewater into my beauty regimen is to use it as a hair rinse (I usually do 2 Tablespoons per 1 cup of water). After I shampoo and condition my hair, I thoroughly rinse and then follow up with the rosewater mix. It’s excellent for skin and leaves a very delicate scent in my hair. Then as a body treatment I will use it for rose scented bath at the end of a long day is the best antidote to stress.&lt;br /&gt;I also will use is to scent our bedsheets and in our oil infuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle comes with a sprayer and a dropper. So convenient to use!</li>
    <li> What can I say that hasn&#x27;t already been said? The claims are true. I tested out my Rose water toner and I love it! It works like my old toner (cover girl) used to, without drying my skin out. I had a light sunburn so I sprayed a bit on it and it feels much better than before, and no sticky left behind like with aloe vera. I love the smell, rose water is lovely and relaxing. I used a bit in my hair for a little extra shine, being a red head they say rose hip oil and rose water bring out the natural tones and highlights. I like that it&#x27;s 87% organic, I would love to see it go 100% organic. A lovely product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE (TO TRY) AND REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
    <li> Rose water has so many benefits and uses. I personally love use this product  after cleansing. It does a great job at toning, moisturizing, its great for acne, you can use this on your hair. Also, after you are done with your make up uou can spray it for a dewey look! Its fantastic. Im obsessed. I will always keep a bottle of this on my vanity! Its also 82% organic! I also notice after i use this my skin is much more supple and glowy. Give it a shot you&#x27;ll love it!! These are my honest opinions for trying this awesome product!!</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing! It comes with a spray top. The mist is light but has great coverage. Rose water is a gentle smell with a cooling aspect to the skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE rose water! It has so many benefits from being used as a toner,cleanser, makeup setting spray, and it works wonders on sun burns and mosquito bites. I have tried several before and this is only the second one that I have tried that actually came with a misting spray top. This is my second favorite rose water that I have tried. My first is Youniques rose water. It has gentle rose scent that is pleasant to the senses. I have yet to try it as a hair care regimen, but I have heard that it works great for that also. This is definitely a product that you want to have around the house due to it is so versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I recently came across this rose water facial toner and I LOVE it!! I have very, very sensitive skin and have to be careful with products that I put on my face. This toner is amazing - I can tell that it&#x27;s hydrating my skin just from the week or so that I&#x27;ve been using it. I use it in my morning routine after washing my face and before moisturizer, although I&#x27;m finding now that I don&#x27;t need as much face lotion, my skin is happy with the freshness it&#x27;s getting from the toner! It also seems to make my skin a little brighter or glow-y! I love to use it during the day as well as a makeup refresher - and the smell, well it&#x27;s heavenly! I really like that the sprayer itself puts out a fine mist of the product. I&#x27;ve used so many spray beauty products that the nozzle shoots heavy droplets; who needs that? This is a new favorite now in my skincare routine, I&#x27;ve also started spritzing my hair with it some to help with the shine and giving my hair some awesome scented love as well.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I received this bottle at a promotional discount, my thoughts on the product are not swayed by that fact. I can honestly say this is a wonderful spray and I wish I&#x27;d found it sooner! I will be buying more when this runs out ... and at the rate I&#x27;m using it, I should probably buy stock in the company!</li>
    <li> I like it so far. It makes my face feel so soft, and I find myself spraying a little mid day to refresh n moisturize.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what rose toner was but thought it would be fun to test and try something new. I was a bit skeptical since I have really sensitive skin and most products either don&#x27;t do anything at all or completely wreak havoc. I was really happy to find that I didn&#x27;t have any bad reactions at all. I really enjoyed the way it smells too,  it totally transported me back to gardening with my mom which added a soothing factor to it. It felt really nice on my skin and I actually liked the sprayer vs a dropper like other products. I even sprayed a bit onto my hair instead of using a smoothing serum and it worked out great!</li>
    <li> This product was free and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.  The Rosewater toner and rejuvenator does what it claims.  I like  the  way it feels when applied to the skin.  It smooths and seems tor even the skin tone.  The applicator works well. This is a product I would continue usinfg.</li>
    <li> This is my hydrating moisturizer on the go. Whenever I feel like my skin is dry and tight I just run to my bedroom and spray this and it works like charm. I also use this when I get sunburned. It&#x27;s pacify the pain and somehow heals it faster. I love the smell of it. It&#x27;s so relaxing. I also use this to set my make up. It gives you the nice souffle glow and softness of your skin. The dewey look as what the makeup artist calls it. And guess what I use it too for my hair! It gives more shine during those dull days. This is such a multipurpose product and I love it! I do hope though that they will get rid off the Tetrasodium EDTA ingredients since it&#x27;s considered carcinogen (well almost everything is considered carcinogen anyway) and put how much percentage of Phenoxyethanol they use since the required amount should be less than 1%. I  purchase this for a markdown price in return for my objective and equitable review.</li>
    <li> Love this product I got for review.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Kudos for making in the USA and not testing on animals! I heard it was good for itching, so I sprayed a few mosquito bites I had on my foot as soon as I opened it. Instantly stopped it. I got it to try on my hair. I put some in my shampoo tonight and my hair is so silky and shiny now.&lt;br /&gt;*I got this product discounted, but I would definitely order again at full price!*</li>
    <li> My skin is super dry all the time. I was told to use a non-greasy toner but also one that is not too drying. I think I&#x27;ve found it. I LOVE the smell and the spay attachment is the best! I receievd a sample of another rose water toner but this one is MUCH better. So glad I found this</li>
    <li> I am an avid toner user! Especially at night. I love to use this right before I get into bed. It leaves my combination skin tone more even. With First Botany Rose Water Toner I can make cleaning my face fun and quick. It has a beautiful aroma, leaving me questioning if I used enough :) I might have accidentally sprayed my pillow case! It smells that amazing. I tested this out for free in return I leave my honest thoughts on their well working rejuvenating product! I will be recommending this to ALL.</li>
    <li> I got this product for all its capacity. It delivers many advantages that I can use. I love how it smells. Rose water contains rosa damascena which is know for its astringent abilities. This tone can help by cleansing, hydrating your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works perfect for all skin, all hair. Helps with ph balance and helps with the skin texture. This water can also help when you get sun burns it calms the skin and does not hurt. The smell is relaxing and I love that it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will continue to use it for its many uses like skin, hair and aero therapeutic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample, review and give you my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This toner smells lovely, just as I would expect from rose water. I&#x27;ve used different brands of rose water before and loved the results. So, I was exited to try the First Botany brand.&lt;br /&gt;The toner uses some great natural ingredients like rose oil and aloe vera juice. These are mild ingredients that are recommended for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, it also uses Phenoxyethanol and Tetrasodium EDTA which are a stabilizer and preservative respectively. Both of these ingredients are penetration enhancers, meaning that they break down your skin&#x27;s natural barriers, so that these ingredients go right into your bloodstream. Tetrasodium EDTA is also made from formaldehyde and sodium cyanide which are known carcinogens.&lt;br /&gt;Since I received this item as a review, I did not have a chance to go over the ingredient listing in detail. Had I known this, there is a good chance that I would have skipped reviewing this product.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.
