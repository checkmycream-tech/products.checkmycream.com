      <li>It is the best.  </li>
      <li>I used conditioner around my hairline and over my ears to prevent staining (worked great!)</li>
      <li>your* perfect color.</li>
      <li>This is the best in the world!</li>
      <li>Came out perfect and my yukky grays are covered!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy I did!</li>
      <li>Excellent timing and the product is as state.  </li>
      <li>I loved it!</li>
      <li>If you are a lighter brunette, you will end up with a great color wash or highlights.</li>
      <li>It is great to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I follow the directions and have always had great results, both with the color and</li>
      <li>Henna is a great treatment and color choice for hair.  </li>
      <li>The color is very nice.</li>
      <li>Very happy :)I added the pictures so you can see the result.</li>
      <li>Very happy :)I added the pictures so you can see the result.other suggestions I just went with what I had and sounded good.</li>
      <li>The surprising result was it worked at all and evened out my prev color...</li>
      <li>The surprising result was it worked at all and evened out my prev color...</li>
      <li>Based on the reviews I thought it was good.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t worry about it not being the exact color you imagined in your head, you will get the perfect color regardless, a color all of your own that no one else will have!</li>
      <li>and I heard so many great things about it.</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I have found that using straight lemon juice instead of water and then steeping the mixture at 100 degrees F (in my oven) for 2 hours before applying works the best.  </li>
      <li>In a day you will already be used to it &amp; loving it even more.</li>
      <li>Good color, good conditioning, fast deliver.</li>
      <li>how much she loved my hair..took me by surprise but made me feel good :)</li>
      <li>The color is great and my hair feels so soft and healthy!</li>
      <li>My hair dresser is one of many who comment favorably on the color.</li>
      <li>The lighy mountain red henna was great!</li>
      <li>while it becomes more of a fiery sunset color, no one realizes I am enhancing my hair in any way.</li>
      <li>It darkens and becomes richer lovely natural copper color over about 2 days and develops a beautiful luster.  </li>
      <li>At first I loved the color that I got from just two hours of it sitting on my medium brown hair.</li>
      <li>Something unique to individualize me!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the color becoming too orange.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping there isn&#x27;t a huge color difference between my roots and the rest of my hair</li>
      <li>Light Mtn.</li>
      <li>but I like the Light Mountain brand.</li>
      <li>If you are a darker brunette, I suggest the \\&quot;Red\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Light Red\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I have used Light Mountain Henna for years.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to put it on</li>
      <li>With just using water and no lemon juice, the color doesn&#x27;t become rich and there is no shine but a chalky appearance.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to put it on</li>
      <li>Was hard to apply but the color came out great!</li>
      <li>it came quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a red-headed hairdresser that has used this product for a good 20 years;in between using this, I have used other hair colors-expensive, cheap and everything else under the sun.</li>
      <li>For the first week my hair seemed super shiny, but now the color has faded a bit and the super shine is gone.</li>
      <li>However, I love the intensity of bright red hair that glows like a fire when outside on a sunny summer day.</li>
      <li>There were other suggestions I just went with what I had and sounded good.</li>
      <li>I use the Dark Auburn, and it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s chemical-free, pretty easy to put on - though a bit messy - and produces a lovely color that is unique.</li>
      <li>Instead, I got very light highlights that are only noticed at certain angles in certain light.</li>
      <li>After a few more trial and error dyes, I fell in love with the brand Rainbow henna.</li>
      <li>It does fad pretty fast but was well worth the time and money</li>
      <li>but when I&#x27;d go get a salon foil and it would brighten up my hair and face make me feel really pretty.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was my first time using henna</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s got many color layered over prior to that</li>
      <li>More like gritty baby poop.</li>
      <li>I have very short and baby fine hair, so the color took quickly.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps because I used hot water?  </li>
      <li>I made the mixture to \\&quot;yogurt\\&quot; consistency with hot distilled water, blah blah...  </li>
      <li>I was born with a bright, yet deep shade of red hair.</li>
      <li>My most recent store bought color was a red shade that I did about 4 weeks ago started to fade with each wash very quickly.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t care too much your first time when you rinse it out...</li>
      <li>Light Red gives my hair more life and shine, and a little more red.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally light red hair that is about 50% gray now.  </li>
      <li>Light Mountain, thought was so gritty, it was like putting sand on your hair.  </li>
      <li>you want natural, healthy red hair, this is the answer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I took that time clean the bathroom since it made a HUGE mess.</li>
      <li>I researched henna and found it local near me and went with the light red, really un sure of how it would look the box gives sample drawings and nothing I had looked like a before to know what it might turn out like... kind of nervous how it might turn out over the chemical dyed previously bleached mixed gray hair.</li>
      <li>I have been cutting and coloring my own hair more than usual and getting into more reds!</li>
      <li>and my gray is completely covered and the red at first is an OK medium red color.  </li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend their suggestion of using baking soda or conditioner when rinsing out.  </li>
      <li>it gave my hair a red tint without really darkening it too much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m told looks very natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m told looks very natural.</li>
      <li>Mixing Light Red with Red makes for a natural color.</li>
      <li>It will be the exact red color you need for your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The light red should have turned my dark brown hair a pretty auburn.</li>
      <li>Next time I will probably only mix up half of the product -- thus getting more bang for the buck!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t dry your hair while looking in the mirror the entire time worrying, simply go with it &amp; love</li>
      <li>Four days later (involving a swim, a workout, and several showers), my hair is still super soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>My natural color as far as I can recall is a level 6-7</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally light red, now with white mixed in.  </li>
      <li>The sweet little old neighbor even yelled across the street when she saw me in my yard</li>
      <li>This had the same effect in a new spectrum!...</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for light colored hair if you want a little red tint and conditioning.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the new blonde for me!</li>
      <li>as I only left it on for a very short time my first time, ever since then it only grows in intensity.</li>
      <li>A soft red and not brassy.</li>
      <li>color will be natural &amp; only enhanced.</li>
      <li>I was a little skeptical at first, but my hair turned out lovely!  </li>
      <li>I tried googling for pictures of people who used this exact color found a few but</li>
      <li>Later on in life it has lightened exactly as Anne of Green Gables would have fantasized about to a strawberry blonde...</li>
      <li>Regardless, after reading lots of posts on different sites, it appears that the key to natural complex color and shine is the acid in the lemon juice and not getting the mixture too hot.  </li>

    <li> Bring it back to subscribe and save already!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, works well - doesn&#x27;t turn your hair neon.</li>
    <li> Been using this brand for a year and color my hair monthly to cover the gray.  This color leaves my hair medium red.  I have naturally light red hair that is about 50% gray now.  I have found that using straight lemon juice instead of water and then steeping the mixture at 100 degrees F (in my oven) for 2 hours before applying works the best.  I leave it on for 1 hour and my gray is completely covered and the red at first is an OK medium red color.  It darkens and becomes richer lovely natural copper color over about 2 days and develops a beautiful luster.  With just using water and no lemon juice, the color doesn&#x27;t become rich and there is no shine but a chalky appearance.  Perhaps because I used hot water?  Regardless, after reading lots of posts on different sites, it appears that the key to natural complex color and shine is the acid in the lemon juice and not getting the mixture too hot.  It also leaves my hair feeling the healthiest!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a red-headed hairdresser that has used this product for a good 20 years;in between using this, I have used other hair colors-expensive, cheap and everything else under the sun. This is the best in the world!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally light red, now with white mixed in.  Light Mtn. Light Red gives my hair more life and shine, and a little more red.  Never looks artificial. I would recommend it for light colored hair if you want a little red tint and conditioning.</li>
    <li> Was hard to apply but the color came out great! It does fad pretty fast but was well worth the time and money</li>
    <li> This dye didn&#x27;t take to my hair at all. The light red should have turned my dark brown hair a pretty auburn. Instead, I got very light highlights that are only noticed at certain angles in certain light. On the upside, it did nourish it. Four days later (involving a swim, a workout, and several showers), my hair is still super soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> The color is very nice. A soft red and not brassy.</li>
    <li> The lighy mountain red henna was great! I have darkish brown hair and with the cassia and henna it gave my hair a red tint without really darkening it too much. The grey hairs turned a blondish red. I loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Rainbow brand henna for years but tired this  and was very disappointed.  I read previous reviews about the mess but thought i would give it a try.  Henna, as a general rule is a bit messy.  It is like putting liquid mud on your hair.  Light Mountain, thought was so gritty, it was like putting sand on your hair.  The color was also inferior.  I would NOT recommend this!</li>
    <li> No problems and it came quickly.</li>
    <li> Henna is a great treatment and color choice for hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  A bit messy but I like the Light Mountain brand.</li>
    <li> I have used Light Mountain Henna for years.  Mixing Light Red with Red makes for a natural color.</li>
    <li> Excellent timing and the product is as state.  It is the best.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was born with a bright, yet deep shade of red hair. Later on in life it has lightened exactly as Anne of Green Gables would have fantasized about to a strawberry blonde... However, I love the intensity of bright red hair that glows like a fire when outside on a sunny summer day. I&#x27;ve been using this for a year &amp; no one seemed to notice (a plus!) as I only left it on for a very short time my first time, ever since then it only grows in intensity. I&#x27;ve done it over such a long period of time so while it becomes more of a fiery sunset color, no one realizes I am enhancing my hair in any way. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the color becoming too orange. I would never, ever dye my hair with conventional hair dye as it is too complicated, would ruin my fine, long hair, &amp; force me to a salon which would waste my time &amp; money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your color will be natural &amp; only enhanced. It will be the exact red color you need for your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want natural, healthy red hair, this is the answer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a blonde &amp; worried, simply do a strand test. If you know you were meant to be a redhead, simply take the plunge! Don&#x27;t worry about it not being the exact color you imagined in your head, you will get the perfect color regardless, a color all of your own that no one else will have! Don&#x27;t care too much your first time when you rinse it out... Don&#x27;t dry your hair while looking in the mirror the entire time worrying, simply go with it &amp; love *your* perfect color. In a day you will already be used to it &amp; loving it even more. If you are a lighter brunette, you will end up with a great color wash or highlights. If you are a darker brunette, I suggest the \\&quot;Red\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;Light Red\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. I followed the directions carefully and I have blonde hair. I was looking forward to an alternative to chemicals. Based on the reviews I thought it was good. Big mistake. I don&#x27;t write bad reviews, this is my first because it earned it. I made the mixture to \\&quot;yogurt\\&quot; consistency with hot distilled water, blah blah...  More like gritty baby poop. Then started placing the slime on my head. Thats when problems started. It goes everywhere but my hair: the walls, the floor, my face. I still gave it a chance and let it sit for a while. I took that time clean the bathroom since it made a HUGE mess. Then decided to wash it out. It took FOUR washings to get it out of my hair and I&#x27;m still dropping gravel everywhere. And oh yeah, after all of the trouble, did nothing to change my hair color.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an orange color, go for it. I wasn&#x27;t. My dark blonde hair turned Scottish orange. After a few more trial and error dyes, I fell in love with the brand Rainbow henna. I use the Dark Auburn, and it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I took the plunge and tried henna and haven&#x27;t gone back.  It&#x27;s chemical-free, pretty easy to put on - though a bit messy - and produces a lovely color that is unique.</li>
    <li> I have known of Henna hair color for years but always wanted to be a blonde with my pale complexion that has pink tones. I never wanted anything that might be red toned in my hair. I have been cutting and coloring my own hair more than usual and getting into more reds! My natural color as far as I can recall is a level 6-7 I think hairdressers over the years say. It&#x27;s so far from blonde on the scale looks some type of plain brown. I now also have gray in the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My most recent store bought color was a red shade that I did about 4 weeks ago started to fade with each wash very quickly. mind you it&#x27;s got many color layered over prior to that I had highlights I covered... I researched henna and found it local near me and went with the light red, really un sure of how it would look the box gives sample drawings and nothing I had looked like a before to know what it might turn out like... kind of nervous how it might turn out over the chemical dyed previously bleached mixed gray hair. I tried googling for pictures of people who used this exact color found a few but again no one had what I was going over color...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result: I&#x27;ve been very happy I did! It&#x27;s the new blonde for me! It&#x27;s hard to explain but when I&#x27;d go get a salon foil and it would brighten up my hair and face make me feel really pretty. This had the same effect in a new spectrum!... gave me the spunk to match my personality. Something unique to individualize me! The sweet little old neighbor even yelled across the street when she saw me in my yard how much she loved my hair..took me by surprise but made me feel good :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read all that and want to know what I did to apply it here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box gives some guidelines. I followed some and forgot to do some too..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I mixed with boiled tap water not (distilled water as recommended) I also added 1 squeezed lemon, and 1 egg. I did because the box said you could for some different effects. There were other suggestions I just went with what I had and sounded good. I let it sit for 10 min I was so excited to put it on didn&#x27;t read the part about putting it on WET hair. So I put this muddy gunk on dry hair which made it probably a lot harder than needed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piled it on rubbed it in (should have combed through per directions, didn&#x27;t) threw a shower cap on and let it sit for 1hr and 20min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rinsed and conditioned hair. dried and styled. waited 2 days before shampoo...box said to wait 24hrs. The surprising result was it worked at all and evened out my prev color...I&#x27;m told looks very natural. Very happy :)I added the pictures so you can see the result.other suggestions I just went with what I had and sounded good. I let it sit for 10 min I was so excited to put it on didn&#x27;t read the part about putting it on WET hair. So I put this muddy gunk on dry hair which made it probably a lot harder than needed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piled it on rubbed it in (should have combed through per directions, didn&#x27;t) threw a shower cap on and let it sit for 1hr and 20min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rinsed and conditioned hair. dried and styled. waited 2 days before shampoo...box said to wait 24hrs. The surprising result was it worked at all and evened out my prev color...I&#x27;m told looks very natural. Very happy :)I added the pictures so you can see the result.</li>
    <li> After several years of buying this specific color at health food stores, they no longer carry either the brand or the color. It is great to find it on Amazon. I follow the directions and have always had great results, both with the color and the length of time it lasts before needing to recolor. My hair dresser is one of many who comment favorably on the color.</li>
    <li> I read these reviews before going into a health food store and buying it off the shelf. Although it was messy it wasn&#x27;t terrible, and it rinsed out well. At first I loved the color that I got from just two hours of it sitting on my medium brown hair. However, it&#x27;s been three weeks and my hair STILL STINKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I wash my hair, my hair reeks of a planty hay-like smell. When my hair is dry it&#x27;s very faint, but only after three weeks of hair washes. I put in a coconut hair cream to mask it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using henna and I heard so many great things about it. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think my hair is as silky as it was before, and seems to get limp during the day.For the first week my hair seemed super shiny, but now the color has faded a bit and the super shine is gone. I&#x27;m hoping there isn&#x27;t a huge color difference between my roots and the rest of my hair so I won&#x27;t have to do a touch up.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I was a little skeptical at first, but my hair turned out lovely!  The color is great and my hair feels so soft and healthy! Follow directions accordingly -- I let the mixture sit for about an hour before I put it on my hair -- then left it on (with no heat) for about an hour.  Came out perfect and my yukky grays are covered!  I used conditioner around my hairline and over my ears to prevent staining (worked great!) and I would highly recommend their suggestion of using baking soda or conditioner when rinsing out.  As it&#x27;s similar to a clay-pack it can be rather hard to get it all out of your hair in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;One thing though -- I have very short and baby fine hair, so the color took quickly.  As my hair is short, however, I only used a small portion of the mixture -- and had to throw out the rest.  Next time I will probably only mix up half of the product -- thus getting more bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> Good color, good conditioning, fast deliver.</li>
