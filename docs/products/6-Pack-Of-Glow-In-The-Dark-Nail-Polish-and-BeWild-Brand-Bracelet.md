### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>She loved it!!</li>
      <li>these were perfect for our glow run in vegas...</li>
      <li>Would be ideal for halloween or a girl&#x27;s sleep over party.</li>
      <li>i cant even explain how happy inwas when it worked  and the longer the  </li>
      <li>Love these!!  </li>
      <li>Even with the best top coat.</li>
      <li>Glow is not even noticiable unless you use bright colors underneath the polish.</li>
      <li>The picture with the nice packaging box is deceiving but a great product.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and glow easily---each color glows in it&#x27;s own hue!!!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to share with my great grand daughter and her mother.</li>
      <li>Bought these as a gift for a friend and she was very pleased.</li>
      <li>I love the colors amazing!</li>
      <li>I got these in the mail today, exactly as the order said I would, and I received six, perfect condition bottles of nail polish.</li>
      <li>and it still didn&#x27;t glow and chips off VERY easily....  </li>
      <li>Love the glo.</li>
      <li>Love love love  </li>
      <li>then used them over another color, like a top coat.  </li>
      <li>I love these nail polishes.  </li>
      <li>Love the colors but could not get it to glow at all.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love them , the kids love them.</li>
      <li>And yes, they were okay.  </li>
      <li>But it also has glow capacity for many hours after light exposure. :)</li>
      <li>This nail polish gives off a good glow, but flakes off pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>The packaging was also neat and secure.</li>
      <li>They do need to be activated by holding under a light for about 1-2 minutes</li>
      <li>you have it under light</li>
      <li>BUT - on the upside, it glows fairly bright &amp; is cheap entertainment that will last a while.  </li>
      <li>the more vibrant the colors are.</li>
      <li>the only thing good was how fast it shipped...</li>
      <li>fun times</li>
      <li>A clear top coat would probably solve this.</li>
      <li>Although, you need a few coats on top of white nail polish for it to show this is a great product.</li>
      <li>This nail polish is just for fun, and since it&#x27;s clear, it&#x27;s fine that it starts chipping and peeling off within 24 hours of applying.</li>
      <li>All the reviews on this are pretty spot on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice but not exactly what I was expecting,</li>
      <li>there are very tin</li>
      <li>Very prompt shipping - 4 days between ordering &amp; receiving item.  </li>
      <li>The nail polish chips off very easly</li>
      <li>Glows in the dark if you mix it with light colors and give it adequate sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs</li>
      <li>is good because it has different colors but does not glow in the dark</li>
      <li>The colors look beautiful in the bottle, but are very thin when applied.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t glow as intensely as the glow in the dark Wet &amp; Wild Fantasy Makers polish I have been using, but I may just need to experiment with it more in terms of layers and light exposure.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is meant to be heavily layered as I find that it only takes a couple of coats for a nice glow.  </li>
      <li>Put it on too heavy &amp; it will peel off too easily.  </li>
      <li>Long lasting glow, but the polish peels of quickly.</li>
      <li>I still have six different bottles of glow-in-the-dark nail polish (orange, yellow, green, blue, and two pinks), but I would have really liked that clear one.</li>
      <li>Instead, I was sent two types of pinks, one a kind of magenta pink, and the other an orangy pink.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have is that I was looking forward to the clear polish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really into pink, so I don&#x27;t really have much use for two, but maybe I could give them to a friend or something.</li>
      <li>it was her first school dance and the theme was glow in the dark -</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected and wanted for a teenage girls&#x27; gift.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t really glow in the dark had to put on 5 layers just to see the color</li>
      <li>: Glow is barely visable even with a white background.</li>
      <li>I got blue, green, yellow, orange, pink and a purplish color-which is fine</li>
      <li>I used MULTIPLE coats on each nail and still only got a bare hint of glow.</li>

<li> Only glows on nails without any other polish.</li>
<li> If you do plan on using these without any other nail polish underneath, it will take a couple layers until the color gets solid</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t mind not having the clear, but I do wish these glowed even a little for me!</li>
<li> Neon glow in the dark is terrific for girls!!!!</li>
<li> Just could not get them to actually glow in the dark.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t really like the color are not bright</li>
<li> White, green, blue and yellow nail colors all glow green.  </li>

<li> The nail polish didn&#x27;t glow in the dark.</li>
<li> None of these polishes glowed in the dark.</li>
<li> Not good coverage and barely glows</li>
<li> I also didn&#x27;t receive the colors listed here and the green I received had leaked all over the other bottles.</li>
<li> somehow so there was black and green/blue goo all over everything.</li>
<li> However, when I received them they were all slightly opened and leaked in the bag.</li>
<li> but they do glow in the dark!  </li>
<li> My main disappointment came when none of the glowed in the dark.</li>
<li> She&#x27;ll point out what I may be missing.</li>
<li> otherwise i wasted my money</li>
<li> Still no glow in the dark, but, did make my base coat last longer.</li>
<li> Big waste of money and very disappointing.</li>
<li> Worked assume with a white base.</li>
<li> With a black base they don&#x27;t glow as well.</li>
<li> I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS!!!!</li>
<li> I was sad because I was so looking forward to polishing.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed as i took this as a gift abroad for a bday present and only saw it when it was opened, and it was horrible to see the reaction from excitement change to disappointment.</li>
<li> They are very thin and almost colorless.</li>
<li> Very thin polish.</li>
<li> 2 WERE VERY VERY DRIED OUT AND UNUSEABLE!!!!</li>
<li> Very unhappy &amp; misled regarding the glow colors.</li>
<li> Very disappointed that they don&#x27;t glow the colour they are.</li>

    <li> None of these polishes glowed in the dark. They are very thin and almost colorless. Big waste of money and very disappointing.</li>
    <li> None of the polishes actually glowed once i put them on my nails. the do however glow in the bottle</li>

    <li> Only GOT 5 OUT OF THE 6 NAIL POLISHES. 2 WERE VERY VERY DRIED OUT AND UNUSEABLE!!!! I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> Although, you need a few coats on top of white nail polish for it to show this is a great product. The packaging was also neat and secure.</li>
    <li> Only glows on nails without any other polish.</li>
    <li> Love these!!  Purchased for a birthday party as gifts.  Arrived quickly and glow easily---each color glows in it&#x27;s own hue!!!</li>
    <li> They didnt glow for me. I need to rebuy the ines that claires store sells, just put it on once u u r done</li>
    <li> All the reviews on this are pretty spot on. Love the glo. polish peels after a day. Even with the best top coat.</li>
    <li> PROs: Glows in the dark if you mix it with light colors and give it adequate sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs: Glow is barely visable even with a white background. Glow is not even noticiable unless you use bright colors underneath the polish. Even with that i would of gave it a 3 star but 2 of the polishes were open and it seemed to be melting the cap somehow so there was black and green/blue goo all over everything.</li>
    <li> I got these for my 6th grader - it was her first school dance and the theme was glow in the dark - she and some of her friends used the different colours.  They do need to be activated by holding under a light for about 1-2 minutes but they do glow in the dark!  She loved it!!</li>
    <li> This nail polish gives off a good glow, but flakes off pretty quickly.  A clear top coat would probably solve this.</li>
    <li> I got these in the mail today, exactly as the order said I would, and I received six, perfect condition bottles of nail polish. I immediately tried some on and a couple hours later, they glow. The only problem I have is that I was looking forward to the clear polish. Instead, I was sent two types of pinks, one a kind of magenta pink, and the other an orangy pink. I still have six different bottles of glow-in-the-dark nail polish (orange, yellow, green, blue, and two pinks), but I would have really liked that clear one. I&#x27;m not really into pink, so I don&#x27;t really have much use for two, but maybe I could give them to a friend or something. If you do plan on using these without any other nail polish underneath, it will take a couple layers until the color gets solid</li>
    <li> The nail polish chips off very easly</li>
    <li> And yes, they were okay.  Just could not get them to actually glow in the dark.  I mixed them well, Put them on, held my fingers under a lamp for a while.  Still no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then used them over another color, like a top coat.  Still no glow in the dark, but, did make my base coat last longer.</li>
    <li> Neon glow in the dark is terrific for girls!!!!</li>
    <li> I received these as a gift and they don&#x27;t glow at all for me. I used MULTIPLE coats on each nail and still only got a bare hint of glow.

    <li> I love them , the kids love them. Yeh! :) fun times</li>
    <li> these were perfect for our glow run in vegas...everyone could see our toes &amp; fingers!</li>
    <li> I love the colors amazing!</li>
