      <li>Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash, 6 Ounce]]) for years and have been very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I started with this product and it is amazing.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a nice change of pace and scent.</li>
      <li>Now some friends are asking what I am using on my face or did I have some kind of treatment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m  sure  </li>
      <li>This is pretty good at taming my stress breakouts.  </li>

      <li>Make sure you get a good moisturizer to go with it, because it leaves you very, very dry.</li>

      <li>only use it at most once per day, and often skip a day since the salicylic acid can cause skin redness and irritation.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this stuff!!</li>
      <li>AS long as she uses it consistently, she is free of acne.</li>
      <li>I would also recommend to wet your face before applying the gel so that the gel will create a lot of suds and you&#x27;ll have more of an invigorating experience.</li>
      <li>I tried another leading and TV commercialed brand but was not seeing too much of a difference.</li>
      <li>I can use and it really works.</li>
      <li>Works very well on my face.</li>
      <li>I would definitely highly recommend!</li>
      <li>We saw better results with Neutrogena Acne Stress control Cleanser than some of the other skin care systems that we paid $20 to $50 dollars for.</li>
      <li>I have dry/sensitive skin, so I use a lightweight moisturizer such as Eucerin to keep my skin soft, and smooth.</li>
      <li>I had acne caused by a fairly new birth control</li>
      <li>scent is much nicer than the regular version.</li>
      <li>My 15 year old has been using this product for about a year</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been constantly using it but for me it doesn&#x27;t really help me to prevent my acne.</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used it before start off slowly to make sure you don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to salicylic</li>
      <li>Not that the regular version smells bad, but rather instead of a \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; smell, this has a lighter and more refreshing</li>
      <li>I am an older individual and never went through the acne phase in my teens but now for some reason have started with facial break outs.</li>
      <li>Further, she took it to a summer camp and reported that all of her camp friends were lining up every night near her room to use it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was struggling with serious stress breakouts after a cross country move.  Within days of using this product my face totally cleared up. I highly recommend this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I have oily acne prone skin however this product dry my skin to the point were I had burn marks. The acne stressfoaming cleaner works great and I have used it for over 4years however this gel cleanser was not for me.</li>
    <li> It came with a broken pump and I have to unscrew the lid to use. I need a cleanser right away so I&#x27;m not going to return it. Not a please customer.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old has been using this product for about a year and it  is working miracles! Further, she took it to a summer camp and reported that all of her camp friends were lining up every night near her room to use it. AS long as she uses it consistently, she is free of acne.</li>
    <li> I have use it before I usually buy at my local cvs pharmacy but found it cheaper here.  Does help reduce breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is the only acne wash that works for me. I can only find the foam or the cream in the store, and all I want is this gel cleanser!!</li>
    <li> Have used this face wash for awhile, then all stores stopped carrying it.  It works great on my adult acne.</li>
    <li> item as described, quick shipping</li>
    <li> Works very well on my face. I would recommend using the cleanser in the morning time to give your skin a boost of energy, as well as fighting away your acne. I have dry/sensitive skin, so I use a lightweight moisturizer such as Eucerin to keep my skin soft, and smooth. I would also recommend to wet your face before applying the gel so that the gel will create a lot of suds and you&#x27;ll have more of an invigorating experience.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good at taming my stress breakouts.  It doesn&#x27;t handle ALL of them, but they&#x27;re not as bad as they were.  Make sure you get a good moisturizer to go with it, because it leaves you very, very dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  an okay product but not the best. I&#x27;m  sure  i will get something  cheaper  over the  counter</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena oil free acne soap ([[ASIN:B000FH4I1U Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash, 6 Ounce]]) for years and have been very pleased with it. I gave this a try as well since it has the same active ingredient (2% salicylic acid). So far, it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is much nicer than the regular version. Not that the regular version smells bad, but rather instead of a \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; smell, this has a lighter and more refreshing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the regular version it&#x27;s very thick, so just a little is all that is needed. A bottle lasts for some time, making it a better value for me than the store-brand versions, which tend to be much thinner and require more per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it at most once per day, and often skip a day since the salicylic acid can cause skin redness and irritation. If you&#x27;ve never used it before start off slowly to make sure you don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that I notice any difference in the effectiveness of this versus the regular version even though this says it has \\&quot;microclean\\&quot; technology. But it&#x27;s a nice change of pace and scent.</li>
    <li> Occasionally I get acne flare-ups on my forehead if I&#x27;m not careful with what I eat. I usually put this on before I go to bed and wash it off in the shower the next morning. The first night it usually clears a solid 30-40% of the acne away. By the next night it usually clears 80-90%. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This stuf works :) leaves my face feeling super clean and after a few days I deffinitly saw a difference in acne. A great deal price-wise too!</li>
    <li> It came with a broken pump so I always have to unscrew it to use it. I had acne caused by a fairly new birth control and after I started using this to help control it, my skin got so dry, red, and itchy. I have to cake lotion and moisturizer on my face to make it not hurt anymore.</li>
    <li> I have blackheads and if not using proper cleanser, breakout happens periodically. I used to use Acnefree cleanser, however it&#x27;s supply source is not steady (always out of stock on Amazon). I have been trying different replacement, and this one fits my need and also control my teenage son&#x27;s acne well.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product if you have a oily face. i use it twice a day and my face remains free of grease</li>
    <li> I am an older individual and never went through the acne phase in my teens but now for some reason have started with facial break outs. I tried another leading and TV commercialed brand but was not seeing too much of a difference. I started with this product and it is amazing. Now some friends are asking what I am using on my face or did I have some kind of treatment. Only due to use of this product every evening.  I would definitely highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been constantly using it but for me it doesn&#x27;t really help me to prevent my acne. I still get big acne 4 at the time and it is worse.  I read good reviews and hoping this is the miracle acne cleanser but it is not.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my teenage Granddaughters. They have tried alot of other products, but this product is the best! Within one week, three of the four girls had noticeably clearer skin. They have been able to maintain healthy skin since this purchase and have not needed other products or skin care systems.  I recommend this product to all  who have skin care issues. We saw better results with Neutrogena Acne Stress control Cleanser than some of the other skin care systems that we paid $20 to $50 dollars for. It is now our product of choice!</li>
    <li> *purchased elsewhere* but the product was terrible. I have dry/normal skin. I used this 1 time and it felt like I went skiing down a mountain in freezing rain and the result was an incredibly chapped face. For 3 days I had to lather my face with Vaseline. Embarrassing and then just made my skin worse. Don&#x27;t do it !!</li>
    <li> My 1 star is because I&#x27;m mad Amazon discontinued this product. Pricing was great, always packaged well. Only OTC acne face wash I can use and it really works. Heading to Wal-Mart to stock up on it.</li>
