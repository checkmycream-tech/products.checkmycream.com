      <li>I am sure that many makeup artists use this on celebrities, but it&#x27;s too heavy-duty for me to use every day.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and i just got more yesterday.  </li>
      <li>would repurchase if I had more of a need for it.</li>
      <li>You just need a tiny bit and it blends perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Clinique for years and this is so much better.  </li>
      <li>This product is right consistency for good coverage, doesn&#x27;t shine, and blends with LM tinted moisturizer well.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product more than once because it goes on so smoothly and blends well.</li>
      <li>It is creamy and therefore, easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>This is hands down the best concealer I have ever used!</li>
      <li>Ordered this product after reading great reviews on a different website.</li>
      <li>I have used these products before and really like them!!!</li>
      <li>Has a very lovely natural look.</li>
      <li>A great cover up when allergies or lack of sleep cause dark under-eye circles!  </li>
      <li>Great for dark circles!</li>
      <li>This stuff lasts for about two years, well worth the price.</li>
      <li>If you are very young without wrinkles, it might be just fine.</li>
      <li>I could not believe how it brought out my wrinkles so much!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got back to Laura Mercier&#x27;s concealer.  </li>
      <li>Fingers definitely work better than brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely, but the color is a little darker than I need.</li>
      <li>Great under eye concealer or anything that needs a little extra camouflage.</li>
      <li>works very well without showing</li>
      <li>I apply it with my pinky finger and it smoothly runs through my skin staying on all day long.</li>
      <li>Love how it covers my dark circles, but it does leave a shine</li>
      <li>I always set mine with a powder because I don&#x27;t really like the subtle stickiness of the product after applying it, but if I don&#x27;t set it and wait about 5-10 minutes, it will set on its own.</li>
      <li>I have used this concealer for about 10 years - also use liquid concealer, but consistently come back to Laura Mercier.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, because it&#x27;s harder to apply and lasts a long time, it&#x27;s fabulous for special occasions, but I personally find it to be overkill for every day.</li>
      <li>love the laura mercier secret concealer-it covers very well and not greasy</li>
      <li>I seal it applying some powder on and it really stays on all day long.</li>
      <li>It goes on greasy and I couldn&#x27;t see a major difference with it on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am a very fair-skinned girl with pink undertones, and I purchased this in it&#x27;s lightest color.</li>
      <li>I would also recommend this product to people with very very dark or troublesome undereye circles that are OK with spending extra time everyday to conceal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so if you don&#x27;t need to cover dark circles, you may not need such an intense formula.</li>

<li> I would also recommend this product to people with very very dark or troublesome undereye circles that are OK with spending extra time everyday to conceal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so if you don&#x27;t need to cover dark circles, you may not need such an intense formula.</li>
<li> I use Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer as a general makeup, and find this concealer adds the coverage needed for those dark areas below my eyes.  </li>
<li> You do have to be careful with the application, as it&#x27;s pretty thick -</li>
<li> Because this product has such a pronounced salmon tone, I found that I could not use it other places on my fair-skinned face without it being noticeable.</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend this product to other fair-skinned people in search of a concealer.</li>
<li> This is a creamy, matte, completely opaque concealer that tends towards sticky rather than slick (as compared to a product like [[ASIN:B000265CDM</li>
<li> It seemed very heavy when I barely applied it.  </li>
<li> however, it is very powdery, making it look a little caked and dry which makes wrinkles appear even worse.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I use only a little bit on the inner corners of my eyes, applying it with two concealer brushes--a thin one for application and then patting it down with a thicker one inch brush.</li>
<li> Yes, it does highlight the dark circles.</li>
<li> for my everyday concealing needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s very thin, especially the highliter, which comes in one of those brush pens that you twist up.</li>
<li> Settled into fine lines and undereye wrinkles TERRIBLY.</li>
<li> While the sticky aspect makes it long-wearing, it also makes it hard to blend.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll not buy the Laura Mercier again--at least for under the eyes.  </li>
<li> because this product is so thick, pigment-rich, and sticky, it&#x27;s easier to apply with fingers than it is to apply with a brush.</li>
<li> but i read reviews that it is also thick and can get into lines in the wrinkles during the day.  </li>
<li> somehow this brand is too thin or something and doesn&#x27;t do the job I want</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed in the color of this concealer.</li>
<li> Disappointed in the color.  </li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again :(</li>
<li> Once I received it and used it, I was extremely disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have purchased this product more than once because it goes on so smoothly and blends well.</li>
    <li> I had this eye concealer before, and tried another.  I&#x27;m so glad I got back to Laura Mercier&#x27;s concealer.  It is creamy and therefore, easy to apply.  And with it in a bowl, and not a stick, you can get every bit out.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best concealer I have ever used! Great for dark circles!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now, and it&#x27;s great. I totally blends in with my skin (I don&#x27;t wear foundation), hinding the darker zones under my eyes. I apply it with my pinky finger and it smoothly runs through my skin staying on all day long. I seal it applying some powder on and it really stays on all day long. Has a very lovely natural look. I love it.</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time.  It is the only concealer out there that I would buy.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in the color of this concealer. It seems to have a lot of yellow in it.</li>
    <li> works very well without showing</li>
    <li> I have used this concealer for about 10 years - also use liquid concealer, but consistently come back to Laura Mercier. You do have to be careful with the application, as it&#x27;s pretty thick - so if you don&#x27;t need to cover dark circles, you may not need such an intense formula. I like to apply it with a brush and then blend with a sponge. Also great coverage for blemishes.</li>
    <li> A great cover up when allergies or lack of sleep cause dark under-eye circles!  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique for years and this is so much better.  You just need a tiny bit and it blends perfectly.</li>

    <li> Ordered this product after reading great reviews on a different website. Once I received it and used it, I was extremely disappointed. Settled into fine lines and undereye wrinkles TERRIBLY. Cannot return, because I used it one time.</li>
    <li> I would not use this concealer for under the eyes. Yes, it does highlight the dark circles. however, it is very powdery, making it look a little caked and dry which makes wrinkles appear even worse.  I could not believe how it brought out my wrinkles so much!  I was going to try the Bobbi Brown concealer instead (Bobbi is actually my fav) but i read reviews that it is also thick and can get into lines in the wrinkles during the day.  I suggest Mary Kay under eye concealer or highlighter.  I had used it before because a friend sells it and i just got more yesterday.  You can&#x27;t see the makeup once you put it on, it&#x27;s very thin, especially the highliter, which comes in one of those brush pens that you twist up. Actually i don&#x27;t like the pen but i like the product. I&#x27;ll not buy the Laura Mercier again--at least for under the eyes.  If you are very young without wrinkles, it might be just fine.</li>
    <li> I use Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer as a general makeup, and find this concealer adds the coverage needed for those dark areas below my eyes.  This product is right consistency for good coverage, doesn&#x27;t shine, and blends with LM tinted moisturizer well.</li>
    <li> love the laura mercier secret concealer-it covers very well and not greasy I am in the process of ordering another one</li>
    <li> It goes on nicely, but the color is a little darker than I need.</li>
    <li> Love how it covers my dark circles, but it does leave a shine so I pad it with a powder I bought from Bobbi Brown.</li>
    <li> Just not a concealer I returned to once it was gone...somehow this brand is too thin or something and doesn&#x27;t do the job I want</li>
    <li> This is a creamy, matte, completely opaque concealer that tends towards sticky rather than slick (as compared to a product like [[ASIN:B000265CDM Christian Dior Skinflash Radiance Booster Pen-No.3 Sun Beam Makeup for Women, 0.05 Ounce]]). It has a salmon tone to it to color-correct blue-ish toned undereye circles. Because this product has such a pronounced salmon tone, I found that I could not use it other places on my fair-skinned face without it being noticeable. However, I do know that the beauty YouTuber juicystar07 uses hers all over her face, as does one of my friends. It depends on skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that because this product is so thick, pigment-rich, and sticky, it&#x27;s easier to apply with fingers than it is to apply with a brush. One thing about its stickiness is that once it is on, it is not coming off. I always set mine with a powder because I don&#x27;t really like the subtle stickiness of the product after applying it, but if I don&#x27;t set it and wait about 5-10 minutes, it will set on its own. In my experience, it does not crease, but I also do not have oily skin. While the sticky aspect makes it long-wearing, it also makes it hard to blend. Fingers definitely work better than brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a very fair-skinned girl with pink undertones, and I purchased this in it&#x27;s lightest color. I would definitely recommend this product to other fair-skinned people in search of a concealer. I would also recommend this product to people with very very dark or troublesome undereye circles that are OK with spending extra time everyday to conceal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, because it&#x27;s harder to apply and lasts a long time, it&#x27;s fabulous for special occasions, but I personally find it to be overkill for every day. I am sure that many makeup artists use this on celebrities, but it&#x27;s too heavy-duty for me to use every day. I use [[ASIN:B000265CDM Christian Dior Skinflash Radiance Booster Pen-No.3 Sun Beam Makeup for Women, 0.05 Ounce]] for my everyday concealing needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase if I had more of a need for it.g needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase if I had more of a need for it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the color.  It actually made my&lt;br /&gt;dark circles darker. It seemed very heavy when I barely applied it.  Will not buy this brand of make&lt;br /&gt;up again.</li>
    <li> The best stuff ever made</li>
    <li> I have used these products before and really like them!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Great under eye concealer or anything that needs a little extra camouflage.</li>
    <li> Works and feels great.</li>
