      <li>This is the best eye drop product I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>They work great at home or away to flush my eyes when my allergies are bothering me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>great product  </li>
      <li>This is great to keep in the truck as an emergency kit.</li>
      <li>Not as good as compare to othere products</li>
      <li>It feels good</li>
      <li>This helps, and it feels good to.</li>
      <li>He used one &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of the eye cleaner in the eye cup and was all better!  </li>
      <li>I suffer from allergies, and when I discovered this product I was thrilled, I and the reviews were all positive, I tried the product and it worked out great, the product helped mitigate any eye irritation after a shower and contact lens use, it was a great feeling to use this product whenever my eyes felt irritated.</li>
      <li>These single-use, preservative-free eye wash vials are so handy to have around.</li>
      <li>Great way to keep fresh product on hand</li>
      <li>work good - came quick</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to use one bottle two-three washings</li>
      <li>The good news is I ended up discarding all my contact lens, solutions and all eye cups, got antibiotics and now have to use antibiotic ointment every night for the lids, use a hot compress and also shampoo my lids every morning.</li>
      <li>In an industrial plant setting it&#x27;s perfect for the first aid cabinets for very minor eyewash applications - because it&#x27;s one use for one person.  </li>
      <li>The little cup it comes with is great too.</li>
      <li>And I use them as regular eye drops, too, since they&#x27;re all natural and are great at giving my eyes moisture.  </li>
      <li>eye wash is better than drops to clear</li>
      <li>The way the product has been suggested to be used is very wrong, if any of you have any kind of pimple like structures inside your eyelids that you can feel with your fingers there is a very good chance that it wascaused by this product.</li>
      <li>The purified water is such a relief to the irritated eye, and the eye cup is perfect, allowing you to seal in the water without having it drip down your face as you wash your eye.</li>
      <li>love that the individual eyewash packets are in sealed containers, so they are sterile and they don&#x27;t spoil as quickly.</li>
      <li>Only because when you&#x27;re simply pouring the water into your eye (which you can do) you&#x27;re more apt to flinch.  </li>
      <li>totally clean, fine particles which accumulate in the eyes during the day are totally washed away  -</li>
      <li>It never fails - each time he mows the yard, he gets grass in his eye.  </li>
      <li>To keep my first aid kit up to date</li>
      <li>It feels great to be able to wash debris out of your eye without irritating it further.</li>
      <li>have them in the first aid kit ready to go</li>
      <li>I appreciate the quick customer recovery they put in to action.</li>
      <li>So while the solution is sterile, the cup certainly is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do not know where the infection came from, I do not wear makeup very often</li>
      <li>It probably takes me a year to go through all six vials, so that&#x27;s important to me to not have an open bottle of eyewash.  </li>
      <li>You can blink and also rotate your eyeball (as though you&#x27;re looking in different directions), which insures that you clean the whole of the eye.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product occasionally over the past several years and am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how else to describe the feeling but after use, my eyes feel so clean &amp; refreshed - it gives me a real boost after a long day.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>And highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I also love it for after I take off cosmetics when those little particles are stuck in my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Before we had to put a larger bottle in the cabinets and when someone needed it for a very minor eye washout situation most of it had to be thrown out.  </li>
      <li>Not good for first aid kit use as those products may remain in the kit for many months before use...</li>
      <li>My husband has light blue eyes that turn red and angry-looking.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product - I even showed my 93yr old mom how to use it</li>
      <li>Slightly painful, like a pimple, I went to a top eye surgeon in San Francisco (this doc is considered the top eye doc in the world, very renowned, from UCSF hospital), when I told him the history</li>
      <li>Once you open it,  you have to use the whole thing.</li>
      <li>and it also is kind of a rip-off for what you get.</li>
      <li>The eye cup is a soft comfortable rubber as well as oppose to the hard plastic I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
      <li>he was very clear do not use this eyewash as this company has suggested - washing out the entire eye using an eye cup every day, what this does is</li>
      <li>the solution can be shockingly cold and is more comfortable when slightly warmed.</li>
      <li>I orginally had a complaint about the product but lightning deal customer service quickly responded and replaced the product.</li>

<li> problems began after a few months - I developed Chalazion - essential pimple like swellings on the inside of the eyelids caused due to blocked oil glands that are present on the edge of the eyelids.</li>
<li> this product is hard to find but worth tracking down - I had used saline eye drops before but they never did the job quite like OccuFresh.</li>
<li> After a long day at work I often use this product.</li>
<li> I did buy the single use eye cups to go with this product.  </li>
<li> You fill the little cup with solution from one of the preservative-free vials (there are 6 per package), cover your eye with the cup, then tip your head back and rinse.  </li>
<li> only complaint about the product is that I wish the 6 vials also had 6 individual, sealed, eyecups.</li>
<li> I had expected a bit of stinging, but nothing.  </li>
<li> I had to used one the other day.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used the a few times for debris in eyes, or washing wounds on other parts of the body.  </li>
<li> Last night my eye was red and angry and there was nothing visible (like an eyelash) in it, but there had to be *something* like dust, etc.</li>
<li> Yep theres 6 weee little bottles of eye wash.</li>
<li> I used it often for a few months and even stocked up on this product because there was a shortage of this product for a period and was not available on Amazon or CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I like the small portable idea a lot.</li>
<li> No more rubbing his eyes all</li>
<li> This is a hard product to find - I always have to buy it online, but it&#x27;s been a lifesaver</li>
<li> that was irritating it.</li>
<li> 5 stars because it&#x27;s impossible find anywhere else.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works as promised. I like it and so does my sore eye.</li>
    <li> I like the individual bottles.  I had to used one the other day.  I did buy the single use eye cups to go with this product.  Great way to keep fresh product on hand</li>
    <li> This is great to keep in the truck as an emergency kit. We use them on the farm.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye drop product I&#x27;ve found.  It relieves my eye allergy symptoms by washing out the irritants.  You fill the little cup with solution from one of the preservative-free vials (there are 6 per package), cover your eye with the cup, then tip your head back and rinse.  It washes away any irritants.  I also love it for after I take off cosmetics when those little particles are stuck in my eyes.  And I use them as regular eye drops, too, since they&#x27;re all natural and are great at giving my eyes moisture.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> great product  indiv packs for on the go</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product occasionally over the past several years and am very happy with it. Sometimes when my eye is irritated, using a saline drop just isn&#x27;t enough, and that&#x27;s where this product comes in. Last night my eye was red and angry and there was nothing visible (like an eyelash) in it, but there had to be *something* like dust, etc. that was irritating it. My eye drops did not help, so I pulled this product out to use, and it did the trick. This is a hard product to find - I always have to buy it online, but it&#x27;s been a lifesaver when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the individual eyewash packets are in sealed containers, so they are sterile and they don&#x27;t spoil as quickly. It probably takes me a year to go through all six vials, so that&#x27;s important to me to not have an open bottle of eyewash.  One vial fills the eye cup twice, so you can rinse both eyes or the same eye twice. The cup is clearly marked to the fill line, and then you push it against your eye, tilt your head back, and move your eye in all directions to fully rinse it, then tilt your head down and remove the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the product is that I wish the 6 vials also had 6 individual, sealed, eyecups. You have to rinse the one after use, let it dry, and put it back in the container for next time. So while the solution is sterile, the cup certainly is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to also run the closed vial under the hot water on your sink for a few moments before using - the solution can be shockingly cold and is more comfortable when slightly warmed.</li>
    <li> I have blepharitis (a chronic condition that causes occasional eye infections.  This is just one of the tools in my repertoire for treating it.  I suspect that it will probably also be of use during allergy season.  It doesn&#x27;t sting at all (unless there&#x27;s a scratch in the eye).  I had expected a bit of stinging, but nothing.  I do recommend using it with an eye cup.  Only because when you&#x27;re simply pouring the water into your eye (which you can do) you&#x27;re more apt to flinch.  If you use the cup, all you have to do is fill it half-way, press it to your eye, tip your head back, and open your eye.  You can blink and also rotate your eyeball (as though you&#x27;re looking in different directions), which insures that you clean the whole of the eye.  It&#x27;s just much easier, and far less messy.</li>
    <li> This eye wash is the best.  It does not sting your eye.  Only suggestion is to have smaller sizes.  Once you open it,  you have to use the whole thing.</li>
    <li> I like the way these are individually packaged.  I&#x27;ve used the a few times for debris in eyes, or washing wounds on other parts of the body.  I like it.  And highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I orginally had a complaint about the product but lightning deal customer service quickly responded and replaced the product. I appreciate the quick customer recovery they put in to action.</li>
    <li> The product expires in three months. To keep my first aid kit up to date this doesn&#x27;t help - I am only gaining 2 mo. over existing eyewash. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not as good as compare to othere products</li>
    <li> Purchased in February 2014, delivered on time. Expiration date is April 2014.!. Expires 45 days after purchase. Not good for first aid kit use as those products may remain in the kit for many months before use... I did not know this. And was not part of the product description. Only two stars for this reason only. Returning...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m able to use one bottle two-three washings&lt;br /&gt;This eye wash is better than drops to clear&lt;br /&gt;allergy itching.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> 5 stars because it&#x27;s impossible find anywhere else.  In an industrial plant setting it&#x27;s perfect for the first aid cabinets for very minor eyewash applications - because it&#x27;s one use for one person.  No sharing this sort of stuff.  Before we had to put a larger bottle in the cabinets and when someone needed it for a very minor eye washout situation most of it had to be thrown out.  Note: this will not replace eyewash stations that are required by OSHA or larger bottles of eyewash that are necessary for continuous eyewash needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched to Unisol 4 because this now has preservatives in it and it also is kind of a rip-off for what you get. Unisol does have Sodium Borate and boric acid but I&#x27;ve found it to be non-irritating and work well as an adjunctive rinse for my eyelid hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> I had a eye infecton actually it was in my eye lashes, I use this now all the time. It feels good and I know after cleaning my eyelashes now with baby shampoo and doing the eye wash them I am protecting my eye. I do not know where the infection came from, I do not wear makeup very often but I had it and now I want to protect my eye from getting it again. This helps, and it feels good to.</li>
    <li> I suffer from allergies, and when I discovered this product I was thrilled, I and the reviews were all positive, I tried the product and it worked out great, the product helped mitigate any eye irritation after a shower and contact lens use, it was a great feeling to use this product whenever my eyes felt irritated. I used it often for a few months and even stocked up on this product because there was a shortage of this product for a period and was not available on Amazon or CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problems began after a few months - I developed Chalazion - essential pimple like swellings on the inside of the eyelids caused due to blocked oil glands that are present on the edge of the eyelids. Slightly painful, like a pimple, I went to a top eye surgeon in San Francisco (this doc is considered the top eye doc in the world, very renowned, from UCSF hospital), when I told him the history he was very clear do not use this eyewash as this company has suggested - washing out the entire eye using an eye cup every day, what this does is it interferes with the functioning of the oil glands by washing away some of the stuff that is necessary, this can lead to blocked pores that are on the edge of the lids and you end up with almost solidified oil that appear as pimples which get infected. The good news is I ended up discarding all my contact lens, solutions and all eye cups, got antibiotics and now have to use antibiotic ointment every night for the lids, use a hot compress and also shampoo my lids every morning. This happened 10 months ago and I have managed to reduce the problem by only 50%, it takes months for this to resolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The doc also told me that I could use this product as drops in the eye but never as an eye WASH as suggested by the manufacturer. The way the product has been suggested to be used is very wrong, if any of you have any kind of pimple like structures inside your eyelids that you can feel with your fingers there is a very good chance that it wascaused by this product.</li>
    <li> These single-use, preservative-free eye wash vials are so handy to have around. It feels great to be able to wash debris out of your eye without irritating it further. The purified water is such a relief to the irritated eye, and the eye cup is perfect, allowing you to seal in the water without having it drip down your face as you wash your eye.</li>
    <li> this product is hard to find but worth tracking down - I had used saline eye drops before but they never did the job quite like OccuFresh. After a long day at work I often use this product. It feels like my eyeballs are totally clean, fine particles which accumulate in the eyes during the day are totally washed away  - I don&#x27;t know how else to describe the feeling but after use, my eyes feel so clean &amp; refreshed - it gives me a real boost after a long day. I highly recommend this product - I even showed my 93yr old mom how to use it and she loves it! Bought extra in case they stop making it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Especially for people who have dry eyes and get irritated from wearing contacts. The little cup it comes with is great too.</li>
    <li> I like the small portable idea a lot. I use these for my flag football league, in case guys get poked in the eye or need to remove dust/debris. They do what they are intended to do. I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> My husband has light blue eyes that turn red and angry-looking.  It never fails - each time he mows the yard, he gets grass in his eye.  Drops just don&#x27;t work for that.  I purchased this product last time we had a eye &amp;#34;scare&amp;#34; and it was a life-saver this weekend when he mowed the yard and - again - got grass in his eye.  This product comes with a reusable cup to wash out the eye.  He used one &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of the eye cleaner in the eye cup and was all better!  No more rubbing his eyes all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like the convenient individual containers that keep the product sterile.  The eye cup is a soft comfortable rubber as well as oppose to the hard plastic I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
    <li> They work great at home or away to flush my eyes when my allergies are bothering me.</li>
    <li> ordered on a Friday - and arrived Monday with regular shipping&lt;br /&gt;Already have them in the first aid kit ready to go</li>
    <li> Yep theres 6 weee little bottles of eye wash. And even comes with a eye cup, yeeee hahhh</li>
    <li> work good - came quick</li>
