    <li> This product is a must-have if you have natural nails that you paint on your own. A base coat is important as it acts like a primer and a glueing agent between your nails and nail polish. The problem with most base coats is that they are shiny. Shiny base coats &#x3D; quickly chipping polish. It&#x27;s the difference between applying elmer&#x27;s school glue to plastic and paper. It&#x27;ll come right off the plastic. OPI makes the best base coat I have come across (I tried A LOT of them in nail tech school) and I won&#x27;t do my own nails without it. My polish stays on without chipping for about 10 days with this product vs. 4 or 5 days with other products I&#x27;ve tried. I also recommend using Pinnacle Adhere before applying this for a little extra staying power (it removes excess oils from your nails).</li>
    <li> This is a great natural base coat. By natural I mean that when you apply it on your nail it is not shiny and you can barely see it.&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced staining while using it which is a big plus! And I also feel that it makes removing nail polish easier, like if the color was only sticking to the base coat and not your nails.&lt;br /&gt;One of the thing that I was looking for in a base coat is less chipping but I didn&#x27;t see any difference. It is not bad, it just wasn&#x27;t better than without base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Good quality&lt;br /&gt;-Prevents staining&lt;br /&gt;-Natural look&lt;br /&gt;-Easy removal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-No chip prevention&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> Really like the base coat.  It really helps keep the polish longer.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice product you know you can rely on.</li>
    <li> Pricey but worth it.  A small amount removes nail lacquer quickly without any harsh odor or damage to cuticles.</li>
    <li> This base coat helps to prevent nails from becoming yellow as well as to easily remove the nail polish (i tend to use reds often)...</li>
    <li> Girls! make sure you are buying a real OPI nail product! I can&#x27;t find the number on the bottle. There should be two serial numbers on the bottle but I can&#x27;t find neither of them. The return policy is quite harsh so i&#x27;m not planning for a return. However next buyer, think before you buy!</li>
    <li> OPI has great products and this one is no different. This OPI base coat provided great protection for my nails. And I attribute the use to helping my nails grow and become stronger</li>
    <li> OPI Base is essential to every person&#x27;s nail care routine, it helps the polish stick and when used after OPI Ridge Filler you&#x27;ll have amazing nails.</li>
    <li> This nail polish base coat is great to helping any brand of nail polish last twice as long (combined with the O.P.I. top coat). It is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have a professional manicure once a month. In between times, I do my own nails. My nails are well conditioned and the professional manicure keeps my nails in top notch condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed years ago that my manicurist always applied a base coat that acts as a layer to receive the nail color I want. Some base layers are glossy, I prefer those that are not. This Opi base is perfect. I start by applying  one coat to my left hand and then by the time my right hand is done, the left is ready for the nail color. The base is a necessity for me, and keeps my manicure you&#x27;d for at least a week. I usually use only Opi and Essie products, so I do know that I am using quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 10-03-13</li>
    <li> I love OPI and love their colors and NAIL ENVY howerver I did not see that this was that big of a change or a big deal</li>
    <li> Works very well, and I would recommend this. It held up for a long time, and was very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for this is the bes Nail care products.&lt;br /&gt;Use this all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would tell you to buy</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is very good.  All of OPI products are great.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a very light base coat, your will hardly see it in your nails after you apply it and let it dry. And it protects a lot your nails of turning yellowish. Very good value product, since also, brings a lot of polish inside.</li>
    <li> I like this because it stands up to hand washing, doesn&#x27;t look chipped even when it is... it&#x27;s more natural looking than clear polish/base.  OPI is also just a great brand.</li>
    <li> I received this item within a few days after I placed the order. I got exactly what was advertised and for a great price.</li>
    <li> We took this product for our salon. We were looking for bigger volum of base coat and I found in describtion that this is 4 oz volum. But we recived only 0,5 oz regular one.</li>
    <li> This is a standard base coat - OPI makes good nail polish/laquer - I use them combined with the top coat and the polish lasts a little longer than usual and MUCH longer than cheap polish.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a dad who paints his daughter&#x27;s nails...she really likes the daddy and daughter time.  I was having problems getting the darn fingernail polish to stick so I thought of using this product.  My wife thinks I do a bad job...hey, what do I know?...however, it&#x27;s nice when the polish stays on longer than a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, the polish lasts a lot longer on her nails, so I guess it does what it is supposed to do...</li>
