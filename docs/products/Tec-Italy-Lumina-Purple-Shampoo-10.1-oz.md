      <li>it keep your color  hair in good look for more than 6 weeks.</li>
      <li>The product is really great and original.</li>
      <li>Excellent product,  if you have high lights you have to prove this.  </li>
      <li>The more I use it, the more of a bright gray I get on my ombre hair color.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it for sure.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair from turning yellow AND it smells awesome!</li>
      <li>I love my hair now with this shampoo and the conditioner too.</li>
      <li>I love my shampoo.</li>
      <li>i think should be better packaged.</li>
      <li>have a mirror in the shower which I use to make sure this hasn&#x27;t migrated onto my face (as it will stain your skin purple) and I always clip my hair up so that it doesn&#x27;t dye my shoulders/neck.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the amount of orange/brassy tones that my hair tends to pull and I&#x27;ve been really satisfied with this.</li>
      <li>I loved it for anyone that wants to keep that beautiful light blonde.</li>
      <li>After using this product and drying my hair, I saw the beautiful ash blonde hair I had seen at the salon when I originally got my hair done.</li>
      <li>This is a great purple shampoo for my blonde highlighted hair.</li>
      <li>This product restored my hair to its ash blonde colour and made it look fantastic, shiny and healthy!</li>
      <li>I noticed that my color was fading rather quick</li>
      <li>I like that this product also contains Keratin &amp; the smell is fresh floral ( not bad)</li>
      <li>It could make your hair very bright if you leave it in too long, but that is if you leave it in way too long.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s appropriately priced and on days I use this I follow-up with my deep conditioner--not because I feel this dries my hair</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t even opened the bottle yet and won&#x27;t be ready to</li>
      <li>I would like to exchange but the only option available is return it.</li>
      <li>After three uses, the different shades of light and dark stand out a bit more, so that my hair looks as if I had had lowlights and highlights put in at a salon.  </li>
      <li>I just dyed my hair to an ombre gray, my stylist warned me that the maintenance was going to be high in order to keep my hair gray/silver.</li>
      <li>The brassy tones, though not completely eliminated, were definitely toned down, and my hair looked much more natural and healthy.  </li>
      <li>This purple shampoo is extremely dark and full of pigment, so it takes to the hair quickly and actually makes my toner stick even longer.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it claims to do, brighten up blonde hair.</li>
      <li>It has the right amount of purple veracity, even temporarily staining your finger tips if left on for too long (without staining your hair) -</li>
      <li>After using it ONCE I immediately notice my gray come back alive!</li>
      <li>After using both products once, I could see a major difference.  </li>
      <li>I am a natural blonde with blond(er) highlights.</li>
      <li>You can even mix it in with Wen, as my ends tend to get dry and brittle from the bleach, so I didn&#x27;t want to stop using Wen completely.</li>

<li> I am a natural blonde with blond(er) highlights.</li>
<li> You can even mix it in with Wen, as my ends tend to get dry and brittle from the bleach, so I didn&#x27;t want to stop using Wen completely.</li>
<li> So I saw the high reviews on this product, and even though it was expensive, I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
<li> I also have a natural red lowlight to my hair, which makes the blonde highlights look a little coppery.</li>
<li> I am naturally a dark brunette and recently had my hair lightened (ombre) to blonde.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my highlighted hair feeling dry or overprocessed after use.</li>
<li> This shampoo neutralizes the yellow completely after a few uses, and I now go to the salon less often for a toner refresh.</li>
<li> It leaves it soft and I think my gray is not so dull.  </li>
<li> THAN I EXPECTED.  </li>
<li> This is usually difficult for me, as since I am a dark brunette, it takes a while to bleach it to the correct color, and it is even harder for me to keep my hair from getting brassy or golden from the bleach.</li>
<li> This shampoo does not brighten highlights like other purple shampoos, it leaves my hair feeling stripped and dry/brittle.  </li>
<li> My hair is naturally a dark blonde shade, but I have colored it for the past few years.  </li>
<li> Only thing annoying is that you need to leave it in for a few minutes, and also that it makes your finger a bit purple if you don&#x27;t clean them off immediately and thoroughly.</li>
<li> I live on an island with terrible mains water full of copper and other mineral deposits even with a filter it makes your hair a horrid orange/yellow colour.</li>
<li> I use this 1x/week on my strawberry (heavily highlighted) hair.</li>
<li> But at this time I received a wrong one.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was very disappointed when I got my shampoo, it was not the same one advertised!!! I wanted the purple one and they sent the post color shampoo!!!!</li>
    <li> I am naturally a dark brunette and recently had my hair lightened (ombre) to blonde. I purchased this shampoo and conditioner to help eliminate brassiness and keep the blonde - blonde. It has been working great. A co-worker even mentioned today that my hair actually looks blonder. Smells good too! I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I use this 1x/week on my strawberry (heavily highlighted) hair. I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the amount of orange/brassy tones that my hair tends to pull and I&#x27;ve been really satisfied with this. It&#x27;s appropriately priced and on days I use this I follow-up with my deep conditioner--not because I feel this dries my hair but I like to get all my \\&quot;treatments\\&quot; out of the way in one day.&lt;br /&gt;I have a mirror in the shower which I use to make sure this hasn&#x27;t migrated onto my face (as it will stain your skin purple) and I always clip my hair up so that it doesn&#x27;t dye my shoulders/neck. I&#x27;d definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Best purple shampoo! takes out the brassiness out of your hair in one wash. Let it soak for a good 5 minutes. I loved it for anyone that wants to keep that beautiful light blonde.</li>
    <li> This purple shampoo is extremely dark and full of pigment, so it takes to the hair quickly and actually makes my toner stick even longer. The more I use it, the more of a bright gray I get on my ombre hair color. This is usually difficult for me, as since I am a dark brunette, it takes a while to bleach it to the correct color, and it is even harder for me to keep my hair from getting brassy or golden from the bleach. This shampoo neutralizes the yellow completely after a few uses, and I now go to the salon less often for a toner refresh. Love it! You can even mix it in with Wen, as my ends tend to get dry and brittle from the bleach, so I didn&#x27;t want to stop using Wen completely. I still get the same desired results as when I use it alone. Great product!</li>
    <li> I just dyed my hair to an ombre gray, my stylist warned me that the maintenance was going to be high in order to keep my hair gray/silver. she recommended I invest in a &#x27;purple shampoo&#x27; to keep my locks nice &amp; gray. I noticed that my color was fading rather quick so I asked around &amp; my friend suggested I tried this one. I&#x27;m so glad I did! After using it ONCE I immediately notice my gray come back alive! I like that this product also contains Keratin &amp; the smell is fresh floral ( not bad) I would recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this. It could make your hair very bright if you leave it in too long, but that is if you leave it in way too long. ;) Only thing annoying is that you need to leave it in for a few minutes, and also that it makes your finger a bit purple if you don&#x27;t clean them off immediately and thoroughly. But, bottom line, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> The product is really great and original. I just didn&#x27;t give to him 5 stars, because the product was leaking when got in my home.. i think should be better packaged. Anyways, I recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo!  It leaves it soft and I think my gray is not so dull.  Goes great with the conditioner. My hair shines.</li>
    <li> This is a great purple shampoo for my blonde highlighted hair. In fact, it&#x27;s one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried. It does exactly what it claims to do, brighten up blonde hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave my highlighted hair feeling dry or overprocessed after use. It has the right amount of purple veracity, even temporarily staining your finger tips if left on for too long (without staining your hair) - this is how I know it&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> The best to mantain highlights</li>
    <li> June 9, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase products I use regularly before I have none left.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t even opened the bottle yet and won&#x27;t be ready to&lt;br /&gt;do so for another couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will review the product then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your patience.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I love this seller!!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo, although I do need a conditioner with it.  Smells nice.  I have gold highlights and have been told they shimmer in the sunlight.  I assume that is the shampoo working.</li>
    <li> I love my shampoo. It keeps my hair from turning yellow AND it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  if you have high lights you have to prove this.  I love my hair now with this shampoo and the conditioner too.</li>
    <li> just love it, great for ash color. it keep your color  hair in good look for more than 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a natural blonde with blond(er) highlights. I also have a natural red lowlight to my hair, which makes the blonde highlights look a little coppery. After using this product and drying my hair, I saw the beautiful ash blonde hair I had seen at the salon when I originally got my hair done. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT WHICH PERFORMED BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.  NOT ONLY DOES IT WORK ON THE YELLOW TINT IN MY HAIR, IT SEEMS TO ACT AS A CONDITIONER.</li>
    <li> The best purple shampoo I&#x27;ve used in my hair. But at this time I received a wrong one. I would like to exchange but the only option available is return it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not brighten highlights like other purple shampoos, it leaves my hair feeling stripped and dry/brittle.  I would not purchase this again</li>
    <li> I bought both the Tec Italy shampoo and the conditioner.  My hair is naturally a dark blonde shade, but I have colored it for the past few years.  Even when I use an ash blonde shade, my hair would become brassy.  My husband even commented about its orangey tones.  So I saw the high reviews on this product, and even though it was expensive, I thought it was worth a try.  After using both products once, I could see a major difference.  The brassy tones, though not completely eliminated, were definitely toned down, and my hair looked much more natural and healthy.  After three uses, the different shades of light and dark stand out a bit more, so that my hair looks as if I had had lowlights and highlights put in at a salon.  I do recommend this product.</li>
