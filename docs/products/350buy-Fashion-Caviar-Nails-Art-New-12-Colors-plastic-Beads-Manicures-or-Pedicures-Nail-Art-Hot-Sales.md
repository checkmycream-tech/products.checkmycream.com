<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Color comes off when you put finger nail polish on it.</li>
    <li> Product are easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;Make my decoration even better,l&lt;br /&gt;I save lots of money with this&lt;br /&gt;5 stars ..thanks</li>
    <li> 👌 just got these and I&#x27;m going to have a lot of fun so I&#x27;m really excited. the shipper grouped another item that I had ordered . my first impression is that this could be a disaster if a child gets ahold of these but not in a health chocking hazard but in a &amp;#34; I can&#x27;t possibly clean this spill up way&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s just a worst case scenario besides me dropping the thing. it&#x27;s cute !</li>
    <li> They work well and are easy to use. but the problem with this produc is that i notice it loses its colou when u add too much top coat or inferior polish..that the only problem i have with it.</li>
    <li> These are so worth it. Same as the ciante caviar beads from sephora. i got 12 different colors and can&#x27;t wait to try them all. :D</li>
    <li> The caviar is so fun. You have to use nail glue (a lot of it) great colors. Lots of fun.</li>
    <li> They just leave it on your porch for someone to steal it and its a waste of money if someone else is going to have it.</li>
    <li> I have no problems. I absolutfly love it. Also i would Recommended highly to anyone that like this kind of crafts</li>
    <li> the color comes off when i clear coat</li>
    <li> I thought I would love this... But the product does not work so well....they don&#x27;t stay on long enough...this is a quick one to three day design...and that&#x27;s a good day</li>
    <li> Not enough beads the picture is is very deseptive only covered the bottoms of each container would I buy these again only if I couldn&#x27;t find a similar product</li>
    <li> The colors are great but each jar is not completely filled. Some are more full than others. Pretty colors but should have two or three so I have enough to do all nails. Will work if looking to do 1 nail on 1 hand but not enough for more. But for the money spent, I don&#x27;t feel like it was a horrible deal.</li>
    <li> Mine did not come so I can&#x27;t use it so even if it does work I wouldn&#x27;t know because of the inconvenience.</li>
    <li> this was a nail art item and they stick well on nails. do not put to much on one nail or will chip. I used clear nail polish and i used brush on nail glue and both work fine</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive these beads, but unfortunately, they are just not really worth it. I will still use them, but I&#x27;m disappointed by the quality. There is not as much in the jars as is pictured, several of my jars had their lids screwed on so incorrectly that I literally had to break them open just to get the beads out (which means I had to transfer the beads to a plastic bag, which is just not as easy to use), the color selection is lame and not like pictured (no silver... but there&#x27;s clear, WHY?). Also, if you top coat them, the color comes off. And I&#x27;m using Seche Vite, which has NEVER smudged any color of nail polish for me. I realize in a typical \\&quot;caviar\\&quot; application you would not top coat them but what if I want to place them in a pattern on my nail (which is mostly what I got them for)? Finally, as I mentioned before, you don&#x27;t get the quantity of each color that is pictured, and what you get is probably not enough to do an actual caviar manicure all in one color. I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for nail art beads next time. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The packaging was cute, but they are very small containers, not big enough to stick your fingers in, &amp; the beads fall off within hours. &amp; also, when you put a top coat on certain colors, the color bleads! ): but for a dollar, its okay. Also, it takes about 3 weeks to arrive. Probably wont buy again.</li>
    <li> i just adore nail caviar! really great colors. i wish they stayed on longer (i guess i will have to find another bonding method) but this product is really nice. i will be using these on special girly days (lol)</li>
    <li> Not a lot was given in the little containers and the color easily come of, definitely needs a top coat other then that i really liked them, cheap price !</li>
    <li> Personally I wont b buying these again. There isnt nearly enough in the (cute) little pots to do all ur nails even once.</li>
    <li> I loved it but could have been with a little more caviar.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very beautiful and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> i saw the picture and it looked really awesome! i wish it came with instructions, because i didn&#x27;t know how to get them on.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d recommend this for girls of all ages. its amazing looking</li>
    <li> Absolutely as I expected! Looks great!</li>
    <li> Not as many in the containers as looks in the picture. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> crumbles and falls off</li>
    <li> They are totally cute and perfect size! they stick well, once again i just paint a layer of glue and top with a high gloss coat. One container did open during shipping and half had fell out :( but all the others were fine, its a cool amount of each, but i did wish it came with a scooper/applicator.</li>
    <li> Comes is little containers and good value for your money.  The beads get lighter when you apply the top coat.  I didn&#x27;t mind since it actually matched the polish better.  You will get more of some colors than others.  For instance, I got more pink than silver, but can&#x27;t complain for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I used and loved it&lt;br /&gt;Its a little messy but easy to take off and manageable. Its not a bad product.</li>
    <li> I love the color variety available in this set. As soon as I received this product I couldn&#x27;t help but paint my nails and start to use the caviar design. It lasts a very long time and I always get compliments on my caviar nails.</li>
    <li> Not easy to use, bad quality.</li>
    <li> There was nothing wrong with the shipment or the person I bought it from. It just sucks on the nails. It doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple of hours. Worst purchase</li>
    <li> YOU WILL RECEIVE ALL THE COLORS SHOWN. BUT THE CONTAINERS ARE EXTRA SMALL AND HALF WAY FILLED. ONE CONTAINER IS ONLY GOOD FOR ONE NAIL TO BE COVERED. AND THE BEADS BLEED WHEN GLUE IS APPLIED TO THEM.</li>
    <li> The shipping was okay, it took a little over a month for me and I was getting ready to contact the sender but I&#x27;m very happy with the colors. I recieved, 2 shades of blue, 3 shades of pink (my favorite color anyways), silver, clear, green, black, orange,  and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When reading the reviews before I purchased this product,  people were talking about there not being enough beads, well I got about a half jar full of each color which is just fine to me since I&#x27;m not into the whole &amp;#34;covering your nail with beads&amp;#34; idea. They should last a long time but I recommend them so you can give it a try and see how it works for u. I got them for less than $2 + free shipping so I couldn&#x27;t pass up the offer</li>
    <li> great price, and was exactly as i expected</li>
    <li> I like the little cylinders it came in but i wish they filled it a little more but hey like it.</li>
    <li> These are really awesome. Some of the little cases they are in cracked but they don&#x27;t spill out. Can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
    <li> I love the way these look sure it&#x27;s not too much but I didn&#x27;t expect to get a lot in the jar. The seller was really understanding as well</li>
    <li> Colors on beads bleed &amp; disappear when top</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why all the complaints about these; my jars were almost all as full as I&#x27;d expect (two were a little light) and the description says they are tiny (2cm) jars, not the standard 1&amp;#34; jars you  might expect.  For the price... just buying the empty jars would cost more.  I liked the colors and no two were the same.</li>
    <li> These came in very small packages. One was broken when it arrived. It was hard to work with. But for the price its not terrible.</li>
    <li> not completely full but theyre great. i love them. theyre pretty and stick to any wet polish thanks alot seller</li>
    <li> All different colors just like I wanted. Good quantity for the price. Going to order more soon :) maybe bigger beads please.</li>
    <li> The product works well, and there is a nice variety of colors, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how little is in each container.  I have baughter other beads and they came with a lot more.  I use them for nails, but can see how they could be used for art projects as well.  Just wasn&#x27;t happy with the size of the containers, product works well.</li>
    <li> I like it , but I wish it had more product you get a better deal at an arts and craft store.</li>
    <li> includes everything mentioned in the description and came a few days earlier than expected. different colors and the amount was enough for my nails(:</li>
    <li> For the price, these are great, but I was disappointed in the quantity. There was a large difference between the volume of beads on each container. I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> They make your nails look totally different and I like using individually instead of the whole nail.. Everyone stops me and ask me how did I do that, it&#x27;s definitely eye catching will buy again when I run out.. It&#x27;s so much product too</li>
    <li> Be advised that the beads lose their color once applied. It rubs off on your hands if you touch it and all the beads end up silver. Also once top coat is applied absollutely no color is left on the beads. Disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Decent, but I gave them a below average rating since most every overcoat I use on them removes some of the the color from the beads. Disappointing on that end.</li>
    <li> it makes my nails have a different look and i get a lot of complaments the only thing is that it is small i thought it whould b larger</li>
    <li> I guess the item was as described maybe its just my application of it that still has me on the fence about it. But with the price and free shipping, I really can&#x27;t complain too much. The most success I&#x27;ve had with these is simply putting some beads in the jar lid and shaking it over a semi-dry nail and lightly covering with a top coat.</li>
    <li> i have seen this done by salons, and wanted to try it ourselves. it looks great when it is done. it is a bit tricky to do, but looks really great once you figure it out.</li>
    <li> Colors srick on great, high quality, very easy to handle and play with- looks very very professional on your hand even if you are not.</li>
    <li> Sure it&#x27;s a cheap product, BUT you shouldn&#x27;t trick your buyers. In the picture the container it full. When you get it the container is near empty 😑 do not buy this product. I didn&#x27;t even have enough of one color to cover my nail</li>
    <li> it kind of took long but it was worth it i like the beads there little but they are ok</li>
    <li> fun for little girls to play with, or for older looking for cute nails, or can look elegant for pictures.</li>
    <li> Umm I have zero idea how to apply this, soo I haven&#x27;t even been able to use it yet!! Tried looking online an didn&#x27;t find anything except for designs:p application directions would have been great!!  It only common sense!</li>
    <li> the containers arrived loosely opened, inconsistently not filled properly, &amp; I had beads all over I had to clean up after I opened the package. I was not happy about that. the colors are pretty &amp; look fun to use. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use a color more than 1-time. even that will depended on the color I choose bc many colors don&#x27;t  have very much product bc of spillage, lack of quality control. I was really looking forward to using the black Xavier beads. there isn&#x27;t even enough for 1 nail. that upset me the most!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered similar product which will receive the same review bc of the sad same problem. I won&#x27;t buy either product again or anything from their companies.</li>
    <li> More fun nail things to use!  Get some really nice effects!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product just what I expected it to be will re order some again really soon. The only thing is that they tend to fall off really quick lasts me about a day in a half but other then that great product for the price.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what id hoped to get. I had seen the style and knew I had to try it. It was a bonus to get such a variety of colors in one package. I love them and im so glad amazon had what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I was very excited for the beads but unfortunately they never arrived and I waited a VERY long time for them. I am very disappointed since this happened for the first time for a product that I ordered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just got it in the mail today, took a while. Like maybe 1 week and a half, it ships from Hong Kong via USPS. I was surprised of how small it was. 12 small plastic containers. Dosnt seem like 1 container would be enough for all 10 of your fingers, but we will see. Over all, good price, nice colors.</li>
    <li> there were not many beads in the individual wells at all. maybe enough to do a couple accent fingers but definitely not a whole hand if thats what you were aiming for. alot less than whats shown in the picture and color varies. think i got 2 wells with the same color.</li>
    <li> The containers are less than half way full...... disappointed in the amount that was In there.... this would only last about one mani</li>
    <li> Although a little difficult to work with I liked this item and the variety of colors it had. I will recommend this to my friends and shop this item again.</li>
    <li> Recieved quick. I thought they looked tacky but there may like. Good quality. Wish the balls were smaller tho!  Great product</li>
    <li> hard to apply the beads go everywhere I would not recommend I tried several times and just couldn&#x27;t do it</li>
    <li> Basicly happy with the purchase.  My only complaint is that a couple colors we&#x27;re not filled as much as the rest.</li>
    <li> These jars were almost empty and the static cling makes it very challenging to apply. I would never order this again</li>
    <li> I was excited to apply these and when I did, they looked pretty cool until I washed my hands.  All the color washed off!!!  I re-applied to one nail and top-coated the garnet colored beads with clear polish. The color came off and stuck to the brush so when I put the clear brush back in the bottle, it turned my clear polish kind of opaque pink. Not sure if I am doing anything wrong since the containers arrived in a clear zip lock bag sans any instructions. I don&#x27;t see a fix for this.</li>
    <li> Cant do top coat on them like other products, the color comes off. But other than that, they&#x27;re super cute</li>
    <li> Soooo beautiful and can&#x27;t beat the price! They don&#x27;t come with instructions and they came from Hong Kong so they took about 3 weeks to get here but worth it to me. I went on YouTube for tutorial</li>
    <li> they are ok I thought the container would be bigger then what it was but they are great for me doing the aquamarine nails</li>
    <li> the color variety is okay, but the beads stuck well. quantity could be better but not bad for the price. you will need a separate dish to pour and apply to your nails</li>
    <li> THIS WAS GREAT!!!! IT CAME NICE AND NEAT AND NONE OF THE COLORS WERE DOUBLE.&lt;br /&gt;THE CONTAINERS ARE SMALL BUT U WORK AROUND THAT</li>
    <li> Do NOT put a topcoat over these! A topcoat will dull the color or make it silvery. I learned that the hard way! These can be very cool if you use a dotting tool and a funnel.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually done a manicure with these yet, but I am so impressed with how they look. They are teeny tiny with a slight shimmer that you can&#x27;t see in the picture. I am so happy I found these and can&#x27;t wait to do my manicure this evening!!</li>
    <li> These beads are so much fun! Lots of options for using these. They look great and are fun to use.</li>
    <li> Love all the different colors and the way the caviar looks on the nails is awesome. Takes a little practice to apply</li>
    <li> They were beautiful when I put them on (one coat of nail polish, let dry, another coat and dip in beads immediately), but they started falling off within a few hours. Not great quality, but what do you expect? You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> So many beads and all different colors. Seller is very nice and understanding. I have yet to use it but looks great  for it&#x27;s price</li>
    <li> I ordered this item expecting some caviar nails art produces, but instead I just got some random product which is more like gems. Totally different from what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper then buying that $25 dollar brand!! And so many more colors. I would like a little bit more of each color, but a little really does go a long way. Also the variety of colors is amazing. BUY!</li>
    <li> I give this product one star simply because the jars appear full of caviar beads in the picture. But when I received them I was extremely disappointed. You do get the colors you see pictured. But there isn&#x27;t enough in one jar to do a whole nail! I&#x27;m not kidding! This took a month to arrive. Of course it&#x27;s only two bucks, but seriously, it&#x27;s only beads... Why so stingy!</li>
    <li> You can use this product to add to your awesome nail art and give it a cool effect just remember less is more!</li>
    <li> I bought these wanting to try the caviar nail design. I just got them in the mail today (10/22/13) and this is my first impression:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are vivid, bright and very pretty. You, or in my case, get 4 purples ranging from a light violet to a dark purple, almost blue. There are 3 greens, light to dark. One green looks almost blue. You get 2 golds, 1 is yellow based the other more peachy. Also get a silver and 2 pinks with one being more fuchsia.  Over all decent color range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is decent. Mine came in a box, not broken nor did i find scattered beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amount can be decieving because of the plastic container they come in. The cover sort of magnifies the amount. You get half the container- I noticed I got more in some then others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delievery took 2 weeks (this is coming from CHINA) with no tracking. I actually forgot I had these coming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this is a decent product for a small price. You will probably get 3 wears out of these. I will be using them individually to make them last.</li>
    <li> Very small.  Not enough for the money paid.  One jar won&#x27;t even fill all ten of my finger nails.  Very sad</li>
    <li> I am disappointed. These beads are so small. I am not sure why the instruction says  &amp;#34;sprinkle the beads over your nail (do one at a time)&amp;#34;! it is absolutely impossible!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t waste my money on it again!</li>
    <li> 12 different colors seems like a good deal and multiple colors will be fun to play with :-)  thank you</li>
    <li> did not go as far as I would have liked but they look really cool on the nail!!  :D really cool looking.</li>
    <li> They look just as cool as they do in the picture...for the first five minutes. I&#x27;ve tried everything to keep the little beads on, but they just end up peeling off. For a party, they&#x27;re amazing and beautiful. but they&#x27;re just not practical for real life.</li>
    <li> The caviar nails didn&#x27;t come in the containers as shown in the picture. It was a little pin wheel thing and not a large amount of the product. I bought two and I am very disappointed because I would have to buy several more just to get the look that I want.</li>
    <li> the beads are beautiful and work with your nail polish.  but after you polish and top coat they fall off,  so unless you can stand in one place and not touch anything, I would not waste my time or money</li>
    <li> some of the caviar beads were stuck to the bottle of the container and wont come off. I guess when it was shook during the shipping, but otherwise it is very good. the containers are beginners size I wish I found one that was bigger.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but one of the little containers was open so it spilt everywhere :( but other than that it was great!</li>
    <li> The product changes colors once a topcoat is applied! It turns white regardless of the chosen color. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Very durable and adds that little something to your design.. Color stays on with a gel top coat. At lease that I have seen so far with the colors I used so far.. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it amount was small half full very small amount and it doesn&#x27;t stick to nail need to glue it on nail polish doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> it is just makes my nail look cool thank you I hope to see more like this in your site</li>
    <li> This caviar product is awsome. I loved the colors. It stays really good in my nails. Dont have go pay much money to get my nails done. I could do dem my self. :)</li>
    <li> First, when the package came, I opened it and noticed that it was containers of GLITTER..instead of beads. I contacted the seller and the real product took more than a month to come.. When I got it, I didn&#x27;t get some of the colors that were in the picture, such as gold, orange, and silver. Plus, a few containers barely had any beads in it, too. I haven&#x27;t tried it out as yet but I&#x27;ve had poor service and I didn&#x27;t get exactly what I wanted. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again from the same user, and neither would I recommend it from this user. If you want to buy it, buy it from another user.</li>
    <li> I tried to use the beads but a minute later try all came off... They do not stay on at all</li>
    <li> There is probably enough beads in a few containers to do a one time manicure for both hands. Some containers don&#x27;t have a lot of beads at all so I found myself mixing some of the colors. Overall though I love the colors and for the price I am pretty pleased with my purchse.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re only half way filled up because they still seem to look wonderful! I think if the color rubs off it means you&#x27;re not handling it with care, you&#x27;re supposed to DIP your nail in and I think that makes the color stay. But it looks very enjoyable in the picture and so soon I will buy it! I saw the picture of containers while they were advertising it and the containers were filled up half way, so, I think it shows you how much they&#x27;re filled. Overall I&#x27;ve put my opinion on it, four stars!</li>
    <li> these beads are so awesome! they are super cheap and there are tons of different colors! it is so expensive to buy the ones at sephora or other nail art stores, so these are a great alternative and the quality is good.</li>
    <li> use on nail it did not stay on long  i guess i did not use right for someone thatknows how use</li>
    <li> I love these beads. They are perfect for creating amazing designs. You can dip your whole nail or use individual beads to make CRAZY designs.</li>
    <li> vibrant colors, easy to apply, love the texture, will buy more for myself and sister in law, like it on toe nail too!</li>
    <li> There are so many posibilities with the great 12 colors! they are fun they come in fun size packs and the wait was worth it!</li>
    <li> Love them. Exactly what I wanted. I could not find them in stores. So glad to have found them online!</li>
    <li> SO AMAZING , the cantainers aree worth 6 dollars itself but the beads are amazing an awesome, im very happy</li>
    <li> i havnt got the nail art and its been over the time and noe there is no piont of me having it now</li>
    <li> Not even enough in one container to do all your nails. Great bargain but you have to order multiple qtys to have enough to do a whole nail set in one color.</li>
    <li> Great colors. Beads look cool. My wife enjoyed them very much. The price was very affordable too. Shipping took a bit long though</li>
    <li> The containers are about the size of a nickel, maybe a quarter. I like having the option of all the colors. The one downside is that these don&#x27;t keep their color when top coated (the Ciate ones will), so that was kind of disappointing since I do like to dry brush a topcoat on the tips of my nails.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected and not worth the time or money. Beads don&#x27;t even keep the color long. Not worth buying...</li>
    <li> ive been searching for nail caviar high and low finally found it. thankyou my order was on time and its everything i wanted</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve been a fan of nail art for a good year or so, and up until about two months or so ago everything I did consisted of creatively using the polish. But, as of late this was the first &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; I purchased. I really enjoy how small they are, and how easy they are to place and use, however, the brightly colored ones are slightly more difucult to use as they will bleed if you put a top coat over them (which you must do, otherwise they WILL fall off within minutes!).&lt;br /&gt;I personaly prefer the black, silver and gold, which work perfectly on most every polish color. They take a little time to get used to but since I&#x27;ve had them, I&#x27;ve done a different manicure every other night or so, each only taking me about fourty minues to do. It&#x27;s nice to be able to create such detailed little designs with them as well (numbers letters and shapes).&lt;br /&gt;Over all, great product, and highly recomended. Just beware of the bleeding colors, especial if the beeds are over white paint!</li>
    <li> worst product&lt;br /&gt;as soon as you put the caviar nails the start bleeding the colors of the beads are so tiny you can barely see it , you need a toothpick to try and put them on these are the worst products ever invented I won&#x27;t my recommend this unless you&#x27;re an expert they look nice in the picture but don&#x27;t let that picture deceive you believe me...I wouldn&#x27;t recommend I&#x27;m sorry but I&#x27;m only telling the truth</li>
    <li> I applied these to my daughters nails and the colors ran then all the little balls started falling off.  Will keep them for arts and crafts and not nails.</li>
    <li> Super cute love the colors and they are tiny balls. Mine got lost in the mail I guess and I contacted them and they were very nice about!! if there something wrong or a problem they are very nice about it!</li>
    <li> Color fades as soon as they go on. They change color when I apply clear polish. So I applied without top coat and the color faded when I wash my hands or use lotion the same day.</li>
    <li> The color gets wiped off with the beads when you put clear polish over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully they were really cheap.</li>
    <li> I only ordered one to begin with because it was so inexpensive so I questioned the quality.  I got the product earlier than expected and the product was way past my expectations! I will definitely be ordering these again!</li>
    <li> was all mixed together and when I finally gort it after three times getting the wrong item</li>
    <li> I expected it to be a bad product because of the price so its fine. They fall off super quick, and when you apply top coat the color comes off the beads and your nails end up looking horrible. But like i said, im not complaining because if i wanted a good quality product of caviar beads, i should have paid more.</li>
    <li> These are pretty pearly colored and really small.You get alot.&lt;br /&gt;The containers are also nice and reusable.&lt;br /&gt;Great value considering for the price.</li>
    <li> I received the product way ahead of the projected time.  In fact, products I&#x27;ve ordered from right here in the states have taken a lot longer to get here than this product that came from China!  The product is easy to apply and there are great instructional videos on YouTube as how to apply them if you are unfamiliar.  I love the fact that you get so many colors.  You can mix colors for a more interesting look.  This is simply a great product regardless, but for the price it is simply AMAZING!  I definitely give 5 stars and 5 more stars...lol!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I rate with all the stars because they look great on the nail. Its easy to apply if you love nails, recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> I like them a lot. They are the right size for nails.  The only part I am a little unhappy about is the amount of beads.  In the package I received, there was substantially less than what the picture looks like.  Maybe 1/4 of what the picture shows.  If I knew that, I would have ordered more than 1 pack.  I ordered these for my daughter for her birthday. I did not realize that, they were coming from China.  So delivery time was almost a month.  All in all, I am happy. For what I paid for the product, I got. I don&#x27;t think I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. Came super fast and very organized. I think the amount is good for beginner.</li>
    <li> Very nice nails so many people said that they liked it it&#x27;s just amazing if somebody wants to buy this they should</li>
    <li> It came fast and it looks amazing on the nails. There are so many different ways to use it and also mixing the colors together is the best.</li>
    <li> I love the idea and they look fantastic when you put them on but they fall off very easily, even if you put a nice thick coat of polish down and push them into it. I tried to paint over them with a clear coat to get them to stay and it took the color off</li>
    <li> As soon as you put on a clear coat the beads turn silver or fall off!  There is not enough beads in 1 jar (which is tiny) to do 2 full hands.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the beads. I just don&#x27;t like the look of them on me. You know how you see someone else with something and you want to do it too, well that&#x27;s why I ordered them. Like I said they are fine but just not for me.</li>
    <li> These are awful. The color comes off with a top coat, the container looks NOTHING like the picture and you get about 95% LESS beads than shown. When I first opened the package ALL of the beads were mixed together, most of the slots were empty, and most of the beads were in the envelope. I am so disappointed I asked the seller for my money back. I can not stress enough what an awful product this is.</li>
    <li> OK, I didn&#x27;t mind them at first, yes they are smaller than other beads like this and they are not all the same size.  My main problem is that the colors run or rub off.  I do my nails at night and the next morning there is very little color left on the beads.  If I use them for nail art and put a top coat on the color all runs off into the top coat and looks terrible.  I have tried several different clear polishes and top coats and they all make the colors run.  I wouldn&#x27;t even recommend this to a beginner.  You work really hard to get all these tiny beads in place only to have the colors run its just sad.</li>
    <li> These are really cool when you learn how to apply it. Looks better on the picture though. Altogether worth the price</li>
    <li> Caviar was too big for my nails, and all of them turned silver when I coated them with clear polish. If I glued them on, same thing. I ended up just placing them on the nail before the nail polish dried, but they didn&#x27;t last very long. Not even 24 hrs. I tried it on both acrylic and natural nails.</li>
    <li> I just received my order of these today and immediately had to try them out. They arrived quicker than expected and were a great price for the amount that I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the right polish with these nail caviar bits, they will last a long time. I&#x27;ve already washed dishes and my nails are still looking amazing!</li>
    <li> Very cheap! But it took forever to deliver! Doesn&#x27;t work as good as I hoped it did, they only stayed on my nails for a few hours, they lasted almost two days on my sister but thats because she used super glue.. but oh well, my 4 year old daughter likes them.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of colors but not a lot of each color. It takes almost all of the beads of one color to just cover one nail. Very cool though!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this product for a caviar manicure. There are simple not enough beads. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t buy it for that purpose. I got it to use for accent studs on my nails. With this use, the product will probably last a long time. However, I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;caviar&amp;#34; nails. That being said, Shipping was very nice. Nothing spilled and the box it arrived in was not ripped or mangled.&lt;br /&gt;Some containers were filled halfway, others maybe 1/4 or 1/3 of the way filled. As much as I would like them to be filled to the tippy top, that would be slightly impossible because then all the beads would spill out upon opening....there&#x27;s a lot of friction and they&#x27;d go flying. It would be nice, however, for them all to be uniformly filled. That way, there&#x27;s noting to compare them to.</li>
    <li> This purchase lived up to what was expected.  The compartments were all full and looked like advertised.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Completely pleased with the delivery time of this product, just not pleased with the product itself. Despite using nail glue to adhere them, the little balls break off far too easily if you&#x27;re someone who actually uses your hands for anything at all, don&#x27;t get them.</li>
    <li> The shipling time was great but the product was not what I expected.  I did expect the container to be a bit bigger.  The product is difficult to use becauee of the process of applying them.</li>
    <li> Yes, I know, you can&#x27;t always go by the picture of what you are getting. I was a little disappointed in the difference between the fullness of the jars in the picture and the lack thereof in the product upon its arrival.</li>
    <li> The wife has had a lot of fun with these. when I told her what I paid, she thought it was awesome!</li>
    <li> a lot of people were complaining about the jars being less than half full, but mine are filled to the top! love the colors it comes with!!!</li>
    <li> These are super cool. I&#x27;m a nail person with really sensitive skin and an unwillingness to pay $20 at a salon, so I do all the design things at home about once a week. These are great for doing geometric designs, glitter designs, whatever. The value is awesome too. If you like to do your nails, I definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use this yet but it looks pretty and i&#x27;ll try it with nail glue so it stays on longer</li>
    <li> Will be posting pics for this one as the size of the containers was questionable to me.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, my daughters love em and super super cheap.&lt;br /&gt;A long wait for delivery, though well before deadline so great job there to the vendor too.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more for certain.</li>
    <li> I like the colors, it is very versatile and easy to create different designs on little girls finger nails. I like it!</li>
    <li> I bought these to use in card making.  I have plastic bubbles and I want to use theses as snow globes.  It&#x27;s kinda hard to explain.</li>
    <li> I enjoy nail art and bought these caviar beads on a whim. Although they took a while to arrive from Asia, the product is as described and easy to use. I recommend applying them with to your gel nail polish BEFORE curing then applying the top coat for added strength. My main knock on them is that the color rubs off easily and dissolves (it has a bronzy/goldish color underneath, at least the pink ones do) with time and even with the application of a top coat.</li>
    <li> Just as described. These are fun beads to use to decorate your nails or what ever else you might have in mind. They each come in a nice little container for storage. What more could you want.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use it with my shelac products. DON&#x27;T DO IT!. Haven&#x27;t tried it with regular nail polish yet.</li>
    <li> Price wasn&#x27;t bad, just took forever to get to me; since it ships over seas. The colors were very pretty, more of a pastel color to them with a pearl like finish. A bit tricky to use at first, but I recommend you use them only on occasion &amp; not everyday. They tend to fall of very easily.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely awful quality. The color bleeds off of them in less than ten minutes of using them for my nail art. Once the color comes off (and this includes ALL the colors, even silver) the little beads are clear see-through. So cheap. So ugly. Such a waste of money. I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Spend your money on something of a higher quality.</li>
    <li> Love all the colors the only issues i had was different amounts in each container and some of the colors i like more and they happens to be the ones with less beads.</li>
    <li> Great...Great....Great...!!! It was very beautiful... I bought it for my mom and she really like it. Thanksssss a lot!!!I will recommend it all my friends.😃😃😃😃</li>
    <li> This product is cute however it comes in small containers that fills 2 fingernails. it&#x27;s cute if you want to do different colors in each nail.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed!! Had very little in it... so not worth it. I give it a big thumbs down never buy again! !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 4 years old grand.  She loves them.  Oh what mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can really say is, they came in great conditions.  Nothing broken or spilled.</li>
    <li> Love it! Super cute and exactly as shown, and the best part is the colors. Along with the price too.</li>
    <li> leaves a great effect on the nails, are very good, my girlfriend liked him charming and cheap. thank you very much</li>
    <li> The colors are very pretty. I don&#x27;t really like the way they look on my nails, but that is a personal preference. They are also hard to get off my nails. It is difficult to deal with the static cling also.</li>
    <li> Beads are awesome and fun to use. Only negative is they&#x27;re a little smaller than I thought they would be, and each individual bead ranges in size. It isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker, but a little frustrating when you have to look through and find even sized pieces.</li>
    <li> it ok. the color nice but she has to fill it a little bit more. some of then was ok but some was a little bit empty.</li>
    <li> Not worth the time, money AND THE HUSTLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took four weeks to arrive and when they did I was surprised of how tiny the compartments were! Don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;العلب وايد صغيرة وماتستاهل المبلغ المطلوب ولا الوقت اللازم للشحن. تشحن من الصين وتحتاج من أربع الى ثمان أسابيع!!! وكاتبين بلد الشحن امريكا في التفاصيل.</li>
    <li> So disappointed. The jars are not even HALF full like shown in the picture, they are very small &amp; you will have used all of the beads just on one finger...not a good look. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest these, especially at the price. Not to mention that it took FOREVER for them to come in the mail. I might be returning these...</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES these! She thought the beads themselves were cute but she was especially impressed by the cute little containers they came in!! Ha!</li>
    <li> These are really annoying. They fall off really easily. I dont reccomend  them though. They arent that good. They fall everywhere</li>
    <li> Daughter likes this product as she is able to make things on her nails and show them to friends.  Her nails are pretty</li>
    <li> These beads are an OK quality, they are way way smaller then what the picture makes it seem like. Also it doesnt come with all the different colors shown or the little cases shown in the second and third pictures.</li>
    <li> wow i absolutly love the colors! Perfect for nails! ...... &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; come on really people. I loved them just order  one more or 2 more I am for that price!!! shipped in 3 weeks ..... I didnt mind and packaged perfectly! no spill ..... they do give you more then others(some are full and some 3/4 the way) ..... to be exact for you! &#x3D;) but hey I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
    <li> I just received these beads today and it has taken only 3 days to get to me. I love the colors and they are easy to work with as well. The only problem I have is that the picture makes the containers look larger than they really are. I expected to get more product, but for the price I&#x27;m not going to complain too much! I&#x27;m looking forward to using these! :)</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 12 year old neice. She loved them. She is good with manicures and made some really pretty designs out of them.</li>
    <li> This is not the best product. It does not stay on the nail at all or if it does it won&#x27;t stay on for long. I&#x27;ve tried using it about six times.</li>
    <li> My Grand daughter loved them---thank you</li>
    <li> Very happy with my order!</li>
    <li> The item description stated that the Caviar would come in clear containers with their own lids.  I received my order today and I was upset at what I was seeing not only is it not in separate containers but the amount isn&#x27;t enough to do half a nail they sent me a round wheel with just a few beads.</li>
    <li> The picture is definitely deceiving!! I received this and it&#x27;s so small. There is barely any kind of beads in the tiny plastic containers it came in! Not even half way filled. Looks like barely enough for 2-3 uses IF you dont use it on a complete nail! what a disappointment!!</li>
    <li> Hardly has any beads in all of them. And why do you have the nail tools in the picture if it doesn&#x27;t come with. One of the reasons I got it is because I thought the tools came with it.</li>
    <li> The color bleeds period! I don&#x27;t want to work so hard with a product for beautiful nails so I found a much better alternative. If you do choose these please beware! I tried this product with traditional and gel polish. The beads come off very easily when you wash your hands, when you cook, when you eat...they just don&#x27;t do it for me. Plus the half filled containers are definitely a turn off.</li>
    <li> I have used these on myself and my bfs mom. In both cases I soaked them off and did something else. I used with gel nails and I don&#x27;t like the way they look. The color wipes off if you dab with clear coat or wipe. The effect is sloppy no matter how thick or then the clear coat. I would not recommend to anyone who likes perfection.</li>
    <li> I buy this item for my daughter, and she loves it! The colors are beautiful. I just loved it. 0</li>
    <li> Although the product looked liked the picture being placed, the quantity and the sizes werent up for my standards. They were very small...</li>
    <li> This product came about 2 weeks ago and the containers look a lot smaller than pictured and they had marl any thing in them also the beads are extremely small</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I add this onto my nails! They&#x27;re great! Just the right size, and the colors are true to the picture, it&#x27;s easy to apply, can be a little messy like glitter, but hey it&#x27;s totally worth it! And yes it does come from far away, but definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great as long as you are careful. they make a mess and arent easy to apply with kids. But i use them for myself and they are cute. They fall off in a day, but I just reapply...</li>
    <li> When I got these I was so excited &amp; they seemed like they would have been easy to use but maybe I need to watch a youtube video I could NOT make them look as good as I have seem before</li>
    <li> I have not one good thing to say about this product. The picture is extrememly misleading. What you actually receive has barley anything in it. Not enough to do one caviar nail. I dont know what to enough do with the product to be honest. I will probably just thow it out. It is deff. Not worth your money. Wont recommend to ANYONE! Try the Martha Stewart Microbeads!</li>
    <li> These are really cute.  I only hate that the color starts coming off of the beads when a clear top coat is added.</li>
    <li> Purchased these a year ago... still have never recived them. I paid for these and I have not recived them.</li>
    <li> its fun to used.the sad thing its a small container enough for one used</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I love my nail accessories!</li>
    <li> Great product, I use these when I do my nails. Love the colors an use these when I want to have fun.</li>
    <li> its soo little in the containers</li>
    <li> i love this iteam its so easy to use and once on your nail it looks so good. I really recomend this itam to anyone and everyone</li>
    <li> got these for my goddaughter, she is really into nail design so I bought her a bunch of items from this seller because the prices were so great. Going to put it all together and give her a nail design kit for Christmas. These are cute and I think seh will be very creative with them but I wish each container was fuller...there are not that many in each tub</li>
    <li> I like this product it was easy to put on and great colors and it was fun to do cool</li>
    <li> They are cute, but not easy to use. They stick and cling to everything. Does not come with anything to put them on with.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  My clients just love it. Love the colors and will be ordering more soon looks very pretty when you incorporate it to your manicure.</li>
    <li> they do not even stay on your nails. they stink they dont stick to your nails and they come right off.</li>
    <li> It was very messy, stained the nail, and came off very easily. I didn&#x27;t care for it and I have a pre-teen daughter and her and her friends like to do their nails and these tiny beads were EVERYWHERE.</li>
    <li> Add some spice to shellac. It arrived with in two weeks. The containers are small, but overall not dipleased.</li>
    <li> I was displeased with this because they&#x27;re not full like the picture. This was a big disappointment but since it so cheap I guess I got what I paid for....lol!!!</li>
    <li> I thought that the amount of beads would be more...I mean it looks like a good amount of beads in the picture but when I got the package and opened it up, the beads were half of the container and could only cover 4 of my nails...I would rather buy these beads at Micheals for a much bigger quantity so each of my fingernails could be covered with the same color. Also when I put on the top coat the color came off the beads and it ended up being silver...I don&#x27;t recommend this buy.</li>
    <li> a little tricky to figure out, no instructions came with, but you can go online and print instructions....take your time and your nails will come out great!!!</li>
    <li> I thought I would get more nail caviar per container, but overall I am satisfied and content with my selection.  I love the cute container that it comes in.</li>
    <li> I just didn&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
    <li> this is a cool fun product for nail art i love these my girls love the way it looks as well i would buy more</li>
    <li> Depending on how you use them they can look amazing or they can be tacky.  I suggest looking on U tube and getting some ideas on how to use these first.  Some of the containers got static charged somehow and the &amp;#34;caviar&amp;#34; floated all over the inside of the jar.  So when you open the jar the caviar go all over trying to discharge the static.  Only 2 jars (silver and gold) did that static thing.  Maybe they used real metal in it?  That&#x27;s cool!  Other than that they look very small and are very easy to use once you know how you want to use them.  If you cover your whole nail in them you will go through an entire jar in one shot.  That&#x27;s why I say get some ideas.  Either that or be prepared to buy more.  :)</li>
    <li> I I didn&#x27;t know it were small bottles, but i happy, for the price and the difference colors, are nice.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful to work with. I love them!</li>
    <li> Love caviar beads especially these colors that came in this set. Well worth the wait and can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
    <li> Came quickly. Smaller than expected and no instructions on how to use but the product came as seen in the picture so I was happy.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected by overall it was okay I brought it for my two little girls so they can do something different to their nails</li>
    <li> I should have read all the comment before I bought this product, looks great when you put it on but if you put a top coat the colors fades away. I guess for the prize I cant complain.</li>
    <li> Since it&#x27;s listed as twelve colors of the beads, I expected twelve different colors. However, there were only nine different colors since three of them were duplicates. The colors I received weren&#x27;t even much of a variety; almost all red, gold, orange and not even any blues or greens! Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Can wait to use them in my hands love them very much and my daughter love them too.. can wait to use them on her. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Be aware you do not recieve what it shows in pictures, agree with the 90% less than in picture.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved the price and the idea. But it was hard to use. Maybe if you are a professional manicurist...but for the average person. It was messy and clumsy to use.</li>
    <li> I was very excited for these To come the colors are beautiful, however,  they don&#x27;t come with a lot. they come with enough to maybe use on one or two nails and you have to sprinkle them on by hand you can&#x27;t dip your nail in the little container because they are too small. I like them but I was disappointed in the amount you get. But then again you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> its very nice item :) very beatiful :)</li>
    <li> I love this set of caviar. You can mix and match and really be creative. I have gotten so many compliments. I will definately be buying more of this when i run out. This summer I will try them on my toes to see how long it holds up. I used seche vite UV top coat, and I also used IBD UV gel top cop coat to see which one was more durable and they both held the caviar in place for approx 1 week. I used two coats of both. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> i was excited when i received them but then looking closer i noticed that they were not all filled with the same amount.  so were pretty empty.</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to get something awesome, but this was more for kids, not even that. Complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I mean they don&#x27;t cover your ENTIRE nail, but they are super stylish and so many different colors! They match with any out fit!</li>
    <li> i was really excited to get these. ive been wanting to try out the caviar look for awhile. it was really easy to put on and looked really then. but then all the color came off the beads :-( now they all look silver. you dont get a lot either, i thought the containers would be a lot bigger. i had enough in one container to do 2 nails. this is not what i was expecting but im still getting compliments.</li>
    <li> The product is how it shows in the image, however it is in small quanties. It is smaller that the picture shows. Did arrive earlier than estimated. Have not used it yet</li>
    <li> hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love my Caviar Nail arte, it realy looks pretty beautiful and its art. the only complain is that it brings to little, but its 12 diffrent colors so its osome.</li>
    <li> I love my caviar pearls! It&#x27;s really cool. It&#x27;s small but is ok for me, the colors are beautiful and It&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
    <li> These beads took forever to get to my house! I still haven&#x27;t received them! I hope they get here soon because I&#x27;m becoming impatient</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the plastic beads simply because the colors run and falls fairly easy. I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I thought that the caviar would come in individual containers but it came in a wheel and all of them were mixed together. Spend the extra money and go somewhere else!</li>
    <li> Wow this lasted not even minutes! The painting chipped off like nothing! &amp; shipping doesn&#x27;t help either!</li>
    <li> Very cool look. Lots of great colors. Acetone does pull the color off he balls though... Idk if that&#x27;s typical so clean up with a dry brush</li>
    <li> Great product, will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t used with acrylic it will take the color off! Other than that I love them it gives my nails a 3D look with my nail art! Use clear polish!</li>
    <li> I was so glad to get these but was disappointed when when the little container contained 1/4 of product in there. I expected atleast 1/3 or maybe 1/2 but not 1/4 of the product. Sorry will not by this again. Expecially when i found xmas gifts contained more then what i payed for and for less price.</li>
    <li> its very nice and looks good and i like it alot so thanks for the good deal and will not be the last</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these things. She is a nails freak. She is always doing her nails so I thought this would be good for her.</li>
    <li> Nothing but a mess!!! A good deal though!</li>
    <li> So messy!!!!!!!! Stained my table, carpet, and couch.. Looks cool lasts for a while if you do it right.</li>
    <li> Very small containers and very messy</li>
    <li> OK product.very messy to attach</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that the color of the caviar changes after I put a top coat on! Its very pretty, but I would like the original color to remain once I put on a top coat</li>
    <li> i loved using these beads for acrylic nail art. i will be ordering more maybe a bigger size though. the containers of the  beads are about the size of a quater and not so deep. everyone requested these beads but i did not have enough to do all ten nails. i would use them just for an accent nail.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;m not really sure what I was supposed to do with all these little balls.  Doesn&#x27;t really seems like they&#x27;d stay on your nails - even if you did want little balls/ beads on your nails.</li>
    <li> Dont get it. The beads fall off if you dknt aply a top coat and if you aply a top coat the color bleads anf it just looks like you painted your nails (regurally) but as if youve done a verry bad job</li>
    <li> It took a while for them to come in but I must say they are awesome!!!! Love the colors and amount given so ready to do my nails one happy lady!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> these are cute and really good to carry around if you love to do nails!! My girls love these and we mix and match them!</li>
    <li> Comes in small plastic containers- great color selection</li>
    <li> Such a great look for nails. I received this promptly and in great condition. I would recommend this dealer to anyone.</li>
    <li> The color of the beads wash off even without the top coat. I ran them under water to test them and the beads turned completely clear.</li>
    <li> 1/3 of my containers might as well be empty. Literally. 2 of the 12 are half full the rest are under 1/4 - 4 of which I coukd count the tiny beads by looking through the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect teeny tiny beads - the pics are right but are taken up clise so perception may be thry are bigger than the actual size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received:&lt;br /&gt;- black, looks great but virtually empty so its useless to me&lt;br /&gt;- silver, as above&lt;br /&gt;- gold, as above&lt;br /&gt;- metallic purple, looks good and have half a container&lt;br /&gt;- metallic fuschia, as above&lt;br /&gt;- pale pink pearl, looks ok at best but barely 1/4 full&lt;br /&gt;- metallic dark pink, as above&lt;br /&gt;- metallic red, as above&lt;br /&gt;- multi color, looks kinda terrible and is virtually empty&lt;br /&gt;- pale yellow, looks ugh and is under 1/4 full&lt;br /&gt;- pale turquoise, as above&lt;br /&gt;- turquoise, looks ok but under 1/4 full&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this was a waste of time and money, I think I would rather pay a little more and receive a product I can use.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought&lt;br /&gt;By the time I received item I had forgotten that I ordered it but still happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I like this look because it&#x27;s something different.  They started popping off almost instantly.  Even after reading advice about covering them with a clear coat.  I&#x27;ve given up on them.  Even just having them on a French tip didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of nail design with my friends and I and we absolutely love the color selection and endless possibilities. Great deal too!</li>
    <li> Its easy to use and within minutes your nails look like they were done at a salon. I like that it comesvwith so many different colors so you can choose a color according to your mood. Its fun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with this caviar beas. Perfect colors, easy to use and of course looks great. I recommend this product. :)</li>
    <li> the colors are by far the most exceptional and rich colors i have ever laid eyes on. i am so excited to try these tiny spheres on my nails... seriously, the colors look 20 times better in person.. so beautiful.</li>
    <li> EXCELENT ALL I M HAPPY&lt;br /&gt; VERY  THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;br /&gt; I HOPE WILL BE YOU CUSTOMER AGAIN SOON</li>
    <li> waste of money. they color your fingers, and dont stick, they fall off, stain your fingers. wasn&#x27;t happy with them at all.</li>
    <li> These beads stick on better than the $25.00 kit from Sephora! The beads are smaller and they are actually somewhat metal and magnetic to eachother. I work at a water park and usually the chlorine destroys anything I put on my nails but these bad boys are still on and it&#x27;s awesome! be prepared to wait a little while though but it&#x27;s all worth it</li>
    <li> I ordered these at the very beginning of october, and they got here yesterday. I tested them today and the containers are about 25% full, the picture is very misleading. When you put the top coat on top of the &amp;#34;caviar&amp;#34; it strips most of the color. also when you put the caviar on the container is too small to dip your finger in. They are very small with a metallic hue almost, they are easy for beginners. Next time i will purchase something else though.</li>
    <li> They came right on time, with a cute little package to hold them. They work great and stay on nails well. I also like that there are different sizes for the balls</li>
    <li> took a while to receive the item. the containers are very small. smaller than the size of a quarter. will post a picture of the contents as well. have yet to try it</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors. Easy to use. Easy to open containers and perfect size for my nail kit! Will buy again</li>
    <li> These microbeads make great accents, but if you are looking to be able to dip your nails into the container in order to achieve the popular Caviar manicure look, you may be disappointed by the small size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there is no way to choose your desired colors, I found that my package came with a wide assortment. When working with these, it is best to work over a small bowl because you will most likely spill quite a bit. If working over a bowl, you can simply pour the spilled beads back into their original container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that if using the beads with a cheap top coat, the colors will bleed away. I had no problem when using a higher quality top coat such as Seche Vite.</li>
    <li> packaged very well  there not like the real cavier beads but if your looking for a cheaper version buy this dont stay on that well,colors are pretty</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the beads. Its a pretty good price for 12 colors. The containers per beads are about the size of a soda bottle cap. When placing them on i would recommend doing your base coat at least 30min after you apply bcuz you don&#x27;t want the color to come off</li>
    <li> Not really much to use on my nails... One color is enough for like one nail and that&#x27;s it :/</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on my daughter and they kept comming off or if she ate something with her hands they fell off in her mouth so she dont like them</li>
    <li> Great price for the beads. They usually cost a lot more. Easy to use but very hard to vacuum out of carpet so be careful of that.</li>
    <li> These beads are super cute...too bad they come less than half full! Not much else to say other than when I spend my hard earned money on a product, I expect to receive the full amount expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Excellent Transaction.  Sturdy containers with beautiful colors. Good quality product.  I like to pick them up and shake them around sometimes just to see the little tiny balls going around then making shapes with the static.</li>
    <li> They were exactly what I wanted &amp; I love the colors...</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading, so be aware that you will receive about 90% less of what&#x27;s shown and it gets pretty messy. I advise you to work over a small plastic bowl/ box because the compartments aren&#x27;t big enough for you to dip your fingers into. It is still worth it for a beginner (my nails look CUTE). GOOD LUCK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very angry that I ordered this. I received a horrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the beads are way smaller than normal beads like this. They&#x27;re like fine sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there&#x27;s almost nothing in there!! The cases can&#x27;t be more than 2cm in diameter. and I only got one case that was almost half full. I don&#x27;t even have enough beads to finish more than 3 nails. I don&#x27;t want my nails a bunch of different colors. And speaking of colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, The colors were horrible!! I didn&#x27;t get white/ivory which is the only one I wanted. 6 out of the 12 colors I got were a shade of pink which I thought was stupid. I want variety!! Also the bronze/ orange or whatever color it was supposed to be is so ugly, it&#x27;s unusable. It&#x27;s literally the color of feces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. The is one of the worst things I&#x27;ve ever ordered. Very disappointed and upset.</li>
    <li> not as many beads as i thought but omg i love using these.. all the neighborhood girls have had \\&quot;pretty nails\\&quot; also maybe the seller would consider adding a funnel- it&#x27;s sooo hard to get em back into the little containers...</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using these beads. They worked really well and im suprised of how well they stayed on. Thank you</li>
    <li> i got these for my nails and i wasnt very impressed. you get small little containers and the beads stick to the lids. there a mess. after you get them on the colors bleed out on to your nails, and if you put a clear coat on them to hold them in place its even worse. the color bleeds out 10x worse and the beads get a faded color so your nails look kinda cheap.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I&#x27;m so happy with my order.  For those saying you dont get as much as pictured, you do.  That picture is just obviously magnified.  The caviar is standard caviar size, and I received a great assortment of colors.  I just did a french manicure with them and I love it.  I just dipped my wet nail into the pot, instead of trying to pour them onto the nail.  It&#x27;s a much easier and less messy way to do things.  And the color didn&#x27;t bleed when I applied a top coat.  I did them last night, and when I woke up they were all still in place.  They stayed in place even after my shower this morning.  As long as you use a quality top coat you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with them moving once the polish is all dry.  I would buy again and again!</li>
    <li> MY FRIENDS ARE SO JEALOUS!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;the caviars works great, and they look great too.</li>
    <li> This item is as described and is a quality product.  I would buy again.  Slow shipping, but for the price, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Caviar for your nails is a new hip thing. My nail diva next door (sweet little girl) wanted some. I got it. It was extremely inexpensive and she loves dressing up her manicures! Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product if you are trying to keep up with the nail fads!!</li>
    <li> I like the effect caviar nails gives me,but i was wishing the containers to be a bit bigger; however i still like them</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this set! It has all the colors needed and they all come in a plastic case that keeps them together. Perfect for doing accent nails with a lot left over.</li>
    <li> Not at all as cute as they look I orders them thinking I would love them on my nails ummm not so much so they rant as cute in person and fall off no matter how u let them dry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice with nail decorating, but I think its fun. This has made it all the better. This is a very good product &amp; will be buying again</li>
    <li> they arrived be fore the suggested date, the main reason i gave it 3 stars was that most of the containers didnt seem to be full. all the containers have varying levels of beeds in them and none of them are all the way full it seems.</li>
    <li> When I purchased these, I had read reviews that stated the containers are small and could only do three nails of each color, and that some colors are so similar you can&#x27;t tell them apart and fade after top coat application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small size of the container is true. There is no way you could do all ten fingers in one color. I bought these to try before I buy full size and is the perfect amount to do on just one accent finger. Also, I mixed three colors together. It looks fabulous, and you could definitely do both hands this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors were just as pictured. No two were the same or even similar. To get clear coat over these beads, you almost have to &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; it on top. I didn&#x27;t find any fade in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these as a trial to see if I liked but honestly, I will probably purchase two more. You can&#x27;t beat the quality or the price.</li>
    <li> I was able to create a great style with this material. Plus its really inexpensive which is great for me.</li>
    <li> I AM AMAZED HOW THIS PRODUCT TURNED OUT TO BE. IT ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY BUT UNFURTANELY THEY WERE ALMOST EMPTY AFTER MY FIRST REVIEW THE SELLER CONTACTED ME AND OFFEREDED TO SEND ANOTHER ONES WITHOUT ANY COST, NEDLESS TO SAY I AM VERY PLEASE FOR THE COSTUMER SERVICE, AND IN FACT NOW THAT I RECEIVED THE NEW ONES THEY ARE BETTER AND THE CONTAINERS ARE FULLER. I TRIEDTHEM AND THEY LAST. VERY HAPPY.</li>
    <li> i love these everyone be asking about my nails and what shop i went to and i smile and say amazon and i put them on myself lol.</li>
    <li> The beads change colors when you apply a clear top coat, i&#x27;ve read other caviar instructions and it says not to apply one, but how else will the beads stay in place? So I applied one and some of the beads still have their color while the others turned clear. Also the containers come with different amounts of beads none have the same amount, in which i was disappointed by, then again I guess you get what you pay for. Best if used as an accent nail.</li>
    <li> I loved these beads they were super easy to use &amp; in expensive &amp;&amp; I got a lot of compliments when I did my nils...will buy more in the future  😊</li>
    <li> Low quality beads, some containers were almost empty, colors were mixed. Beads won&#x27;t stick to your wet nail polish for nothing, as soon as it dries they roll right out your nail. Awful experience. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Adds such a beautiful look for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to go to a nail place and spend $40+ though it was a little difficult to apply to nails, beauty is pain!</li>
    <li> love this product...it adds so much personality to nails &amp; toes... have to be gentle whrn using them, they roll everywhere lol! thank you</li>
    <li> Thanks for the supplies, great shipping time.  Appriciate the availability.  Cannot wait to try them out. Love that they came in a container other than plastic wrap &#x3D;-)</li>
    <li> There were no directions on how to use it or anything to use to apply it.  Came quickly in the mail.</li>
    <li> first time day i got them i used them and i love them as soon as i need some more im going to place another order</li>
    <li> Although the vials were only partially full, for the price it was a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are nice, and the item shipped promptly and arrived over a week ahead of schedule.&lt;br /&gt;It only took 2 days to process, and 8 business days to arrive from Hong Kong to Arizona, USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the seller is always this prompt with processing, I would recommend again.</li>
    <li> She loves them and wants more!  Just wish they weren&#x27;t so small as they appear a bit larger in picture.  Not enough in each container to do a full manicure but loads of fun!</li>
    <li> I think caviar nails Look great and i got it at a great price love love love love the product recommend.</li>
    <li> Ok so I got this like 2 months later  which is bad and it barley comes with any its not even filled halfway</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beads started falling off 2 hours after I put them on and the colors fades almost instantly and you are left with a mess!</li>
    <li> once you put the caviar on top of the clear nail polish it bleeds. Not happy about that on a pale background.</li>
    <li> It comes with a lot more than most sets. Its pretty and works well. I recommend for buyers looking for low price, broad selection nail caviar. :)</li>
    <li> it had twelve different colors and it came in really cute containers i loved all the colors and they are as advertised. came around date stated.</li>
    <li> Shipment took kinda long, but that was expected since i knew beforehand it was coming from a long distance away. The beads fell Off my naila easily, and never lasted more than a few hours.</li>
    <li> It says Caviar beads and i got a bunch of glitter and i have to wait like a month to get it &gt;:(</li>
    <li> THIS IS A  FUN AND CUTE NEW WAY TO MAKE YOUR NAILS LOOK DIFFERENT. I love that it comes with a variety of lovely colors for one low price and you can just mix them to ur hearts desire to achieve many different looks and combinations. (the packaging it comes in is also cute)</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t mind the small amounts just the colors they show do not really match or sparkle like the pictures shown. won&#x27;t buy it again that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> Got what I paid for, but I can&#x27;t get them to stick to my nails..  cheap cheap like the price</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about ordering something like this sight unseen and from china. But this was great. I was pleasantly surprised at how fast I received the item. It wasn&#x27;t due to arrive for nearly over a month, but I got in just under a week. Great colors included, I received 3 pinks (my favorite color so no complaints from me on that) 2 silver, 1 red, 1 black, 1 blue, 1 gold, 2 green, 1 kinda hot pink looking color (again not complaining since I looooove pink). Each in its own lil pot, with a screw on lid for security. Pots are clear so you can see the colors, they come about half filled which looks to be about a half once of beads. Which is good if you do like I do and just dip your tacky (slightly wet nail) in the pot. Hope this review helps and detailed enough to help make your mind up. It&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Terrible. When you put a top coat of clear nail polish on it, (because that&#x27;s what you are supposed to do) the color comes right off of the bead turning it to silver.</li>
    <li> While the price is fantastic, you cannot apply a top coat whatsoever as it pulls the color entirely off of the beads.  Without a top coat they will stay on your fingers two days at most.</li>
    <li> Okay these are really cute, but they were poorly packaged. One of the little containers was open so they are all over the envelope. Other than that they were pretty cute. Some of them aren&#x27;t full enough to do much with but worth the price.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this first it got lost somewhere and I contacted the seller and they resend it. What I received? Ridiculously empty containers that will barely be enough to cover 1 nail. POINTLESS!! Do not buy this item you will waste your money (or at least make sure that the seller is a trusted one)</li>
    <li> This order kind of disappointed me simply because the pots were so small and so were the beads..I thought they were a little bigger than that..I&#x27;ll still use them though..</li>
    <li> I loooove this product!These beads are such a hot seller. My clients request candy coated nails. The package is nice too with the little containers for each color of beads. I&#x27;ll be re-ordering this product real soon!</li>
    <li> I got the effect I was looking for, but! The only problem I had was when I put a clear top coat of polish on top of them, the pink changed colors &#x3D;/ So I guess watch out if you put a top coat on these</li>
    <li> you have to really secure these with a heavy top coat, or better for acrylic and gel where you can tap into polish for more secure fashion.  if you do those things, then they are fun!  hard to come off those.  can&#x27;t have it both ways.</li>
    <li> beAUTIFUL COLORS  YOU CAN DO A FRENCH STILE  YOU CAN USE IT IN A LOT OF CRAFTS NOT ONLY MANICURE  BE CREATIVE</li>
    <li> What I received is actually what was pictured- They came in a nice package and each color were in seperate containers BUT not all the them contained the same about of beads.  When I turned the package on its side, you could see that 1 or 2 of the containers were filled about half way with beads, while others (like the hot pink) seemed to only be filled like 1/4 of the way.  (probably only enough to do 1 maybe 2 caviar nails)  I like the product and I can&#x27;t wait to use them, but I definitely recommend ordering more than one if you are going to do the caviar nail or are just planning on using a few of the colors as that may be the color that is only 1/4 of the way filled.  Only marginally satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic price!!!  my daughter uses this all the time, it has encouraged her to grow her nails because they look so pretty....  Cavier nails is great product, I even use it...  We found this on a site called best holiday gifts to give ....  You will love it....</li>
    <li> The colors are even prettier in person!  Will be ordering more!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!  This is exactly how it is described, even better in person!</li>
    <li> I was SO excited to use these inexpensive caviar beads! I waited weeks for them to arrive (before the estimated delivery date) and I quickly got to work experimenting. I intended to use them in combination with Gelish polish to give them a longer lasting look than the sephora brand method. As soon as i laid them into my gel polish they color started to melt away, it muddied the polish and the destroyed the look. I tried setting the beads in the sticky layer, color melted, i set the beads in a gelish polish layer, color melted, I set the beads quicker and top coated and cured, again melted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the beads with regular OPI polish with the same result. I guess i could try using them as a scrap book embellishment, but so far I have wasted a few bucks and multiple hours of my time trying to make this happen, If anybody finds a better way, please fill me in!</li>
    <li> I am a \\&quot;do it yourselfer\\&quot; when it comes to my nails. I am willing to try new techniques and products on my own. This was definitely a challenge but, so intriguing that I will absolutely do it again.</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to get something awesome, but this was more for kids, not even that. Complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of these but I can&#x27;t seem to keep them on. I even put a clearcoat on top and they fell off before that night.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone that loves to dazzle with their manicure! Easy to apply, and fun to explore your creative side with.</li>
    <li> i was extreamly happy with the really fast shipping, it got here 2 weeks before the estamated delivery date  (arrived feb 1- estamated day feb 13) i love them they are exactly what i expected, the only problem (witch i do not see it as a big problem) is simply they are not as full as they apear to be in the picture, the amount in each container would only completely cover 2 maybe 3 nails, but i am only usuing it as tip, so i believe this item is a great buy</li>
    <li> Product came super quick.Super excited but to my disappointment black was not included. which is what i wanted. There were 4 different shades of green and 5 different shades of pink/purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 2nd 2013&lt;br /&gt;After having these beads in my stash for a while i decided to finally use them. I was highly disappointed! When i went to to put a top coat over the beads the color began to rub off of them!</li>
    <li> So easy to use and its good quality for the price. It shipped pretty fast as well. I will sure order again</li>
    <li> I like the colors, but the problems are that first the container is very tiny and some colors have enough caviar for only one nail. they don&#x27;t have the same amount, and it does not look the same way it does in the picture. but on the other side i thought the price was very good, and it&#x27;s worth for begginers.</li>
    <li> I used these right away. They look great. I was complemented the moment I went out. They were easy to apply and look great specially with a top coat.</li>
    <li> Really nice lot of caviar! I don&#x27;t really like the feel of them on my nails, but I use them for other crafty projects, especially as sprinkles for tiny clay desserts. This came with lots of nice colors and the containers are really cute, after I run out I can re-purpose them for chap stick!</li>
    <li> These are exactly what you&#x27;d expect. If you&#x27;ve never seen nail caviar, very very small. I&#x27;ve used them to accent manicures so far but haven&#x27;t put them all over a nail yet... looks like a daunting prospect, but I will soon!</li>
    <li> I love these already, my package came with a lot of beads and the individual containers are decent sized, I like personally love it and is enough for my nails</li>
    <li> As someone that loves to do their nails I like to try these different styles, so when I saw a variety pack of the nail caviar I knew I had to get it. The product came sooner than expected and in nice packaging. The variety of colors are all really nice but the amount of beads it actually comes with is smaller than I expected but for the price its worth it. But be careful if you put  a top coat over the beads it takes the color off and leaves them silver.</li>
    <li> This was terrible. I got two containers of the same color. The containers were WAY SMALLER than pictured. And most of them weren&#x27;t even half full! I will NEVER purchase from this seller/company. I&#x27;m very disappointed and wish I could get a refund.</li>
    <li> love them need more! and no not all that is pictured came . no brushes and i have never recieved those brushes.</li>
    <li> Color comes off when wet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments when I use these on my nails. The amount you get for the price.... you can&#x27;t beat it !</li>
    <li> Lov It!! neatly packaged colors r bright and pretti&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very fast and accurate colors same as picture hope u enjoy yousM</li>
    <li> This was a great buy.  The &amp;#34;caviar&amp;#34; is a bit bigger in size than I expected but the quality is good and takes to adhesive well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very creative in nail designing, so these beads make it so easy for me to get pretty nails. Although the containers are smaller than they look in the picture, I put them in a bigger one since I mixed up all the colors anyway. The mixed colors look awesome &amp; I&#x27;m sure to order more :)</li>
    <li> It is really fun, I love using it on my nails. Love the different colors and the case it came on. thank you</li>
    <li> My package came when it said it was going to which was nice. What I spent coordinates with what I purchased and I am very pleased. The only con would be that the colors lift or change when you cover them with a topcoat.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried these out yet, but I like the containers they came in, and the colors are very pretty. I just don&#x27;t quite understand why some containers are almost full and some of them are almost empty...</li>
    <li> I purchased this item with a little hesitation. When received I was so pleased. The nail art was what I expected. Product is fun and beautiful. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> All the jars are almost empty.  Each color can do maybe just 2 fingers.  I only ordered one order, so if I want all ten nails to be the same color, I&#x27;ll have to get a few orders.  And it took forever to get here, almost a month.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and its what I wanted. It took a while to come but I like the case it came with.</li>
    <li> These were perfect and they are fun for new nail Ideas. I use them on one finger on each hand. I just put clear nail polish and sprinkle them on and they look amazing.</li>
    <li> I must say I had an issue with the beads. I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the way they were packaged. I received the beads in the jar but not in the enclosed plastic box, rather I received them in a sandwich looking bag. The beads spilt within the bag. I contacted the seller and they were kind enough to refund the money for the mishap. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the refund, I was only trying to make them aware of what happened. I&#x27;m happy that they had such good customer service and will re-purchase the beads again. Others are correct with how little come in the jars, but for the price, I don&#x27;t see too much of an issue with that.</li>
    <li> This took a really long time to get here ordered February 7 th came march 3 rd 2014.  I would give this a 5 star rating but, they all have different amounts in them? Overall it is what I wanted at a decent price!</li>
    <li> I know they are nail art. But I had a different purpose for them :)&lt;br /&gt;They make very good material for micro art.</li>
    <li> I love the color variety available in this set. As soon as I received this product I couldn&#x27;t help but paint my nails and start to use the caviar design. It lasts a very long time and I always get compliments on my caviar nails.</li>
    <li> the containers are really tiny and they do not come fully filled and some of the colors com with way less beads than others... for sure you wont be able to use one single color in all your nails.</li>
    <li> These are great, I only wish there was an easy way to use them on my feet.  I have yet to perfect it.  They are so tiny and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;Just as described.</li>
    <li> Great my wife loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally inexpensive for the value you obtain for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very smart purchase, I hope we can do business in future</li>
    <li> Very small amounts in very small containers.  Not enough in one container to do more than two nails.  The color disappears into the top coat.  Also took way too long to arrive.  Save your money and dont purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem like there was alot in each tube, but when my daughter had used it, there was enough for her to do her complete nail on both hands with the one tube.  I think she may have to mix the colors the next time she plans on using it though, unless she doesn&#x27;t cover the complete nail.  She is very happy with the product though and they look very nice.  We were just disappointed in how long it took to receive shipment.</li>
    <li> These are gorgeous! I have had so many clients fall in love with them! Great amount, and they are vibrant! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of this product. I wish I did not purchase it but for the price its not that terrible a loss</li>
    <li> I think this is very cool, i learned to put nail glue on and pour the beads over my nail and wait a little bit and secure it with a little more nail glue on top. I&#x27;d definitely order it again, and probably will soon, the processing/shipping time took less than the approximate delivery date :)</li>
    <li> love the4 bulky caviar look. for the price its a steal. i would definitely recommend it to anyone its worth it.</li>
    <li> arrived earlier than i thought...12 diffrent colors.the jar are the small ones..but thats fine..all jars are full..since ill only use them with nail art there perfect</li>
    <li> It took a while to arrive and only two of them were full all others were less than half way but the colors are very nice. I still haven&#x27;t used them lets see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Really good, a tube can not shut down, but I managed to save some of the paint. Do you really give a variety of price and expectations. My only drawback is that delivery and it took a long time, but for me it does not matter. This product is very satisfied. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> it only had a little bit! Next time i wont buy this. and my mom said that you should give me 2 more that has more but if u want to its okay but if u dont wanna give me 2 free ones then i wont buy them EVER again from u! ima tell my friends not to buy from u</li>
    <li> This set is such a great buy for anyone who is trying to do the caviar nail look.  The colors are very pretty and you get a nice assortment.  The price is also great, compared to the caviar nail kits that are sold elsewhere.  It did take about 2 weeks to receive, but I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me.</li>
    <li> These are terrible! You put clear nail polish on them or was your hands and they turn white. Aweful product!</li>
    <li> Once u place the them on your nails the colors start to fade. Actually the fade on ur nails and the die runs off on ur nail. Or maybe I used it wrong but I doubt that.</li>
    <li> I wish it were bigger and has more caviar nail art in it  cause it great when you want to do a design with it on the nail salon or a home</li>
    <li> Ok I found out you can get these microbeads from any craft store or walmart. Martha Stewart crafts. You get a lot in the containers and it should last you a few months and honestly its worth the price. Exact same thing same beads everything! So why pay for just a little bit when you can go and get a quality of microbeads good amount from Martha stewart crafts. And they come in a set of 12 for a good amount! They have all the colors even gold silver white black. If you don&#x27;t believe me google it!! Its better then buying on here for a small amount!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECK IT OUT! :D I hope I helped some people its about 10 - 12 dollars but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> the top coat, no matter what brand or quality it is, fades the color of the caviar. You end up with grey/silver caviar no matter what color you see on the picture.</li>
    <li> Really cheap and weird. I probably would never buy something like this again</li>
    <li> Very nice art decorations!! Love the fact that they are exactly as described and in a variety of different colors.  These are the perfect assessories to any nail decoration.</li>
    <li> Since you are not supposed to apply a topcoat over this, don&#x27;t you think the color of the beads should be somewhat lasting?  Nope, it&#x27;s not.  Although, it is gorgeous for the first 24 to 36 hours.  After that you have a faded mess.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE BEST BEADS YOU WILL FIND. YOU SHOULD GET THESE BEAD FOR NAIL ART. I LOOKED FOR THEM AT A STORE IN MY TOWN BUT I COULD NOT GET THEM FOR CHEAP.</li>
    <li> Nice colors. The only down fall is the amount in each case. My sister loved the amout she got. but was expecting more.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that was received in a decent amount of time.  It is exactly as advertised.  Thanks</li>
    <li> The containers were much smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be. Not enough to do a whole manicure in one color. The beads were also smaller than some other versions I&#x27;ve seen. And the color started to wash off after maybe a day of wear.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old was thrilled . we used them right away and it was easy and turned out great!</li>
    <li> I ordered these cause  I couldn&#x27;t find the colors I wanted in the stores. I put the pink ones on my client and the pink rubbed off with the clear top coat. Not very happy when you are using them on paying clients. Also not enough in the little bowls. One container was almost empty. They are good for starter beads but I will continue to try and find them at the stores. I was very disappointed with the quality I ordered.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product. I like the fact that I have 12 colors to choose from. Caviar beads are very messy, but if you use a tray underneath the nails while using this, the beads shouldnt make a mess and go every where. I learned through trail and error, lol</li>
    <li> these beads are simple to put on. I can do different designs on my nails with the plastic beads. thanks</li>
    <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
    <li> I like the case which contains the multiple pots. The only thing was application...the pots are not very deep for dipping nail in and  you get a little on the tip..hard to cover the whole nail that way. It does look great on</li>
    <li> I was looking for that but at the pharmacy is $7.99 and I found this kit.&lt;br /&gt;Everybody asks where I bought and is a good material</li>
    <li> Was very happy to get my product. It came on time and excited to start using it. Don&#x27;t know what else to say other than got my goods.</li>
    <li> this caviar beads are terrible. not worth the money at all. They fall off nails easily. Lose color. Just not good quality at all.</li>
    <li> cant wait to use it. it actually looks big in picture but its not that big its a decent size</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture, all the colours are in one tub and by the time it got to me all of the colours had mixed together so they can not be used the way it was intended. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I like the assortment of colors!  I did notice on some of them the color bleeds when putting on a top coat but I have had that happen with others as well.  I would recommend this product, just be careful with the top coat.</li>
    <li> Excelente! me encantan estos accesorios para hacerse una manicure fuera de lo comun! El vendedor muy cumplido con los plazos, y el producto es exactamente lo que se detalla en la descripción. No tengo quejas!</li>
    <li> These are fun and come in great colors. They take some practice to get used to applying.</li>
    <li> you get very little in each container. they make very cute designs and they come in a good assortment of colors</li>
    <li> These are very nice except for the fact that they are so small. I really wish that they came in a bigger packaging</li>
    <li> I love it! So many colors to choose from! The beads come in all different sizes from small to smaller!</li>
    <li> I ordered the 350buy Fashion Caviar Nails Art New 12 Colors plastic Beads Manicures, I was looking for this caviar pearls for my nails,I was fortunate to find it available on Amazon.com, for extraordinary price,  I thought it was an absolutely fantastic idea to create a 3D effect with tiny pearls on my nails for my son&#x27;s graduation, The application of the pearls is very easy, The package is in a cardboard box with the product details on the front, the caviar pearls are in a  transparent plastic packaging and can keep each color in their place, I am really satisfied with my product.</li>
    <li> I was excited to order these but I got what I paid for.  The containers are very small and are not filled as pictured.  The posting on the package says it came from Hong Kong so it is not worth returning.  Save your money and pay for a better quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having fun using these beads on my nails as well as art projects I work on using polymer clay. They are also fun to add to homemade cards and scrapbook pages.</li>
    <li> I loved the variety of colors, but the containers were so small. Wish they came in bigger containers.</li>
    <li> Like this would recommend it !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy was a waste of money</li>
    <li> So not worth the 3 weeks to get here. First of all they are really really tiny. You get enough beads to do maybe 1 or 2 nails. I was very disappointed as all the colors were just a lighter shade of the original color.</li>
    <li> the package is very tiny probably about 3 inches tall and 5 inches 4 inches wide and they dont even stick to your nails! very disapointing &#x3D;[</li>
    <li> daughter loved it, its a little messy but fun to use, lots of great colors and something new to use.</li>
    <li> You defiantly get for what you pay for being so cheap the picture is deceiving much there is enough for about 3 fingers for each color but they are better then using sprinkles.</li>
    <li> The color comes off of the beads after wearing for a while or when you put clear nail polish on top.</li>
    <li> Very cute . And alot of them too&lt;br /&gt;I Love these beads . You should order these (:&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars .</li>
    <li> My daughters are all caught up in this wild nail craze and this made the top of their wish list.</li>
    <li> This product is very cheap but it serves its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the containers are very small. This means that you&#x27;ll go crazy trying to do a full manicure. Use it for an accent nail, or to make designs with individual beads using tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, The packaging is great. The containers come 4x4 in a container carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the shipping took almost a full month for me, but I ordered around holidays so that probably contributed to the delay. I&#x27;ve heard that a few people received it in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, the color variety is a gamble. You can&#x27;t choose your colors but most people get a good assortment. I did! All the colors of the rainbow plus a white and an dark purple that looks black (which I liked much more than black)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, the containers will be messy because beads tend to cling to the top and sides of the container, that&#x27;s not the sellers fault, it&#x27;s how the beads are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, The beads are very small (a little smaller than usual microbeads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for a beginner, just to try caviar nails, or in a little gift set. If you already know all about caviar nails, then you may want to go for a more expensive set so you can have a full manicure or bigger beads.</li>
    <li> The colors are distinctive, bold and bright, i love the colors.  I need to get them in larger quantities. Excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of these beads for my sisters nails and for me for scrapbooking and other odd crafts that I do.  They are really gonna be neat on both nails and crafts.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive these beads, but unfortunately, they are just not really worth it. I will still use them, but I&#x27;m disappointed by the quality. There is not as much in the jars as is pictured, several of my jars had their lids screwed on so incorrectly that I literally had to break them open just to get the beads out (which means I had to transfer the beads to a plastic bag, which is just not as easy to use), the color selection is lame and not like pictured (no silver... but there&#x27;s clear, WHY?). Also, if you top coat them, the color comes off. And I&#x27;m using Seche Vite, which has NEVER smudged any color of nail polish for me. I realize in a typical \\&quot;caviar\\&quot; application you would not top coat them but what if I want to place them in a pattern on my nail (which is mostly what I got them for)? Finally, as I mentioned before, you don&#x27;t get the quantity of each color that is pictured, and what you get is probably not enough to do an actual caviar manicure all in one color. I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for nail art beads next time. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> i bought this one for my daughter and she was obsessed  with the look i would buy more in the future</li>
    <li> Got this product sooner than I expected which was a plus. Its easy to do but the beads are definitely cheap. It looked good for one day but the colors do not last. As soon as I took a shower all the color faded, but what do you expect for $4?! I did get a lot of nice colors though. I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> my kids loved these .there favorite thing to do is decorate there nails .and they really made them pretty with these</li>
    <li> Maybe it was me... Maybe it was the product... Tried several times and several  youtube tutorials.  I could never do the nail effect. Ended up throwing them away. AAAANNNNNNDDD its only a tiny bit of each color, kinda expected that thou</li>
    <li> to hard to dip fingers tip in, very ackward</li>
    <li> The color bleeds. Not solvent resistant.</li>
    <li> The colors are very vibrant, only problem I found that all the color except black comes off one the top coat get put on. I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the brand I use but i can&#x27;t seem to be able to use all the colors.</li>
    <li> this arrived at my house right away.  love the fast shipping and the colors are so pretty i cant wait to put these on my nails the only thing is that there is only enough for 1 nail in each little container.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted! Cute colors nice packaging! Will look great with designs! W@ill buy again and would recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> these look great for about a day, and then they just all fall off... they also are very messy, and I would suggest using over a paper plate if you buy these...</li>
    <li> It took over a month to get this product . I was very disappointed in that.  The product it&#x27;s self is ok.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a couple weeks ago I received them in perfect condition nothing was broken and the containers were full of beads. I loved it!</li>
    <li> When I saw these I thought they were so neat! I bought them and tried them as soon as they got to me...They kind of make a mess when you are putting them on your nails. Also I put a clear coat on top of them so they would stay in place better, and the color came off most of it. I kept it on and by the next day most of it had fallen off. So this would only be good to use right before you go out for the night. It will not last more than a day/night.</li>
    <li> These came quickly and exactly as advertised. The beads were tiny so it was very easy to put them on the nails. No tweezers required, which made me happy (because I have a very low quality tweezer which doesn&#x27;t work) . If you sprinkle them on your nails it makes a little mess. But if you dip them, it&#x27;s fine. Overall I love these. This makes a good nail tip. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever purchased here, is exactly what they offered me. Are happy with this. I have no Idea how to use they have to included a manual</li>
    <li> I really like the effect these give on my nails. I like the size and the colors that came with the set are really pretty! The only thing I would complain about is the application. You have to use a top coat to keep these on, but when you do it smears the color of the balls into each other &amp; kind of ruins the effect given by the little balls, especially if you mix them together to get a sprinkled effect. They make the top coat colored. :(</li>
    <li> Despite the different quantities in each container the beads are very nice. They do exactly what they are meant to, and I have not had any trouble with them. Overall this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Product rec&#x27;d within estimated delivery date but not enough of each color to even do 1 nail.  The pics show full containers, but they are far from full.  The seller did an awful job of packaging because many of the lids were not secure, therefore a lot of the beads spilled and mixed in the bag.  Would it kill you to fill the containers like the pictures show?  I barely have enough to do 1 nail with many of the colors and there are a few I can&#x27;t even use because I didn&#x27;t get enough, especially after having them spill!  I would recommend giving enough of each color to do a full set, even if you have to charge a few dollars more.  Not at all impressed and to make matters worse, I contacted the seller prior to posting feedback/review and got no response.  If you don&#x27;t mind mediocre products and no customer service, go ahead and buy from this seller, but I personally won&#x27;t ever buy from this person again due to the lack of service and false advertising!</li>
    <li> This was a sad excuse for caviar beads. The picture shows very full pots but that&#x27;s not even close to what you get. You get about the whole bottom covered in the beads and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting, thank you!</li>
    <li> The picture for this product mislead you. I didn&#x27;t expect a large container but I expected the containers given to at least be all the way full or mostly full. I haven&#x27;t used the beads yet because I want to figure what to do with them before I waste them. I emailed the seller and am hoping to get a return email about the product. I really like the look of manicures I&#x27;ve seen with these so if you buy them and they aren&#x27;t what you expected complain to make them change this. I will post again when I try them.</li>
    <li> If you like nail art, and want to have very stylish pretty art on your fingers, you have to buy this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love. Colors and the packaging is perfect to carry on all this little tins in make up bag/kit.</li>
    <li> I just got my package yesterday and I can not wait to use it. They come in a cute little set. perfect for a gift this Christmas.</li>
    <li> What a waste! This product ships from HONG KONG! It takes forever to receive. What a waste of PLASTIC and ENERGY!  Too bad I have to even give it one star.</li>
    <li> when I put it in a color change, and falling all the time, came two boxes that I could not open, were not closed.</li>
    <li> I just ordered just because  it appeared in the suggestions! my caviar beads even arrived before the estimated receive date! I went on you tube and watched videos and learned how to apply! I will be ordering more. saved a trip to the nail salon and the results are great! the product was shipped neatly in packaging and everything was in tact. I love the 12 colors very vibrant and match exactly with the picture.</li>
    <li> Love the way it looks on my nails!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in good condition&lt;br /&gt;Mine were all in there own little container&lt;br /&gt;Containers are small so you really don&#x27;t get a whole lot but for me&lt;br /&gt;personally it&#x27;s a great amount because of the amount of colors&lt;br /&gt;I got all different colors and mine were all cute,&lt;br /&gt;I was worried from the reviews about the colors and how they melt away as soon&lt;br /&gt;as they come in contact with the polish, but I guess you just have to know how to make that not&lt;br /&gt;happen.&lt;br /&gt;1.) Apply thin layer of clear coat r whatever color you desire&lt;br /&gt;2.) you can either dip your figure in which ever color you want, then use like a little scooper&lt;br /&gt;to cover what ever is left uncover (because the containers are small) or simply just use a little&lt;br /&gt;scooper and scoop up the beads and pour over nail.&lt;br /&gt;3.) apply a nice layer (not ALOT) don&#x27;t brush the clear coat on, more like dap the polish on&lt;br /&gt;(This keeps the color from rubbing off the beads)&lt;br /&gt;4.) Let dry and apply a thicker more even coat</li>
    <li> Really colorful, metallic colors cute and they stay for a long time in my nails</li>
    <li> Great! They are as posted and my clients love the extra sparkle that these give to their nail designs. Thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading other reviews and though &#x27;hey why not?!&#x27; The beads are so pretty and I got 12 different colors like it said. Except, there isn&#x27;t enough beads to do much. The container it comes in is very small but its deff worth the couple dollars.</li>
    <li> The color comes off as soon as it gets in water after one day the Belen&#x27;s were just a see threw bead</li>
    <li> The little tubs are half empty ! Different colors also. I wasn&#x27;t very happy with my order I thought it was going to be a great our purchase but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> these took some time to come in but when they did, they are awesome. none of the containers had spilt and all were in intact. the packagin was also in take and the colors are awesome. so much in each container, even if you use alot you will have plenty to last you for a good while. love using these to decorate flowers or to add a bit of punch to my nail desgns as studs.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I read some of the reviews saying that it was just sand and very little.  My vials were all full, and plenty in each to do a full mani of each color!!</li>
    <li> I had no problems with this product. got it pretty quick, and it was in good shape. A++ I will use them again.</li>
    <li> These came pretty empty not what I expected it to be but I can give as a gift to someone because I won&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using these caviar beads. I use a regular pen to pick them up and last long on nails if gel is used as a top coat.</li>
    <li> Great for decorating nails love the different colors... Don&#x27;t wash dishes though or it&#x27;s coming off.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE SO MANY USES FOR THEM LIKE THE WAY THEY ARE PACKAGED IN NEAT LITTLE JARS WERE NOT SCRAMBLED EGGS WHEN I GOT THEM</li>
    <li> [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ Cool product that you may want to consider :)  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]  ] ]</li>
    <li> I just got it today .. Took almost a MONTH to receive .. I almost forgot I ordered it , the colors are a lil duller than in the picture.. But the beads look exactly the way it is in the picture .. I give this product 4 stars because of the time it took to get to my household</li>
    <li> The only thing is you should buy more than one if you are planning on doing a complete manicure with one color as the packages are small</li>
    <li> Easy To Use, Great colors and containers works well for storage use. Love doing different color nails, so this works really well.</li>
    <li> The beads themselves are fine. But from a professional standpoint I&#x27;d never use them! The colored beads bleed if they get wet (washing hands, etc.) or if using a bonding polish or top coat. Then they look smudged and unprofessionally done</li>
    <li> Like using these because they make your nails look so modern and different its great. People are like man i want nails like that. I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good it&#x27;s just very little I can&#x27;t do someone&#x27;s hand cuz it would run out.:( ................................small small small small small small small small amount but all though it did come fast earlier that anything I have ever gotten.</li>
    <li> Love nail designs????? this beads are the best to give the nails a good fashion look, they are easy to put on and take off!</li>
    <li> When I received these beads some of the containers wasn&#x27;t full and some were empty. I wasn&#x27;t happy with the order at all.</li>
    <li> I just literally got the product in the mail. It came in before the date I was told it would get here. When I opened up the product, I was extremely ticked that all my jars weren&#x27;t all full! The main colors I got that I wanted weren&#x27;t the ones full unlike the gold and silver. I wanted blue, red, and black. The red jar, I can only do one nail, and the black maybe 2 nails max! I know I did pay a LOW price but for nails you need more then a 1/4 of a filled little jar! I would not buy this product again! If you are a nail lover like I am....DON&#x27;T buy this product![[ASIN:B008SPOKIW 350buy Fashion Caviar Nails Art New 12 Colors plastic Beads Manicures or Pedicures Nail Art Hot Sales]]</li>
    <li> These looked really cute so I ordered them thinking they would be fun for my daughter. No matter what we do these do not stick for more than a few minutes before they start falling off.</li>
    <li> I love these. It&#x27;s a cute little something to add to a mani. Fun, bright colors. They stay good and are easy enough to remove.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. Its cute and looks nice and the colors are super cute but once you put them on a nail bed they do not last! I glued it on with resin and they did not last as soon as the manicure is dry the beads start falling off</li>
    <li> They dont stay on! It takes forever to get them and I ended up needing them reshipped cuz they never arrived. If you try and use a topcoat to make them stay than the color comes off! Worst caviar ive ever used!</li>
    <li> WOW.. I was SURPRISED to see how MINUTE these caviar &amp;#34;things&#x27; are. I tested the product,BUT ONLY used clear nail polish, and also looked on UTube to make sure this was how they are to be used.&lt;br /&gt;There weren&#x27;t any instrcutions, but again it was easy to use, might be messy, but all in all on a finished nails (s) I would think this &amp;#34;llok&amp;#34; is very cute and definatly something my niece would like!!</li>
    <li> Came exactly as it said it would. It was nicely packaged and I am happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t want it to big, it&#x27;s just perfect to go on top of your nails. These are my thoughts and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and would order from them again.</li>
    <li> One of the colors came broken and first I was really mad because it was the black color. I&#x27;m a little bit upset</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. Satisfied customer!!! I would buy products from this company again and again!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> no instructions at all to tell me how to use. will be awaste of product now to use on nails as dont know how to use</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot of close colors&lt;br /&gt;I wish the colors would have been brighter and i didn&#x27;t receive an equal amount of all</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have huge expectations for this product, but I find myself especially disappointed by the colors I received.  There are four jars of an ugly medium pink shade (and these are the only very full jars, naturally) and three very similar brassy/orange colors.  If I didn&#x27;t have incredible color acuity I would not be able to tell the difference between the shades.  The size of the beads is rather disappointing as well, considering that they are all different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not terribly surprised, but I was hoping to at least get 12 different colors.  I am sure I&#x27;ll be able to find a way to use at least some of these beads.</li>
    <li> The containers I got were maybe 1/4 full and they were not very big containers. I wouldn&#x27;t complain except for the fact that I bought the same product from someone else for about 50 cents cheaper and got WAY more product. However the product is good just not the quantity.</li>
    <li> I either didn&#x27;t know how to use it or it wasn&#x27;t a good product. it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick to nails</li>
    <li> tiny, but just as described/pictured, arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Very bad quality.  The color melts off the beads if you put a top coat on them.  However if you don&#x27;t put a topcoat then they fall off...</li>
    <li> Bead size is SMALL, great for me because I use on my natural nail which makes bigger pieces harder to use&lt;br /&gt;Color is DARKER than in the pic, the light purple you see is really just purple, white just silver, light gold a darker gold&lt;br /&gt;Quantity is LESS than seen in pic, it covers only the bottom of the case. Just don&#x27;t expect more than one nail for the lighter colors and two for the darker.&lt;br /&gt;Overall............worth the few dollars and the wait! Hope this helps others! Jessica &lt;3</li>
    <li> She loves these!  She has been practicing like crazy on her practice fingers and on her mom and sisters and when school came back in session, she must have had all her girlfriends lined up.</li>
    <li> Love this and a great price! Looks cute for the fashion trend of doing your ring finger different from your other nails. These go a long way if you just use for one finger and polish the others! Great trendy look! I don&#x27;t understand the complaints. These are tiny cavier beads and priced crwzyvlow. I&#x27;m a manicurist and appreciate the value!</li>
    <li> perfect to do my nails</li>
    <li> I purchased these beads to use as nail accents.  I love the colors and thought the beads were the perfect size for a manicure.  They were easy to apply.  Basically, you apply the nail polish and sprinkle the beads on top (make sure you catch the beads in a container so you can store the excess beads).  Press down lightly to make sure they stick and you&#x27;re done.  I applied a coat of clear  nail polish on top to ensure the beads adhered.  They look fabulous.  I ordered two additional sets to give away as gifts.  I noticed some reviewers purchased the beads and complained that the set didn&#x27;t bring enough of one color to complete a full manicure.  That is true. If you are looking to do a full caviar manicure using one color you will need to purchase more than one set.  If you are purchasing this to use as a nail accent, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this since I&#x27;ve been into doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;WELL the colors are super pretty, the case is cute, I got the order WAY before I was supposed to, so why is this only getting two stars? There&#x27;s not enough in one jar to do a full manicure with!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d be better off buying the beads from micheals.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re a bit more, but atleast you&#x27;d be able to do all your fingers a few times.</li>
    <li> for the lady who wants to vary what her nails can be, this makes a great gift... was recieved and enjoyed</li>
    <li> The color selection was great. The main problem is if you apply a top coat, the color comes off; if you don&#x27;t the color still comes off within a day from normal hand use. It was fun to apply though.</li>
    <li> These things are cute, but can get messy and you don&#x27;t really get a lot of beads for a whole hand. It&#x27;s good for doing an accent nail though, but I didn&#x27;t really expect to do a whole hand for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> After I read the bad reviews I was a bit nervous..  but I figured for $3.00 I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted to say I had none of the problems anyone else did. My nail caviar arrived much sooner then date estimated. I used Orly Seal On top coat to secure it, no melting... and although the pots looks small you require much less then you would think to fully cover a medium length nail. I used small plastic bathroom cups to mix colors and only did two accent nails but I would have easily had enough to do all 10 in the color combo more then once. I have ordered 3 more as gifts sets, they arrived at the same speed and where equally as good.</li>
    <li> These little beads are funny and fun to use and definitely take time to learn to use them , but they are at a great price.</li>
    <li> COULDNT WAIT TO GET THESE.. WHEN I USED THEM.. (NOW I DON&#x27;T KNOW) IF IT&#x27;S BECAUSE OF THE....  IDK... UMMM WHERE/WHO THEY WE&#x27;RE MADE... BUT I USED MY SECHE&#x27; VITE DRY FAST T.C ON THEM &amp; THE COLORS SMEARED.. &amp; RAN.. &amp; THEY LOOKED... CHEAP.. IDK... LIL&#x27; DISAPPOINTED...</li>
    <li> they come in all the colors and am very happy i can chose all the colors in nail polish and these match it perfectly thanks again.</li>
    <li> i wish you have light bright colors for the summer. but i&#x27;ll buy these beads over and over i love the look who ever came up with this idea is very grate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome new concept, at least to me. The beads were very pretty. I only wish that they were smaller in size and would stay longer than a day. Still it&#x27;s good for a girl&#x27;s night out.</li>
    <li> I like them but the only thing i dont like is after you get them all on your nail then you have to put a clear coat over them so they dont fall off the color came off of the little beads or (caviar) so like i did a pink nail and after i put the clear coat on half were still pink and half were sliver! Am i doing something wrong ? Am i not suppost to put clear coat on top or what! If anyone has any comments on how to help plz let me know! Thank you !!</li>
    <li> Two of the little jars arrived about a quarter filled all other jars where filled to the top. Won&#x27;t make the mistake of buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I wish there was more to them. I love how they look, but there is very little. Luckily, I have small nails but there is not much more than one application, if that from each.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what you think it is and it&#x27;s a very small amount. It&#x27;s not glitter it&#x27;s beads and i wasnt happy</li>
