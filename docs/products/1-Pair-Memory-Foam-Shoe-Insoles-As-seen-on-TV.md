      <li>This pair of inner soles is the best I have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>was expecting more quality based on its cost.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Was cheap go to 99 cent store save your money threw them away after hour</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the way they have to be cut when trying to fit them into shoes</li>
      <li>but they seem like they will be comfortable.</li>
      <li>; memory foam--not pliable and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy them.  </li>
      <li>When you cut the foam it doesn&#x27;t fit the shoe size for a women&#x27;s shoe.</li>

      <li>These foam insoles are a real JOKE !!!</li>
      <li>I bought these insoles to replace the original insoles that came in my sneakers.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve heard memory foam inserts to they where great the first day only</li>
      <li>Good sole inserts.  </li>
      <li>The Seller was was fine-I received them quickly-</li>
      <li>Works well added to my sneakers and it is helpful for my pregnant swollen feet 😊</li>
      <li>You are better off to buy a new pair of  shoes with memory foam in them.</li>
      <li>Bought these to fit into shoes that I had purchased that arrived to Australia a size to large.  </li>
      <li>BUT I DID WORTH  THE EFFORT&lt;</li>
      <li>It was not memory foam more like paper there was nothing soft and foam.</li>
      <li>having worn insoles costing 40 and these neither pair lasted or was worth the price</li>
      <li>but I do not think they are worth the price they have them for.</li>
      <li>You would be better of walking on your bare feet!!</li>
      <li>and  thank you very much Amazzam.</li>
      <li>these tore the first time I wore them - they are a piece of junk</li>
      <li>They bunched up in thier shoes and were thrown away within the first week.</li>
      <li>these are pretty crappy insoles.  </li>
      <li>better than i expected and well worth the money.</li>
      <li>and i have leg discomfort if i stand or walk for very long  (more than 15 minutes).  </li>
      <li>They seemed fine initially.</li>
      <li>they help me so much.  </li>
      <li>They grip too much.  </li>
      <li>This product was very slender for a man size and slides around in the shoe.</li>
      <li>very helpful item, very reasonably-priced item.</li>
      <li>This is too much money for 1 hour of comfort.</li>
      <li>Thanks Tina L Nielsen (misstweetybird1205@gmail.com)</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have much cushion at all.</li>
      <li>Not truly memory foam but rather a cheap thin layer on top of another material - like styrofoam.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>I found them very comfortable even though they look pretty thick.</li>
      <li>They are something totally different and they are cheap and low quality.</li>
      <li>But through the first day wearing them, I found my feet were not comfortable, the way I would expect with true \\&quot;memory foam\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The first time you use they are as flat as a pancake.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how long they will last but nice in comparison to other inserts.  </li>
      <li>i was surprised at how well these in soles made my feet feel when it came to comfort and support.</li>
      <li>that your feet would be in some soft foam and shape to your feet.  </li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>get real ones for same price</li>
      <li>They were a gift to someone that doesn&#x27;t lived near.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not much support or foam!!!! waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Works well added to my sneakers and it is helpful for my pregnant swollen feet 😊</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and received when said</li>
    <li> It feels like your walking on air. my feet feel good. Memory foam is a great invention!</li>
    <li> these tore the first time I wore them - they are a piece of junk</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product.  Provides NO support for your feet and the foam is made out of such a cheep material that your feel start sweating instantly. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> They are not as advertised.  They are not a true memory foam as put in for example Skecher shoes.  Would not buy another pair.  You are better off to buy a new pair of  shoes with memory foam in them.</li>
    <li> After just two days the &amp;#34;Memory died&amp;#34; and they were flat as a pancake.</li>
    <li> Feels good in place. Great support.</li>
    <li> They fell part in less then a week there crap made for a dime sold way over what they should be I might as well have whiped my a** with the ten I spent on this crap go to walmart get real ones for same price these suck!</li>
    <li> These are not memory foam...just foam.  They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; well and offer little support.</li>
    <li> Low quality product.  Don&#x27;t have much cushion at all.</li>
    <li> Was cheap go to 99 cent store save your money threw them away after hour In shoe</li>
    <li> Hard to get foot in shoe with socks.  They grip too much.  Will not get again for myself.  Might be okay for someone else though.</li>
    <li> I should have gone to the craft store instead.</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money! The foam packs down and doesn&#x27;t spring back. The backing peels off the foam. They didn&#x27;t last a week but looked so bad that I was ashamed to return them.</li>
    <li> They were a gift to someone that doesn&#x27;t lived near. But they seemed very pleased to receive them, said they had been unable to find them in the stores.</li>
    <li> I think I gave these amnesia after one 12 hour shift.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable !!! Excellent 😊</li>
    <li> Good sole inserts.  but not exactly what I wanted, I wanted the gel inserts but these are okay, you do have to cut them to your shoe size.</li>
    <li> These were a perfect way to replace the insoles that came with my shoes. The company I bought the shoes from did not have insoles for when the originals wore out.</li>
    <li> These insoles were made of memory foam about like my body is robotic. Incredibly bad claim by the manufacturer. Amazon refunded my money without my asking or returning the cheap ripoff. Drugstore.com did not. Don&#x27;t by these.</li>
    <li> This is what I was looking for, great service, I got my insoles in a 1 1/2 -2 day period its in ca. an I am in pa., I think this was wonderful. I just want to say good job and  thank you very much Amazzam. I would give you a five star rate from me. thank you,  J  Laughlin</li>
    <li> good product good price good service</li>
    <li> I love buying things from Amazon I&#x27;m always pleased. I have a question I bought two pair of ankle boots they are beautiful, but I got the wrong size it&#x27;s been less than a month can they be returned them for the correct sizes? Thanks Tina L Nielsen (misstweetybird1205@gmail.com)</li>
    <li> Worst insoles ever. They are just foam not memory foam I didn&#x27;t even use them they were so uncomfortable a waste of money</li>
    <li> got these to put in some ole shoes to make them more compfy . They helped little , but could hav bought them at any Dollar store ,</li>
    <li> This pair of inner soles is the best I have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;When I wear them it holds up very nicely.  The sole stays in place when taking the shoe on and off.  I do not need to readjust the inner sole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you a good product</li>
    <li> Took forever to come shipped from China. No memory to this it is so thin not there. Comes in 1 size have to cut to your size. I would not recommend wish I could give a zero and get amazon not to post them for sale :(</li>
    <li> I wore these insoles for the day, about 5 hours and they were as flat as paper, they felt good for about the first hour.  This is too much money for 1 hour of comfort.</li>
    <li> WHY I CHOOSE THIS IDEM.I NEEDED SOME INSOLES FOR MY SHOES MY FEET WAS HURTING I I TRIED 3 OR 4 BE FORE  I BOUGHT THESE THEY HAD FOAM INSOLES TRIED THEM WOW WHAT A DIFFERENCES IT MADE MY FEET.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED THE SOFTNESS OF THOSE INSOLE,THE THING I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE CUTTING MY SIZE OUT A LOT OF LINES BUT I DID WORTH  THE EFFORT&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I bought these insoles to replace the original insoles that came in my sneakers. The originals had worn out and ripped. These are pretty thick inside your shoes but they squish down so that doesn&#x27;t matter much. The only downside I noticed was that the material sticks to my socks. The insole should be a slippery material that doesn&#x27;t stick to socks when trying to put your foot into the shoes. This problem is reduced with a little baby powder sprinkled into the shoe before putting it on.</li>
    <li> I love these.  I work on my feet all the time and my feet and legs ache.  I have had wonderful results with these cushy insoles.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I order them regularly</li>
    <li> Not memory foam....this is cheap and crap.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price.  Shipment was more than satisfactory.  Received in good shape and good time,  However, the price was way beyond the quality and usefulness expected.  I got better inserts for $8.67 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Very good. Very comfortable on the feet! I can recommend these for people who don&#x27;t have enough natural padding on the bottom of their feet.</li>
    <li> Not as thick as i first thought. They are just fla. Not arch.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just simple foam. Like the ones at the $1 stores.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting more quality based on its cost.&lt;br /&gt;I only used them for about 2 weeks, afterwards they just lost their shape and I threw them away.</li>
    <li> It was not memory foam more like paper there was nothing soft and foam. I thought they were going to be more like the memory foam  top mattress i have on my bed that your feet would be in some soft foam and shape to your feet.  But i tried them and didnt get that comfort i was seeking.......Thank you anyway</li>
    <li> Not worth one penny. Used them once , after that, no support at all.&lt;br /&gt;Just a big ripoff,they&#x27;re useless after first use.</li>
    <li> Not as great as i thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Happy to have something that can bring comfort to the feet of the man I love!  He spends many hours a day on his feet and it is nice to know his feet can feel hugged by having this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tasha Marie</li>
    <li> Wore out in less than a week but I&#x27;ve heard memory foam inserts to they where great the first day only</li>
    <li> They added comfort as described.  Don&#x27;t know how long they will last but nice in comparison to other inserts.  Try one.</li>
    <li> The memory foam was much too thin.  The insoles did not improve the comfort of my shoe at all.  I would suggest at least triple the layer of foam.</li>
    <li> When you cut the foam it doesn&#x27;t fit the shoe size for a women&#x27;s shoe. You need to take the insole of the shoe you plan to insert and cut foam from that</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way they have to be cut when trying to fit them into shoes but once they are in they are very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift for someone that is on thier feet all day. They bunched up in thier shoes and were thrown away within the first week. I feel bad that they did not like the gift,</li>
    <li> Not truly memory foam but rather a cheap thin layer on top of another material - like styrofoam. Not worth one cent.</li>
    <li> Some time ago I had memory foam insoles I think from Broostone or sharper image and it was far superior........very disappointed a waste of money...I Ordere 4 pairs believing they would be like the others I had and I hate them</li>
    <li> Bought these to fit into shoes that I had purchased that arrived to Australia a size to large.  Too expensive to return....so figured a thick inner sole would solve the problem.  These were purchased and were outrageously crap.  They had a thin layer of memory foam - about 3 mm with what appeared to be paper lining the top and bottom.  On the first wear, they crumpled down to my toes and scrunched up making the shoe very uncomfortable.  it is impossible to slide your foot into the shoe as the inner soles slide downwards despite all attempts to keep them positioned...DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> THese did nothing for me.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had it in my shoes for two weeks and they are coming apart. the &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; part is peeling away from the outer layer and it doesn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s shape. after a while of using them, they conform to the shape of your foot and have no further support</li>
    <li> This product was totally not what I expected.  The insert moved with my feet but started to ball up within the shoe.  It did not stay in place or have any kind of adhesive to fit within the shoe.  I did not look at this carefully or read any previous review.  Do  not recommend for no one with achy feet.</li>
    <li> Garbage- don&#x27;t buy these they are not memory foam, they are pieces of foam cut to look like shoe inserts. I returned mine.</li>
    <li> These inserts were definitely not worth much.  They seemed fine initially. But through the first day wearing them, I found my feet were not comfortable, the way I would expect with true \\&quot;memory foam\\&quot;. When I removed them at the end of a single 8 hour work shift, they were completely flattened.  Depoofed. No longer comfy inserts, basically thin as a piece of paper.  Garbage.  I&#x27;ll continue looking for comfy insoles, definitely elsewhere...</li>
    <li> I got these in a box of stuff. These were not even opened so I thought I would try them out. I found them very comfortable even though they look pretty thick. I have flat feet so I find any and all insoles with arch support uncomfortable and some times even painful. So when I tried these I came here to try and find more but I do not think they are worth the price they have them for. I might buy them if they were cheaper.</li>
    <li> Might as well put a piece if paper in your shoe. Same result.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried these yet but they seem like they will be comfortable.</li>
    <li> They are so comfortable and easy to wear. They fit most of my shoes which makes it good because I can use them on again and again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these before and I was always very happy with them. I have problems with my feet and these inserts have helped to ease the pain I&#x27;ve experienced. This time, they were very thin. After just a few days of wearing them there is no cushion left and they are completely flat. Next time I&#x27;ll try a different manufacturer. The Seller was was fine-I received them quickly- it was just that the company that makes them has obviously changed something.</li>
    <li> I  thought the foam would be thicker.</li>
    <li> The first time you use they are as flat as a pancake.  No support.</li>
    <li> Cheap ones !!! I used it for one week and i had to trash it</li>
    <li> I now have  purchased 6 pairs of these inserts.  they help me so much.  i have spinal stenosis and i have leg discomfort if i stand or walk for very long  (more than 15 minutes).  i have put these in all of my shoes and standing/walking is a lot softer now.  very helpful item, very reasonably-priced item.</li>
    <li> Works great, love them</li>
    <li> these are pretty crappy insoles.  As soon as you walk on them they totally flatten out (they stay flat too) and give you feet no comfort whatsoever.  Will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> hard to cut to size.  a &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; memory foam--not pliable and comfortable.  not worth even the 8. cost.  money wasted</li>
    <li> Lots of Cush-feels great</li>
    <li> Great insoles for my walking shoes!  I really enjoy them.  Good quality, easy to trim to fit, and I will definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> These are not at all what I expected! They are very thin and unlike any memory foam I have ever seen before!</li>
    <li> These are not what the package looks like in the picture. They are something totally different and they are cheap and low quality.</li>
    <li> this insoles did not last one week, the material was weak and they were ruined on a couple of days worn!</li>
    <li> i was surprised at how well these in soles made my feet feel when it came to comfort and support. better than i expected and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> having worn insoles costing 40 and these neither pair lasted or was worth the price paid .. word word word</li>
    <li> I love them, make my feet feel good, and my feet don&#x27;t hurt nearly as much.  I was happy enough to have ordered more.</li>
    <li> These were horrible bought them a while back and they only lasted one day, not really memory foam at all very thin.</li>
    <li> These are so thin, they simply crumple up as soon as you wear the shoe one time.  I would never buy them again.</li>
    <li> These foam insoles are a real JOKE !!! You would be better of walking on your bare feet!! Save your money and buy something that really works!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to have more flow in the liners to help ease diabetic foot pain.</li>
    <li> These memory foam insoles cushion my feet and add comfort, especially in shoes with little padding or support. I like the way they protect my feet in shoes I use for dancing. Because the insoles are a bit think, you do need to allow a little extra room when buying shoes.</li>
    <li> I asked my boyfriend to cut them to size for me, he followed the directions exactly for a 6 1/2 and they were so small I couldn&#x27;t even wear them.  The measurements are way off. WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
    <li> They were great when I first put them on but after a couple days they were wore out</li>
    <li> Great product.. great service</li>
    <li> This product was very slender for a man size and slides around in the shoe. I ended up putting them in a different shoe than I initially intended.</li>
