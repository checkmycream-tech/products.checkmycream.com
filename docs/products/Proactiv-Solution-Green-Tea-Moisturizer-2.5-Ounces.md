<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Such a light and greaseless moisturizer the absorbs right away and makes your face feel great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!  It works very well w/my sensitive skin &amp; never clogs my pores or makes me break-out as some moisturizers do.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Everything was great!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily and I feel more refreshed after using it! I will definitely keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> fast delivery, just as promised. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have an oily skin and tried many moisturizers which could hydrate my skin with out generating too much oil and found none. Proactive green tea moisturizer is just about right product for me. Very light and easily sinks in and hydrates the skin easily and have a fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> This is a feathery light gel that absorbs into the skin very fast. I&#x27;ve tried countless moisturizer, but this one takes the cake. It&#x27;s hydrating, leaves skin smooth, light, easy to use, non-sticky, absorbing, unscented, doesn&#x27;t leave face greasy...this is one of my favorite facial products :)</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all for me; in fact it seems to dry my face out more than if I don&#x27;t put anything on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give up using this \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; because after I put it on my face I have flaky skin all over my face and it feels like I&#x27;m wearing some type of mask, a very uncomfortable feeling needless to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this a few times just to see if maybe the things I&#x27;ve written above were happening because I was switching facial moisturizers but nothing improved,  my face still remained very dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it works for some people as for me I think I will stick to coconut oil which may leave my face shiny looking but eventually it does soak into my skin and I&#x27;m left with a nice, healthy, complexion.  The only reason I tried this product was because I wanted something that moisturized my face immediately without waiting for \\&quot;the shine\\&quot; to go away.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would have done if this Proactiv Green Tea Moisturizer was not available to me. I use it several times a day. Just recently recovering from a flare up of acne and rosacea; the green tea moisturizer has helped me like nothing else ever, before. It&#x27;s calming, soothing and cool. Makes the redness go away almost immediately. My skin feels so much softer, smoother. I did find however from the original tube I had; that the product I purchased from Amazon &amp; Discount Beauty is an oil free formula? I called the company (Proactiv) and asked what was the difference? They just told me that the formula had changed, nothing else was different. The only major difference I personally could tell was that even though they are giving you .5 ounces more; it takes a whole lot more to get the same result. Nonetheless, I&#x27;d never be without it! Thanks Amazon, Discount Beauty and Proactiv. I will never use anything else on my delicate face again...well may be when I start getting wrinkles! Tonya :0)</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. I use this every morning before I put on makeup. Not heavy or oily. Very lightweight. A must have in the winter.</li>
    <li> This is a much more convenient way of purchasing Proactiv products.  Great product, non-greasy, very light, and does a nice job moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I imagine this would be a good product if you lived in a humid climate, but in the dry Colorado air, it simply isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough and it actually seems to dry my skin out. I&#x27;m sticking to Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a moisturizer, not for acne.  It leaves my face pretty dry.  It is probably good for acne, but as a moisturizer, I would look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Most other cheaper moisturizers contain oils (that leave your face feeling greasy) or comedogenic ingredients (that clog pores and cause breakouts) but this product is oil-free, gel-based, and light on the skin making it the perfect moisturizer for those concerned about acne. This is my fourth time buying and i felt the need to finally leave a review because of how much better i think it is than other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disclaimer: i have not and likely never will use this product with other proactiv products. i have used regimen products like those before in the past (neutrogena and acne free) with little success so felt no need. i use it as the moisturizer in my acne.org regimen (the owner sells his own products but also provides his regimen and detailed explanations for each step free of charge) and my skin has never been clearer.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected, great moisturizer, it smelled good, absorbed well, could hold its own up against a lot of higher priced products..</li>
    <li> Just the right creaminess, fresh scent.  Great  performance  worn alone or under makeup.  Not oily, a huge plus for me.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this moisturizer for someone with oily-prone skim like mine.  It&#x27;s a great daytime product and wears well under makeup.  It&#x27;s the only one I will use now.  I&#x27;m on my third tube.  A++</li>
    <li> i received the travel size when i ordered proactiv a while back and fell in LOVE with this stuff. no greasy feeling whatsoever, makes you feel really... fresh and hydrated, but not shiny or oily. i will say, though, that the bigger size feels a tiny bit different from the travel size, or maybe i&#x27;m just imagining that. either way, i use this stuff every day (and have for well over a year now) and don&#x27;t see myself stopping in the near or distant future.</li>
    <li> This is the best product it really helps to clear acne as well as being a great moisturizer green tea helps to kill acne bacteria so that your skin is clear A Plus</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it everyday as a base. Because it&#x27;s so light, It wont clog pores. The seller was prompt with their delivery. Which is always a plus in my book. Loved the prod., loved the price, loved the seller. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this moisturizer for my daughter who is suffering from severe acne along with #1,#2 and #3.&lt;br /&gt;this 2.5oz tube will last for a long time and working on my daughter&#x27;s acne and it smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;will order this product again for my daughter!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer ever! It&#x27;s oil free but it does not feel like it and It absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Its a really good production with nice smell. and I get it really soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will come next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good</li>
    <li> The kiosk did not carry this size of the green tea moisturizer. This is great to use with the proactive system.It was a bargain!</li>
    <li> This product smells incredible, and I figured, since I was spending so much on facial cleanser (Proactive) I thought, why not get the good moisturizer. I&#x27;m very pleased. And my skin is getting better by the day.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Just as great as advertised no frills just easy to use and the results were way more than expected. Wow!!</li>
    <li> I had acne for almost 8 years before I found this. I have tried dozens of products on my skin - lotions, creams, ointments, benzol peroxide, the proactive line, prescription drugs, every over the counter product, and facials - nothing worked. Until one amazing day that I got a sample of this lotion in the mail. I used it that night, and when I woke up the next morning my acne had already begun to heal. Before the end of that sample bottle - my face was clear! I love this lotion and will use it for life :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these moisturizer for a while now and it is my go to moisturizer in the summer because it is really light and it helps my occasional break outs. Good lotion especially for the amazon price and for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am one of the few that have very sensitive skin and can only use ProActiv sparingly, but I love this mosturizer.  It soothed my dry skin, and I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Good product for the money. It was bigger than I had thought and was worth the money. Works very well to hydrate my skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I guess it does what it needs, but doesn&#x27;t help my acne. I will be switching to a different moisturizer once I am done with this though.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for all skin types. For years this has been my favorite moisturizer and I continue to buy it even though I don&#x27;t use other proactiv products anymore</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and applies smooth. It also feels very light and it doesn&#x27;t affect my make up!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my face and the consistency is nice. I added this product to my daily morning routine last year and since then, I have noticed that my skin has been a lot nicer. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer because it absorbs quickly into the skin and has a very nice, light scent.  It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin as well.</li>
    <li> The absolute best moisturizer for acne prone skin! Even though you may have oily skin, when you pass a certain age, you still need to moisturize it.</li>
    <li> I was previously shipped this product by accident (I had ordered another Proactiv product). I LOVE this moisturizer. It is light, not heavy and greasy. It absorbs completely into skin in 30 seconds. I can really tell a difference in my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it and will not be without it!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer, however I think it&#x27;s most suitable for combination/oily skin. My skin is combination/dry (i get oily/acne-prone in my t-zone), and this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seem to give me quite the moisture I need, especially during the winter months. I like that it doesn&#x27;t break me out at all, and seems to be somewhat calming for my sensitive skin. I still continue to use this product, but I have to mix it with Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion (which is too greasy alone), and they seem to balance each other out. I&#x27;m still searching for my perfect moisturizer...sadly this is not it!</li>
    <li> I have problems with Acne and have used several proactive products for years..They are good/helpful products however for the moistuizer I find that Cetaphil DermaControl Moisturizer works better for me...</li>
    <li> My daughter has tried many different moisturizers for her combination sensitive skin.  After receiving this  and using it for a week, she keeps telling me I should try using it, too.  She is absolutely sold on this moisturizer.  She likes that it soothes and moisturizes well, but feels very light.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love Proactiv&#x27;s green tea moisturizer and had been buying it from the original creator&#x27;s website and spending almost twice as much as I do when buying it from Amazon. My skin is highly sensitive to metals, fabric and the sun and this is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break me out and feels so replenishing on my face. You have to try it out.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers I have ever used.  Love everything about it except for the price -- only 2.5 oz for $18?  Ouch.</li>
    <li> Awesome product at an awesome price.</li>
    <li> My teenager has used this before with success and requested it .</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and use it every day. It is lightweight, not greasy and smells awesome. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and no problems with delivery</li>
    <li> Good price, love how it feels, will be purchasing again. Definitely better than going through the company, I think you save over $15 purchasing it here.</li>
    <li> I have used Proactiv products for many years...When they introduced the new moisturizer I received a sample...Very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;lightly scented, in a gel like formula...absorbs nicely and leaves face feeling clean and protected..</li>
    <li> I have been using this every night before bed.  It&#x27;s neither the best or worst moisturizer I ever used, but then, I&#x27;m always looking for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; one.  I do like the product very much.  It is not greasy and it seems to absorb very well.</li>
    <li> So far so good for someone who hate using moisturizer, I used to stop after serum and go straight to sunblock or foundation, now I use this sparingly after serum. This product did not disappoint me.</li>
    <li> I tried this moisturizer a few years ago. I had forgotten how much I liked it. I have combination skin, so it&#x27;s hard to find a good moisturizer. This moisturizer is perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. I love it. The smell is nice, and it feels nice and light on the skin. Non irritating.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face but made it drier.  I had the impression that because it is made of green tea it would  be a good one.</li>
    <li> Ugh so frustrated.  Been trying to find a moisturizer that will NOT make me break out.  I thought surely Proactiv would meet my need.  I was wrong......... I was breaking out after just 2 days of use.  I read the ingredients and it has dimithecone - which always makes me break out.  It&#x27;s silicone ladies.......like the stuff we all put in our hair to make it smooth and shiny.  So disappointed in this product and  I can&#x27;t return because this vendor doesn&#x27;t accept returns.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s lightweight but moisturizes very, very well. It feels so nice on my skin, very refreshing. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product does not Moisturize my skin at all. I have to apply it 2-3 times every morning just so my skin doesn&#x27;t peel. The regular proactiv lotion is way better</li>
    <li> Definately giving our Carver Tub a 5(EXCELLENT)!!  It sure makes for a relaxing bath, it&#x27;s so nice &amp; deep &amp; the jets  sure relieve them aching muscles, I like them because they make lots &amp; lots of bubbles!!  We don&#x27;t always use the lights, since we always seem to have too many bubbles!  This tub is definately worth the $$$ spent..  Will for sure buy from CarverTubs.com again if we ever need another tub...Oh, &amp; the transaction online went smoothly too!  GREAT customer service!&lt;br /&gt;Marc &amp; Laurie Rayborn</li>
    <li> Love it! Moisturizers my face without breaking me out! And leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. I reccomend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son to use with Benzoyl Peroxide for acne.  He likes it, and wanted more.  When I went to reorder, I saw that it had gone up over 60% in price for this size.  But other sizes (from other vendors, probably) of the same product are priced pretty wildly, and you can save money by buying smaller amounts, or larger amounts, so search alternatives.  I see an add-on price for a 1oz size that is close to the same price as I originally paid, and a quantity of 10 of that size for about half the current price.</li>
    <li> fake, watered down. Not the real stuff at all.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference using this product.  It is a bit oily takes a long time to dry.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff and hope it never gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite moisturizer, it doesnt feel greasy, its light &amp; feels good on my skin. Got everything in a timely manner also great seller</li>
    <li> This is a nice lightweight, non-greasy  moisturizer. Has a very faint fragrance of  green tea. This  is the  one  for me ( ;</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer at night because it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF in it. It smells great, absorbs quickly, and it keeps my skin soft and I noticed a definite improvement in my skin tone after I started using it a couple years ago. I still love it!</li>
    <li> Very much like this product! Is a great moisturizer and use a small amt before putting on make-up. Doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin or cause break-outs.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever</li>
    <li> I use a regular Proactiv moisturizer most days, But I use this when I get razor burn or a little too much sun. It feels very cool and nice on the skin, and it calms down any sort of inflammation. Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more, even for a daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a moisturizing cream for dry hands.  It is a great, non-greasy product, but it doesn&#x27;t solve my dry skin problem.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for summer but it&#x27;s not the best for my winter dry skin.</li>
    <li> fresh cool feeling, awesome for oily skin and dry skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this moisturizer for my son, BUT I have to say that I even use it.... He uses it along w/ his Proactiv Kit. The moisturizer leaves your face so moisturized and feeling sooo refreshed. My son uses it twice a day and I use it only in the morning. He says he face NEEDS this green tea moisturizer because his face feels nice and smooth when he uses it.</li>
    <li> A must have light moisturizer for me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good moisturiser.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is awesome!  It is great if your face tends to break out like mine did because your face can become dry, but this makes your skin smooth and feels like it just drinks in the moisture.  It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts either.  I use it every day, twice a day, and will continue to use it as long as Proactiv continues to make it.  The green tea is also natural and great in skin care products.  Would recommend this to anyone who cares about their skin.....excellent moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. It smells amazing! If you apply just a  little under your nose, you&#x27;ll smell it most of the day. It has a relaxing aroma. If you want this moisturizer, buy from this page. The bottle is much bigger than how it is pictured. I was impressed. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s light weight&lt;br /&gt;applies smoothly</li>
    <li> I have VERY oily skin and I can&#x27;t imagine going a day without this moisturizer! It is not only lightweight, but it feels weirdly refreshing when you put it on. Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like most moisturizers. It always soaks into my skin leaving it matte and perfectly moisturized! This has defiantly helped reduce the oil on my face!</li>
    <li> This is the only mostirizer I use, it smells wonderfully natural and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  I absolutely love it and plan on continuing to use it forever.</li>
    <li> It was the real product at a much better price than anything you could pick up from Proactive! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I love this. It is soft and light on your skin with the most pleasant scent. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and this really helps With the dryness. It is a litte pricey but definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve tossed out so many moisturizers in the past when they claimed to be appropriate for acne prone skin but were awful.  I try to but several when I find it on sale so I always have a tube on hand. Highly ,recommended!</li>
    <li> I got this moisturizer as a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; when I used to be on the Proactiv autoship. I&#x27;ve since discontinued my membership and only purchase through amazon, and always go back to this product when I run out! I haven&#x27;t found another moisturizer that works on my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. Feels like such a light formula. Would recommend to anyone who hasn&#x27;t quite found one they like. It&#x27;s worth a try and you might be surprised!</li>
    <li> This is probably my fourth bottle of this. It leaves your skin so soft and has a nice aroma. Try it.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It leaves my skin very smooth and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes. Highly recommended. Proactiv is a great product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Moisturizer does it&#x27;s job quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel oily. I have been using it for about a year.</li>
    <li> works really good with or without proactiv products. its good if you use it daily. its also good for the skin n its moisturizers n keeps it moisturized all day.long. love this product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is perfect for very oily skin. It goes on feather-light and does not cause breakouts, while leaving skin feeling smooth and flexible.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;My face dries out very easily and will become iritable, red and will start flaking off like dandruff around my nose and eyebrows. However I do not have any acne issues. After a few days of use, my skin became much healthier. After a week&#x27;s use you couldn&#x27;t even tell I had any dryness issues at all. It absorbed into my skin very well and left no oily residue. Works better than many other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This product is very expensive. I also found it to have a medice-like smell to it which lingered for about 10-15 min after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I decided to keep the Proactiv in my travel pouch, but my main facial moisturizer is the Aveeno Whipped Souffle (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003K75V72) which moisturizes a bit better, has no odor to it and is much cheaper for a larger quantity.</li>
    <li> My first time trying this and i am very happy with the product&lt;br /&gt;not to mention i got it from here instead proactive is a plus!!!</li>
    <li> I am not a PROACTIVE member so I try to get some if these things from Amazon Prime.  Some things you cannot get.</li>
    <li> I had no idea you could buy these individually online. I always bought it at the mall and paid wayyy to much.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> it is a skin moisturizer of some sort.  and it does moisturize skin as well as most drugstore bought products.</li>
    <li> I really like all of the Proactiv poducts, but I LOVE this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture, very light and makes my skin soft to the touch.  With no oily sheen or feel.  It&#x27;s perfect to go under the mineral powder foundations that I use: Sheer Cover &amp; also Bare Minerals.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a watered down product compared to the original green tea moisturizer. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Granted it&#x27;s a bigger bottle, but the 30ml bottle sold by pro-cor merchandising is the real proactiv green tea moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Not oily at all. Very light and refreshing. Gets absorbed instantly and I love the scent as well. Highly recommended to oily skin type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for more thsn 4 years and I haven&#x27;t had a break out since.  Love the Green Tea moisturizer as my skin is combination oily/dry.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for a couple of days. First time I applied was at night and the next morning my face felt so soft.  I have been applying on my face and it seems to even out my skin as well as keep it soft.  My skin has  calmed down.  I have been searching for a face moisturizer that won&#x27;t irritate or cause me to break out.  Yes it costs more than most moisturizers out there, but it&#x27;s worth to buy when it does a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:  when I use it for three to four days, I start to develop little red bumps on my face.  This is a shame because I really like the way if feels on and has a great scent.  One or more of the ingredients are irritating me</li>
    <li> I had bought the sample kit of Proactive over a year ago, and it came with the Green Tea Moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t use the Proactive acne kit anymore, but I really missed using the Green Tea Moisturizer.  Since then I have tried so many different ones, but nothing even compared.  It is a little bit more expensive than the other moisturizers I have bought, but it is well worth it.  It feels very light, has a slight great smell, and it doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy like the last product I used.  I just got this in the mail today and I am so happy.  I would also like to add that the product is about $15 cheaper through Amazon, rather than through Proactive, and it was in new condition.</li>
    <li> this product is fantastic, it feels very light and non-greasy. I&#x27;ve used many products in the past but they usually makes me breakout.  This product does its job and does not cuase any breakouts!</li>
    <li> great product. What you see is what you get. I will buy from them again without question.</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but this isn&#x27;t the same. It was more of a gel than the moisturizer that I used to use. Not a fan</li>
    <li> The best for acne prone skin imo</li>
    <li> I have a very annoying skin type.  Oily nose and forehead, dry cheeks and eyes.  This is the ONLY moisturizer that compensates both of these problems.  It also tones down the red undertone I have to my sensitive skin on my face, evening out my complexion.  I don&#x27;t even use the Proactiv System!  Just go right for this moisturizer.  Perfect for dry winter skin, and I don&#x27;t need any coverup in the summer.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer helps to keep my skin clear of bumps and blackheads. I use it twice a day and at night I let it dry and then add my night moisturizer. Also helps stop itching on neck and chest area..DeShane</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think Proactiv makes this product in a size larger than 1 oz. but I decided to try the 2.5 oz anyway because I love this moisturizer.  It seems different, possibly diluted?  Will go back to the 1 oz tubes.</li>
    <li> Extremely light, helps to clam irritation with a slight cooling sensation (at least for me). It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film and will not clog pores. Out of all the moisturizers from Proactive this is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and I did not feel it moisture . I would not recommend to someone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> You can use this as much as needed for dry, sensitive skin and it won&#x27;t leave your skin greasy. I&#x27;ve tried every other moisturizer you can find in stores and nothing compares to this one. All the ones in stores always leave a greasy oily feeling to my skin, even when they say &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;non-comedogenic&amp;#34; and stuff like that. All other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried are also so heavy and creamy and leave a sticky feeling, but the Green Tea moisturizer is a light-weight, truly non-greasy, oil-free, and non-comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores) moisturizer. It never feels sticky. You can re-apply it as much as needed. It smells great, too! It doesn&#x27;t give me pimple, and almost everything gives me pimples. It&#x27;s water based moisturizer so it&#x27;s truly light-weight. It is very calming to my sensitive skin, too. It doesn&#x27;t burn if I have pimples or blemishes, while other moisturizes I&#x27;ve tried burn my skin when I have blemishes. It&#x27;s great for dry, oily, sensitive, irritated, eczema and redness prone skin, like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this moisturizer when I tried the proactive system. It came as a free gift.The proactiv 3 step system worked at first but then I became allergic to the benzoyl peroxide (not and ingredient in the green tea moisturizer), but the green tea moisturizer was the best thing about being a proactive member because you could get it at a reduced price. But now I think it&#x27;s actually cheaper on amazon than on the proactiv site. Great deal!</li>
    <li> works well, not greasy and a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have been searching all over for a great, fresh moisturizer for my face. I finally came upon this and after reading the reviews was determined to get it. I have very oily skin and didn&#x27;t realize that the packaging stated for dry skin so I was a bit leery. But it has worked wonders. It leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed and with no shine - which is great!!! I will continue to buy this for as long as I possible can.</li>
    <li> This works better then any brand of lotion on the market period.</li>
    <li> Price was right, and the product is great, definitely beats paying a lot more for less product at the mall.</li>
    <li> Has methyl parabens! :(</li>
    <li> I have been using proactiv green tea moisturizer for 2 years. The one I just received from this seller is bad quality. It is not like the good old moisturizer, it is diluted and awful. Save your money and do not buy this thrash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been spoiled for all other moisturizers. This is hands down the best I have ever used. It only takes a little bit, it goes on easily and disappears into my skin without leaving any greasy residue and it keeps my skin soft and moisturized all day without getting oily. It&#x27;s worth paying a little bit more for a product that really works.</li>
    <li> this really absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling very soft;  i am 58 years old and this helps my occasional pimple.  Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> I shave and put this stuff on. The Best, makes your skin smooth and kinda smells like you came from the beach.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a year, but just recently purchased it from this seller. It was extremely watery, and didn&#x27;t have the same consistency that the product usually has!</li>
    <li> God moisturizer. Does peel a bit but good nonetheless. Nice, fresh smell. Leaves skin feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Absorbs completely into your skin, leaves skin feeling fresh and hydrated. Works great under makeup because it never leaves your skin greasy like some other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This is actually the 5th bottle of this lotion I purchased so far, but the first time from amazon, just because I used to be a member at proactiv but didn&#x27;t use all there products that they were sending me every month so I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the rest, but it really moisturizes your skin through out the day and it&#x27;s not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind which I like. I also suffer from acne and it doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts for me. It took me years looking for the right moisturizer for my skin and I&#x27;m glad I finally found it.</li>
    <li> I hated the Proactiv cleanser, repairing cream &amp; toner, it made my skin problems worse but I love, love LOVE this green tea moisturizer! Not greasy at all, pleasant smell &amp; worked wonders for the skin, especially under my eyes! I had this crepey, wrinkley \\&quot;chicken-skin\\&quot; &amp; dark circles under my eyes that expensive name brand eye creams did nothing for but this Proactiv Green Tea Moisturizer worked miracles for me! I like Cetaphil but like so many other moisturizers it also caused me to break out where as this green tea moisturizer does not in fact this helps my fine lines &amp; blemishes to go away without irritating, being greasy or shiny at all, I honestly hope they NEVER stop making this!!!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried this moisturizer before and I am very pleasantly surprise that it just as good as the Oil-Free Moiisturizer.  Great price and great product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer!  I actually wasn&#x27;t expecting such a big tube either! I only use this for my face and it is just wonderful! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different face moisturizers trying to find one similar to this one after using the sample that comes with the face wash because this one is a little pricy compared to others. I can&#x27;t find anything that even compares.  It doesn&#x27;t have any SPF, but I use it at night after my shower.  It&#x27;s just feels so refreshing and has that light refreshing smell and dries up like there&#x27;s nothing but softness on your face.  Not at all greasy.  It&#x27;s just perfect and worth the $$ in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I have extremely oily skin and moisturizers even oil free ones break my face out.  This one actually hydrates my face and keeps it from itching from being too dry and doesn&#x27;t break it out.  It almost seems to be clearer using this moisturizer.  I also use the Proactiv original acne treatment 3 step system.</li>
    <li> I use a SPF+moisturizer after showering in the morning already. But I recently got this one for night. It does not leave skin feeling oily at all. It leaves a clean feeling, no residue or anything like that. I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Started using this moisturizer about 3 yrs ago as a base prior to applying makeup.  It is wonderful.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  I used it before as a teen when I had really bad acne but never bought more because I didn&#x27;t have money to back then lol.  It is kind of expensive if you buy it from the proactiv site but it&#x27;s a lot more inexpensive on amazon.  Leaves skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer does pretty well.  It&#x27;s not my favorite that I&#x27;ve ever used, and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an SPF in it.  It does work fine, not too heavy, and a great option for people with oily/acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I bought it in the 1 oz container first and fell it love with the scent and feel. Looking for a non-comedogenic moisturizer when you have problem acne is a must and it is very difficult! This product fits the bill and does not cause any breakouts while offering some moisture, a clean scent and nice texture. Love it - will buy it as long as its available. The Proactive line in its entirety is too much for my 47-year-old skin, but this moisturizer is very nice. I just use a separate eye cream.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer because it&#x27;s not too oily and leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean! It has a really light scent to it, so it&#x27;s not over-powering.</li>
    <li> Really loved this product when I used the Proactive line. Since then I have switched cleansers but elected to continue using this mosturizer since it is not heavy when my skin can tend to be oily. Was so excited when was able to purchase it here.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I have found that leaves my skin feeling hydrated without feeling sticky or greasy. All of the other moisturizers I have tried didn&#x27;t mix well with my makeup (bare minerals), but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin. It works well to moisturize but I think proactiv just really dries my skin all together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this moisturizer for about a week, but I can say that I am very happy with it so far. I have sensitive acne prone skin and this does not cause me to breakout like other moisturizers have had in the past. The product also has a light texture which spreads easily and dries fast, which is a huge plus for me because I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time rubbing it in. It also has a subtle, yet, pleasing scent that does not overpower. There is also a slight cooling sensation which feels very refreshing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only criticism I have is that it does NOT include an SPF and it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the amount you get. (A 2.5 oz bottle would probably only last a month or less).&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the proactiv system for several years.  I would recommend everybody try this product. I love it.</li>
    <li> I could not use this product, because it burned my skin and make it even more red. I&#x27;m disappointed that I could not return it because of the seller policy. This product might be good for acne, but not for ROSACEA.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, product as advertised.</li>
    <li> The product feels like gel - while it absorbs quickly, it makes no significant difference on the skin. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This face mask did absolutely nothing. It didnt break me out (which was unusual b/c I have sensitive skin), but it didnt work either. I think a lot of things from Amazon is just outdated (old).</li>
    <li> arrived on time. This is a great product if you have dry skin. I don&#x27;t like the proactive cleansers and toner but this is the best!</li>
    <li> love love love this product. was fast and easy to order great product. will def buy again will be a returning customer</li>
    <li> Moisturizer as a drying agent?  No. This is an awful product. My mild acne got worse. Get away from the chemical crap and find real moisture in natural oils. Your skin may thank you.</li>
    <li> I love the way it moisturizes W/O leaving a greasy feel.  It really seems to promote healing of dry spots on my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the other proactiv products but I use a clean and clear face wash and afterwards I pamper myself with the Proactiv green tea moisturizer and my skin feels like baby&#x27;s bottom lol. I don&#x27;t very much at all so it will last me quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Good lotion, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t say its any better than an oil of Olay or similar brand.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used on my face.  It goes on so smooth and soaks in immediately without leaving shine or greasiness. I have oily and acne prone skin and this DOES NOT break me out! I&#x27;ve used another oil-free moisturizer for years, but it never helped with occasional dry patches. The green tea leaves my skin hydrated and balanced.  Also looks great with makeup!</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer, Period.</li>
    <li> Good to calm skin after Proactiv  product use.  Best for spring, summer, fall.  A little lightweight for winter if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer, its light and moisturizing and it smells good. But I am not sure if my skin likes it yet.</li>
    <li> I use this because it&#x27;s not oily feeling.  I have also found that most of the moisturizers leave dry spot on my skin.  I am elderly and expect my skin not to be as it was when I was young but this product seems to work the best.  Also this site has the best price for the product.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of proactiv products in the past and always been very happy with them, this one is no different... reasonably priced and does what is supposed to!!</li>
    <li> the green tea moisterizer i had before smelt better in my opinion, or maybe its just me. but very lightweight, goes on smoothly, made my skin a little greasy at first but absorbed into my skin within like 5 mins. keeps my skin from breaking into a rash. so im satisfied.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Got this for my teenage daughter. Very soothing!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I just wish it was more cost effective.  Pricey... but worth it.  I haven&#x27;t found anything else like it anywhere.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works wonders for my skin! It smells nice and fresh, and it feels light on the skin (doesn&#x27;t feel greasy). This moisturizer is ideal for sensitive, acne-prone skin. This is also a good size bottle that will last you quite a while. And this is an amazing price for such a generous amount of a great product. I strongly recomend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer smells wonderful, and I love the way it makes my skin feel right after I put it on. My face is soft, smooth, and non-greasy. It absorbs fast, which is always good before applying makeup. However, once it absorbs, my cheeks and chin get dry/flaky right after, and I have to apply some more. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but it really depends on your skin type, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for dry/combination skin (I have combination skin).</li>
    <li> Green tea is something I&#x27;ve been looking for at a reasonable price.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break me out or dry out my already dry skin.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Luv this protect, but I wish it was more affordable.  It was delivered right on time in good quality.  I only use this on my face at night time.</li>
</ol>
