      <li>Amazing excellent.</li>
      <li>and I can say that I do see results that I am extremely happy with.</li>
      <li>but otherwise I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>I think this is a great device to use to get rid of lesions or blemishes on the skin.</li>
      <li>This is good in theory, but in reality mine is junk.  </li>
      <li>It has needles on it, did you think it was going to feel good?</li>
      <li>Make sure you use a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fair and honest.</li>
      <li>At this time I haven&#x27;t found anything that works any better than lemon juice!</li>
      <li>so I purchased this product hoping the great reviews would be accurate.</li>
      <li>I bought this exact Derma Roller because I love the color purple and because it had many wonderful reviews.</li>
      <li>the cleanser I use is DHC soap after cleaning face I will daub suitable functional nutrition.</li>
      <li>far as the results, I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
      <li>Always be sure to sterilize any needle before using.  </li>
      <li>The packaging came crumpled on one side but the actual product was perfectly intact.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>What i noticed better results is by using a cleansing mask and then exfoliate my face after.</li>
      <li>have been used the microneedles for more than 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>The reason there are so many great reviews on this technique/procedure is because it really does work and it will transform your skin...</li>
      <li>Use it once a month at most.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just on my one cheek mostly.  </li>
      <li>my skin looks better.</li>
      <li>When I first got this, I tried rolling it rather fast over my skin thinking it would be the best way.  </li>
      <li>And it is important to know that the more rolling and bleeding you do in one session the quicker and better</li>
      <li>It is SO cheap, and can be used before applying serums to get the most of your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get it, and use it 1-2x a week.</li>
      <li>The most important is that my pimples are removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>boy, whomever discovered this is nothing short of brilliant.  </li>
      <li>I think it is very sturdy, good quality</li>
      <li>Easy to handles.</li>
      <li>When I first saw the derma roller, I thought it was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>There is a beautiful inner box for you to keep and store the neeles.</li>
      <li>I looked fine.</li>
      <li>However, an hour later my skin looked great and plump.</li>
      <li>Just have to lightly roll across the skin</li>
      <li>The case design is great though - I would definitely not buy one without one.</li>
      <li>I am excited about this though.  </li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m rather excited to see how I&#x27;m looking in about 2 months...</li>
      <li>Unique design.</li>
      <li>Also, I soaked it in rubbing alcohol before using and I always clean with alcohol after each use.  </li>
      <li>and it came right on time!</li>
      <li>I do the treatment before bed because my skin does turn bright red afterwards...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s works so great on the pimples, I can see the dramatically change of my own face in such a short time.</li>
      <li>Ive been searching for some many ways to get rid of my scars, I have ice pick scars mainly.</li>
      <li>like it very much !</li>
      <li>Really gets rid of fine lines on the face.</li>
      <li>what I think is most important is that you get the needles in the skin enough to stimulate the collagen and healing.  </li>
      <li>For under $20, I thought it was worth looking into.</li>
      <li>(that and around the mouth are the most sensitive areas) and see how I can tolerate it without numbing.</li>
      <li>and I have some old light scarring from cystic acne..</li>
      <li>After only one use my skin feels and looks better.</li>
      <li>I need to heal the mark it lift on my skin and that I test it first on my skin</li>
      <li>instead end of my face first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a youthful 44 year old with light skin with olive tone</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty much cleared by the morning</li>
      <li>Reduce the pimples and diminishes appearance of cellulite and stretch marks, large pores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not rolling in any certain number of times..</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure by reading all of the other reviews on exactly the correct size.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, and I notice a huge difference in my acne scarring.  </li>
      <li>I really like the derma roller alot.</li>
      <li>I was getting really nervous about the amount of money I was going to have to spend doing microdermabrasion/peels/lasers etc...</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:mo1566N0RM42YEM]]You may not believe usd11.99 can bring you so much surprise.</li>
      <li>Just experiment and figure how much your skin needs...</li>
      <li>I really cannot believe the transformation already.  </li>
      <li>First I will disinfect the micro needle by 75% alcohol and dry it for 15 minutes then clean my face,</li>
      <li>When I first time received the microneedles I was surprised by the pakage, the brand</li>
      <li>I used the roller after doing that and felt like I saw way better results than previous times.</li>
      <li>But that can&#x27;t be attributed to this particular product.</li>
      <li>My face had large pores that were not too noticeably large, but large enough to make me not want them.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying it.  </li>
      <li>I must say, I have a high tolerance for pain, but this takes the cake.  </li>
      <li>But then I read more about and found that those little holes cause the skin to start producing collagen.</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s not taking much at all to have my skin react..</li>
      <li>If I had to do it again, I would ordered it from Amazon prime and paid a few dollars more.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think there is any one right way as everyone is different</li>
      <li>I am also using a new face cream so that may be confounding the results.</li>
      <li>I am a new user of this tool.  </li>
      <li>in regards to other reviewers who gave low scores: if you think that using ANY product for ONE month will drastically change your face/stretch marks etc.. You need to be more realistic.</li>
      <li>What more it comes with a very very specific instruction which tell you how to use it, what the function and other details of the needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to have many pimples, too oil, big pole and black heads.</li>
      <li>I started doing it once every week and a half and am seeing results after about two months and an really excited to see my acne scars go away.  </li>
      <li>After that I saw my face  smoother, clear.</li>
      <li>It clearly states what it is and what it does.</li>
      <li>First review from a long time amazon addict.</li>
      <li>So far I  have used it 2 times and I can&#x27;t believe the difference I see in my skin already.  </li>
      <li>Well everyone has different levels of how much they can tolerate.  </li>
      <li>I am a 38 years old woman.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t bother me that much after the 3rd and 4th use.</li>
      <li>So far I like what I have seen.</li>
      <li>I  need to purchase a different size needle as this one doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
      <li>It help me get rid of all my face problem (pimples, big pole and oil, etc) which trouble me so many years .i</li>
      <li>Pores look smaller and skin look like new skin.</li>
      <li>nothing major</li>

    <li> I ordered this on August 9 and received it August 27 even though the order said I would receive it the earliest September 5; either way it DID arrive faster than initially indicated. The packaging came crumpled on one side but the actual product was perfectly intact. I&#x27;m not sure if there were supposed to be actual paper instructions other than what was on the packaging but otherwise I&#x27;m happy. This was the cheapest (I paid $5.35) version of this roller on Amazon, while others charged $15, so it was a REALLY good deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a youthful 44 year old with light skin with olive tone and I have some old light scarring from cystic acne..nothing major but I can see it.  It&#x27;s just on my one cheek mostly.  When I first got this, I tried rolling it rather fast over my skin thinking it would be the best way.  Nope it isn&#x27;t so I&#x27;ve learned.  I don&#x27;t think there is any one right way as everyone is different and it&#x27;s best to experiment to find what works best for you.  For me, I am now setting it in place on my skin so the needles sink in and this doesn&#x27;t hurt at all doing this..then, I slowly roll it.  I&#x27;m not rolling in any certain number of times..your skin will tell you when you&#x27;ve had enough...always listen to your body...everyone is different.  So far, it&#x27;s not taking much at all to have my skin react..what I think is most important is that you get the needles in the skin enough to stimulate the collagen and healing.  In short of a one week, my skin looks unbelievable.  I really cannot believe the transformation already.  A series of peels couldn&#x27;t do this, I know.  The reason there are so many great reviews on this technique/procedure is because it really does work and it will transform your skin...forget about spending money at a spa hoping and hoping for results. I do the treatment before bed because my skin does turn bright red afterwards...it&#x27;s pretty much cleared by the morning so no one will notice.  Just experiment and figure how much your skin needs...your skin will tell you.  Well, I&#x27;m rather excited to see how I&#x27;m looking in about 2 months...boy, whomever discovered this is nothing short of brilliant.  Also, I soaked it in rubbing alcohol before using and I always clean with alcohol after each use.  Always be sure to sterilize any needle before using.  I don&#x27;t always put anything on my face after rolling either...I try to be as natural as possible.  Thank you for reading my review..it&#x27;s fair and honest.</li>
    <li> I received this product as it was described. However, be prepared to wait forever to get this item. If I had to do it again, I would ordered it from Amazon prime and paid a few dollars more.</li>
    <li> Item arrived earlier than expected., Excellent service. I will recommend the derma roller to others. 5 stars rating. Really gets rid of fine lines on the face.</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical about this product. Sometimes it&#x27;s nice to be proven wrong. After only one use my skin feels and looks better. Just remember your skin needs time to heal. Use it once a month at most.</li>
    <li> This item is just as pictured. Works great. I actually Google - videos to show how to use it fro a company that specializes in using these.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the derma roller, I thought it was too good to be true. But, hey, it will &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; wrinkles and scars with enough time and use? For under $20, I thought it was worth looking into. Been using it steadily for the past few weeks and haven&#x27;t seen much (if any) change. Will keep trying and will update my review in another month.</li>
    <li> Bought this one after reading a lot.  Gotta say that after using it in the night you can see a little difference in your skin in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it and update later</li>
    <li> I decided to try the roller on just one arm to see if it helped my crepey skin.  After a few treatments, it doesn&#x27;t really look any different from the arm that I didn&#x27;t roll.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact Derma Roller because I love the color purple and because it had many wonderful reviews. I got the 1.0 mm length needles to use on my face and stretch marks around my body. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face once every week and I can say that I do see results that I am extremely happy with. My face had large pores that were not too noticeably large, but large enough to make me not want them. It is also very painful to use, but for me I notice that I got used to the pain and it didn&#x27;t bother me that much after the 3rd and 4th use. I think this is a great device to use to get rid of lesions or blemishes on the skin. And it is important to know that the more rolling and bleeding you do in one session the quicker and better your results will be.</li>
    <li> This is good in theory, but in reality mine is junk.  It was too big (wide) to use easily on my face and way too small to use on my body. I don&#x27;t see any differences in my skin, even after looking both here and elsewhere to see if I was doing something wrong or could do something better.  The needles on mine feel very dull and they DO hurt.  The brand listed here now is not the one I bought, so maybe there&#x27;s a difference.  The case design is great though - I would definitely not buy one without one.</li>
    <li> So far I like what I have seen. The only thing is, that I used the Derma roller  3 times in one week, then my face had little, tiny scabs all over, for like two days and after that my face was peeling. After that I saw my face  smoother, clear. I like!! but definitely start with one time a week.</li>
    <li> What I did not like about this is despite all the length options, it does not give recommendations on how often to do it.  I got the 1.0 size and researched how often to do it and got answers ranging from once every five weeks to three times every week:/ I started doing it once every week and a half and am seeing results after about two months and an really excited to see my acne scars go away.  What i noticed better results is by using a cleansing mask and then exfoliate my face after. I used the roller after doing that and felt like I saw way better results than previous times.</li>
    <li> I have deep stretch marks on my legs and stomach so I purchased this product hoping the great reviews would be accurate. I have used this device faithfully (1-2x&#x27;s daily) for 2 months and there was absolutely no change. In addition to using this tool, I have a strict skincare regimen of oils and creams. Nothing has changed; therefore, disappointed.</li>
    <li> First review from a long time amazon addict. I too am looking for an antiaging miracle but will settle for anything that works. Just used this for the first time few days ago. Bought the 1mm MS roller. Inspected it carefully upon arrival and the needles were sharp and straight. I used Dr. Numb numbing cream to numb up beforehand (which, despite the mixed amazon reviews, numbed my face quite thoroughly), cleansed the roller and my face and then had a friend roll my face fairly aggressively. The treatment was not comfortable per se but definitely not excruciating either. With the numbing cream discomfort maybe a 4/10. Felt like someone was pricking my face and lots of little popping sensations from the needle breaking the skin which was rather odd but not unbearable. I actually really disliked the sensation of my face being numb so I think for the next treatment I will just numb my forehead (that and around the mouth are the most sensitive areas) and see how I can tolerate it without numbing. I was pretty red after with minimal pinpoint bleeding. By the next morning I looked normal except for teeny tiny little red marks scattered around my face - bottom line I looked fine. After a few days I have to say my skin is looking minimally tighter. I am also using a new face cream so that may be confounding the results. Nevertheless I will be sticking with this, probably once a week or so and see how things are looking over time. It is my understanding that maximum results are not seen until several months out as collagen takes time to form and lay down/ organize.</li>
    <li> This item was ship on time. I did not like it , it hurt and left me with awful marks. I need to heal the mark it lift on my skin and that I test it first on my skin instead end of my face first. Don&#x27;t care for this. :(</li>
    <li> I figured for the price, why not. I&#x27;m glad I did. I have seen improvement in my skin when I use this regularly. Those who say they bled, pressed way too hard. Not meant to use as a meat tenderizer! Just have to lightly roll across the skin and you can feel it worked. BTW...use it at a time you don&#x27;t have to go out as your skin will be red for at least 6 hours.</li>
    <li> Very pleased!!! Pores look smaller and skin look like new skin. I truly recommend this tool. Amazing excellent. Just try it!!!</li>
    <li> Easy...followed directions, no improvement noted.  Very disappointed; had high hopes.  At this time I haven&#x27;t found anything that works any better than lemon juice!</li>
    <li> Sturdy, works perfectly. Maybe I&#x27;ll try for a bigger gauge to see results. Results should take over a month though</li>
    <li> I really like the derma roller alot. I think it is very sturdy, good quality and it came right on time! Would definitely recommend to anyone with stretch marks</li>
    <li> I must say, I have a high tolerance for pain, but this takes the cake.  Ouch!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the results, I&#x27;m impressed.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, and I notice a huge difference in my acne scarring.  I have had severe acne scarring since I was 16.  I&#x27;m now 32 and I want to get rid of it.  I don&#x27;t have ice pick scarring.  I just have darkened pigmentation (uneven skin tone).  I&#x27;m african amerian, so I didn&#x27;t want to have laser treatment done, as it is not suitable for our skin.  This is definitely doing the trick.  I highly recommend trying it.  Make sure you use a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am going to order different sizes now.  I am a new user of this tool.  So far I  have used it 2 times and I can&#x27;t believe the difference I see in my skin already.  I just need to purchase the smaller sizes for under  my eyes and my face.  I wasn&#x27;t sure by reading all of the other reviews on exactly the correct size.  According to the box it says to use the .05 for your face and I have the 1.5 for your body.  Well everyone has different levels of how much they can tolerate.  I am excited about this though.  I have spent alot of money on all sorts of anti aging creams and also have had fillers done with botox.  This is definetly something I am going to stay with.</li>
    <li> Ive been searching for some many ways to get rid of my scars, I have ice pick scars mainly. I have had acne for about 13 years... I took accutane for a few months and it cleared up recently. I noticed a lot of scarring left behind and after 2 treatments of the Derma Roller my skin looks better. I do it every other day to let my skin heal.  My skin is brighter and scars that I&#x27;ve had for years are starting to fade. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1566N0RM42YEM]]You may not believe usd11.99 can bring you so much surprise. The answer is YES!&lt;br /&gt;I have been used the microneedles for more than 3 weeks. It help me get rid of all my face problem (pimples, big pole and oil, etc) which trouble me so many years .i like it very much ! Now let me tell you the reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Reduce the pimples and diminishes appearance of cellulite and stretch marks, large pores. I am not so familiar with other functions such as smoothes heavy pitted skin, helps reverse effects of sun damage ,etc but it&#x27;s works so great on the pimples, I can see the dramatically change of my own face in such a short time. I am a 38 years old woman. I used to have many pimples, too oil, big pole and black heads. I have been used the size 0.5mm microneedles for 3 weeks. Now I can see my skin is smoother and clearer than before. The most important is that my pimples are removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Unique design. When I first time received the microneedles I was surprised by the pakage, the brand Melodysusie care every detail. There is a beautiful inner box for you to keep and store the neeles. What more it comes with a very very specific instruction which tell you how to use it, what the function and other details of the needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to handles. I use the needles 3time a week at home by myself. First I will disinfect the micro needle by 75% alcohol and dry it for 15 minutes then clean my face, the cleanser I use is DHC soap after cleaning face I will daub suitable functional nutrition. The next step is to use the microneedles. I usually move the roller four times at least in four directions horizontally, vertically, and diagonally right and left(refer to figures)total in 5minutes,rember to pay attention the place where need to be cured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. No permanent damage to the skin, no pain during the procedure. Don&#x27;t think it will be pain and hurt your skin; it hurts a little when you first try it. Your skin looks a littlered and feels like you have slight sunburn afterwards. However, an hour later my skin looked great and plump. 3weekes later I stated to see a few scars (above my eyes) get a little lighter. I first read about it on a site called wrinkle-free-skin-tips and was really afraid to try it. It looks scary ....putting holes into my skin. But then I read more about and found that those little holes cause the skin to start producing collagen. So I try and it won&#x27;t make me disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It can be used on thin skin, and on all areas of the face, neck and body even on head. My husband has tried for a month on head already and he said it can stimulate the growth of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Above all I think you are deserve to have it !!!</li>
    <li> The needles are too long to begin with and after the first use, my skin broke out terribly. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I  need to purchase a different size needle as this one doesn&#x27;t do much.  I think it does irritate the skin a little but have been using for a month with no results.  It does not hurt to use and does make the skin turn pink but the effect only lasts a very short time.  Not sure I would recommend until I try a different size to see if that would have a different result.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I am 29 and beginning to get little wrinkles and have some sun damage from tanning and living in California. I was getting really nervous about the amount of money I was going to have to spend doing microdermabrasion/peels/lasers etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then somehow I stumbled on this miracle wand and all of my worries went away! It is SO cheap, and can be used before applying serums to get the most of your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get it, and use it 1-2x a week. Take a before and after picture, give it a few months. You will be happy, I promise. There is no way it won&#x27;t work because the technique is based on simple science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD: in regards to other reviewers who gave low scores: if you think that using ANY product for ONE month will drastically change your face/stretch marks etc.. You need to be more realistic. It took YEARS for you to make those wrinkles, sun spots, and stretch marks. DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO WORK WONDERS IN *ONE* MONTH. Your reviews are invalid because you aren&#x27;t giving your skin the time to slough off and newer, healthier layers to surface. YOU MUST EXFOLIATE WELL about 2 days after a treatment. The only way this product won&#x27;t work is if YOU are using it incorrectly, or not giving it enough time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you are giving it a low score because \\&quot;it hurts\\&quot;, that also, is not the fault of the device. It clearly states what it is and what it does. It has needles on it, did you think it was going to feel good?</li>
    <li> This was my first derma roller and my experience has been unpleasant. I had a poor reaction: my skin formed tiny pustules and became crusty in some areas. It almost looked like a rash around my nose. But that can&#x27;t be attributed to this particular product. What I can say is that sometimes when I applied pressure, instead of rolling, the needles just scraped across my skin. The roller jammed completely or would roll lop-sided. I had only poured alcohol over the needles; I didn&#x27;t even submerge it as directed, so it&#x27;s not like it should have rusted. Would I try derma-rolling again? Possibly. Will I use this product again? No.</li>
