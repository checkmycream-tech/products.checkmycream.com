<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I take Plavix and am fairly active so I collect lots of bruises. This product is the best I have found..It shortens the worst bruises to a little over a week.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well this works. I bruise very easily and frequently need to fade the bruises as quickly as possible. I have tried many products and this one works the best hands down. For me it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, works miracles. I used after facial injections and had absolutely no bruising. In the past, always had moderate to severe bruising.  Love this product and plan to keep ordering.</li>
    <li> Very small tube. It was gone in a flash. Decent bruise cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this cream. I had a really bad black eye. With the use of Zax&#x27;s it was easily covered in a week and practically gone in 10 days. Everyone was amazed.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of bruises from our little Chiweenee jumping &amp; accidentally scratching my arms. Each scratch turns into a bruise because I take a blood thinner. Zax&#x27;s cream applied immediately after I get a scratch really makes the bruises fade more quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing cream.  I bruise so easily and constantly have bruises on my forearms.  I received this cream on Monday and started applying it 3 times a day.  Here it is 5 days later and I can barely see the places on my arm.  I definitely recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> A little faster than Der Mend.</li>
    <li> I tend to bruise easily and when I read the positive reviews for this product I decided to try Zac&#x27;s Bruise Cream.  I followed the directions for using the cream and I have had very good results.  The bruises definitely fade more quickly and I even had good results using the cream on older bruises.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had a shiner one couldn&#x27;t believe and this has helped accelerate the healing process.  Essential for any bruising!</li>
    <li> Excellent...want to buy more</li>
    <li> I used this post-surgically. It really helped heal the bruising fast. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a couple of weeks AFTER I had fallen and bruised myself. I&#x27;d had a tube of Hirudoid cream for bruises that you can&#x27;t buy in this country (I&#x27;m Australian), and used it up. So the Zax arrived and, thankfully, just sat there. Of course I saw it one day and was thinking &amp;#34;well, it will just sit there - good&amp;#34;...and five minutes later dropped a huge can of tomatoes on my hand! I used the Zax right away (after cleaning up the cut) and never got a bruise....great!</li>
    <li> Love the product, I just wish it came in a bigger size.  The amount of bruises I have to cover uses Zax&#x27;s too fast.  So I had to go to another product which is larger for the same price.</li>
    <li> Really resolves bruises faster. I recommended the product to other people with good results.</li>
    <li> It made my spots darker</li>
    <li> My husband used the cream for a couple of days and liked the result. This a good addition to our first aid kit.</li>
    <li> OK but doesn&#x27;t work as expected. Dealer great!</li>
    <li> I tried it on my bruised cheek after a Juvederm filler injection and it worked wonders.  The bruised cleared up within days.  Thoroughly pleased with the results.  I definitely would recommend this product</li>
    <li> pain relief&lt;br /&gt; within first hour i love your cream product,thanks!</li>
    <li> It did help heal the bruise very quickly</li>
    <li> been using it for a week - didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> A friend fell and hit her head, which resulted in huge black eyes within a few days. Your cream was like a miracle drug for her and helped right away!!!!</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm.  Wish I&#x27;d had it sooner! Thank you</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that works.  Allow about four to five days depending on the bruise.</li>
    <li> I bruise very easily, often without even knowing it.  This cream speeds the healing process for me.  It&#x27;s not instant, but it shortens the time until the bruise disappears.</li>
    <li> First time I used this product and it worked great! A wonderful product to have on hand.</li>
    <li> More effective than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Wow! Actually works! I&#x27;m a very easy bruiser. I constantly wake up with weird bruises that I know not where they come from. So, finding a product that actually helps my bruises go away faster is really really nice! I just wish it came in a bigger size. It&#x27;s so expensive for such a tiny amount. But I&#x27;ll pay it if it will keep working and helping me heal faster. Having a ton of bruises is just too concerning to me to not keep getting this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried other arnica creams and this one tops them all.</li>
    <li> This cream is exellent.</li>
    <li> Do not waste  your money, this product does not do anything at all.  I used exactly per instructions</li>
    <li> Had a large bruise above wrist-applied bruise cream same day.In about 5 days,the bruise started fading.I am satisfied with results&amp;&lt;br /&gt;will recommend it to my friends😊</li>
    <li> Very slow, but it seems to eventually work</li>
    <li> I started using the cream on bruises on my arms and noticed that the bruises seem to fade away quicker than bruises i did not put cream on.  I have repeated this process to satisfy myself.  Thank you for the product and i am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Really did help healing time!</li>
    <li> Zax&#x27;s bruise cream has met and exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> not in any way as effective as Dermend</li>
    <li> very good/but not that good</li>
    <li> bruises seemed to go away a few days faster</li>
    <li> Seems to speed healing.</li>
    <li> Very good.  I have used ScarZone bruise cream and this is as good or better and you get a lot more for the money.</li>
    <li> The best ever!  Follow directions and it&#x27;s the greatest.  I&#x27;ll never be without it.</li>
    <li> I have not had the cream long, but appears to work fine, however, my skin is so old and thin, I get new bruises faster than the old ones disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had taken better care of my skin in years passed, but this cream has helped more than anything I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;RH</li>
    <li> Great stuff, and the best customer service ever!  Seriously, there are real (and wonderful) humans who really stand behind this product.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I believe the product works that well.</li>
    <li> My bruises were gone in four days, just as advertised. I was searching for another product and when it couldn&#x27;t be found, I ordered Zax&#x27;s. Works , easy to apply, is not messy..Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT, absolutely fantastic!! I had a HUGE bruise on my arm that was VERY noticable and UGLY looking, I didn&#x27;t even want to wear a short sleeve shirt, but with our HOT weather its not comfortable to wear long sleeves! I decided to try Zax&#x27;s Bruise Cream, now that&#x27;s ALL I&#x27;ll EVER use, absolutely works, and FAST!! Usually my bruises take a month or more to go away; I hate it that they take forever! Well this time in at least 5 days it started to get less and less until the seventh day it was good enough to just put a little makeup to cover up what was left of it!&lt;br /&gt;I have another bruise on my upper thigh that&#x27;s 2 months old, I&#x27;ve had it before I bought the Zax&#x27;s; it&#x27;s still noticable like a shadow! I keep forgetting to put the Zax&#x27;s on because it&#x27;s in a place I never see or really pay attention to it! I started putting the cream on; looking better now!!&lt;br /&gt;I give this cream a 100% for fantabulous!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. One thing else I would like to add, I rubbed this cream on 5 to 6 times a day, I know that&#x27;s more than what they wrote in their directions, BUT I wanted to get rid of this disgusting bruise REALLY fast, thus I put more than recommended on it, and it worked, ALL GONE!!</li>
    <li> definitely reduced the bruise time--which was on my face and distressful. thanks much Zax.</li>
    <li> This cream did not work for me, as I have blood bruises from taking warfarin.  I did send it back.  I wish there was something else out there that would cover or help these marks.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This cream surpassed all of my expectations; using it 2x/day DID seem to help speed up the healing time by 4-5 days. Better than any arnica cream I&#x27;ve ever tried (I tend to bruise easily)!</li>
    <li> I am on blood thinners and constantly have bruises on my right hand as I am right handed  By using this cream on my hand every day I have been able to reduce the ugly bruises on my hand.  It works.. It took a while but it does work.  So I use it as a daily routine item.  Also I keep it in my purse in case I hit my hand then I can put it on to reduce the amount of bruising as explained by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Just when I thought there was no end in sight, Zax&#x27;s came along and literally changed.my.life! I bruise very easily (somewhat anemic) and due to my workouts I receive bruises constantly. It&#x27;s extremely embarrassing and I am asked about them at work all the time. I can&#x27;t really wear skirts because they&#x27;re all over. I&#x27;ve tried multivitamins but really don&#x27;t like putting any type of pill in my body so was looking for something more homeopathic. A couple of people mentioned that there are bruise creams that can help so with full skepticism I figured, why not? Read the reviews for Zax&#x27;s and gave it a shot (despite the higher price). Let me just tell you that THIS STUFF WORKS!!!! I just started 2 days ago and had a 4&amp;#34; long bruise across my thigh - it&#x27;s nearly gone. I wish I had taken a before/after photo but I was really nervous it wouldn&#x27;t do anything so I didn&#x27;t bother. It&#x27;s amazing. I wholeheartedly recommend this product; might have been the best money I&#x27;ve spent in years.</li>
    <li> Only cream I have found that actually helps with bruising on thin skin.  Every little bump on arm causes red bruising and I rub the cream on until the white color dissolves  (twice a day).  Really helps shorten time of discoloration.</li>
    <li> This is my first review I&#x27;ve ever written bit I feel compelled to tell others to buy this product! Had lipo on my chin that left an awful bruise on my neck. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days and it&#x27;s fading away! Love love love it!</li>
    <li> Liked it a lot, but frustrated that it is not available now.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this works so well. I receive injections so I just use immediately after and the bruising either doesn&#x27;t happen or it is minimal. I bruise easily and love this product.</li>
    <li> It really works.  I bruised myself and immediately used the cream for 2 days.  NO BRUISE!!</li>
    <li> After taking a big fall during an ice hockey game (I was foolish enough to not wear equipment) I was certain I was going to have a large bruise on my thigh. A friend of mine gave me a tube of this cream to use. Figured, no harm so I tried it. The next morning I had NO bruise at all. My thigh was somewhat sore but it was no longer red and there was no sign of injury. After day 2, it was like it never happened. No pain at all!  Day 3, I was back on the ice, with equipment though!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The honest truth, now my wife uses it!&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jamie Newman</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.  This cream really works.  I bruise easily from taking 81 ml daily aspirin.  My bruises healed much faster with Zax&#x27;s bruise cream.</li>
    <li> It seemed to work but honestly couldn&#x27;t tell if it was 1, 2 or 3 days faster than natural repair. Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as promised. Now a household staple and after I finish typing --I am ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;I had a deep facial magenta bruise and it vanished within days. This is a remarkable cream!</li>
    <li> Works great, fragrance free. Would definitely buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I have used other brands of bruise creams these past few years, and Zak&#x27;s is the best of the bunch. I have very sensitive skin, and am a blood thinner taker due to various heart problems. I&#x27;m also in my late 70s, and although very active, and very young at heart my skin just isn&#x27;t the same as it was when  was younger.&lt;br /&gt; Zak&#x27;s is good as mentioned. better than most, as mentioned. It honestly helped, yet my skin bruises take a long time to literally &amp;#34;go away&amp;#34;, if the ever do. I will continue to use it, and yet at the same time will continue to look for other creams so to speak, that will possibly do a better job.&lt;br /&gt; I say this because my arms ( for the most part), look like I am an ad for Coumadin Poster Man, and being vain, bothers me.&lt;br /&gt; Thanks for your inquiry.&lt;br /&gt; Arthur</li>
    <li> This does seem to shorten the time until bruises disappear, if used 3 times a day, and immediately after bruise appears.</li>
    <li> It really did lessen my dark bruises quickly and effectively.  Would definitly recommend.  Wish it were a little less expensive, because I almost finished the tube quickly.  I was polka-dotted because of prednisone!</li>
    <li> I have found that this product does speed up the removal of bruise skin discoloration</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders. I have always been one to bruise easily on my arms and legs, to the point that more than once over the years I have had concerned people ask me if everything was alright at home. I have tried other herbal compounds as well as straight Arnica sublinguals with only slight improvement. I have no idea why but whatever they have compounded to make this cream they have done so perfectly. I had bruises on both arms of roughly the same age and to test the cream I used it on one arm twice a day.and did not use it at all on the other. Even though they were not fresh bruises within 2 days I noticed the color of the bruise change.from black to yellow and day 4 barely a mark remained. I immediately started using it on the bruise on the other arm and got the same result. These were small bruises, about the size of a nickel. I&#x27;m now working on getting rid of a much larger bruise on the back of my leg where a door caught me as I was attempting to maneuvering my mom&#x27;s wheelchair into a doctor&#x27;s office. This time I was able to start using the cream the same day. I&#x27;m applying 2x a day, it&#x27;s day 4  and parts of the bruise are starting to turn yellow and the edges are returning to my normal skin color (it is a really deep bruise about 3 inches long and an inch and 1/2 wide). If you bruise frequently this cream is definitely worth a try and is cheaper on Amazon than similar (and for me inferior) creams sold at the natural foods store.</li>
    <li> does as described, very pleased, I have order more</li>
    <li> I bruise very easily, even from wearing a bracelet.  This cream definitely heals the bruises much quicker than using plain Arnaca or nothing. Finally.</li>
    <li> I bruise easily, especially after having my second child. This cream reduces bruises by several days, even if the bruise has been there a while. Big surprise to me was how it healed a deep bruise I&#x27;d had on my leg for 4 years - no joke! I kept hitting the same spot on my leg with the car door and this was a bruise within a bruise. I didn&#x27;t think it would ever go away, and a few days of rubbing in this cream did it. Wish I&#x27;d known about it years ago! And it was especially nice that this seller sent an email to me outlining how to achieve optimal results. I would recommend this cream to everyone.</li>
    <li> Works well if applied as directed. I cannot use Vitamin K so this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> Followed  the instructions and my forearm bruises disappeared in four days</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Thanks Zax.</li>
    <li> This really works great and I bruise very easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to tell how effective this product is because it is not practical for me to apply it three times a day.  I use a cosmetic cover-up for the bruises on my arms and it seems pointless to apply the treatment over the make-up.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It truly works, and I had a very bad bruise and it is getting better day by day.  I am so very happy that they have a product that really works.</li>
    <li> I looked at a few bruise cream and settled on this one thanks to the positive reviews and glad I did.  I bruise easily and with this cream the bruises dissipate much faster than without anything.  I only apply morning and night when I remember and it still works well.</li>
    <li> This cream hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me. I have many dark bruises on my legs from years of Lupus and medications without obvious injuries and unfortunately they&#x27;re very noticeable on my light skin which is awful. I read good reviews about this product and I really didn&#x27;t think the cream would actually work on the kind of bruises that I have but I wanted to give it a chance anyway and I was right. This cream is probably best  for fresh bruising as I had my bruises for years. This isn&#x27;t a negative review about the cream as I&#x27;m sure it actually works but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve run out of the cream already within a week because I have so many bruises it&#x27;s ridiculous. I may buy another tube because maybe my bruises just take longer to heal but I don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
    <li> I just put it on for the first time today, but I thought I should share with you that the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is very runny.  (At least the one I got is.)  So, don&#x27;t go squeezing the tube firmly expecting it to take a second to come out.  It will pour right out if you&#x27;re not careful.  If it is not supposed to be a runny liquid will someone please let me know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to give it a rating so I&#x27;ll give it a 5 based on everyone else&#x27;s opinion.  I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed that it works for me as well as it works for everyone else because if you look at me wrong I bruise!</li>
    <li> I bruise really easily and this works in 3 to 4 days.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using another Bruise Cream for  about 2 years.  I am so glad I foumd &amp;#34;Zax&#x27;s&amp;#34;.  It is so superior in every way!</li>
    <li> This is a great aid in healing a bruise. The cream absorbs very well .</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I ordered it for post operative bruising.  I was amazed how fast my bluish/purple bruise started to fade into yellow. It was within a weeks time.  I&#x27;m 2 weeks post surgery &amp; can wear shorts! No discoloration on my skin.  It easy to apply, absorbs quickly and there is no residue.  I will recommend this product to anyone.  Shipping &amp; delivery was in a timely manner.  Thank you Zax Healthcare!</li>
    <li> My wife tried out ZAX&#x27;s Bruise Cream after she bruised her left foot, and with in 9 hours the bruised 95 % gone.  I really think this cream could be a game changer.  Thank&#x27;s ZAX&#x27;s great product!</li>
    <li> I had droopy eyelid surgery for vision problems. And the bruises were unbelievable, makes you wonder what in the heck is done to your eyes when your knocked out during surgery. To be so bruised even in my cheeks when I got home. I ordered this Zax&#x27;s Original Bruise Cream, about 4 days after my surgery. (I wished I had known about it before surgery, I would have had some on hand and would have been using it front he beginning, because this stuff works just like it says it does, way, way way, faster. The bruises fade FASTER, than just letting them heal on their on.  Doctors/surgeons  that operate on delicate parts of the human body that is visible (like the face, hands, chest, legs, etc.)  should automatically give tubes of this stuff out to patients to go home with, so they can be bruise free in half the time.</li>
    <li> IT DOES HELP, WILL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS.</li>
    <li> CAN&#x27;T SAY IT REALY A GOOD PRODUCT IT DID NOT WORK</li>
    <li> Had several bruises on left arm.  Put on three to test.  All healed at same rate...No difference.  Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic.  I already see results.  I will purchase more</li>
    <li> i am a prednisone user and bruise quite easily. i&#x27;m a type A person prone to a lot of bruising. Zaks does well on minor bruising,&lt;br /&gt;but is slower to help large bruising., mostly because the surface bleeding falls to gravity. I believe it does reduce the time that the large  bruise is visible but not by much.</li>
    <li> It works!  I had a facelift and it was soothing and took the place of moisturizer during that trying time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks it really seems to help.  I have thin skin and bruise at any tiny bump. I have been this way since my early 50s, now approaching 70s. It&#x27;s the first thing I&#x27;ve used that clears up faster and leave my dark areas from constant bruising, lighter. Am amazed. I only use it at bed time. Thks.</li>
    <li> Bruises seem to go away a little faster.  Works faster on smaller ones.</li>
    <li> My daughter took this from me and used it for bruises on her knees from contemporary dance class.  It worked so well she won&#x27;t give it back so I ordered a second one for myself!!!</li>
    <li> As a woman in her mide 70&#x27;s, I have senile purpura.  I use everything that&#x27;s out there to help minimize the bruising.  I use this, Dermend and some concoction the compounding pharmacist put together.  And, yes, I think it works but you have to be consistent in using this.  Nothing &#x27;heals&#x27; senile purpura.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a magical cream but you&#x27;ll be happy with the results. I used it for over two weeks three times a day and the bruise starts to fade gradually. Zax&#x27;s should be in every home cause it really works. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Yes</li>
    <li> I love it,,,I have thin skin and bruise easily on my arms and hands. I use it as a hand cream and believe it prevents ugly marks on my hands and arms. I would recommend this product to anybody.</li>
    <li> It appears to reduce the time for the bruise to go away</li>
    <li> I order it because of a troubled injection that was somehow painfully cystic and I realized that the Arnica cream was the only thing that was curing and relieving this issue. My first tube was finished n I decided to try this one. The product arrived with box totally open plus I didnt feel the same great effect I have when I used Arnica, I gave this to a friend for some muscles pain (he hasn&#x27;t used it yet) and I bought Arnica cream at the local GMC ( with Arnica cream I have great effect, injection almost totally cured) honestly, I cant say anything to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent treatment for bruises.  Works better than the DerMend cream recommended by my Dermatologist!</li>
    <li> I need more time to evaluate.  the cream works very well for new bruises.  I have an elbow bruise which I have had for over a year.  It has not done much to reduce  this bruise, but since I have had it for an extended period, I am thinking it will take longer time period to reduce the bruise, but I have no idea how long that might be.  Please advise.</li>
    <li> I have seen improvement but it is slower acting than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> This really works.  I was not sure at first but then after about a week it seem to start working very quickly</li>
    <li> It worked as advertised. I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Received as promised.  This item is used when needed.  Haven&#x27;t had a bruise to try it out on.</li>
    <li> It is a fair product.  It takes quite a while for it to work so something faster would be better.</li>
    <li> Terrific product.  Because of thinning skin I bruise continually and this product fades them faster than anything else I have used.</li>
    <li> This cream really works for arm bruising! I have tried straight arnica and Dermend and this is the only thing that really works!</li>
    <li> this was the best and rapid bruise cream i have ever used.  i bruise so easily and this cream i would give a 5 star to.    please continue to carry this wonderful product!!  thank you</li>
    <li> I found Zax&#x27;s on Amazon trying to figure out how to speed up bruise healing.  I am really amazed at what a wonder product it is.  I am going to tell every doctor that will listen about it&#x27;s results.  It dramatically speeds up bruise repair - new and old bruises no matter the cause of the bruise.  It&#x27;s a DEAL for what it does!</li>
    <li> My husbands bruising on his hand especially was from so many medical procedures requiring repeated ports in his hand when he was a young boy. I thought it looked better using the cream</li>
    <li> This is a must have for every medicine cabinet.  I got sideswiped by a subway car that jerked forward and my whole arm was purple.  This cleared it up in a few days!  With Prime shipping, you don&#x27;t have to wait long to get this home, but I would definitely recommend having this on hand for when you need it (the sooner you start applying, the better it works).&lt;br /&gt;This is a miracle worker!  Thanks Zax&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do what it says. Bruises take longer than 4 days to disappear.</li>
    <li> I found that Zax&#x27;s does nothing, it takes just as long for the bruises to heal with or without the cream.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore I would give it zero stars if possible.</li>
    <li> Did nothing on bruises</li>
    <li> Great cream!  I recently had rotator cuff surgery on my shoulder and my arm was bruised from my wrist to my breast on the right side.  It helped reduce the bruising and soreness.</li>
    <li> I bought this Bruise Cream because of the high review and it works wonderful. I see the result at day 2 or 3</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this product for several years and really love this product as it makes the bruise go away faster and makes it feel better. In fact recently i had a fall which resulted in a massive almost black/purple bruise. My husband said he had never seen such a large bad bruise. I immediately starting using Zax&#x27;s bruise cream and was diligent and used the bruise cream 3 times a day and after 7 days the bruise was 75% gone and felt better.We were was sincerely impressed once again!</li>
    <li> Disappointed in this in view of the claims made as to its&#x27; effectiveness. Works slowly, not as well as Scar Zone.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!  I never thought it would work so well in such a short length of time.  My husband had suffered from a condition where he would bruise easily.  Over time, the skin on his lower arms became brown and stayed that way.  Zax&#x27;s Bruise Cream began to lighten the brown areas and heal the newer bruises after only a week.  It continues to work for him.  Congratulations on such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This cream actually heals bruises quickly and relieves pain. I would give it five stars if it were not so expensive.  If you have major bruising due to an accident or something worse, you would have to pay a fortune in order to treat them with Zax&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Product is sold by a third party.</li>
    <li> Cream was very soothing and effective.  Seemed to have sped up healing of bruise.  I would recommend this cream highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two different bruise creams now and they really work about the same. I bought Zak&#x27;s because of it&#x27;s 5 star rating !!</li>
    <li> This product is a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bruise very easily and I do not heal fast due to health issues. I had been in the heat and bent over in my driveway and blacked out. I hit the top side of my head near my hairline. I wear glasses,they were fine so my brow bone was not hit. By the next morning from my brow down to my cheek bone all the way across to my hair line was black and had a lot of blood pool. I had just gotten Zax&#x27;s Bruise Cream, it does say NOT to use around the eye area. I&#x27;m extremely sensitive anyway around my eyes,even makeup. I had a Dr. apt in a couple of days, so I took the chance and applied over the entire bruised area,eyelid included. It did not bother me at all. I had a nice cooling effect that felt wonderful on the area! Instructions said you can use up to 3 times a day, I used it  in the morning and before bed. By TWO days it was down to a slight green in areas but mostly GONE! I had taken photos to show my Dr. day by day of what it looked like since I didn&#x27;t go to the ER. He said I had multiple contusions and was amazed that it healed like it did, and with my health issues where I don&#x27;t heal as fast as normal. I recommend this to anyone! It&#x27;s all natural to use on children to the elderly. A fantastic product! For my Dr. to be that empressed, says a lot!!</li>
    <li> I fell and had a few nasty bruises.  I applied the Zax&#x27;s cream, per instructions, to the bruise on my chin/jaw as it was by far the worst and not to the two other bruises. The color and pain have gone from bruise I used the cream on In  while the other two are still quite colorful and painful.  In my opinion Zax&#x27;s cream did help a lot.</li>
    <li> My wife used this product. She prefers other arnica products at lower prices.</li>
    <li> Jax&#x27;s works great.  I have sun damaged lower arm skin and Jax&#x27;s reduces the time for these &amp;#34;bruises to diminish.  I suffer bruises frequently and usually don&#x27;t know how I got them .  Jax&#x27;s causes these &amp;#34;bruises&amp;#34; to disappear in much less time than normal, which was weeks instead of days with Jaxs.  Thanks very much for Jaxs.  Harry</li>
    <li> This cream really works I used it three times a day gently smoothing it on the Bruise and I have to say it even had cooling sensation but within days it was not even noticeable plus the bruise never turned from the Black and Blue stage to that ugly green yellow look. Each day it just looked better it took the black color out and turned a little red  then gone.</li>
    <li> used as directed 3 time a day for 7 days, no improvment seen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used such an amazing product! I play full contact roller derby and have sustained some really nasty, swollen and painful bruises. Sometimes they last weeks and make daily activities very uncomfortable. Since finding Zax&#x27;s my bruises heal faster and are much less painful and swollen.&lt;br /&gt;I recently sustained some bad bruising on my inner arm so i put Zax&#x27;s on it right away. No joke, it was gone in like 4 days. I was amazed! I&#x27;m very fair skinned so bruises last and last on me. Now that I have Zax&#x27;s on my team, bring on those heavy hits!</li>
    <li> I had some facial surgery and was bruised heavily along my jawline And neck . I used this religiously about a week into my bruising as I had to return to work and was concerned about my appearance . This creme really speeded up the healing of my bruising . I highly recommend it for bruises that you need to hide quickly.</li>
    <li> works great The best  ever. Thank you for this great product</li>
    <li> A terrific product.  It has really made a difference in my bruises (I have aging, thinning skin) and the bruises are remarkably lessened after I use the product.  The seller has wonderful customer service. She emailed me with some additional tips and told me little about the history of the product (made of all natural products and smells really good!!)- I was very impressed that she took the time to answer my questions .  I will continue to buy this product (one for home and one for the office).. I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try....it REALLY WORKS !!!</li>
    <li> This actually works. I had a bad bruise on my leg. I&#x27;m talking 3 inch diameter black, purple and red. I used this cream on it every 3 hours for 3 days, and the bruise was gone. Usually bruises take weeks to fade on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried several bruise creams prior to buying Zax&#x27;s bruise cream.  It has proven to be more effective than anything I have used before. Typically it took 10 days to two weeks for a bruise to go away using other products. With Zax&#x27;s cream that has been shortened to 4 days to a week.  It really does make a difference.</li>
    <li> ZAX WORKS BETTER THAN DERMEND I NOW USE BOTH TOGETHER, YOUR TUBE SIZE COULD BE LARGER, RUBBING THE BRUISE ALSO GIVES QUICKER RESULTS, THANKS, GENO</li>
    <li> I have very thin skin and my hands stay bruised all tme.  Ordered this cream and have been trying same for about 2 weeks.  Since I bruise so easily I cannot for sure that the cream has helped, but am trying to use the cream like the directions.  Hands look better but not completely clear.  Still tryingl</li>
    <li> It works great.  I get bruised really easily and it helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the cream would work for most folks.  It was damaged in shipment when it arrived.  i did try some on my face for a small bruise and it has menthol in it which is not good close to the eye.  Company is very nice.  Priced a little high.</li>
    <li> I was severely bruised due to having fillers around my smile lines. They just weren&#x27;t going away. As soon as I started to use this product, they began to fade. If you are getting any type of work done on your face and would like to be able to go out in public, I recommend having this on hand...lifesaver.</li>
    <li> Easily absorbed into skin and fast acting in reducing bruise.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Doing well, need to order more soon.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works just like it says.</li>
    <li> I would give five stars if the tube wasn&#x27;t so small. Doesn&#x27;t last very long and for $18, it should. It does work but I won&#x27;t see completion. I will stick with the vitamin C + aloe vera gel regimen. Works pretty fast.</li>
