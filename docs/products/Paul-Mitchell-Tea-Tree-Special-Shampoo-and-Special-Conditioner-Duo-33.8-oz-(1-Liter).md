<li> And a bottle lasts a LONG time.</li>
<li> I am a long time sufferer of psoriasis and eczema</li>
<li> This is a gift that was very well received in the past!  </li>
<li> My son has dry scalp issues, and his dermatologist recommended this shampoo.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the same smell and consistency as the previous bottle I bought in a salon and has that tingly-fresh feeling after you use</li>
<li> None of my other shampoos or conditioners do that.</li>
<li> I have extraordinarily long hair and only need to use a very small amount of both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
<li> Also, it left my hair feeling dry and weak.  </li>
<li> seems to be watered down.</li>
<li> They made &amp;#34;efforts&amp;#34; to stop leakage by scotch taping the pumps to the bottle instead of screwing them on tightly.  </li>
<li> They came wrapped tight from my seller, no leaks like some have mentioned.</li>
<li> No more scalp issues.</li>
<li> The only problem I have with it is that it burns SO bad when it gets in your eyes.</li>
<li> I have thin hair and this product is too thick for me.</li>
<li> It has been over 3 weeks since we have used it and there are still chemical burns on his head and behind his ears.</li>
<li> Needless to say I did not get to use ALL of the product.  </li>
<li> Packaging was a bit weird (zip lock?)</li>
<li> so my scalp was so bad I couldn&#x27;t wait for another shipment at the time I received it.  </li>
<li> It burned my Boyfriend&#x27;s scalp so bad and mine also.  </li>
<li> This product is terrible.  </li>

    <li> This is a gift that was very well received in the past!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Arrived packaged and extra sealed in case of bumping during shipping. This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner, and the only thing that works on my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Used by teenage boys.  Very pleased with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> My son has dry scalp issues, and his dermatologist recommended this shampoo. Great product. No more scalp issues.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this product is too thick for me.</li>
    <li> Wow!  These products are fantastic.  They really nourish your hair and you can feel the tingling sensation with both products.</li>
    <li> I personally despise the smell of tea tree but I needed something else that would work for my itchy, flaky scalp because Head n Shoulders does NOT do the trick. I love the minty tingle it gives my scalp and how soft my hair feels with the conditoner. So far I am absolutely enjoying it. :)</li>
    <li> The family loves this shampoo, great for those with sensitive hair.</li>
    <li> Refreshing &amp; love it! Try the soap too. It&#x27;s fantastic as well. I have 8 more words to go &amp; ... There, reached it! lol</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!  Amazing scent, nice and foamy, and makes your scalp tingle in a good way.  And a bottle lasts a LONG time.</li>
    <li> Same thing I used to get from my stylist, tho cheaper.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> The best product ever for psoriasis.</li>
    <li> feels good on the scalp but careful not to get around eyes or it will BURN like crazy.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for dry scalp, also has a great smell!</li>
    <li> Great product great price</li>
    <li> Awesome, as described</li>
    <li> This is very astringent shampoo/conditioner.  It burned my scalp like medicated shampoos do.  It has a very strong peppermint smell that I did not care for.  Also, it left my hair feeling dry and weak.  I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the product already...but really liked the LOWER pricing through Amazon!</li>
    <li> The product arrived with some of the conditioner leaking into the box.  They made &amp;#34;efforts&amp;#34; to stop leakage by scotch taping the pumps to the bottle instead of screwing them on tightly.  Needless to say I did not get to use ALL of the product.  For $55 worth of shampoo and conditioner you would think they would package their product better than they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, it seems to be the real stuff.  It&#x27;s the same smell and consistency as the previous bottle I bought in a salon and has that tingly-fresh feeling after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider ordering again, but if the next shipment were like the first I would return both bottles.  I am a long time sufferer of psoriasis and eczema so my scalp was so bad I couldn&#x27;t wait for another shipment at the time I received it.  This product doesn&#x27;t help to get rid of the psoriasis on my scalp or behind my ears, but it did manage to rid all of the flakes and dryness on most of my head.  Also, if you have any open sores or cuts, it will not burn them like regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great for hair and sometimes I use as an invigorating body wash</li>
    <li> Packaging was a bit weird (zip lock?) but otherwise, the product is great.</li>
    <li> The tingling sensation of the shampoo and conditioner is very exhilarating.  I really like this product!</li>
    <li> throw out your Head &amp; Shoulders for Johnny, Fancy Poo for Susie and Color Safe Shampoo for Mama.... this is the only shampoo your household needs. Solved a lifelong flaking problem for my daughter and the rest of us love it too.</li>
    <li> THE. BEST. SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER. EVER.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible.  It burned my Boyfriend&#x27;s scalp so bad and mine also.  Constant itching, flaking and redness of the scalp.  I don&#x27;t think this is a true Paul Mitchell product. It has been over 3 weeks since we have used it and there are still chemical burns on his head and behind his ears. DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> I love Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree products, however this one I ordered online seems to be watered down. It does smell amazing and leave your hair smelling fresh, BUT after one day my hair is SO incredibly greasy. None of my other shampoos or conditioners do that. Also it does not have the same look/consistency of other tea tree products I have ordered straight for the salon</li>
    <li> Smells nice got here fast too.</li>
    <li> Wakes your senses up for sure. It&#x27;s invigorating and wonderful. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have extraordinarily long hair and only need to use a very small amount of both shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair feel great, worth every penny</li>
    <li> I love the smell of mint in the morning. Smells like victory! This is a great shampoo and conditioner. If you&#x27;ve never tried it, just go for it. Nice tingly feeling on your scalp. Great for your hair. Easy pump dispensers. They came wrapped tight from my seller, no leaks like some have mentioned. Nice discount by buying bulk on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo - makes the scalp feel so clean and tingly.  This was a good deal.</li>
    <li> I looooooooooooove this shampoo. It feels nice while using it, and leaves your hair soft, silky and smooth. The only problem I have with it is that it burns SO bad when it gets in your eyes.</li>
