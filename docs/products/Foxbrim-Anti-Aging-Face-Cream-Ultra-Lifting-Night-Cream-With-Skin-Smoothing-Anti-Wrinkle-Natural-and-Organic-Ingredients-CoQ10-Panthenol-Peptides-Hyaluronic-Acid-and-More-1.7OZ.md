<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really like this. Thick with a nice tingle when you apply.I believe I already see a difference.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this creamy lotion on my skin and have used it a few times so far. My skin feels more moisturized with this product and it also tightens up my pores. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and there is no sticky or tacky feeling when I use it. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product! I received free product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging! And I also love the little pump application. However, sadly after using the pump once it didn&#x27;t want to work any longer. The bottle feels pretty light so I honestly don&#x27;t know if the pump isn&#x27;t working because its gone or because its broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I got about 4 applications from this bottle before it stopped working completely. I love that it is fragrance free. I don&#x27;t like to put much scented product on my face. The product is thick and creamy and feels really good on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment contains CoQ10, Panthenol, Peptides, and Hyaluronic Acid. The benefits of these amazing ingredients include healing and repair of the skin, improving the appearance of your skin, stimulating collagen production, fighting free radicals, and hydrating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can apply make up over this product so that is a huge plus. I used this product as a moisturizer for the few applications that I got out of it. I noticed that it did make my face feel tighter and smoother. I only wished I had gotten more out of the bottle than I did. I think this product is worth a second look because of the amazing ingredients and the potential benefits that they provide. Also the company offers a 100% money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to and it gives you a healthier, brighter skin. I have not noticed any wrinkles going away but a product like this can prevent them from occurring because of the natural ingredients. I like how it&#x27;s not harsh on the skin and has a subtle smell. This facial cream would be great for the summer since it&#x27;s light weight and sets in the skin quickly. I recommend this product to those who want firmer and younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I like everything I get from this company - the packaging is plan and nothing exciting, but the products are fabulous - this is a smooth silky like cream that is moisturizing and soaks into the skin well - I use this at night currently along with their toner - eye cream (my favorite eye cream) and a serum - this routine is quick and easy and the results are wonderful - comments about how great my skin looks and I am getting older everyday but feeling better about it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this and other Foxbrim products to everyone who needs skin care -&amp;#34; Hey -- Hey -- you - you wont have young skin forever start taking care of it now -  &amp;#34;  these products are a good start to your ant-aging routine that everyone needs.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this is the best, but it is good.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS NIGHT CREAM</li>
    <li> Did not like.  It felt dry to me and not moisture aide for my face.</li>
    <li> After using this product, my face feels smoother and softer. The underneath of my eyes are looking much better now, no bags etc. The product doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily etc, which is a big plus. It has a very light scent and feels silky as you are applying it. I am so glad that I got the chance to review this item.</li>
    <li> Mom loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin and am always cautions when applying new products on my face. After applying and using the Ultra Lift Treatment for several weeks now, I can say that it has been very gentle on my face. It is a thick luxurious cream that absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving it greasy or sticky, major plus. It hydrated my skin after the first use, giving it a much smoother and softer appearance. The product is fragrance free but does have a slight scent from the ingredients, no biggie, you can’t really smell it after its been fully absorbed into your skin. I like that Foxbrim uses natural ingredients as part of their formula and would recommend anyone with very dry skin to try this or for wrinkle prevention. Another bonus is that they give you a 100% Money-Back guarantee.</li>
    <li> excellent cream...absorbs fast and leaves my skin super soft....love it!</li>
    <li> not the best I have tried but OK</li>
    <li> The Ultra Lift Treatment absorbs really nicely but stays with you for hours.  It&#x27;s a white creamy consistency that feels really smooth on my face.  There is no odor, which I love.  I don&#x27;t really care for things that have strong odors so this works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt nourished and hydrated throughout the day.  I didnâ€™t feel greasy at all.  I am happy to say my skin and eyes didnâ€™t have a negative reaction like they often can have with harsh products.&lt;br /&gt;During the last few weeks Iâ€™ve been using the Ultra Lift Treatment by Foxbrim every day.  I have seen a wonderful brightness in my skin.  My skin tone looks a lot more even and the feel is really nice and smooth.  I even think my skin is feeling a little more firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I havenâ€™t been using this product long enough to notice a difference in the fine lines just yet.  I think it will take longer to see those types of results.  I am excited with the results Iâ€™ve already experienced.  My skin seems to crave the nourishment it feels when Iâ€™m using it.</li>
    <li> Nothing special!  Similar to most anti-aging  drug store line products.</li>
    <li> I love Foxbrim and its many products that has never failed me. I use a lot of their creams and anti aging products because all of them have been very gentle on my extremely sensitive and dry skin. Hyaluronic Acid has been one of my “go to” ingredients/products when it comes to anti-aging and moisture retention and it’s one of the things that in my opinion, Foxbrim has perfected. I love this brand and I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> We received this product for free, the opinions are our own.  First of all, my wife didn&#x27;t have to deal with any irritation while using this product. It was easy to use and kind to her skin. She tried it on a particular area of her face where she saw some fine lines. My wife noticed immediately that her skin looked brighter and smoother, giving her a more youthful look. She will continue to use this product because she gets the results she wants, without any side affects. My wife uses this at night before she goes to bed. She wakes up, her skin feels great and she looks good. Her friends at work thought she went to a beauty parlor, but she just uses great items like this that we receive for free.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I get nervous when trying new products on my face as I have had issues in the past. However I got an opportunity to review this and I thought to myself that I had been looking for a good Anti Aging Treatment and now would be the perfect time to try out.&lt;br /&gt;  I like that the scent is not over powerful at all ( a huge plus for me ) and that my face did not break out. It was not greasy at all. As for removing wrinkles I can not attest yet to how well it works as I am 29 and my wrinkles are very small and just starting to appear. I like that by using this treatment I am preventing them from appearing though. My skin also seems much smoother and I know it is a result of incorporating this into my every night beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. It&#x27;s unscented and thick but goes on easily and absorbs into my skin unlike most thick creams which just seem to sit on top. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any huge differences in my skin but so far I really like it. No sunscreen so I use it at night before bed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for past 5 days, I don&#x27;t see fewer wrinkles, certainly doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve had a facelift.  Perhaps after a few more uses...</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have noticed a difference in my skin, particularly my neck.  Was starting to get a little turkey neck and now that is becoming much less noticable.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim is another skin care company that is one of my favorites. I love trying out all of their products. I haven&#x27;t come across one i haven&#x27;t liked yet. They stand behind their products and if you are not satisfied with them you can return for a full refund. You cant beat that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using their new Ultra Lift Treatment that they sent me for me for review for a couple weeks now. I have  happy with the results.s very lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin and I love that little goes a really long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out on my neck area and I have noticed that the lines on my neck seem a little less noticeable and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Ultra Lift Treatment has Panthenol in it which helps exfoliate dead skin cells and to reveal fresh, new skin LOVE this!!!!</li>
    <li> Foxbrim is another skin care company that has become one of my favorites and I love it when I get to try out their new products.  I have been using their new Ultra Lift Treatment that they sent me for the last several weeks &amp; I have been really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Ultra Lift Treatment on my neck &amp; decollete area and I have noticed that the lines on my neck seem less noticeable and the skin tone on my neck &amp; decollete area is more even.  Unfortunately, I have some Melasma on my neck and decollete and because the Ultra Lift Treatment has Panthenol in it which helps exfoliate dead skin cells and to reveal fresh, new skin &amp; helps diminish the look of my Melasma.&lt;br /&gt;he Ultra Lift Treatment is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin and I love that little goes a really long way!</li>
    <li> Thin wrinkly chicken neck is now getting tighter!!! I have never found anything to help me with my icky neck.</li>
    <li> Hmmm... So far, I&#x27;m impressed. I have purchased SO many different lotions and potions in hopes that my skin might look healthy and not have a negative reaction to the product. After having used the Ultra Lift Treatment for a little more than a week, I think I may have found a keeper. The jury is still out, but I am not disappointed in the appearance of my skin, and I definitely have not had any adverse reactions to it.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. It really made a much needed improvement in my skin. Plus it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
    <li> I love this brand.  My skin looks great.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My face is so smooth. I can definitely tell the difference in my skin. I will continue to use product.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed is the smell of this night cream. It has a very medicinal smell that is not too pleasant. The cream is white and it is quite thick and smooth. When I applied it to my face (I apply every night) I didn&#x27;t have to use much because it is so thick. Once applied my face started feeling cool and tingly. Once it dried (I waited about 5-10 minutes) my skin felt smooth. The next morning my face felt tight and it seemed brighter than normal. I loved the way my skin looked and felt. I received this free to review and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> So far so good I use this along with other foxrim products alos</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I have been using for several days and I already feel an improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture.  This product was shipped immediately, which is alway a plus.  I&#x27;m so glad I read the other reviews and decided to purchase this.</li>
    <li> It feels wonderful, like giving the skin around my eyes a drink of cool water.  However, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  Will let you know and reorder if it works.  Thank you for the speedy delivery and packaging.  Theresa</li>
    <li> This is a really substantial and smooth moisturizer. For night. It does not soak in and leave you feeling dry. I do see some improvement too and have not been using it for that long. I would get this product again.</li>
    <li> Everything FoxBrim puts out is incredible.  I am such an advocate.  This night cream is like food for my face!  It feels so soft and nourished when I wake up. I love it.  This was just what I was looking for something to make my skin soft without adding a heavy poor clogging lotion.  I was lucky enough to get this product on a discount using a promotional code if I left a review.  This product easily earns five stars! My only warning to you is it is a small amount so it will really go fast.  I would just stick to one pump each night :)</li>
    <li> This has taken a while to seem some hyperpigementaiton lightening, and for the price it&#x27;s a good deal if you don&#x27;t have a lot of higher pigmentation or skin discoloration.</li>
    <li> awesome nightly cream! after a nice warm bath, apply to your face and go to bed! made my face feel awsome and woke up looking refreshed.</li>
    <li> Excellent night cream!!  Leaves skin nourished during the night!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving this Ultra Lift Night Cream &amp; Treatment by Foxbrim. It is made from all the best anti-aging ingredients and all-natural ingredients so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting any nasty chemicals on your skin. I keep this product right next to my bed so that I never forget to put it on before I go to sleep. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference. My face feel nice and tight after putting this product on and it soaks up really good. In general, my face is feeling a little more firm and looks a lot more healthy. I very much recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> i received  this last night  and i have been using since. makes your skin nice and soft. i apply iy at night after i have scrub my face with a cleaner. amazing product . I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a thing happending to my face or neck area.  I&#x27;ve been using this for two months straight.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> see no difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Container: The product comes in a plastic pump-style container. It has a small stopped where the product is released. This reduces any contaminants entering the bottle. It is 1.7 fluid oz. The container is recyclable. The product is not tested on animals, is made in the USA, and stays fresh for 12 months after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Organic Aloe Vera, Palm Oil, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Olive Oil, Lactic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Castor Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Organic Safflower Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Stearyl Alcohol, Coenzyme Q10, Silk Protein Amino Acid Blend, Shea Butter, Organic Jojoba Oil, Vitamin B5, Phytic Acid, Phospholipids, Vitamin E, Lecithin, Lemon, Apple, Sugar Cane, Peptides, Lemongrass, Vitamin C Palmitate, Sclerotium Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Xanthane Gum, Allantoin, Pentylene Glycol, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: The product is described as a Professional Formula. While it is listed as fragrance free there is a slight, pleasant scent. You only need 2 pumps of the product to cover the face and neck. The product is a rather thick white cream. It spreads on easily and smoothly. Immediately the rich, emollient cream goes to work. You can continue to spread it or allow it to be absorbed naturally into the skin. The goal of this product is to restore softer, smoother skin. There are significant ingredients that work to do this. My old friend hyaluronic acid is there, which works to increase moisture and moisture retention in the skin. There are also ingredients that will help to remove dead skin cells and increase the smoothness of the skin. And there are healing ingredients to help the skin recover from the daily battering by the environment. In a short time the cream is fully absorbed and you can see the results. Pores look smaller, skin appears smoother, with added firmness. Tiny lines are reduced. Once fully absorbed I applied my foundation, actually a BB cream which has many of the same benefits as this cream. My skin looked radiant, smooth and younger. I was surprised when I washed off my makeup that the softness and smoothness remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a number of products by Foxbrim and I have been satisfied with them all. While your results may not be exactly like mine, I would recommend this product for everyone looking for improved skin appearance and ongoing smoothness and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review.

    <li> Have used for 3 weeks and love the way my face feels and looks.</li>
    <li> I work full time and usually only get 6 hours of sleep at the most every night. My dark circles make me self-conscious and I have been on the look out for a quality night cream. Just a nice moisturizing cream that also helps with bags under eyes and to prevent wrinkles as well. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because I own other fox brim products and they always end up as my favorite. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 nights so far and I am very satisfied with the results. I don&#x27;t look as tired when I get to work and my skin is smooth and awake. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pictures are before and after 4 days.</li>
    <li> I received this a couple days ago. it has a mild fragrance and my skin seemed to drink it up. The product has a nice texture and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day. My face felt smooth the next day with no greasy residual. I really enjoyed this product and great price.</li>
    <li> This is like food for your skin. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any sheen or oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are a reason to break into a happy dance.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and I&#x27;ve had to use extra of this product to hydrate my skin, as the cream is not very rich or thick, for a night cream; and one may go through this product quickly as the container is rather small.&lt;br /&gt;I do think it has made a difference to my wrinkles so far, I think it has made my skin more youthful looking. It has no fragrance added, another big plus. Pretty happy with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product as a promotional sample in return for testing it and leaving my sincere opinion.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s the best but I&#x27;ve tried my fair share. It&#x27;s up there for sure.</li>
    <li> We have only been using the cream for a few weeks, but so far, so good. This cream has a nice rich texture, is unscented (which is essential for us), and feels good on the skin. My wife says that it feels as though it&#x27;s already helping with some of my lighter wrinkles even after a few weeks. Clearly it has the ingredients that most of the better skin care products focus on, one or two at a time (Vitamin A, Panthenol, Hyaluronic Acid, and CoQ10). The big advantage here is that it has them all. No complaints.</li>
    <li> like the day cream by the same company, these products seem to be pretty good, especially for the price.  I like that they are mostly natural.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom. This is a trusted brand for me as I do like the ingredients they use. Still waiting to ask her about the long term results but no side effects so far.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, like the feel.</li>
    <li> its really nice. its not very oily. i use it in the morning after my toner , with my retina cream i use at night.  its great soooo far lol.</li>
    <li> Got a free and this is very Good product.thank you seller...I love it</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad but not good either. I wish they would put a slight fragrance on it. Otherwise it&#x27;s been working well. I haven&#x27;t seen a crazy dramtic difference as of yet. It&#x27;s been like 2 months of me using it.</li>
    <li> Received at discount for review purposes. Have been using a couple days now, and i must say its an upgrade to my old night cream. Can definitely  feel it going to work on my skin as soon as i apply. All while not leaving any greasy residue.</li>
    <li> SO I got this product yesterday and have tried them over night.... you may not believe it but I can feel the difference in just one use!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;this morning my skin was more former, have those Mochi like skin &amp;#60;3 I love it &amp;#60;3 I would have to recomment to my mother in-law ;)</li>
    <li> This is one of the best product I ever tried.. Feel safe every time I&#x27;m using it. Don&#x27;t feel any harm in my face. It&#x27;s really made my face soft and beautiful. I definitely buy this  again and will Highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rich and absorbed fast, not oily at all, will order again</li>
    <li> I Love The Smell Of this product &amp; How much product is in there.  I really can&#x27;t wait to see what this does for my skin as i continue to use it...</li>
    <li> Do I like this cream? Yes. Am I in love with it enough to use it exclusively? Not yet. But it has softened the fine lines around my mouth and eyes, and so I give it big props for that. At 63, any improvement is welcome! After I&#x27;ve used up the container, I will reevaluate.</li>
    <li> This cream is very heavy. Which is exactly what I need! I have very dry skin so this moisturizer is a life saver. My skin definitely feels softer and smoother after using this. I can&#x27;t wait to see if it evens out my skin texture overall as it claims! I also love the pump packaging. It makes it very easy to use. I don&#x27;t particularly like dipping my hands in a pot of cream. For the record this is definitely a NIGHT moisturizer. I think it&#x27;s way too heavy for day use especially if you&#x27;re wearing makeup on top. Overall yes I really like this cream! I received a discount on this product for review purposes but that does not change my opinion.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers have done an excellent job detailing exactly what the ingredients in this product do (definitely read over some of the lengthier ones for a good overview). The thing I&#x27;m always concerned with is how well a product absorbs. I hate greasy moisturizers and creams but despite how thick this night cream is it absorbs really well and goes on smoothly without any greasy residue. I&#x27;d absolutely buy it again.</li>
    <li> A fantastic night cream. Not too heavy, but very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> The best quality face cream I&#x27;ve ever used, moisturizing my skin without feeling greasy or sticky, I love it!</li>
    <li> doesnt seem to make much difference to my skin .  Not as good as their Vit C cream</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful!  I feel it is working, goes on wonderful and soaks right in, stays emollient!&lt;br /&gt;Very light scent!  just my first jar.. We will see!</li>
    <li> Another great Foxbrim product...see my other reviews.  Just got this one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really see much difference between this and other night creams.</li>
    <li> I love these supplements. I use these every morning as a part of my daily routine and these haven&#x27;t let me down yet. For about /2 the price of stores this is a great option. Delivery was super fast and great quality.</li>
    <li> Have used several nights now. Its just an extra second to my nightly routine but feels great</li>
    <li> This cream definitely met my expectations and I highly recommend.  I am over 60 and was pleased to see this product worked wonderful on my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin.  I understand that plastic surgery is the only thing that can really do what I need (LOL) but for those of us who are okay with our character lines and just want help from getting too many more....this is the product to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also want to mention the follow-up from Troy of Foxbrim was incredible!  Not only is this product top notch; this company is also.  I have ordered many products over the years from Amazon and have never seen a company care this much about customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Used regularly you can definitely notice a difference. I especially notice in my self in the under eye area where I usually have dark circles.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Ultra Lift Night Cream - This is a beautiful cream  - it goes on like silk and is deeply penetrating right away so it lends itself well to evening skin care routine.  There is nothing worse then a night cream that does not penetrate then you have a face of product that you certainly do not want to put on your pillow (unless your pillow has wrinkle issues haha) At any rate I can use all the help I can get and this formula is definitely improving my under eye area quite a bit.  With everything I look for in a night cream Foxbrim&#x27;s formula is very well designed to target most concerns like wrinkles, skin texture, protective and proactive treatment as well.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. I wear it every night after I wash my face. I particularly like the way it feels, not too thick and not oily. Makes my skin feel really soft and health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few nights to try this cream and I must say it does hydrate nicely. I use it on my face and neck before bedtime and my skin feels very nice and hydrated in the morning. I would recommend this cream for sure!</li>
    <li> When i saw this cream i got really excites to try it. Its great since it contains hyaluronic acid, coq10, panthenols, and peptides. It goes on very smoothly, its sligjtlt thicker than the foxbrim day moisturizers, but surprisngly it still absorbs just as quickly. Leaves my skin feeling very smooth, it is preferred to use it at night, and whenni do i wake up to glowy healthy skin. I am in love with foxbrims products. They contain such high quality ingredients, and you get so much for the price. This bottle is 1.7 ounces so it will last you quite some months, since a little gos a long way. These are my honest opinions about trying this awesome night cream.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say...it works. It just really works. It&#x27;s a great lotion and fantastic for all skin types. Fragrance free!</li>
    <li> I have just been using this a week, I can say I really like the way it makes my face feel.  It really beats many other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;As far as lifting...if I reorder in a month that will be a good sign and I&#x27;ll add another review. I can say this is well worth a try and a great product for the price. I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> Great product, works miracles. Thanks for allowing me to review.</li>
    <li> This is seriously my favorite moisturizer EVER. It feels SO nice. It smells a bit like glue, but it works. I have SUPER dry skin with ichthyosis vulgaris, a skin condition that makes me scale and flake. This makes my skin look supple and soft (and feel it, too!). I LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t quite done the job it says it will.</li>
    <li> WOW! And I truly mean WOW!! So as I am taking pictures for my review I of course have a small amount on my finger that I do NOT want to waste! So in spite of the fact that it is only noon I lotion up my face and neck. Now I have tried a couple other brands here and there, you know the ones that make you wonder if it really is going to do anything because it feels like you just put regular lotion on your face... So not the case with this one!! As the lotion started to absorb into the layers of skin I could actually FEEL IT WORKING! My skin started to feel a bit taut but not in an uncomfortable or painful way. It felt like a work out for my face! I highly recommend this night cream. I use it on my face and neck. Its my new favorite night cream!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS.  IT IS NOT GREASY, AND IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL SO SOFT.  I HAVE NOTICED MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES BECOMING LESS NOTICEABLE.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I love how it feels when I put it on my face, and it has been helping my skin look clearer and more youthful!</li>
    <li> This feels really nice on my skin!!</li>
    <li> Seems as though this one will be a keeper...works quickly, smoothing and firming. Wake up in the morning with much fresher skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product would defiantly recommend.best night cream I&#x27;ve use and makes your face very soft and toned.love it</li>
    <li> This product goes on smoothly, makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. Does not irritate my sensitive skin. Does not irritate my eyes. I would purchase again and I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I paid full price. It must be nice to get it for free... It made me break out. I&#x27;m 50 and thought breakouts were long gone. It seems to sit on my skin. Very greasy to me. Maybe because I live in Florida and it&#x27;s hot and humid. I bought the eye cream as well and love it. I&#x27;m now using this as a hand cream. Back to my retin-a and Argan oil for my skin care needs...</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything particularly special about the lotion, but the first thing I DID notice (after spending $20 on one bottle - based on rave reviews) is that it looks home-made. Mine came in a generic bottle and looked like a label had just been printed and put on. :( not what I&#x27;d hoped for by any means. Don&#x27;t trust every 5 star review - people&#x27;s personal preferences can vary in so many ways as to their own standard of excellence.</li>
    <li> I really love this night cream,absorbs really nicely!</li>
    <li> I put this on every night, &amp; I do not see a difference yet. I am not sure how long I need to keep using it to see the difference, but I will keep using it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try and review a product by Foxbrim called Ultra Lift Treatment – Advanced Anti-Aging Treatment. I hadn&#x27;t really heard of them before but the ingredients sounded high quality and the description sounded like it would be something that I would really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the formula, I found it to be the perfect consistency for me. While i didn&#x27;t feel like the cream was unscented, I did like how it smelled a little like cherry almond. I really liked how it didnt clog my pores or irritate my skin like many other creams have.  I was sent a complimentary order of Foxbrim&#x27;s Ultra Lift Treatment, but this is my honest opinion and feedback of the product.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim’s Complete Anti-Aging Retinol Moisturizer works very well, and I would suggest that people who are concerned with aging should start using it in their late 20s. Retinols work really good for people who are starting to see fine lines and wrinkles.  I also found that it dried quickly, which is essential when layering products. The vitamin A Retinol regenerative benefits help strengthen your skin’s elasticity and boost collagen production while unclogging pores and reducing the overall pore size.</li>
    <li> This Ultra Lift Treatment is wonderful. I&#x27;ve been using it for most of November and I have noticed my skin is smoother and softer. This moisturizer works great at keeping my skin moisturized all day and I like that it you don&#x27;t need a lot of product to apply on your face. It&#x27;s also nice that it is fragrance free. I can see a difference in some of my facial lines which is really great. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was sent a complimentary order of Foxbrim&#x27;s Ultra Lift Treatment, but this is my honest opinion and feedback of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost jumping out of my seat with excitement to have found this moisturizer.  Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I happened upon the fact that I feel it is a dupe for The Miracle Worker by Philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And actually, I think Foxbrim’s Ultra Lift Treatment is slightly better.  It is everything I can see gaining from The Miracle Worker, but in my opinion, it is slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not tried either of these products in the past.  So, I gave Foxbrim’s Ultra Lift Treatment a go first.  I fell in love with it even before I knew about the similarities with The Miracle Worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim’s Ultra Lift Treatment is a thick, rich, creamy type of moisturizer.  The one thing I do have to disagree with Foxbrim on is the fact that it isn’t completely fragrance free.  It has a cherry almond scent to it.  Similar to the Jergen’s body lotion or (as I have now discovered) Philosophy&#x27;s The Miracle Worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is what gave the two being so similar away.  The thickness, creaminess, richness, and scent are all the same between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I think Foxbrim’s Ultra Treatment has an edge on over The Miracle Worker is that it is slightly less greasy upon application and it soaked into my skin just slightly quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have been given the opportunity to try Foxbrim.  This will be my go-to moisturizer during the winter, for sure.  And the fact that it appears to be doing all that The Miracle Worker offers at a much better price, score!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also really digging Foxbrim’s packaging.  It comes sealed and has a pump at the top versus a squeeze tube option {which can get messy} or having to dip your fingers into a pot {gross}.  The cap secures on tightly {good for traveling} and the matte finish on the label is something a little different, yet nice.  Plus, the graphic design work is simply adorable.Plus, the graphic design work is simply adorable.</li>
    <li> Ultra Lift Treatment by Foxbrim is a wonderful way to boost your skins appearance. It&#x27;s made with the most potent ingredients to give your skin that extra boost it needs. Foxbrim Ultra Lift Treatment is the easiest to apply and fastest way to see results. My skin has never felt or looked this great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is white, thick, unscented, but goes on easily. When I use FoxBrim Ultra Lift Treatment I can feel my face instantly feel a little tighter, as if it is being lifted.  As with many of Foxbrim&#x27;s products, a little goes a long way. One pump does my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product.  It has become a staple in my nightly routine.  Every time I use it, my skin feels soft and fresh.  I wish it were softly scented instead of fragrance-free, but it works well, and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> this product came very quickly. Packaging was sturdy &amp; safe. I did not enjoy the scent of the product BUT I enjoy the texture and the results! my skin feels very soft but tighten and my bags has almost disappear. I will purchase this item again, very soon!</li>
    <li> This ultra lift treatment is for effectively addressing wrinkles, fine lines, crow feets and for visible signs of aging. It&#x27;s got superior premium ingredients in it like CoQ10, panthenol, peptides, hyaluronic acid and others. They also offer a 100% money-back guarantee if the product doesn&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself is white and is completely fragrance free. A lot of products nowadays add different fragrances to their products and it can get pretty overwhelming, so I&#x27;m glad this one has none added to it. The cream is pretty thick and you don&#x27;t really need much of it to cover your whole face or just the problem areas. The best about the bottle is that it&#x27;s got a pump which makes it way easier for me to use because I&#x27;m not a big fan of dipping my fingers in cream to scoop it out. The pump gives you the amount of cream you need and is completely hassle free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about a week I did notice that my face was a little firmer and in overall it had evened the skin. The way I used it was first I used cleanser to clean my face and neck, and after that I applied the cream. I think this ultra lift treatment has excellent ingredients and in a long run it will definitely even the skin out and give your face a good lift and also nourishes it. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it to see even better results.</li>
    <li> You can feel it working from the moment you apply this to your face. The moment you apply this you can feel the tingle. I did feel a little discomfort at first but that quickly went away. I seemed to notice almost immediately that it helped with some of the little indents that I had on my forehead and seemed to lessen the bags under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using Ultra Lift Treatment [Advanced Anti-Aging Treatment] on a weekly basis to watch as it continues to decrease those ugly lines and the baggage that I carry under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is JUST MY OPINION. So give it a try &amp; experience the results for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend just started using this, so it&#x27;s hard to say instantly that this stuff is miracle cream, but so far she really likes it from the cream formula to the packaging. A lot of times you buy these creams and they just seem cheap, like it could really be any magic formula inside some random squirt container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the best way to review this product would be to apply it on one half of my face, and then record results while aging for 30 years. Obviously this isn&#x27;t practical, but I can touch on some ingredients that have been researched that help. Collagen deterioration is a huge factor in skin wrinkles and sagging skin, and peptides help restore some of these broken bonds and revive your collagen to an extent. Skin hydration is also very important, as is overall body hydration, and hyaluronic acid has been shown to drastically improve skin hydration.Factor in Vitamin B, and you have a very good formula that has ingredients that help skin health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said my girlfriend has enjoyed this so far and applies it to her face at night before bed. She doesn&#x27;t mix it with her make up, but she does like that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell or something that will bleach our pillow cases. We did receive this product to review, and I must say so far she seems very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update if anything changes!</li>
    <li> It was nice to put it on but few hours later I start to break out around the hair line and then all over the face, sorry not for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Best ever for the price. Feels so good.</li>
    <li> No visible notice of positive change.</li>
    <li> love this company and love this night cream more review when I use it more</li>
    <li> can not believe I fell for this product. Nothing more than maybe a Moisturizer??  without sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I received the Fox Brim Ultra Lift treatment free and for review.  The cream came in the normal Fox brim pump.  It is a great application method as just enough cream pump out of the container.  The treatment was smooth white and spread on quite nicely.  It contains al natural and organic ingredients such as:  Peptides, COQ10, Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin B5.  It did not eel sticky or make my skin feel tight.  It was gentle enough to use around my eye area which is a plus because I wear contact lenses and that is where I get a lot of fine wrinkles.  This product can be applied in the morning and worn under makeup or at night.  I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM10f04407e4801f60462d91fa07c33410&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim&#x27;s creams are really good. They only use natural ingredients and for me that is the main reason that I like to try their products. Foxbrim Ultralift Treatment with hyaluronic acid CoQ10 and Vitamin B5 is fragrance free, it is really good if you have sensitive skin like me. The cream is white and light. It absorbs quickly. I like to use it at night in all my face and neck. My skin tone is more even now. This fall my skin is moisturized. I highly recommend you to try it.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
    <li> Ultra Lift Treatment&lt;br /&gt;I was provided the opportunity to try Ultra Lift Treatment (http://www.amazon.com/s/ref&#x3D;nb_sb_noss?url&#x3D;search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords&#x3D;ULTRA+LIFT+ANTI+AGING+TREATMENT). This wonderful unscented cream contains CoQ10, Vitamin A, Hyaluronic Acid, peptides, and other helpful ingredients that could aid in the healing of aging and damaged skin. I applied this cream twice each day, and felt an immediate pleasant tightening sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, my skin suffered no ill effects, no breakouts, and no rashes. I really liked that the product had no odor, since I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong odors. The cream also absorbs rapidly, leaving skin feeling smooth, with no greasy residue. It’s best for those of us with dry skin to be sure to use a good moisturizer after using this; it’s simply not moisturizing enough on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided the opportunity to review this product at no cost from Tomoson, though I would never recommend any product I do not use myself. Additionally, my reviews are always honest and unbiased. All opinions expressed are mine alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product five shining stars.</li>
    <li> still using this....too soon to give review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in arid Arizona and this trio of moisturizers is the first I&#x27;ve found that actually helps my dry skin. No more flaking when I put on my BB cream. No more dry patches. I combine this with Foxbrim&#x27;s Vitamin C Lotion and their Radiance Eye Cream. Beats all the expensive &amp;#34;miracle products&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried by far.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial cream to tone and tighten  your face! If you are worried about those fine lines and wrinkles this will make a difference without having to do any &amp;#34;procedures&amp;#34;. It will be a great staple to add into your beauty routine to keep you looking ageless. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and quickly absorbs into your skin for a mess-free application. It also seems to help with bags under your eyes and helps make them less noticeable. This is a great affordable alternative to any procedure and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works well!&lt;br /&gt;Wicks into the skin easily and does not leave behind a greasy residue or make you feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin soft and supple feeling.&lt;br /&gt;No harsh smells and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Went on nice and felt light and airy.  When I woke up the next day my face felt awesome.  Glad I got to try this for review.  I&#x27;ll definately be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream - I use it every night as part of my routine. It seeps into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. In the morning my skin still feels moisturized.</li>
    <li> thx for your concern about your customers! i love your product - it&#x27;s smooth and very moisturizing - but not oily--&lt;br /&gt;but i think your packaging is exceptional - i LOVE the plastic pump container - lightweight and perfect for travel!!! and it gives an ideal portion in one pump - no waste, or digging it out of a glass jar - i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll order it again</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Ultra Lift Night Cream goes on smoothly and absorbs instantly into skin. It is not heavy,&lt;br /&gt;greasy, or oily feeling. It feels super lightweight, I like feeling my face isn&#x27;t loaded down with stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I am not fond of the smell when it first goes on, but it fades away as soon as it dries. It does not&lt;br /&gt;cause my skin any irritation. A little goes a long way.  And it has a pump applicator so it stays&lt;br /&gt;sanitary.  My skin feels nourished, it is softer and smoother. I think one week is to soon to tell if it&lt;br /&gt;is lifting and all the would be long term benefits of using this cream.  But I love that it has all natural&lt;br /&gt;good for your skin ingredients and Foxbrim has a money back, no questions asked guarantee.  I&lt;br /&gt;bought this product at a promotional price for review &amp; testing. No compensation for a positive&lt;br /&gt;review was provided. All of my reviews are honest and based off of mine &amp; my family&#x27;s experiences.</li>
    <li> great product works well</li>
    <li> I used the Ultra Lift Treatment after washing my face in the morning and evening for about a week.  This thick cream absorbed into my skin quickly and did not make it feel oily or clog my pores.  My skin feels extra soft and smooth.  I only have fine lines and small wrinkles on my forehead, which seem slightly diminished.  Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to smooth out wrinkles and have smooth, soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free to review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> It feels good on my face, it&#x27;s just to early to tell if it erases wrinkles and fine lines, will let you know after I&#x27;ve used it awhile.</li>
    <li> The FoxBrim Ultra Lift Treatment comes in a 1.7 fl. oz. bottle. This product is a thick, white cream that is easily absorbed into my skin without leaving a sticky or greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using FoxBrim Ultra Lift Treatment every morning and night for the last two weeks. I apply one pump to my freshly cleansed skin and gently massage it into my skin. This product is a thick, white cream that is quickly absorbed into my skin without leaving a sticky or greasy residue. My face feels smoother and firmer and I&#x27;ve noticed that my fine lines seem to be diminishing. I can&#x27;t stop touching my skin and I really love how my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that Foxbrim offers a 90 day money back guarantee if you are not 100% satisfied with their product. This way you can try their product and if you don&#x27;t get the desired results you can return it, no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> After using the Foxbrim Ultra Lift Treatment in the mornings for a couple of weeks, I have found that my skin is soft and feels good. I&#x27;m not particularly fond of the heavy feel this cream has when I apply it. It actually is hard to disperse without a bit of a chalky look (not dry chalky, though). It soon absorbs and is not visible either with or without makeup applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can recommend this product because it contains good ingredients and because my skin is soft with using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Very nice weight and consistency! Looking forward to future results for my skin!</li>
    <li> i  using t his product justee for 15 days is not time enough to see any change on my skin.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to try out Foxbrim&#x27;s Ultra Lift Treatment and it is another hit from Foxbrim. Firstly, this is just a personal thing but I like that their packaging is uniform and not glass as that reduces oxidation of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I like the mix of ingredients like peptides, hyaluronic acid, vitamin b5 (panthenol) and CoQ10. All of these are good for your face&#x27;s texture and appearance. With continued use, I noticed my face had a soft glow and scarring was lighter. Since I suffer from severe cystic acne, deep scarring and recently, dermatitis, I have restricted what I use on my face. I am scared of using something that will trigger my dermatitis as it is really unbearable. I never had a breakout with this thankfully and was glad that I could see improvement. I like that this has a light texture to it that sinks into your skin, rather than a heavy feeling that takes a while to absorb. Because of this, I am able to wear it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great treatment and would work well with other products in the regime.</li>
    <li> I  used to spend up to $125. for Kinerase night time moisturizer.  This is a great night cream at a fraction of the cost!  My face stayed hydrated, even with the very coldest, dryest winter. I also have very sensitive skin on my face, so finding something that does not irritate my skin is difficult.  This cream is gentle, non-greasy, and contains the best ingredients out there for healthy facial skin.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Everyone is concerned with keeping their skin young and fresh looking these days, but a lot of people don&#x27;t know what they should be using to achieve their goal. Foxbrim&#x27;s Ultra Lift Treatment is a great anti-aging tool for your skincare routine. I have been using this Ultra Lift Treatment on my skin for some time and the softness of my skin is unparalleled. This is a facial moisturizer used to target aging signs in your skin, it will firm, lift, and promote new collagen production. The Foxbrim Ultra Lift Treatment is worth every penny, it sinks into your skin immediately without leaving any residue on your skin whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the ingredients and what will they do for my skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid: A great skin moisture binder, Hyaluronic acid binds 1,000 times it&#x27;s own weight in water. This will help drive moisture deep down into the layers of your skin and make the moisture last a lot longer. Hyaluronic Acid will also help improve your skin&#x27;s elasticity, and despite it&#x27;s name Hyaluronic Acid does not burn your skin, it&#x27;s actually extremely soothing.&lt;br /&gt;CoQ10: This is an antioxidant so it neutralizes free radical damage drastically slowing down the signs of aging. CoQ10 will also promote Collagen and Elastin making skin look supple and firm.&lt;br /&gt;Panthenol: A great ingredient for skin hydration, it soothes, moisturizes, and hydrates skin. Panthenol also has excellent healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Foxbrim Ultra Lift Treatment will help restore skin&#x27;s Collagen and Elastin making you look youthful. It will also heal your skin with the added ingredient of Panthenol. This is a perfect moisturizer for anyone looking for younger looking skin, or someone that has very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can even say about this product is that it has absolutely no scent. Some people love that, but I like having a little scent to my moisturizer it just makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something super luxurious.</li>
    <li> My Experience: Very impressed with this anti-aging cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and my facial skin is already feeling tighter. I&#x27;m also noticing a few fine lines fading, which is a huge benefit to me! I have sensitive skin and so far this facial cream has not caused any rashes or reaction. I&#x27;ve been using it before I go to bed. I wash my face first with a facial cleanser and then apply Foxbrim&#x27;s Ultra Lift Treatment. One suggestion I have is to be careful when you press the applicator piece. I&#x27;ve found a lot comes out when you push it down completely. I just started to press it halfway, so less comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: The packaging is attractive. However, it is made out of a plastic material that is a little softer (bendable) than what I would have expected for a high-end facial product like this; especially one with Retinol. In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased facial creams in a solid plastic container that isn&#x27;t bendable. This is the first that reminds me of the type of plastic a hairspray top is made out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aroma: Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent which I don&#x27;t mind. I prefer products with no scent to a very little scent. This way I&#x27;m not smelling it all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend trying this product! I&#x27;ve experienced results in just a few weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

    <li> I am partial to Foxbrim products.  They have consistently great products.  That said, I love the lush Ultra Lift cream.  It soaks right in &amp; over night works to leave your skin feeling softer.  I don&#x27;t know about the lift part yet.  It&#x27;s gonna take a miracle to lift up my 65 year old face but any help is surely appreciated!I did receive this at a reduced price for an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
    <li> This actually makes a difference in the sagginess of my cheeks/jowls; first thing I&#x27;ve found that does. I&#x27;m mid50s.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product very long, but, so far I am quite pleased. The bags under my eyes seem to be less prominent , (I certainly hope so) my skin feels firmer, works well under make-up. I will give you another update when I have used it a bit longer. At this point, I have nothing negative to say.</li>
    <li> The people at Foxbrim are amazing! If you a problem they go up and beyond to help you to solve it. I can not say enough about there customer service. Thank you Melissa for helping me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this ultra lift treatment for about a week now. The shipping was very quick, and the company is very caring and quick to address concerns. I received the bottle (not in a box) in a bubble envelope and in great condition. The product is completely fragrance-free. I like this because I have had bad reactions to lotions with fragrance in the past, and sure do not want my facial products to have any fragrance to them. The product is the consistency of a really good lotion. It absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves no oily residue. I usually use this on my face before putting on makeup. The biggest change I have noticed is that I typically have very scaly skin on my face and it leaves my makeup looking terrible and accentuating the scaliness of my skin. With this product, on the very first use, I noticed that I had no scaliness in my makeup application. I also noticed my skin is firmer and all around just looks better (even without makeup). I&#x27;m confident to go au natural when using this product. It has NOT done anything for my dark circles, but I have bags under my eyes that are so bad that I would get charged an additional fee at the airport, that&#x27;s how bad they are. So I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to fix that problem. I do have fine lines by my nose (jutting upwards towards my eyes) and the appearance is very much reduced using this product. Also, I have a scar by one of my eyes, and it is visibly reduced when using this product. The only thing that I wasn&#x27;t too terribly excited about with this product was the ingredients label was hard for me to read (the letters weren&#x27;t dark or crisp enough). My husband said he could read it fine, but I couldn&#x27;t. I did contact the company, and they literally wrote me back within the day acknowledging my concerns and thanking me for the feedback. When companies respond so quickly and so politely to ONE measly customer like me, it definitely seals the deal that I will do business with them in the future! I think the only other thing that would be nice is maybe a clear packaging so that I know if I&#x27;m running out or not ;) I have seriously enjoyed using this product and will purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to also add that I have used some lift products from other companies (that you can find in your local store) and I LOVED the way they made my skin look, hence why I wanted to try this product...but they were more like a waxy spackle, and wouldn&#x27;t soak in, and basically worked only by &amp;#34;filling the cracks&amp;#34;. Which made makeup application hard, and the thick residue left on my face would wipe off. This product does NOT do this, it&#x27;s not like a &amp;#34;crack filler&amp;#34; like some of the other products (and high end/expensive ones I might add). This product hydrates and plumps my skin, making it look amazing. Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free to review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.her thing that would be nice is maybe a clear packaging so that I know if I&#x27;m running out or not ;) I have seriously enjoyed using this product and will purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to also add that I have used some lift products from other companies (that you can find in your local store) and I LOVED the way they made my skin look, hence why I wanted to try this product...but they were more like a waxy spackle, and wouldn&#x27;t soak in, and basically worked only by &amp;#34;filling the cracks&amp;#34;.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of night creams with much the same ingredients at much higher prices. Why spend more when this one will do the trick? Don&#x27;t wait until you have saggy wrinkles, start using this before they happen and keep them away as long as you can! However, it does help make your skin look smoother and younger. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> love this night cream, it leave my skin so nice smooth and hydrated, i love that it dont leave my face feeling greasy, no one likes greasy pillow cases!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the feel on my face. it&#x27;s so silky.  Not sure if it&#x27;s removing any wrinkles but I am 67 so what can I expect. I look 29 though so not sure if it&#x27;s working or not lol.  I do notice my face getting tighter after I put it on. Oh by the way I am a man also so we like to look younger too</li>
    <li> Have used it for only 1 week, but I&#x27;m LOVING it!</li>
    <li> UPDATE2: Foxbrim&#x27;s claim that the vacuum reduces waste is legit. When the container stopped delivering I opened it, and there was no product left. As promised, I&#x27;ve upgraded my review to 5 stars.  UPDATE: Foxbrim contacted me and explained that their containers are sealed under vacuum, and the contents are forced up under pressure when the pump is actuated, reducing waste. I&#x27;ve upgraded my review from 2 to 3 stars for the personal contact and explanation. When one of my products appears empty, I&#x27;ll cut the container open and see if the waste is minimal. If so, I&#x27;ll upgrade my review to 5 stars.  Foxbrim products are excellent, but they have sealed containers such that when the pump stops working, you can&#x27;t open them up to get the remainder of the product out. Essentially, you&#x27;re prohibited from using everything you paid for. I despise that - it&#x27;s designed to force you into buying more before your previous purchase is exhausted. I&#x27;ll be seeking comparable products that enable full usage.</li>
    <li> This cream is too notch. Just after a few nights use I can see a difference! Good product!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product! I love it ! Just perfect for me and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream for almost 4 weeks and I really like it. In just this short amount of time I have noticed my skin tone has evened out and and is not as oily as it used to be. I&#x27;m in my early 30s and the fine lines and creases in my forehead that I have noticed are still there but I do believe they are diminishing. The cream is light and soaks in very quickly, but leaves my skin looking dewy and feeling soft. The smell is not great as it smells a bit like chemicals, but it&#x27;s not off putting.</li>
    <li> This night cream is a great bedtime moisturizer. I use it in after a cleanser and serum, and the trio seems to be working well together! I have some fine lines, and this cream has seemed to soften them slightly in the past month of using the product. It contains all natural ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and the formula leaves my skin feeling supple and well nourished! I would feel confident saying that this bottle will easily last me another month too.</li>
    <li> Ultra lift night cream. I love fox brim and this is another amazing product. I love how they only use natural ingredients so I do not need to worry about skin cancer risk. The scent is never overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I  received this with a discount to provide my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> A bit heavy, using a tiny bit goes far! I tested half my face with neck, what a difference! Mostly on my neck/under chin. Definately made my nose pores much smaller.  Only downside; you need a very clean face/neck. I also use on my hands, ten years vanished!</li>
    <li> Best night cream..my skin looks so clean and fresh in the morning</li>
    <li> I just got into the FOxbrim brand and I am really impressed.  I love this night cream... Your skin makes all of its repairs during the night that is why it is so important to use a great night cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple days and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is softer already. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles so I&#x27;m just using it for preventative measures. The cream is thick but absorbs right into your skin without feeling sticky or oily at all.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have bought something from the FOXBRIM. So far I have been satisfied with their products. I love the air pressure dispenser. The lotion is a very soft, creamy, white lotion and not clear like some night products. Not too greasy, but smooth. It’s a night cream, so it is not aimed for using under cosmetics, but if you have dry skin it would be suitable. The is virtually no odor. What little bit there is smells like a light daytime sunscreen. Fresh smelling. I noticed the front of the jar focuses on the Hyaluronic Acid, CoQ10 and other ingredients… What they didn’t mention, but I love is the other natural ingredients, like Aloe Vera (which is top on the list), Kosher Vegetable Gycerin, Organic Safflower, Shea Butter, Vitamin b5 and a long list of other organic and natural extracts. I love the Peptides and other ingredients, but the long list on the back are the ones I get most excited about. If you&#x27;r looking for something that feels and smells healthy and makes your skin feel fresh, this would be one of the tops on my list..

    <li> I love all foxbrim products. However, I havent noticed any lifting yet. I like that its organic, and at a good price.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product</li>
    <li> This has to be my new favorite nightly ritual. This cream is making my skin softer and firmer by the day. I cannot wait to keep trying this!</li>
    <li> I love a good night cream. This is smooth and feels good on my skin. So far I like it.</li>
    <li> A night cream that is perfect for every routine. This cream goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel to thick. Gives a great moisturized feeling to my face. The glow is worth it ladies.</li>
    <li> The Foxbrim Night Cream was delivered in sealed, protective packaging, so is exactly as described on product page. We purchased the Night Cream in a promotion for testing and review. I had just used the last of the Night cream I have been using, and can only find in Germany. This is a beautiful, lightweight cream that seems to lock in the moisture, without that greasy feeling. I love the organic ingredients intended to stimulate collagen production and to moisturize skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a great night cream but they are usually very greasy and I just can&#x27;t sleep comfortably with that feeling on my face. So when I was offered this Ultra Lift Night Cream from Foxbrim for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it to try. I&#x27;ve been using it every night for about a week now and not only is it light and not greasy.  My face and skin has felt tighter and is less puffy from exhaustion which is awesome! I definitely recommend trying this Ultra Lift Night Cream from Foxbrim.</li>
    <li> love this cream for your face it feel so good and does not cause any problems with your face and it work for sure you can see the&lt;br /&gt;different in a month so give it a try you will love it to</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with sensitive skin all my life. It can make it really hard to enjoy new creams and lotions as I now have deep wrinkles in my face that I am tired of looking at.&lt;br /&gt;I did my research on this product and I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anything quite like it. It has COQ10, Hyaluronic Acid and 2 or 3 other really important ingredients for great skin. I&#x27;m just blown away at the price. I received this as part of a promotion but I will be buying this again and again. It&#x27;s like food for your skin. Seriously. My sensitive skin just can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
    <li> This cream is really nice.  I feel my skin tighten as soon as I smooth on my face and neck. I also like the texture it&#x27;s not too thick.  I usually break out when I apply certain lotions and this one did not cause my skin to break out.  I love this product and will definitely order again.  I find this brand to be exceptional.  You cant imagine how happy I am to have found this.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and I would recommend it to others looking for a night cream.</li>
    <li> i love everything that is foxbrim! will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this prduct it goes on smooth and I love the results I would definately buy again.</li>
    <li> Make my face feel like silk...</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream felt on my face and how soft it leaves my skin.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or clogged.  The only thing I did notice was a very distinct scent, however, once on the skin and absorbed you do&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it....just order another bottel and also another product from amazon&lt;br /&gt; last night!! :-) I am amazed that something actual works on my&lt;br /&gt;upper eyelids :-) :-) :-) very happy&lt;br /&gt;Try IT! It Works!</li>
    <li> best products, my skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> My skin became so oily, irritated and developed acne and some red patches.; had stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Absorbs beautifully and leaves my skin radiant. I use it every night. I&#x27;m 53 and get compliments about my skin frequently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not normally the type to write reviews, but this cream gets one from me. I&#x27;m on the younger side (24) and was beginning to get some visible fine lines under my eyes, particularly when I smiled. Within a couple of weeks of trying this on a whim, they&#x27;ve been substantially mitigated. If you&#x27;re fighting fine lines, definitely give this one a shot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been striving for several months to find a facial moisturizer that would help me fight the effects of mature skin.  This one is finally living up to it&#x27;s claims !  I truly LOVE it, my skin is finally beginning to glow again and looking soft and smooth.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for help with mature dry sensitive skin or otherwise !</li>
    <li> This product has been working for me well so far. It really helps with those fine lines and so far receiving nice comments about how younger looking I am at my age of 61 years old. Compared to the former expensive moisturizer product I have used before these (Lancome), this is a quarter of their price and delivers result as stated in the label. Thanks for the great product and hope for the best for your company as well.</li>
    <li> no difference after 2 weeks, great customer service</li>
    <li> I purchased both the Ultra Lift and the Vitamin C lotion from FoxBrim through Amazon and they both arrived very quickly and were packaged very well.  I&#x27;ve only had the products a few days so it&#x27;s a little too early to expect to see results.  However I do like the how easily it absorbs into my face and neck and they have a pleasant but not overpowering scent.  I think the product is good value for money and would probably purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Ultra Lift Treatment after the first use left my skin looking firmer and feeling hydrated with a healthy glow. I am waiting to see the results after using the entire bottle.</li>
