    <li> Great product, great service!</li>
    <li> The conditioner was ok. But the shampoo...my hair went so dry and twined together after using this</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with their shampoo and have been using this for about a month and a half. I have noticed some hair growth lately, but it&#x27;s not extremely noticeablr. Hopefully, with a couple months of use, the shampoo and conditioner will help even more. It would be nice if the bottle came with a little more product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for her hair thinning/loss problem. She definitely has a positive experience so far. Using this shampoo helped with the hair loss and it is great for conditioning too.</li>
    <li> Great product I have not been using this conditioner very long but my hair seems to be getting thicker.</li>
    <li> This is a very good conditioner. It has a great smell and makes the hair fuller and more manageble. I can&#x27;t tell if there is any hair regeneration yet but I will keep using it. I also am using the companion shampoo.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner for hair loss when hair starts following out.</li>
    <li> My grandmother is close to being 80 and her hair has just lost it&#x27;s life. Her hair is really thin and every conditioner that we have tried to get for her just makes it so soft that she can not do anything with it. When I saw this Hair Growth Conditioner by PRI I knew that I had to get it for her. This conditioner is by far the best that we have come across. It is not heavy at all and it left her hair soft, but not so soft that she could not do anything with it, but it was fuller in body and made it look like she had more hair. She says that it almost feel like her hair is thicker, which is something she has been trying to do for years. I am very pleased with the way that she looks and she loves the way it makes her hair feel, all around a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a free or discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.  Will keep trying.</li>
    <li> Its been almost a year since I started using this conditioner and I really like it. It leaves my hair soft and it has helped prevent further hair loss and thinning. I will highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> that is the worst hair product ever....im using it and no changes in my hair</li>
    <li> I was offered this Formula 500 Conditioner for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. I ordered it because it says it helps with dandruff and flakes. In just about a week of using it, my flakes and dandruff are almost non-existant. I am definitely going to continue using this condiitoner. If you are looking for a great condtioner for your flaky scalp, try this Formula 500.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work and they want you to lie about the product to say how good it is to get a free bottle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in hair loss... I will not continue to buyt his anymore.</li>
    <li> This seems to be ok conditioner.  Have been using it for a bit now and haven&#x27;t seen much hair loss since using it.  After using it, hair feels nice and smells good.  The conditioner itself smells quite nice.  I keep my hair somewhat short so I don&#x27;t have to use much.  This bottle should last a while depending on hair length and thickness.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it since using it so far.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  If anything I would say the bottle was a bit small to be honest.  It is what it is tho, I can&#x27;t complain really after getting it at no cost for a review.  Overall, nice conditioner that leaves hair soft and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted price to review.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it leaves my hair feeling soft, manageable, and  looking and feeling fuller.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. First off it is so hard to even get out of bottle to even use it. I think it stinks! The smell is nasty. Then it does nothing for my hair. When I rinse it out my hair is still really dry. Not at all soft feeling. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. Especially with what it costs. The bottle wasn&#x27;t even full!!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found these shampoos here.This is the best.Thanks. Thelma</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair very well. I like my hair real soft and I have really dry hair so it might be better for someone who has oily hair.</li>
    <li> Like it seems to be helping</li>
    <li> Product smells, ALSO have to use another Conditioner WITH IT,  SO THICK, Like Beeswax, that you have to use twice as much, So I know this bottle wont last long.  Hair  JUST as Tangles as always, and Alot of hair loss with combing.  No difference.</li>
    <li> Garbage! Do not waste your money! I feel it did not even stop my shedding. In face it seemed to speed it up.</li>
    <li> I recently received this Formula 500 Hair Growth Conditioner by PRI. It arrived in a fast an timely manner and was well packaged. It comes in a nice sized 200 ml bottle. This conditioner is supposed to stimulate hair growth, eliminate dandruff, and help with hair loss. After using it a few times I have noticed that my scalp is not as dry, my hair is a little softer and it does not leave behind a nasty residue. To use- just apply a sufficient amount on wet hair, gently massage the scalp and hair roots with fingertips, rinse and repeat. It would probable work better paired with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>

So I am looking forward for the full result of using this product. My hair smells good and easy to comb as well :)</li>
