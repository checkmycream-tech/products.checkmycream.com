<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everyone is raving about these clips, but I just don&#x27;t love them with the set of rollers I have. That said, they may be nicer to work with other rollers, but I have a flocked jumbo/super jumbo set and they just can&#x27;t quite get the hold I need. They do not securely hold the rollers in place, causing them to droop or partially unravel, resulting in a disappointing curl. I&#x27;d rather risk a small dent from the metal pins it comes with.</li>
    <li> I love these self adjusting clips which conform to many different sets of hot rollers that I have, very durable!</li>
    <li> They are ok they work with the rollers</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to grab.  They hold rollers securely.  So much easier than pins.  Love them.  Also work perfectly to section hair for coloring or straightening.</li>
    <li> Works great with the hot rollers, I particularly like these with the travel rollers.  Perfect for little girls as well, don&#x27;t pinch like the clips on their sweet little heads.</li>
    <li> I bought these Conairs and also another kind of similar clip (the other kind was terrible--I am so glad I got these Conairs) at the same time. The Conairs are MUCH easier to use, a softer plastic and they open/close easily. The price is reasonable and worth it. Good quality. I was happy. I recommend these.</li>
    <li> These do not work on the large hot rollers!!!  I was disappointed one size does not fit all!!!!</li>
    <li> Got these to hold my hair on the rollers but does not do as well as I had thought they would.  They are big and bulky.</li>
    <li> This set of ten Conair clips works great with all sizes of hot or Velcro rollers. They never get stuck in my hair. However, if you leave them in too long, you might get a slight crimp or bump. Be conscious of where you lay the roller on your head if you&#x27;ll be leaving them in for awhile.</li>
    <li> Do not work for the reason I purchased, which was to hold hot rollers.  Should have believed the other reviews</li>
    <li> They work as they should.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clips and large hot jumbo curlers at the same time.  I would only want to use the \\&quot;Super Clips\\&quot; when using hot rollers.  They work great!  Seller was great to deal with!</li>
    <li> These clips work with virtually any roller size it seems. They definitely did not leave a crease in the hair as with other hot roller clips. They seem durable and worth the price. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> These are much better than the wire prongs.</li>
    <li> Works well with my Conair hot roller set. They do tend to slip off the larger sized rollers but overall a good product.</li>
    <li> These clips hold better than the original clips that come with hairsetters.  They are not thick heavy clips, but they don&#x27;t need to be to get the job done.  There are 10 clips in every package.  I would order them again.</li>
    <li> Work wonderfully well with my jumbo hot rollers.  Don&#x27;t know how I did with out them.  I bought 2 packs and use about 20 rollers on my hair (two sets of rollers)</li>
    <li> I was so used to the metal torture pin clips that come with hot rollers that I wasn&#x27;t sure how I was going to feel about these. Fortunately I was pleasantly suprised. They hold the hot rollers extremely well and they don&#x27;t hurt your scalp the way the pins do. My hair is pretty thick and the 10 clips seem to be enough for my hair. Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> For $6 or so these are worth every penny. I bought new conair hot rollers that came with the wire hook clips. I do not like them at all. These are perfect.</li>
    <li> These clips are amazing for thicker hair....they actually hold the curler in place</li>
    <li> I use these with the molecular steam hair rollers instead of the shields.  They hold much better and are easier to use.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good. They&#x27;re a little big for the small rollers but still work OK. One nice feature is the way the clip is designed. It has &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; that go all the way to the end instead of ending with a bar across the bottom like some others so it doesn&#x27;t leave a clip mark. But I do wish it came in different sizes.</li>
    <li> These sure beat the heck out of the wires that came with the curler set.</li>
    <li> they hold the rollers nicely and easy to use</li>
    <li> These hair clips work in various ways and are easy to put into your hair.  They hold hot curlers in very well, uliket those wire ones, and they do  not break your hair.  I can always count on Amazon.com to locate the items I am looking for and  their service is exceptional.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased [[ASIN:B000Q6V1UG Remington H-2050 T-Studio Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers with Tourmaline]] and found that the heated clips with these Remington rollers did not hold the roller in place, UNLESS I stayed really still, and that&#x27;s not going to happen in the a.m.&lt;br /&gt;The heated clip that remington has is a great concept, but the smooth, heated surface also makes it more slippery on dry hair.  So I ordered these Conair clips because they said they were large, and could withstand heat.  So now in addition to my heated clips, or in leiu of.. these were the perfect answer!  You can&#x27;t heat these clips in the Remington unit, but they can withstand the very hot velour rollers, as well as blow-dryer heat.  They also can hold a jumbo size roller, large enough a roller for someone like me with really long and crazy curly hair that needs to be tamed! No slipping at all, and no crease marks with rollers!</li>
    <li> I ordered these clips to replace the smaller ones that came with my Conair how rollers.  These are easier to handle, and do hold the curlers well.</li>
    <li> GREAT! I bought a hot roller set whose caps seemed to loosen up and had to order these clips which worked well.</li>
    <li> I love the clips..saves a lot of time when i am in a rush in the morning getting ready. i use them too for the other rollers i have that are similar in size.</li>
    <li> I use the the jumbo sized hot rollers (1 1/2 inch). The U clips do not do a very good job of holding the roller in place. These clips are so much easier to use and do a MUCH better job of holding the rollers in place. These are the type of rollers I have: [[ASIN:B00006IV30 Conair TS7NR Rollers Instant Heat Travel Hairsetter, Jumbo]]</li>
    <li> I ordered these clips on Wednesday and received them (Prime) on Friday. I have Revlon hot curlers and these clips fit them just fine. My only concern is that they seem kind of thin/flimsy. I expected the plastic to be a little thicker, like the hair clips. I think as long as I use them carefully, they will be fine.</li>
    <li> I really love these clips. They allow me to use the Infiniti Pro by Conair 2 inch hot rollers, since the clips that come with those rollers are useless.</li>
    <li> Great item at a great price, must have for hot rollers, no picks sticking in your head! Great product really.</li>
    <li> Works good for many purposes.</li>
    <li> Use it with my caruso curlers and it works great! Need to buy another pack. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0002JKPA4 B0002JKPA4]]</li>
    <li> It does not hold hair that is fine.</li>
    <li> At a price tag on amazon under $9, I figured I might as well get them with my new hotrollers that I ordered.  Good choice!  They just make the process simpler, quicker, easier.  With these I can throw my whole head in rollers in about 10 minutes, and take it down in like 1 minute.  The pins that come with rollers are ok, they work, but truse me clips make it the processes simpler, especially for folks like me new to hot rolling.  (PS, they also work great just to us to section off your hair when styling, flat ironing and blowdrying)</li>
    <li> As others have said, these clips crimp the hair, making it impossible to use for smooth or curly styling. Conair makes a lot of hair products. You would think the company would care enough to make a decent set of curler clips, but apparently not. Scunci makes much better hair clips that fit around rollers.</li>
    <li> I ordered these with the conair extreme heat jumbo roller set.  I do not like the metal pins that come with roller sets.  These made it much easier.  Would have given 5 star but there was a little crease from the clips.  It faded quickly after a little tousling.</li>
    <li> It was recommended that I purchase these clips when I bought my heated rollers, however, I didn&#x27;t need them.  They are more lightweight and just on-hand if I ever need clips.</li>
    <li> Clips are OK.  The only problem is that there are 10 in the box.  My roller set comes with 12 rollers.</li>
    <li> Luckily I bought these clips to accompany the Conair instant rollers ( I needed to buy something else to get free shipping).  They worked much better than the heated roller clips that came with the rollers. I found that these did not leave dent marks in my hair as badly as the heated clips.</li>
    <li> My mom definitely needed some new clips after using something similar for over a decade. I got these for her and she loves her new hot roller clips!</li>
    <li> Use with Conair Ceramic Flocked Rollers on some which would have burned my head, otherwise.  The longer of the two sides of the clip acts as a barrier from the heat to the scalp.  Good to purchase with the Conair Rollers to use as needed.</li>
    <li> The super clips are great. They work very well to hold in any size roller, Love them!</li>
    <li> Purchased these to go with my Conair Jumbo/Large hot rollers that came with pins.  It holds the rollers much more securely than the pins, which is exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Deducted one star only because the width of the clip is not as wide as the Jumbo-sized rollers, so occasionally I&#x27;ll have a few strands of hair falling out of the sides.  Not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> Great hold. So much easier to work with.</li>
    <li> The super clips hold both large and smaller Conair hot rollers.  They are much better than the large wire clips included with the product.  Glad I bought them since it makes for a quicker roll up time, resulting in a quicker hairdo comb out.</li>
    <li> Yes, these clips will certainly do the job. I was hoping for something more than plastic, but it should be sufficient.</li>
    <li> I have hot rollers that came with wire pins and do not hold the rollers in place well.  I tried these and they do a great job on both the smaller and larger rollers.  I also have velcro rollers that need to be pinned and these are much easier to use to hold the rollers in place.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair, and using the wire clips that came with my set of hot rollers was always a hassle - to get them on the roller in the first place and them to keep them there.  These clips make curling my hair so much easier as they clip on quickly and hold even the jumbo-size rollers in place.  (I have two sets of these rollers:  [[ASIN:B00005A441 Conair CH14JXR4P Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers]])  These clips also do not leave crimp marks on my hair like a different set of clips that I have do.  I highly recommend supplementing your hot roller set with these clips.</li>
    <li> I thought these would change my world but they didn&#x27;t. I guess I&#x27;m more of a metal clip girl.</li>
    <li> Cheap and do not work with my existing Conair rollers</li>
    <li> These are bulky. They get in the way of each other. I got rid of them after only two attempted uses.</li>
    <li> In all honesty, I do not know how I ever made it without these little guys. Now curling my hair is a snap! Not to mention, these are so much more comfortable on my head than the gangly wire version. Buy them and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I liked my hot roller, but hated those metal pins.  They got so hot that they would burn my scalp.  These clips saved the day.  They hold the rollers securely and do not leave a crease in my hair.  These clips are GREAT!</li>
    <li> I had a set of these clips years ago and was very pleased to find these available on Amazon.  I just starting using my hot rollers again after years of straight hair and could only find the metal pins.  These clips make setting my hair much neater and easy to do.</li>
    <li> Unhappy with the clips, doesn&#x27;t work well with the heated rollers I bought on here and it pulls my hair and slips right out.    Not good for me and I don&#x27;t even use them.    Waste of money, I think it&#x27;s made for thicker hair types.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clips for my Conair heated roller set, because the metal pins that came with the rollers held a little too loosely at times. These clips do a much better job of holding the rollers in place. They are also much easier to use than the metal pins. The only reason I gave the clips four stars instead of five is because they do leave a slight impression in my hair. It&#x27;s not a real big problem, though, it just looks a little less smooth than I&#x27;d like. Still a good product, though, and I do recommend them.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the clips that came with my hair setter, these are much easier to use and more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Product is what its described..it did take a while to get here..but its okay.like it a lot dont like that it too long</li>
    <li> These clips hold the curlers better and are much nicer to your hair than those metal pins that come with most hot curlers.  Just make sure you clip a little bit of your hair \\&quot;off the curler\\&quot; to hold it in place.</li>
    <li> I bought these extra clips from Conair and double clipped the Revlon long hair hot rollers which kept them more secure</li>
    <li> I have the revlon travel set of  10 hot rollers, my hair takes curl easily and they help give me some lovely body, but I HATED the securing pins that the set came with, they fall out so easily. These do exactly what they should and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! :)</li>
    <li> These clips hold small hot rollers with my unfortunately thin hair very nicely, and the ones that originally came with the rollers did not.  I do find that they leave a bit of a line on the top curls, but that vanishes much faster than my curls.</li>
    <li> So glad I found these.  My hair is fairly short and using pins to secure the rollers was a pain as they fell out seconds after being put into place.</li>
    <li> They won&#x27;t tear your rollers and they hold your hair firmly in place.  I am going to buy more.</li>
    <li> I do like these clips.  They are much easier to use than the metal clips and they stay put much better.  However, they only come with 10 clips when they are meant to be used with the Jumbo roller set that comes with 12 rollers.  What a rip!  They should have had a little better coordination with that one.  They also seem like they could have been a little better quality for the money.  They seem a little on the cheap side...although they work well.</li>
    <li> I have been hot rolling my hair - on an off - for about 30 years. And I&#x27;ve tried these clips all kinds of ways and they make dents. I&#x27;ve tried these, the blue ones and a few others, but nothing gives a nicer curl than metal pins. They can hurt, but they work! I&#x27;ve been using the same clips from a 20 year old set for all my new rollers. I just can&#x27;t believe these things work for people. I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> It may have been how I used them, but I ordered for the jumbo roller set I had ordered that only had the pins.  I think these are not as good because I have another set that has clips like this that heat up w/ set and I think that the clips need to be hot to work more effectively.  It could have been the roller set that I ordered that had the problem, but these just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The clips work great and allow me to use my new conair jumbo rollers without them falling out.</li>
    <li> I love these!! I just wish it had 12 to a pack for the 12 roller packs. I might have to buy another set.</li>
    <li> I purchased these along with the new Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers and wasn&#x27;t sure whether the clips would be too small for the Jumbo size rollers.  I am happy to report that that the Super Clips work well on both sizes of these rollers.  And no ridges in the hair either!  These are much gentler on the scalp since there is no contact with the scalp unlike with the roller clips that come with the hot rollers.  LOVE them!</li>
    <li> Exactly what you expect from roller clips.</li>
    <li> these were somewhat helpful since my hair is so fine and thin. With a new hair setter though, I find they are just ok.</li>
    <li> These clips have slightly sharp very thin teeth it makes me wonder if they damage hair.&lt;br /&gt;They work fine with Conair jumbo hot rollers,super jumbo not so much.Maybe for someone with shorter hair these clips work better but my hair is very long and they do not do the best job. However it is still tremendous improvement over metal pins that did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> These did not hold the rollers I bought them for.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product, which I bought based on the great reviews. The clips claim to hold jumbo rollers, and they do, but not very well. Expect jumbo rollers to sag and flop around with these clips. They also do not hold magnetic rollers very well, I think because they are too smooth. I had to get out my old fashioned wire and mesh rollers, which is sad because I wanted to be able to blow dry my hair in the magnetic rollers. Since the clips don&#x27;t hold jumbo rollers well, I had to use lots of small rollers which is a problem because my hair is very thick and I have a lot of it. This meant that it was difficult to put the smaller rollers in because the clips kept grabbing on to the hair around it, pulling hair out of the rollers that were already set. By the end, I could barely fit more clips on my head because I already had so many clips in place!</li>
    <li> I bought these in addition to what came with my hot rollers. These clips are of a much better quality then what comes with the hot rollers. They are made with a bit more plastic so the teeth are a little harder and hold hair better.</li>
    <li> Love that it helps secure the hot rollers. Most of the time, the hot rollers comes w/ pins that don&#x27;t hold my thin hair so this is the best thing.also help for separating hair while styling.</li>
    <li> work great to keep the different size dry curlers in my hair.  the ones with curler set too hard to use.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000R87B1Q Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count]]    Love these clips, as they hold securely, without leaving any crimp marks! I use them for hot rollers and velcro rollers for extra security!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t hold the curlers in my hair, they slide right out...the old hot curler pins that came with my set work so much better. The clips are just not tight enough. Maybe on shorter hair they would work, my hair is quite long, but not particularly thick.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased these clips I had gone on Amazon and read the reviews.  Of course all the reviews were great and I was ecstatic and eager to get my hands on them.  I had ordered them to replace the metal pins that came with my new conair hot rollers (I loathe them).  I had purchased the jumbo and super jumbo conair hot rollers and the pins did not hold up the rollers.      From reading the reviews, I had expected the clips to be a miracle worker.  However I was quite disappointed after a couple uses.  The clips weren&#x27;t strong enough to hold the rollers in place (I have thin hair so the rollers aren&#x27;t too heavy), they were a bit flimsy.  The most annoying part was the top of my crown.  Not only were the clips unable to keep the rollers in place, they created creases in my hair.  I was not satisfied at all!  I guess I expected too much.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to find these online as I use varying sized rollers in my hair and the u-shaped pins just don&#x27;t hold well unless I use two of each and then they leave their wave mark in my hair. The large clips did well with my normal or average size rollers but did not work at all for the larger hot rollers I have, they simply didn&#x27;t fit around them, which is why I bought these to begin with since they tout one size fits all. It&#x27;s a good product just does not suit my needs.</li>
    <li> I bought these to make it easy for my rollers to stay in place, well it works great and just love them.</li>
    <li> I like this product the only thing is it causes dents in the hair when you take it out. Need to find a way that pervents the dents.</li>
    <li> Works for my HOT travel set of rollers. I love them and the price! Prime Shipping from Amazon was so fast and these blow the wire clips included in most roller sets out of the water.</li>
    <li> Bought extra because reviews of the traelving smart by conair heat setter said they don&#x27;t give you enough clips.&lt;br /&gt;these clips are big, it was difficult to get them on the roller. I sent back the rollers anyway</li>
    <li> I purchased these to clip over my hot rollers.  First, my set came with 12 rollers and there are only 10 clips.  Next, they hold ok, but not as good as other reviews have said for me.  I have long hair, but I still expected better results.  They are a lot better and easier to use than the metal rings that come with the rollers.  The quality of the plastic and the design, leaves something to be desired.  The opening does not always line up for the comb to go through which shows the cheap quality of the product itself.  Not bad, but I would&#x27;ve spent more to get a better product and overall tighter hold on my rollers.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually need these.  Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t clear that this type of clip came with the rollers.  Not worth the postage to return.</li>
    <li> I was tired of the dents made in my hair by the clips that came with my hot roller set.  I decided to try these because of the great reviews.  I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  These have made the dents from the roller clips almost nonexistent and they eliminate that awkward \\&quot;floppy roller\\&quot; thing that can happen when the roller clips don&#x27;t grab the hair at the base of your scalp.  If you use hot rollers at least once a week, these are absolutely worth it.  I don&#x27;t know why Conair doesn&#x27;t supply these roller clips with all of the hot roller sets they sell.  Customers would be far more satisfied.</li>
    <li> The super clips work very well with hot rollers but I have had no trouble using the clips that came with the rollers.  The super clips are easier but not necessary for me.</li>
    <li> These clips are fantastic! I have a set of conair curlers that has nothing but super jumbo and jumbo size rollers. These fit great! The curlers would NOT stay in my hair with the wire clips that came with the set. This will keep the curlers IN!</li>
    <li> Helped holding my hot rollers in place but wish they were a tad bigger. Overall pleased with the purchase and good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using these clips for my Conair rollers since before I can remember. I bought another batch to replace my old ones I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 or 4 years. They last a good amount, occasionally I&#x27;ll break a few, but they work better than the pins that come with the rollers. However, I will say that now the new rollers come with clips so these really aren&#x27;t as necessary, but still I enjoy the way these don&#x27;t leave a mark on your hair as bad and they don&#x27;t hurt your head either.</li>
    <li> These clips are good (although there are only 10 and the rollers come in a set of 12) but they didn&#x27;t really hold my thick hair well.  Perhaps I should get more rollers so that there is less hair on each roller....that might fix it.  Otherwise they are good and perfect with the hot rollers.</li>
    <li> Took a chance and bought these for my hot rollers.  I thought that maybe they would help to keep the rollers from sliding out of my hair, especially on the last two bottom rows. Unfortunately, they did not help and my roller will not stay in place.  Either my hair is too soft or the hair is too short on the bottom. In desperation I was able to lock the two bottom rollers together with one clip and I successfully got them to hold for 5 minutes before falling out. This just did not turn out to be a useful purchase for me.</li>
    <li> These are a bit flimsy and I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t last years but they work really well with my Conair Big Curl hot rollers. The metal pins included with the roller sets are completely useless and my set only included six of these super clips. So I bought this pack and now just have extras.</li>
    <li> good clips , as it holds the heavy rollers firmly</li>
    <li> Great-even better than the originals with the wire. Fits every size and much more comfortable and faster.</li>
    <li> Good clips for my wife. THe old ones were going bad and these are well made and fit the curlers she already had.</li>
    <li> Hard to explain, but the curvature of the clips doesn&#x27;t quite reach around the curlers as well as other types of clips.  It&#x27;s almost as if the clip&#x27;s &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are too short.  What ends up happening is that the clips don&#x27;t hold the curlers as tightly as the original clips I had before and the curlers will slowly unroll.  They work, but are not as good as the other clips I got.</li>
    <li> Work really good with hot rollers.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!  I hate those darn pins that come with my rollers. These are so easy to use &amp; hold wonderfully!</li>
    <li> These are okay.  They need to have a tighter/stronger grip as they let the rollers slip.  Also a little instruction on how to use would be nice.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and they work well.</li>
    <li> I had some of these clips and needed more. All the ones I had are still fine, I just have a lot of hair and needed more clips. They are easy to use and durable.  They are the best ever for holding rollers! I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These clips are the best! I have an old set that I have been using for nearly 20 years and I LOVE them. They work with any size hot roller and keep the roller comfortably and securly in place without leaving any marks on your hair.  They are also very easy to get in and out. If you use rollers of any kind in your hair, these clips are a MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> I thought these would me more sturdy than they are but they are defiantly better than the little metal things that  come with hot rollers.  I would recommend still recommend them and am glad I have them.</li>
    <li> I never liked the old U shaped clip that came with my hot rollers. It took some finesse and experience to do it right, even then, shorter areas like the front of my hair never looked as good as it could. I went to get glamour shots done for my hubby and the stylist who did my hair used clips like this. It looked quick and easy. My hair looked great! I found these clips on here and bought 2 packages, I LOVE them. I will never go back to those horrible clips. I know other people like them but this works best for me, much easier and faster. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> They were great, and I would reccomend them to anyone who is curling hair for dancing or cheerleading anything of that sort</li>
    <li> Basically, too large and stick up on my head in such a way as to be difficult to work around my head with subsequent rollers.</li>
    <li> I remember buying these on vacation in CANADA and they were AWESOME.  THESE however, are kinda weak and cheap.</li>
    <li> I was worried that these clips would not hold well, but they are great! I would recommend them to anyone who needs replacement clips for their hot rollers.</li>
    <li> Arrived almost immediately!!  Just perfect.</li>
    <li> These are the best clips for rollers! We use them all the time for pageants!</li>
    <li> I have a flocked hot roller hair setter that used thin U shaped clips on them.  Not only did I lose many of them, they didn&#x27;t fit that well over the roller and would fly off my head at whim and I&#x27;d have to re-do the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw these awesome clips I knew they would be perfect!  And they are!  They are easy to open and hold as you position the roller to your head.  They hold the roller on nice and tight and they are so easy to take off too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I got the conair hot rollers which came with the metal clips.  They were horrible, I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in.  My husband did research and found these conair super clips.  They arrived on time and are so easy to use.  Now I can set my hair and not have the roller fall out before I put in the next one.  Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> THEY ARE GREAT, easier to handle that the clips that come with the hot rollers.</li>
    <li> Item as described, received on time.</li>
    <li> The Conair Super Clips work with all sizes of hot rollers.  Fantastic!  Don&#x27;t slip or slide.  Works so much better than smaller clips</li>
    <li> Glad these were offered at the same time I bought the curlers, didn&#x27;t realize they weren&#x27;t included.</li>
    <li> Did not hold as well as expected. Guess they are more for larger rollers than what I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> Best roller clips ever.  If you use hot rollers, these are fantastic.  They are very lightweight, plus they are large enough to go around the rollers, even the large ones.  Plus, for places close to your face or neck, they go around the curler completely and protect you skin from the heat.  I replaced the clips that came with the new hot rollers that I have that come with those horrible heated clips.  These clips work much better and are not so heavy on the head.  Plus who need to have the clips heated anyway!!  Get these clips, you will love them.</li>
    <li> These did not hold my curlers as tightly as I had hoped. I use them occasionally, but could easily do without them.</li>
    <li> Fits all rollers.  The other clips I had would aways pop off causing me to have to start over which can be time consuming when rushing to get ready.  These are perfect and result in a smoother more polished look.</li>
    <li> I bought it as extra clips for my hot rollers. Worth my money than pricey ones at any stores in my location</li>
    <li> This is the perfect travel size. My hair is natural wavy and these 5 rollers, if used for 5 minutes, are perfect for a smooth do!</li>
    <li> These will fit any curles, hot or cold.  Easy to use and will open for the jumbo curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like them.</li>
    <li> great when you don&#x27;t have to put thick or big bobby pins in your hair</li>
    <li> The weak clips make it next to impossible to hold a single roller.  If you plan to clip two roller with one clip it work well.  If you have thick hair I believe this product will work for you.</li>
    <li> I bought these because the clips I had didn&#x27;t hold the rollers.  These clips don&#x27;t hold either.  I have the jumbo rollers and these clips won&#x27;t hold them.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than the clips that came with my hot rollers! I am so glad I was finally able to find clips that do not leave a huge crease in my hair.</li>
    <li> Then buy these Conair SPC10X Super Clips! These Conair SPC10X Super Clips, make all the difference. You will not have ridges in your hair. You will have a firmly griped roller. There is no metal to touch your ears or scalp. I believe the clips fit most heated rollers. I am so glad I trusted the Amazon reviews and purchased them. Love &#x27;em! ;o)</li>
    <li> These are just great!  Years ago they came with my electric rollers and of course through time they went to the place that all my other curler clips that I can&#x27;t find must be. I went looking at every store and couldn&#x27;t find them. I was really surprised because they were so easy and much more comfortable than sticking those wire clips over the rollers and they held the curl much better.  I gave up on them and only stumbled  on them here while looking for rubber bands for my Yorkies top-knot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have them back. I even used them with my regular curlers. Even without free prime shipping they would be worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have very short thinning hair.  Used these with my electric rollers.  Great with the longer pieces but did not grab onto the  short front pieces as well.  These were great on my dtr&#x27;s long hair though!</li>
    <li> I have to do tons of adjusting here and there just to get one clip SOMEWHAT holding the hot roller. It&#x27;s weak, flimsy, and a waste of money. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I bought these after reading the very helpful reviews. I bought these to use with my Conair xtreme Instant heat volumizing rollers Model # CHV14JXRW. The rollers are jumbo and super jumbo, the clips fit so well and stayed in place. I am ordering another set ASAP as the rollers are a set of 12 and only 10 clips are in the clip set. They hold great but I wish the clasp was a little tighter, otherwise I would&#x27;ve given them a 5 star review. They are amazing for the price and I look forward to using them with the cool velcro conair rollers. I am Mexican-American with thick long hair.</li>
    <li> This item advertises that the clips do not leave marks in your hair, but they do. And they are really bad. Someone made fun of me and said I look like I have hat head. I already threw away the box, so I assume I can&#x27;t return them, although I would love to exchange them for a different type of roller clip.</li>
    <li> Keep hair in place  not as sturdy as I hope but get the job done</li>
    <li> Just too large to handle and use.</li>
    <li> These are great!  They keep my scalp from getting burnt on hot curlers and they hold the curlers very firmly and very well</li>
    <li> I purchased these clips in hopes that they would help keep my large hot curlers on as I would set my hair.  They are GREAT!  They keep the curlers in place for the duration of the set without sliding off my head!</li>
    <li> The only great product that works with any type of rollers - highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> These clips are great. They are easy to put on and cut my time in half. I don&#x27;t have to struggle trying to put on the rollers with the clips that were provided.</li>
    <li> They are okay but I thought they would hold better than they did.  They don&#x27;t keep the curler tight.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.  Holds in curlers and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on the hair.</li>
    <li> These clips work and are much easier than the pins that come with most hot rollers, but they still leave a mark in my hair.  So I gave up the hot roller idea.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading a review for [[ASIN:B006WBO2J6 Exclusive Remington KF-20i Protect and Shine Flocked Ionic Hair Rollers By REMINGTON]] and they are a helpful addition to this set. I use this product for the rollers on top of my hair, which tend to get dents more easily. They really do fit all my rollers. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> They work with all my hot rollers so my hair is done in 20 minutes. They don&#x27;t leave any marks and are very easy to use with one hand. Great buy.</li>
    <li> These clips are great for most hot rollers and hold the hair nicely.  They are pretty big and fit over my 1 1/2 in rollers well.  Great product for not much $.</li>
    <li> With a &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; sales line, these should certainly fit a set of rollers made by the very same brand, Conair.  However, they are not large enough to encircle the roller while also taking hold of your hair near to the scalp and so don&#x27;t hold anything in place.  They are also made of very light and flimsy plastic. Clips should make your life easier but I&#x27;ve opted to go back to the metal pin clips that came with the rollers.  They require a bit more care when putting them in place but at least they don&#x27;t fall out once in.</li>
    <li> Who invented these?? They are miraculous! I have been using different versions of hot curlers for decades and have cursed the clips the companies provided when&lt;br /&gt;[a] the rubber tips fell off and the sharp edges dug into my scalp&lt;br /&gt;[b] I lost the correct size clips and had to try to force a smaller one to work&lt;br /&gt;[c] the clips stretched out over time and didn&#x27;t hold well anymore&lt;br /&gt;[d] the clips fit but I just couldn&#x27;t get the correct angle to make the curlers hold&lt;br /&gt;[e] my haircut was just a tad short to wrap the curlers enough to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clips fit ANY size curlers. No searching for the right color tips or size. They grip instantly and painlessly and leave absolutely no dents or marks in the hair. They grip even when short hair is not securely wrapped all the way around the curler. These clips have cut my user time in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price fluctuates widely so pick them up on the down swing--or just hurry up and buy them. You won&#x27;t begrudge the couple of dollars extra you spent. Who invented these?  What took so long? Probably not enough women engineers!!</li>
    <li> Work just as described, great addition to my hot rollers...They should come with the set instead of the silly little metals pins.  Very much worth it!</li>
    <li> They melt with the hot rollers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these with 2 different types of rollers.  I bought extra for the next time I need them and I also sent some to my mom and sister.</li>
    <li> I found them too heavy for my hair type which is baby fine hair.  My friend uses them and likes them her hair is much thicker.</li>
    <li> Great product. The items are well made. I wish twelve came in the box because i have twelve rollers. Overall, great!</li>
    <li> They left my hair with weird dents, not my favorite</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold rollers close to my head. I had high hopes for these. A little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have Remington hot curlers, and these worked fabulous with them.  So glad I didn&#x27;t buy the pins.</li>
    <li> These clips work well for curlers on the sides and back of your head.  They don&#x27;t work well for the top of your head as they&#x27;re too loose and the curlers just bounce around.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love them.  Like the 2 larger sizes for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Do not hold curlers as securely as I would like. I have large hot curlers but these are a bit too loose.</li>
    <li> These clips are really wonderful because they will hold hot rollers in place for every hair type. They also do this without leaving any winkles, kinks, or bumps during the setting process. I wish I had some smaller ones for my smallers hot rollers, but the large super clips work fine on my jumbo and large  rollers. They work OK on the medium size, but best with jumbo and large.</li>
    <li> I use these to hold in large hair rollers that are supposed to not need clips. But, the curlers slip out unless you use hairspray or other products.&lt;br /&gt;Not real strong clips, but they do the job.</li>
    <li> Like the clips but they do not connect too well if hair wrapped on rollers is thicker. Use these for top of head and use the pins that came with Conair Hairsetter for sides and back.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE EASY TO MANIPULATE AND CONTROL THE HOT ROLLERS VERY WELL.  I GOT THEM TO REPLACE CLIPS THAT CAME WITH MY CONAIR INFINITY PRO.  I  AM VERY PLEASED.</li>
    <li> These would be good curler clips for the right sized curler diameter. They are not one size fits all as they claim to be. They do not hold 2&amp;#34; curlers</li>
    <li> I bought these as a replacement for my Conair Electric roller clips that had worn out. They look the same but are not! The spring in these is not as strong and they will not hold the curler in place, they fall out every time. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These clips are amazing!  The best I have ever used.  I ordered these as extra after reading the reports on breakage but so far have not had to use them.  Identical clips came with my Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Ceramic Rollers and they hold the rollers is very easily.</li>
    <li> I really like these clips.  I have an old Clairol hot roller set and was tired of my hair slipping out of the rollers due to the wire clips not working well.  These clips work with the jumbo rollers as well as the small and medium size, do not stretch out and hold my curlers firmly and without lines every time.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to get the big 2in rollers for my hair but these Super Clips (though they fit around the roller and my hair) have absolutely no ability to actually hold the roller in place!. Complete waste of money. Very disappointed, as now I cannot use my new rollers.</li>
    <li> The clips work well for any size roller. They do require some getting used to for them to be placed correctly.</li>
    <li> Finally!  I knew there had to be something other than those horrible metal things to keep the hot rollers in my hair.....and these little plastic clips are worth their weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I guess they sell those metal clips with the hot rollers because they are easy to travel with but as far as staying in your hair - not good.  They just pop right out.  These plastic clips are the answer stay put; they do what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> they really hold my big curlers in place. Yeah!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what  I wanted</li>
    <li> not catch very strong, is usually a bit loose, slips if you put in a certain way but does not fall, it is a good material.</li>
    <li> There is not a replacement for my Remington rollers but these work well.  What is really great is being able to use these and NOT burn ears or skin!</li>
    <li> I think these hairclips work really well!  they hold the rollers in place much better than the metal clips they came with.</li>
    <li> Description adequate.  Exactement ce que je voulais. Bien emballe. Well described. Exactly what I wanted. Good packaging.</li>
    <li> No pulling of your hair. No clip-marks. Probably the only down-side is that they don&#x27;t come with a little storage bag. I&#x27;m ordering a second set for travel.</li>
    <li> horrible! same as the horrible clips that come with the conair hot rollers--which are also horrible. will not stay in hair. hardly usable.</li>
    <li> These are the correct size for the Conair jumbo rollers, and grab well without hurting.  They are quite delicate, however, so you will want to store them in their box.</li>
    <li> Was not very impressed with these clips.  DId not hold the rollers in place like I thought they would.  DId not think it was a good deal for the money because it did not live up to what I expected.  No reflection on the seller.  Shipping was great.</li>
    <li> I really love these and they are soooo needed I have lots of hair and the stupid wire things most rollers come with are less then useless so these fit great stay put and  work with all sizes</li>
    <li> I honestly thought these would be the same clips as the ones I had worn out, but I was SO wrong.  While the clips are the same size, the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are not.  One side is definitely shorter than the other side and will not hold my curlers.  Very disappointed in Conair -- a waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Easy to use and they don&#x27;t leave dents in your hair.  Fits all of my rollers (Conair brand) just fine.</li>
    <li> Not enough clips for my set of rollers...short 2</li>
    <li> Not good if you have long hair. Poor quality and too small to keep rolls in place..</li>
    <li> I just got my clips and used them tonight and I really love these. They are very easy and they hold my hair just fine. Recommend these to all who are tired of the wire clips.</li>
    <li> Some of my metal clips got bent or went missing these clips fit multiple size rollers. They are a little delicate being made out of plastic. Don&#x27;t leave them on the floor, I broke one that way. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> I had some other clips similar to this that were hard to open, so I never used them. I have the more narrow ones that came with my rollers, and I don&#x27;t like them because they leave bumps. The pins I use with my travel rollers take a while to put in correctly and sometimes have to be redone. And they can tangle in the hair when removing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great. Easy to open, stay put and don&#x27;t tangle in the hair. I love hot rollers because they do the work while I put on make-up. These clips have made the process even faster.</li>
    <li> Brought this as add-on item, and I am happy I did. The extra clips do come in handy when I run out of my clips from my hot roller set. Also, the clips are good quality. Thanks</li>
    <li> These clips are much better than pins, they hold the curler in place and are much easier to work with.</li>
    <li> I bought these to go with my hot rollers in hopes to prevent kinks in my hair with a bigger clip.  Didn&#x27;t work. The clips themselves are fine and fit the roller but I still had kinks in places on my curl.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this purchase because I thought, &amp;#34;Finally, something that will stop those annoying hair clip kinks you get with traditional pins!&amp;#34;  And, while it did eliminate those kinks, it came with several other problems...one being that it doesn&#x27;t hold your hair very well to the roller.  Also, the hair that it did hold to the roller wasn&#x27;t held very tightly.  All in all, it kind of does the job, but not as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> These clips work great for hot rollers and even non hot rollers.  I&#x27;ve used them when wet setting my hair with the velcro rollers.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try these to replace the harsh metal clips that came with my hot rollers.  They are easy to use, but leave crimps in my hair that look terrible.  It is obvious that I had some kind of clamp in my hair after I remove the hot rollers.  I have stopped using them.</li>
    <li> These roller clips are the best.  I did not see any crimping in my curls.  Easy to use although they are really big and hard to store.</li>
    <li> fits great over my long thick hair!</li>
    <li> These Clips are great but the set really doesn&#x27;t need extras but there are great to have.  They really hold my hair.</li>
    <li> Forget what hot roller sets provide.  They are worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clips work absolutely fantastic.  They work with big rollers on thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, if you need to get your hair out of your face for other reasons, such as putting on a facial mask, or makeup, they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> The clips are ok I know they are used for rollers but I purchased them just to hold my hair.  I tried them and they are a bit big and plus they dig into my scalp, so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Much better at holding in the rollers than the wire clips.  Just what I needed.  I can keep the rollers in even while I do other tasks without loosing the rollers.</li>
    <li> When my hair is rolled up, they don&#x27;t fit. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with other clips (like the ones that came with my Remington). They need to be bigger.</li>
    <li> These are Great Hair Clips.  I have the Calista  Hot rollers and they work great on them.  (I  use two clips on the long hot rollers). And if you have to hold a piece of hair (if you have long hair) out of the way they work great for that too. I am sure there other ways to use them, I have not had them that long but I  Do Love them.&lt;br /&gt;They were shipped quickly and I received them fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> They are made for large and extra large rollers. Small heated rollers fall out because of their weight. Had to use the clips that came with the rollers for the small size.</li>
    <li> She&#x27;s happy with it. She has long thin blonde hair and seems to do the trick for her when she wants curls.</li>
    <li> Not as secure as I would like for my xtra jumbo rollers. Maybe better for someone with shorter or thinner hair. My thick hair probably adds to the diameter.</li>
    <li> I was a little annoyed that my $30 Conair 12 hot roller set came with TERRIBLE clips that would not hold my hair. They pulled my hair and I had a headache after removing the rollers 10 minutes after putting them in.  So, I did a little research and ordered these to alleviate the issue. They are 10X&#x27;s better than the clips my set came with. They hold my baby fine hair just right and create great volume that does not leave any marks on my hair. But, I did have to order 2 sets of these clips to go with my 12 roller set. Again, a little annoying, Conair. $50 total investment...</li>
    <li> Clips do exactly what you would think they would, hold hair and rollers together. I think they are great!</li>
    <li> I recently puurchased the Conair  jumbo and super jumbo hot rollers.  The wire \\&quot;clips\\&quot; sent with them were useless so I purchased these.  These plastic clips are much more secure in my hair as it is heavy and curly.</li>
    <li> These do not work well for thin hair.  My hot rollers slide out of my hair when I use these clips.  The traditional U shape pins work much better.  I used these on my niece who has think hair and they worked fine.  They do work well for holding my bangs back while putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> These are perfect! When trying to curl shorter hair the clips just won&#x27;t hold. I wish I had thought of getting these many years ago. Saved me so much time of fussing.</li>
    <li> Great for large hot rollers,  My only complaint is that they tend to leave small &#x27;dents&#x27; in my hair after removal. I think I&#x27;ll stick to the metal U-shaped pins from now on.</li>
    <li> Good item. I use them with my new Conair mega rollers.</li>
    <li> Love these! So easy to use and I&#x27;m not very good at doing anything to my hair!</li>
    <li> I got these clips to replace the original ones that came with my Conair hot rollers. They&#x27;re okay except that when I use them on the first roller on top of my head they leave a weird-looking unwanted wave in my hair so I have to use the old ones to prevent that from happening.</li>
    <li> I recently resurrected my very old Clairol electric curler set just to see what it did with my hair.  The rollers still heated up well but the metal on the roller clips had oxidized and were rough.  As I liked the bounce the curlers gave to my hair I considered purchasing a new set of curlers but once I read a lot of reviews I think my old curlers were just fine - they heat up quickly, etc so I just needed new clips.  These clips are great, much more comfortable than the old u shaped pins and they hold all size curlers quite well.  I gave 4 stars as I wish the package had 12 - 14 clips instead of 10.  I have short fine hair so I don&#x27;t need a lot of rollers - but my curler set has at least 20 curlers  and I usually use 12 rollers so I either have to order another set or use some of my old clips.  Keeping 2 old painful clips for now!</li>
    <li> Used it over curlers it was easy to use, it stays better than the metal holders that come with the curlers I purchased.</li>
    <li> Excellent. ...product was received exactly as described. I would definitely order again from vendor.</li>
    <li> They do what they are supposed to do hold the rollers. I just don&#x27;t think roets are for me. Sticking with my iron!</li>
    <li> does the job for light hair not heavy hair, these clips are kinda weak but they work but have to be careful with them. Kinda weak for long heavy hair.</li>
    <li> They fit the baby bliss too. Worked really well. Held curlers tight in hair. Easy to use even for the curling impaired</li>
    <li> These clips are the bomb! They are the best clips for heated rollers.  they are Soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are really great in that they fit a variety of rollers.</li>
    <li> They work swimmingly for smaller rolls. Not so much for the larger variety, which I thought would fall into the \\&quot;super\\&quot; category. Great, otherwise.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t master the dumb clips that come with electric rollers!  My hair is thick and the rollers never stayed on my head.  These clips are wonderfully easy to use and hold the rollers in place.  It works on any size roller (large to small) All hot rollers should come with this type of clip!</li>
    <li> this was a christmas , and  i do mot know how they work, she said she liked them. thats all i have on this.</li>
    <li> These are great to use with the hot rollers. They hold the rollers securely and there&#x27;s no &#x27;crimp&#x27; in my hair when I take them out.</li>
    <li> Here is a great product that has fit three different curler sets so it&#x27;s very versatile. Love them !,,,,,,,,, ,</li>
    <li> Does not create hair clip crimps after taking rollers out! Works great with the Conair Infiniti Pro Instant Heat Ceramic Flocked Rollers.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s much better than the metal pin clips! I find it more stable on hair if you combine the pin clips and this roller clips :)</li>
    <li> These are what I needed. Work great</li>
    <li> I felt the clips were flimsy, not heavy enough.  However, because my hair is thinner, it was sufficient to hold to the rollers.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money these don&#x27;t hold well, your better off using the clips the hot rollers come with.</li>
    <li> The clips are wonderful but not suitable for my purpose.  I only use the small rollers and they are too big for them.  I gave one set  to my daughter and one to my hairdresser.  If they would come up with smaller ones, I would buy them in a second!</li>
    <li> I like these so much more than those metal roller clips that come with hot rollers. I feel like they work better on smaller rollers, but they still hold well with large and jumbo rollers.The clips can leave &amp;#34;crimps&amp;#34; in your hair, however running my hand through my curls usually does the trick. I have more than ten rollers, so I bought two packs and I&#x27;m happy I did!</li>
    <li> This product worked very well, these don&#x27;t hurt, they are easy to use and easy to remove, they help me look great.</li>
    <li> These are the most effective clips to hold hot rollers. They do not leave as many marks in the hair as other clips. I use these with the  Conair felt-covered electric curler set.</li>
    <li> I love these. I bought them for my big hot rollers. They fit great.</li>
    <li> these are an important addition to the rollers thankyou</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work well on the 2&amp;#34; hot rollers. Maybe they work in smaller rollers. Conair used to make quality metal clips in the old days. Now everything is cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> These clips are exactly as I expected.  Works great for holding rollers in place.  As I purchased them for the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Ceramic Rollers, clips came with the set, so this purchase was not necessary.</li>
    <li> Needed something for those bigger rollers that regular clips can&#x27;t handle. Love these--easy, simple, do the job. Don&#x27;t get any other clips!</li>
    <li> Kind of torn on these. I use an older pin hot roller set, I thought these would make life easier but they just don&#x27;t have a strong enough spring to really hold anything. They don&#x27;t feel very stable and often fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work but not very well. There are better (almost every) options out there.</li>
    <li> I bought heated rollers, and I didn&#x27;t want to use the metal clips I&#x27;ve used in the past because they hurt.  If you clip these on the curlers just right, they do work.  You can&#x27;t move your head around much though because they will loosen and your curlers might fall out.  So they don&#x27;t work quite as well as the metal clips, but they don&#x27;t hurt my head either.</li>
    <li> These just didn&#x27;t hold the curlers in for me. They fell out as soon as I put them in.</li>
    <li> Great! It actually works! I have large pores and I use the make up from Bare Minerals. Buy it and you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Brand New.  These are not the greatest quality, they&#x27;re ok, they hold, but not as tight as I prefer, so I have to use the roller pins to really stretch the hair.  I am happy with my purchase because it was on sale, less than $6.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;gigantic&amp;#34; rollers and these don&#x27;t quite fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Conair is the best!</li>
    <li> If you hate the metal horseshoes that come with hot rollers, then you are going to love these! I used to only pull mine out when I was totally desperate. Now I use my rollers all the time! These clips keep them in place, keep in heat a little bit longer, and don&#x27;t leave lines in your hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The clips are good for the smaller rollers but do not hold the jumbo rollers; they keep falling off.  They also leave a mark on your hair.</li>
    <li> I use these when I am fixing my make up or around the house in addition to working great with my hot rollers. Great product reasonable price.</li>
    <li> These clips work well and have, so far, lasted over two years with regular use. If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product I&#x27;d recommend you give them a try. They seem well made and are a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Extra clips for my hot rollers. Does the job great, seem well made, hold up well and got enough that I don&#x27;t need any more for now.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> great in holding hair back</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really hold well. Sometimes I have to put two on one curler to hold it. Would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> These work better than the wires that come with most curlers.</li>
    <li> These clips have proved very useful, the metal clips that came with the hot rollers I purchased made it difficult to hold my hair up.&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect, they stay in place and are much much better than the metal clips.</li>
    <li> These clips really hold well. The clips are strong and the teeth are close together allowing the hair to remain tight while not putting \\&quot;groves\\&quot; in the hair like other clips do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these as roller clips, but they are GREAT to pull back portions of your hair to style the layers underneath</li>
    <li> These little guys work well, but crease my hair pretty badly. you&#x27;re better off just using the little metal things that come with your hot rollers...then you don&#x27;t have to worry about creases. They also take up a ton of room in your bathroom. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these since the mid-90s - well, a set of them that came with some Conair curlers I bought waaaay back then. I can&#x27;t believe the originals have held up this long!!&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve lost a bunch of them over the years, so I needed some replacements. These are the exact same clips as my originals, and work just as well. They are better at holding my hair in curlers, especially since I have layers. But I also use them for everyday styling, just to clip hair out of my face when putting on my makeup, or to clip up my top layers when I&#x27;m straightening the lower layers, that kinda thing. Awesome price, too!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I had been searching for for a very long time.  I have Conair hot rollers which I love but the clips that came with are garbage.  They could not stay in because the teeth were so darn short.  I was using some old clips from my T3 rollers but there were not enough.  Came upon these, and now I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I bought a used set of curling rollers from a local thrift store. They were in excellent condition , however they came with no clips. I found this product on the internet (amazon) and decided to purchase. They worked so good that I purchased a total of two packages one to keep in Florida and one for my home in virginia.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer claims that these super clips are made to hold all sizes of rollers.  Although this can be deemed as true in a sense, I would highly recommend using the metal clips that come with the large to small roller sets instead.  Otherwise, these clips dig into your scalp because of the long teeth.  I have two Conair hot roller sets:  1) the 12 jumbo roller set, and 2) the 20 large-to-small roller set.  Since I have shoulder length fine hair, these clips work great with the jumbo rollers of the one Conair set, but don&#x27;t really hold any of the other roller sizes in my hair securely without digging into my scalp.  Therefore, I would recommend these only for the \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; size rollers unless you have very thick hair for the clips to grab.  They do seem to be made very well and are sturdy.  That&#x27;s why I gave them 4 stars.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re asking yourself \\&quot;why did she give only 4 stars?\\&quot; especially because I clearly like the product in question, well the lack of star was simply because i feel that the teeth of the clips should all be uniform in length. That&#x27;s all folks. Everything else about these clips is pretty darn good, especially for bangs, layered areas, and flyaway spots!</li>
    <li> These are very good clips...so throw your wire ones away. On a rare occasion....I can get a dent from them. Used them for 3 year. So if u you want virtually dentless hair...try just the plain color plastic ones for area&#x27;s for places you absolutely don&#x27;t want a dent.</li>
    <li> These are a perfect alternative for hot-rollers that use metal clips. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I was hoping they would eliminate creases at the top of my hairline, but they don&#x27;t.  They are still far better than the clips that came with my curlers, though.</li>
    <li> They fit perfect, I purchased these because they all seem to get lost over time.</li>
    <li> This is a good replacement for hair clips that come with curlers because all of those tend to leave dents and marks. However, I will say it is NOT cool that these don&#x27;t come with Conair hot curlers to begin with so you have to go out and buy them.  Just as bad as planned obsolescence.</li>
    <li> wife said they worked fine</li>
    <li> These clips are great to use on top of your head and on the sides where the rollers might move around due to the weight of the rollers.  Now I don&#x27;t have creases causes by typical clips.  I bought *Remington H9000 Ceramic Hot Rollers* which is great too.</li>
    <li> The clips do not hold the hair in rollers as expected. They are too small to fit around the roller. Very poor design</li>
    <li> teeth are flimsy, but they do the job and hold my curlers in place.  I have another set that has lasted for seven years, so I can&#x27;t complain - not for these prices.  STRONGLY recommend.</li>
    <li> Great Seller - great product !!!</li>
    <li> I love these clips. they are better than the ones that come in the hot roller sets.   They grip well. I don&#x27;t have hot rollers agains my neck or ears with these. They keep everything in place.</li>
    <li> i bought these becuase i read they help you not to get those lines when you curl your hair. I noting if I don&#x27;t place the clip just right I still get them if not more.. Im iffy if Im happy with this purchase. They do hold a lot better but I find myself after my hair is curled pulling out the flat iron to smooth down those crimp marks at the top of my head.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my super clips.  I bought them to use with my travel rollers, based on the amazon recommendation (\\&quot;Other shoppers purchased these 2 items together.\\&quot;).  They are a flimsier and more flexible plastic than I expected, but my previous roller clips were such a brittle plastic that they broke every time I dropped them.  I have been using these with my regular (not travel) hot rollers as well.  I have long, very thick hair, and I use all10 tocurl all of my hair.  I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> These super clips work great with the larger hot rollers - I can&#x27;t wait for the return of &#x27;big hair&#x27;! Love the hot rollers and love the clips!</li>
    <li> These worked very well, came on time, in great shape. Would order more if I needed them, but don&#x27;t need a personal salon.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t fall out like the picks that come with hot rollers, etc. I also use them just to keep my hair up on top of my head. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> These clips are better than the clips that came with the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multi-Size Hair Setter. The item met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I use them even with out rollers!</li>
    <li> These are super flimsy, sent them back.</li>
    <li> the quality of the clips leaves a lot to be desired, they do not hold the large rollers that well.</li>
    <li> I bought these to go with a Caruso hairsetter and they worked perfectly, leaving no unsightly dents in my hair.</li>
    <li> Bought them because I thought that the regular clips wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair or would create a ridge.  I did not find them to be effective.  Maybe longer hair?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these super clips for over 15 years since i&#x27;ve been using rollers. I just find it much easer to use clips that resemble a comb to hold onto my very long hair that I wrap around my curlers vs. those little metal things that come with the rollers. I never use those. My hair and/or strands of my hair always fell with those things. So I use these. I bought 2 sets so it&#x27;ll last me through times when I break one here and there. It happens. I purchased this item as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; so I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping fees. I&#x27;m an online shopper and never pay shipping. I save my gas, time on doing errands and money,</li>
    <li> Bought these to go with the Remington Hot rollers because those clips basically don&#x27;t hold much.  These are ok.  I think with tons of practice I can get these to hold better, but don&#x27;t expect them to hold rollers perfectly right out of the box.  Oh and one size DOES NOT fit all.</li>
    <li> I dislike the junky thermal clips my set came with, they fall out of my hair. These clips work great with my roller set, don&#x27;t fall out and don&#x27;t leave lines on my hair! Love!</li>
    <li> First, I thought it&#x27;s too flimsy and cheaply made. After using it with my ConAir Jumbo Hot Roller, it worked great. I believe it was made this way to use with Roller. It might be difficult to clip the Roller with the thicker and harder material. And the heat from the rollers did not melt or destroy the clips.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money because I was getting frustrated with the wire hook. These clips did not leave any dent mark on my hair. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Have two sets of hot rollers in varying sizes.  The clips fit perfectly and so much better than the pins.</li>
    <li> I thought I could no longer use my hot rollers because I lost the clips. Was relieved to find these!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these to replace/supplement clips for my T3 hot rollers. They are not equivalent to what was provided with the T3, but they do work to keep rollers in place.  The clips have a lot of &#x27;teeth&#x27; that are difficult to use with thicker hair, and sometimes cause tangles. On the flip side,  my T3 clips keep breaking and deforming from the heat- and the Conair are quite sturdy and strong.</li>
    <li> I bought these clips in case the ones that came in the original set broke, worth it for the low price.</li>
    <li> I bought these WITH my hot curler set because I knew I would use them. They work great to hold the hot curlers in my hair AND they work well to clip my hair to keep it out of my way. Good tool!</li>
    <li> Bought these to use with two different curling sets - they work, but not really any better than the metal &amp;#34;pins&amp;#34; that come with the curlers.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even bother to use the metal clips/pins that came with my hot roller purchase. These worked great from the get-go. Easy to use, although when you roll them, they do kind of weigh down on your curls and it looks like your curls are drooping. Despite that, these clips didn&#x27;t affect my curls, and anyway I&#x27;m thinking that was due to gravity so unless I can fight against the law of physics, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> i have not been able to find this product which i used to buy locally.... they hold in rollers really well and hold hair back..... really like these.</li>
    <li> This is useful for my hot curlers... Thought i lost 2 clips... But not. The box was nice.... Like the clips.</li>
    <li> I bought these in conjunction with some Remington hot rollers but they don&#x27;t work very well for clamping in to a roller. In fairness, it might be the roller and not the clip. I do, however use the clips every day for sectioning my hair while I&#x27;m blow drying or a heated tool (a curling iron or flat iron). And sometimes I just want to pile my hair up and they&#x27;re great for that!</li>
    <li> Throw out the ones that w the steam rollers and buy these! Now if theft can only make JUMBO sized Caruso steam rollers.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cheap, they work, and they fit into the heater my wife uses to curl her hair.  Far better than the other alternatives, and cheaper is occasionally better- like on these.</li>
    <li> I use these daily. They work great with my hot rollers. Keeps the roller in instead of falling out all over the floor.</li>
    <li> These did not hold my curlers at all. I really wish I had gone with the cheaper standard metal pins instead of trying to get a nicer product. These are cheap and flimsy, do not recommend at all. Would have returned but had a busy summer and the return period expired.</li>
    <li> This should be a staple in all stores!  Works well with the rollers that come with flimsy metal clips.  For the price, everything as expected: kinda cheap plastic material but does the job.  Looks like a product thats been good since the 80s, so it doesn&#x27;t need improving.  Wish there was more than 10 in a box though.</li>
    <li> Love these clips. Nice having so many and they are not hard on my hair. Old type wire clips ripped at my hair.</li>
    <li> I use these with my conair hot rollers and I have to just say that these clips are a little awkward to use.  When the clip on, they kind of flop over rather than being a tight grip like I had assumed.  Perhaps it may be due to the fact that I have thin hair, but I can almost see it happening to someone with thicker hair as well.  I don&#x27;t think they really are worth the price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Rollers go in twice as fast! No more messing around with the wire clip any more fore me! I love these things!</li>
    <li> Not good for holding hot roller sin but good for section off hair when styling</li>
    <li> ...on virtually every tutorial that teaches about hot rollers. These clips or the U-shaped pins are the only ways to secure the rollers that don&#x27;t leave kinks.</li>
    <li> These are just what I needed to keep my curlers from falling out.  The clips hold them as long as I need them to stay in.  They fit perfectly and hang on!</li>
    <li> The Super Clips are much better than the metal rings that came with my hot rollers. Don&#x27;t waste your time with those and buy these clips. You may want to get two boxes depending on the number of rollers you have, or in my case I leave them everywhere I go so I need extras!</li>
    <li> I have used these for years (12 years maybe?) and I love them with my hot rollers but I didn&#x27;t have enough of them.  I ordered this new set and they are still awesome compared to the pins that normally come with hot rollers but I have noticed that this new set is a lot flimsier than the older version.  My original ones still have a very tight and secure spring and the new ones feel looser.  They still seem to hold as well for me (shoulder-length hair with compact set of rollers) even though they are more cheaply made than the older version.  Not sure how they would do on long hair or with heavier rollers.</li>
    <li> Yup big for my regular sized hot rollers, loose clamp let&#x27;s them slide down</li>
    <li> not impressed; did not cover my 2&amp;#34; rollers sufficiently and don&#x27;t hold rollers well.</li>
    <li> These might work well on the largest size hot rollers, but I use the medium size and these do not hold the curler firmly.</li>
    <li> the clips worked okay.  they are narrow and seem to be brittle.  Also, the left their marks in my hair</li>
    <li> I love these clips.  I find I need to use the longer end under the curler to brace it against my head, but that just makes it work better.</li>
    <li> Have other sets of these, just needed more. So far they seem to hold up very well. Haven&#x27;t had a problem with them holding any of the medium / large rollers I use, haven&#x27;t used with  extra larger rollers.</li>
    <li> These clips seem to hold the jumbo rollers but I haven&#x27;t used them with hot rollers yet.  I tried them with a roller in my hair just to make sure they went around the roller and stayed in my hair.  I won&#x27;t know until I use the rollers when they are hot and all of them are on my head.</li>
    <li> The box states (in bold letters), &amp;#34;ONE SIZE FITS ALL&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Holds rollers firmly in place&amp;#34;, But it doesn&#x27;t.  I bought the Conair mega rollers, with the clips because of the above statement, but it doesn&#x27;t fit.  The clips keep slipping off, because its too small for the rollers.  I thought because of the statement advertised, and the fact, its from  the same company, it would work but ......I am HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED..!!!  I did give 2 stars instead of one, because, it does fit smaller sizes...</li>
    <li> The clips are great. I used to use the \\&quot;pins\\&quot; that came with my hairsetter. The pins did not hold the curlers. After poking myself in the head several times with the pins in order to get them to hold the curler, I gave up.  Saw these on Amazon and gave them a try. They are so easy to use. I have no problem with them holding the curler. They&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
    <li> These clips do what they are suppose to do but I feel as though they could be a bit stronger in their grip.</li>
    <li> My Conair hot roller device has 12 rollers....I wish this item would have come with 12, but I purchased it knowing it was short 2.</li>
    <li> Clips are easy to use choice of using longer side or a shorter side to hold your hair.  If hair is long and&lt;br /&gt;heavy longer side works better.</li>
    <li> These are great. I use them with my hot rollers now instead of the pins.</li>
    <li> These clips are great for styling.  I use them without rollers and they are great to keep in the shower.</li>
    <li> The hair clips are great in holding the rollers in place. They are sturdy and very easy to use. They hold the roller even if the pin doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re fine.  The problem is that they&#x27;re the only ones available - at the time of my purchase.  Flimsy, but they work.  Probably won&#x27;t last too terribly long.</li>
    <li> Do not work well with the rollers. Too bad.</li>
    <li> These seem a bit cheaper than when they first came out. Also, as others have stated~ NOTHING compares to the stability that the old wire clip/pins provided. I truly WANTED this to work... They just don&#x27;t w/ out leaving a line.</li>
    <li> Been using these for 15 years only had to replace them recently.  Love them for hot rollers and for keeping my hair out of my face as I get ready.</li>
    <li> These work so much better than the metal clips that came with my curlers.</li>
    <li> the also work to hold you hair in place</li>
    <li> fast ship and great item!!!</li>
    <li> get these hands down over those metal clips!...No marks and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These hold very well!  Took the frustration out of trying to get the metal u-rings to hold!  Glad I purchased them!</li>
    <li> These do the trick to hold my hot rollers that wouldn&#x27;t stay in place with the wire pins. Fits multiple sizes of rollers. A great buy.</li>
    <li> I use them all the time as clips to separate my hair when I use my curling iron and with my rollers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using these over and over again, to figure out a way to get them to hold my hair and the roller. It just doesn&#x27;t work. Conair needs to go back to the metal ones. The plastic clips are useless.</li>
    <li> Bought to use with Goody Styling Essential Rollers (Style Self-Holding Multi-Pack Rollers).  Worked great.  Easy to work with.  Why ever use pins again when these exist?</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with my new Conair HS28X rollers. They are a bit long in the &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; you might say but they do work and keep my rollers in place. To bad they didn&#x27;t come with a little bag for storage.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with my [[ASIN:B000EPJNMW Remington H-1015 Ceramic Compact, Large and Medium Roller]].  They hold a bit more securely than the metal clip, although they still fall out at times.  I have to be very careful how I apply them to avoid crease marks.</li>
    <li> These are just your run of the mill hair clips. They were suggested for the heated roller set, they don&#x27;t work. They&#x27;re good for sectioning off hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest them as roller holders.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Works perfect to keep the rollers in with my fine hair. Only needed to order 1 box as it has 10 clips in it.</li>
    <li> It is a easy fit for all size rollers. It is user friendly. Great value over all and is recommended.</li>
    <li> Im a hair stylist and these are great. They really help not leaving creases&lt;br /&gt;Iike butterfly clips. I use these in my own hair collection.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful with my Conair rollers and much easier to use than the dumb wire pins they include with the curlers.</li>
    <li> They will do the job ok. They are not as strong as the original ones that came with the hot roller. They are the OK replacement.</li>
    <li> Work wonderful.  Much easier than trying to get those metal pins to hold them in.  Considering buying another set since as a gift.</li>
    <li> Love these! Perfect for holding my Remington hot rollers in place</li>
    <li> Fit the Conair Hot Rollers that I purchased also</li>
    <li> Finally I can use my hot rollers with ease. My hair is very thick, and the pins that came with the rollers were constantly popping off the roller</li>
    <li> I ordered these to go with my expensive rollers that did not come with combs.  I think every set should have combs and if yours does not then buy this set because they are perfect!</li>
    <li> I got these for my large body rollers.  They don&#x27;t seem to work any better than the clips that came with the rollers.  They don&#x27;t hold them tight.</li>
    <li> Work great. Replaced my rusty U-shaped clips from my still-functional late-70s curlers.</li>
    <li> These clips work much better with the roller set I recently purchased than the metal clips that came with it.  I found this true with my previous set, but had to replace them after many years of wear and tear.</li>
    <li> The clips that came with my Remington hot roller set did not keep the rollers tightly connected to my head. I had to use the con air ones and they worked really without putting a dent in my hair</li>
    <li> Love these clips. They don&#x27;t leave a mark when used with hot rollers. For this reason, I use these to section my hair when I blowdry it. They don&#x27;t fall out and won&#x27;t leave funky indents in your hair!</li>
    <li> These clips served their purpose, which was to hold my hot rollers without making any dents in my hair, and they work! I&#x27;m glad I bought these and I use them for many things now, including holding my towel together around my neck and chest when I&#x27;m dying my hair, and to keep sections of my hair separated when I want to style it.</li>
    <li> These work great with a set of hot rollers I have that were missing the clips.  I also use these to section my hair for cutting and coloring.</li>
    <li> Worked well for the hot rollers</li>
    <li> I have jumbo hot rollers and these clips are not ideal.  The rollers pull away from scalp due to the being jumbo sized I suppose.  They also did leave crimp marks on my hair.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> For someone like myself, who can never use the clips that come with hot rollers, these are the ones to use.  However, they are getting 4 stars as they were cheaper at walmart.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t fit the grey rollers and they certainly aren&#x27;t able to clip my hair up. One side has longer teeth than the other and they don&#x27;t seem to grip well.</li>
    <li> They work just perfectly with the conair compact styling setter, and it&#x27;s much easier than the original clips that come with it. Worth it for sure.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these, work great and hold rollers in place without making creases in hair.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter.  She did not care for them....she does have rather thin hair and this may be the reason they did not work well for her.</li>
    <li> work great! hot rollers do not fall out :)</li>
    <li> These clips make using my hot rollers so easy! I use steam rollers and I think these speed up the process by a good five minutes overall. They seem to decrease drying time too, since they let more air get to the hair. They are the best. With how cheap they are it&#x27;s worth giving them a shot.</li>
    <li> I already had the hot curlers and some clips, but lost some, so I ordered these.They work perfectly to hold the curlers without the poking and denting of the scalp that the wire clips produce.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use while on vacation. I am very happy with this product! I used the clips for a variety of things, such as seperating sections of hair while blow drying my hair, hoIding my heated rollers in place and pinning my hair up while exercising.  They don&#x27;t pinch the scalp or snag the hair. They are very durable, sturdy and pack-able!</li>
    <li> So much easier to use than typical hot roller pins, which slide out. Great for large and XL curlers in particular.</li>
    <li> Best roller clips to use on any hot rollers keeps your hair place it keeps it without falling out why your hair is curling and hot rollers love it five-star for me :)</li>
    <li> This item was perfect, thank you</li>
    <li> Does the trick, but it&#x27;s easy to lose them, wish it came with a bag.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Kristy-wife of Dustin</li>
    <li> Great, will be tossing out the metal clips, as I find them all over the place. Sturdy, good purchase</li>
    <li> A must have for hot rollers.  Those cheap little metal things that come with them are a pain to use.  I love these they hold the curlers in but i still like to use a metal clip for my bangs because these will sometimes leave a clip mark.</li>
    <li> Perfect for long hair and big rollers! Very strong grip.</li>
    <li> I use these clips with hot rollers from a competitve brand. Works perfectly!!</li>
    <li> BEST CLIPS EVER TO HOLD ROLLERS, USE THEM ALL THE TIME FOR YEARS AND WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this product and so far has been very satisfied with the use and results of this product</li>
    <li> I have very thick, heavy hair and I always have trouble getting rollers to stay in. These clips are much better than those that come with my Conair hot rollers (I have two different sets, and neither one came with clips that could keep the rollers in my thick hair very well). These don&#x27;t hold my hair perfectly, but are a huge improvement over anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> keeps the hot rollers in!</li>
    <li> much easier to use  and stays in hair than original clips that came with my Remington travel hair curler set.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that will not hold a curl for longer than 30 minutes when using a regular curling iron. I don&#x27;t like using hairspray, but if I did  the curl would last longer but only for a short time maybe another 30mins. to an hour more. What amazes me about these curlers; it only takes me 5 minutes or less to roll my entire head AND I only leave the rollers in for anywhere from 5- 10 minutes MAX and my hair still has curls when I come home after working 8 hours and zero hairspray. My hair always looks shinier and healthier when I use my rollers.  My hair has bounce and body and yes curl all day.  I love the way my hair feels. This product just blows me away. Every hair salon in the world should use these. They leave no marks in your hair like a curling iron barrel does. It&#x27;s super fast, and you can add either just great body to your hair in just minutes or very curly curls in as little as 10 minutes. My hair is even more easier to style with the bounce and curls I get using different size curlers in different areas of my head. This is something you can&#x27;t achieve using a curling iron unless you have 4 different size barrels heating up at one time. Who does that? I  gave away every curling iron I own. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair - if I have to style it,  I have recommended these to anyone who asks what I use on my hair to get the curls I get and I am asked often!! Like many of the other reviews, I too, wish they had 30 clips for the 30 curlers but I purchased 15 extra clips when I purchased the curlers and even though I had to buy extra clips to match the amount curlers supplied -since they only give you 15, I STILL THINK THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY PAID and WORTHY OF 5 STARS!!!! Love it Love it Love it!</li>
    <li> They fit my jumbo nicely!</li>
    <li> Thought these would hold rollers better than clips.  In theory they do but these are poorly made and not worth it</li>
    <li> I bought some heated rollers with the nasty metal pins to keep them in place. I kept burning my fingers trying to get them on and often they just rolled off. A girlfriend told me to get this style of clip as they are so much easier to use and she was right! This product works really well, is easy to attach to my rollers (not Conair by the way and they still work). They stay where they are put and I no longer burn my fingers. Success!</li>
    <li> I bought these clips to use in place of the ceramic ones that come with my rollers. These clips prevent the bend or crease that the standard clips seem to create. Speedy delivery</li>
    <li> Only wish it came with more than 10</li>
    <li> an absolute must, especially w/hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;the pins that come w/ them are horrible! these will save your do.</li>
    <li> Great clips just did not need extra clips for the rollers I ordered&#x27;</li>
    <li> had the bas just needed the clips...so glad available and i have them ..awesum!</li>
    <li> Universal. Using with the Remington compact set.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t really hold my rollers in place what a disappointment!</li>
    <li> I got these because I lost the clips that went to my giant 5 roller set.  They were exactly right.  I later found the missing ones under the bed, where the cat swatted them, so gave five of the new ones (there were 10) to my granddaughter for her hot rollers.</li>
    <li> i bought these to replace the u-shaped clips that come with my hot roller set.  these do not hold very tightly, and will fall out if the roller isn&#x27;t rolled into your hair horizontally, which i almost never do.  it is extremely annoying to be doing my makeup and have two or three clips/rollers unclip and fall out on the floor...i have yet to find a clip that holds my rollers in. i would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> These fit many different sizes of rollers and hold them perfectly in place. I would definitely recommend these to anyone that loves their rollers but, can&#x27;t make them stay put.</li>
    <li> the clips don&#x27;t keep the rollers on hair and you have to constantly re-roll your hair, at least that is what happens with my hair</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Useless  to me because the culer set I bought a the same time comes with clips! Grr .</li>
    <li> These work great. I got a set of conair hot rollers and the clips that came with it just wouldn&#x27;t stay in, but these did the trick, and no lines!</li>
    <li> not sure i like them seem real generic</li>
    <li> I love these they were recommended to me by a friend. They are awesome. I love these. I use them daily.</li>
    <li> My hair is so thick that these just don&#x27;t hold the weight.  They do work for my daughter though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Split decision...</li>
    <li> Sturdy clips that will last a long time.  Bought a second set for the Conair hot rollers I just purchased.  Hate when I lose them!</li>
    <li> Really help keep the roller in, but can make pulling them out a little difficult if you&#x27;re not super careful to not clip in hair from another roller.</li>
    <li> I love this product but the last time I received it (fall 2014) the quality had noticeably gone down.  The springs were made of a different metal, and the plastic was less weighty.  I hope they last as well as the previous set.</li>
    <li> They are a bit large  for a whole head of curlers.  and a little too flimsy.  they actually  ADD  to the time it takes to set  my hair  trying to be careful  with them.  I wish I&#x27;d sent them back,  but I have to make-do with them for now.</li>
    <li> A must have clip for hot rollers. They keep the rollers in place!</li>
    <li> Makes life easier, a definate must. I use these with the large and jumbo rollers. They will keep hair in place and prevent your fingers from getting burned!</li>
    <li> I received my Conair Clips from Amazon in just a few days. Easy to use. Works much better than clips that came with hot rollers. May also be used with velcro rollers for a firmer hold resulting in curls that last longer. Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered books, shoes and other items from Amazon and would rate all of them at five stars.</li>
    <li> I bought Conair hot rollers with clips. I bought an extra box of these clips, however, they are too small to hold the larger hot rollers in place as they do not reach far enough around. I would suggest to not buy these, but to buy a larger size unless you have very short hair and use small rollers. Hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for !</li>
    <li> Great grip &amp; fit any type of roller.</li>
    <li> These hold the rollers ok, I use 2 per roller but the great part is that they do not dent the hair at all!</li>
    <li> I bought these to use in conjunction with my hot rollers and I used to with a variety of sizes and types and they adjust regardless of size (super skinny to jumbo rollers). These work SO MUCH better than the dinky wire clips that come standard with most rollers. They&#x27;re sturdy, easy open and easy to remove from hair without pulling and snagging. These are also great when dying my hair at home as they have great hold for sectioning off chunks of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered a second set of these and to just isn&#x27;t enough for my hair when I&#x27;m doing a whole set of hot rollers. But they&#x27;re not expensive and so worth having.</li>
    <li> They work really well with curlers that I bought and hold the curlers in my hair for a good while.</li>
    <li> These work well with my old rollers and are easy-not hot on your head. Save the box for storage later under your sink.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for the originas</li>
    <li> Everything just as advertised,thank you</li>
    <li> this is a great concept and I thought exactly what I needed. However I have passed shoulder length hair that is heavy so once I get my hair up in the hot rollers these are not sturdy enough to hold it.</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair, your rollers my still want to fall out.  Also, like everybody says, you do gets lines from the heat/clip.</li>
