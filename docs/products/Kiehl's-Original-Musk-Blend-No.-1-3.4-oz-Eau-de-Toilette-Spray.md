      <li>i love this fragrence.</li>

      <li>However, I decided to wait it out, still clinging to the hope the scent would magically improve.  </li>

      <li>It smells fantastic on either my wife or myself.  </li>
      <li>The scent of it isn&#x27;t always the same each time you wear it, which is great.  </li>
      <li>This smell is light and fresh.  </li>
      <li>It lasts all day and just smells so fresh and clean.</li>

      <li>Sexy and clean all at the same time.</li>
      <li>it is a bit heady but at the same time fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>Pure musk at its finest.</li>

      <li>Yeah, a real man wears this sort of stuff....</li>
      <li>Its have much valued the people, as very business, strict, uncompromise.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I really am.</li>
      <li>but i did not have a concrete answer.    </li>
      <li>male cat spray\\&quot; For those of you fortunate enough to have never smelled either, let me sum up in one word...</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my body chemistry because there are so many positive reviews, but for me, this was not good.</li>
      <li>Wow, so ibought this from the kiehls site.  </li>
      <li>I thought the scent would improve after a bit, so I walked around, sniffing the pulse points of my wrists, hoping against all hope that after a few moments, I would be able to utter an \\&quot;ahhh\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It gives you an amazing feeling like you&#x27;re rounding up cattle with a woman behind you holding on to your bare chest, all while you&#x27;re texting another woman to come over for drinks later.</li>
      <li>To be perfectly honest, I thought it was illegal to sell beauty products without a box listing ingredients</li>
      <li>Alas, has puted 4 since some woman spoke that smell(blows in), soap or old grand mom by toilet water.    </li>
      <li>This is real musk without the overpowering additives that other companies use.</li>

<li> This is real musk without the overpowering additives that other companies use.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, maybe I&#x27;m not using enough?</li>

<li> Sorry kiehls.  </li>
<li> Amazon, however, steered me to the product, it was delivered in a few days, AND I SAVED ALMOST $20.00!!!!!</li>
<li> This product is VERY hard to find!!!!</li>

    <li> If you are looking for clean scent, that out of the shower scent, the rest of the day, then this is it! I am a man and I love this scent and so does my wife! Sexy and clean all at the same time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, wasn&#x27;t as \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; as I thought I&#x27;d be. Doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, maybe I&#x27;m not using enough? And doesn&#x27;t smell to me at all like the oil, which also doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
    <li> I liked this product. Beside it true (real) manly scent of the nutmeg, as base of all toilet water for mans. Its have much valued the people, as very business, strict, uncompromise. The Aroma remains not perceptible when use, but is long felt (sounds) after. If You want to leave its trace in the manner of aroma to about You to recalled. buy and make use. Alas, has puted 4 since some woman spoke that smell(blows in), soap or old grand mom by toilet water.    Alex</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES it.  I think it has quickly become one of his favorites.  It is a crisp, clean and fresh scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.  The scent of it isn&#x27;t always the same each time you wear it, which is great.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a musk fanatic!  That being said, I came upon this item and based on the reviews, I was very excited to try it! Through a search, I found that it is available at a local department store, so rather than risk ordering it, I excitedly ventured out to the store for a test!  My immediate reaction, was \\&quot;un-neutered ferret and male cat spray\\&quot; For those of you fortunate enough to have never smelled either, let me sum up in one word...YUCK!!! I thought the scent would improve after a bit, so I walked around, sniffing the pulse points of my wrists, hoping against all hope that after a few moments, I would be able to utter an \\&quot;ahhh\\&quot;.  Sadly, no such luck.  The scent never improved and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to shower.  However, I decided to wait it out, still clinging to the hope the scent would magically improve.  Hours later, I took that shower!  Maybe it&#x27;s my body chemistry because there are so many positive reviews, but for me, this was not good.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF MANY FRAGRANCES I WEAR,BUT THIS  ONE REALLY MAKES ME HAPPY AND PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK WHAT ARE YOU WEARING.  IF YOU WANT TO TURN HEADS BUY THIS FRAGRANCE.</li>
    <li> If you want to steer away from the countless colognes that are smelling more and more like women&#x27;s perfume, then this is a must buy. It gives you an amazing feeling like you&#x27;re rounding up cattle with a woman behind you holding on to your bare chest, all while you&#x27;re texting another woman to come over for drinks later. Yeah, a real man wears this sort of stuff....</li>

    <li> Great original scent which draws a lot of attention from people.   My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a long life, meaning I have to reapply it during the day.</li>
    <li> hello,    after my order around 45 days ago, i still do not receveid the perfume. i have sent some messages but i did not have a concrete answer.    so how do you think is my opinion on this product and above all from the provider...</li>
    <li> Kiehl&#x27;s classic star product, in the most convenient, practical presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best if combined with the shower gel &amp; the body lotion.</li>
    <li> From what I can tell, the spray has been out of stock with Kiehl&#x27;s since June but the essential oil is still going. This is real musk without the overpowering additives that other companies use. Also, this is a great price for this size bottle.</li>
    <li> Wow, so ibought this from the kiehls site.  I was sooo anxious to recieve it, but when it arrived and i opened it and tried it out, it smelled like stale perfume.  I waited till it dried to see if the scent would change but it didn&#x27;t.  YUK!  I wish they would have never changed the formula to Jovan musk.  That was an amazing scent.  If i could find that or something close to that i would be happy.  Sorry kiehls.  I really am.</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I use Kiehl&#x27;s Orignal Musk.  I enjoy the smell of musk but most are too loud.  This smell is light and fresh.  I enjoy wearing it especially in warm months.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It smells fantastic on either my wife or myself.  It adapts its scent to the individual and smell amazing.</li>
    <li> i love this fragrance! after years of being a fragrance whore (literally, dozens...the money i could have in my account;() this the one i wear everyday.  it is a bit heady but at the same time fresh and clean.  i will occasionally wear marc jacobs or guerlain vetiver (gemini that i am, i have to mix it up once in awhile).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy this cologne for a while now, and recently purchased this with a gift card. It arrived wrapped in bubble tape, but without the box it SHOULD come in. Granted, this was no big deal for me, as I bought it for myself and it hadn&#x27;t been damaged during shipping, but if I had bought this as a gift for someone else, I would have wanted to know it would be sans box. To be perfectly honest, I thought it was illegal to sell beauty products without a box listing ingredients and whatnot + a safety seal, so it was all a little fishy to me. That said, the scent is as it should be, so I&#x27;m content.</li>
    <li> i love this fragrence. It smells great on me. You should probably sample it on yourself before purchasing it. My sister hated the way it smelled on her, i guess everyone has different body chemistry. However, i love it. It lasts all day and just smells so fresh and clean. It also moisturizes ur skin! Whenever i wear it, i get complements from both men and women.</li>
    <li> I love the way this Musk by Kiehl&#x27;s makes my skin smell musky and sexy!  Throughout the day, I spend a lot of time in the sun, and by the end of the day I can still smell my perfume! I live in Florida, and usually perfume sweats off of me, but this Musk lasts and lasts!  It changes scent, too.</li>
    <li> This is a soft, lovely fragrance that lasts all day. Highly recommend it! Doesn&#x27;t overpower you. Pure musk at its finest.</li>
    <li> Not the scent I was hoping for.</li>
