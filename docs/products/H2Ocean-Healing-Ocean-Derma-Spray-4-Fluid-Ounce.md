      <li>Quick Ship!</li>
      <li>I originally got this for when I was going to pierce my septum but ended up giving it to my brother after he used one of my piercing needles for his nose</li>
      <li>Years ago a Vet told me to use saline spray to clean wounds and I have always kept it on hand.</li>
      <li>Works great for cleaning piercings and other hard-to-clean places like g-tube sites</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s a mist and not a spray, but I&#x27;ve not had the quick healing result that others mentioned in their reviews.</li>
      <li>This is good for minor scrapes and scratches.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re golden</li>
      <li>I was trying to help heal freshly pierced ears (wouldn&#x27;t recommend for that), but for small things, it works great.</li>

      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The most recent can puchased, seal unbroken, is now part of our home first aid kit.</li>
      <li>The spray and formula was gentle on my skin but the spray was powerful enough to clean the piercings.</li>
      <li>I use it for bug bites, boils, infections related to piercings and pretty much any open wound on my body.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s what is saving my piercing.</li>
      <li>We even tried buying plain bottled saline and sterile syringes (the liquid medicine dispensing kind), which was a hassle not really worth</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I did not have money to go to a dermatologist, I put on some regular toothpaste on it and after two days, it was fixed!</li>
      <li>It kept my lip ring pretty clean, but the spray is a little messy.</li>
      <li>I used several canned products, some of which were a little more dribbly or uneven to spray as opposed to this one, and some of which were even more expensive.</li>

    <li> Great stuff! Has multiple uses and I&#x27;ve bought many cans!</li>
    <li> I am glad that I purchased this product!  I use this to aid my navel piercing.  It&#x27;s easily portable, and non-stining.  Quick Ship!</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s a mist and not a spray, but I&#x27;ve not had the quick healing result that others mentioned in their reviews.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. It kept my lip ring pretty clean, but the spray is a little messy. Helped my piercing heal.</li>
    <li> Great product. Cut the healing time in half with a cut on my hand!</li>
    <li> Cleared up the irritation and difficulty I was having healing my Dermal anchor. Only this product several times a day and you&#x27;re golden</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I was really desperate to cure an infection after I got my nose pierced. It did not help me at all. I cleaned it twice daily but my infected bump was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I did not have money to go to a dermatologist, I put on some regular toothpaste on it and after two days, it was fixed! It was a miracle. You can use it on pimples, too, (just a tip).</li>
    <li> Healed the wounds well, just took a little longer than expected. This is good for minor scrapes and scratches. I was trying to help heal freshly pierced ears (wouldn&#x27;t recommend for that), but for small things, it works great.</li>
    <li> It worked good on my belly button piercing</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff and it seems no ones knows about it!! I use it for bug bites, boils, infections related to piercings and pretty much any open wound on my body. Does not sting and actually calms the affected area!! thank you</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Really helps heal cartilage piercings!</li>
    <li> this product is great, will be purchasing again, any wound seems to heal faster without any sting.</li>
    <li> I use this with every bandage change on my diabetic feet and it seems to be speeding up the healing process...thanks!</li>
    <li> Made multiple purchases of this product -- a family member struggled with a diabetic foot wound for several years, thankfully now healed.  I used several canned products, some of which were a little more dribbly or uneven to spray as opposed to this one, and some of which were even more expensive. We even tried buying plain bottled saline and sterile syringes (the liquid medicine dispensing kind), which was a hassle not really worth the money saved.  (And believe me, I&#x27;m frugal.  I recycle everything but lint.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most recent can puchased, seal unbroken, is now part of our home first aid kit.</li>
    <li> This spray is the only stuff that has ever worked for healing piercings. I&#x27;m on my 4th nose piercing (yes it&#x27;s a bit excessive), as the first 3 times i had it pierced it kept getting infected and wouldn&#x27;t heal properly. I like having my nose ring a lot so i continued to get it redone, but not until the 4th time did I learn about Healing Ocean. If my nose ring starts feeling a little sore or infected I just spray it and use a soaked Q-tip for inside my nose on the piercing. The pain literally goes away in a few hours. I&#x27;ve tried many ointments and nothing has worked so well until this. I will definately be purchasing this stuff again!</li>
    <li> Yes. All I have to say is yes. I have had 2 naval piercings that did not work out because it got infected. I figured I will try to have it one last time and this time the piercer recommended sea salt spray for healing. I was skeptical because of how the piercing never worked for me before, but using this made all the difference. I soak my piercing once a day and it takes away any redness and does not burn or sting to apply! So far it&#x27;s what is saving my piercing.</li>
    <li> Works great for cleaning piercings and other hard-to-clean places like g-tube sites</li>
    <li> Definitely helped with my infected helix piercing and arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this product I been using it for years!</li>
    <li> I got this to use on one of my dogs - he was scratching a lot. He protests. I had occasion to use it on myself and there is no sting and I think my cut healed quicker than usual. Years ago a Vet told me to use saline spray to clean wounds and I have always kept it on hand. This comes out in a spray - the other brand I have comes out in a stream that can be frustrating. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I originally got this for when I was going to pierce my septum but ended up giving it to my brother after he used one of my piercing needles for his nose lol. It works great and thanks to this he didn&#x27;t get an infection from his at home nose piercing.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I use it for would care. Sterile and very easy to use. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> When my ear piercings were taking a while to heal, I used this product. The spray and formula was gentle on my skin but the spray was powerful enough to clean the piercings. Love this product. Even after I was able to finally change out my earrings, I would clean the earring posts with rubbing alcohol, used stainless steel posts, and cleaned my ears with this solution and....no infection!</li>
