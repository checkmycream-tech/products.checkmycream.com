      <li>My skin looks better than it has in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, it contains a SPF rating of 20, so it is perfect to wear under makeup daily.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because it was a face lotion more than anything.</li>
      <li>Hopefully I will be able to get more when I need it.</li>
      <li>Hopefully my face will not fall off.  :)</li>
      <li>I love this product but the Safety Seal on the box and the dispenser on the bottle was also dampered with</li>
      <li>am glad i got this product -</li>
      <li>Sunscreen always seems to make moisturizer stay on the top of my skin instead of sinking in to work as it should.  </li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I used to love it and made my skin smooth, not needing foundation either.</li>
      <li>I loved it, and it was very close in formula to the one that was discontinued.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll sacrifice other things just to buy this wonderful cream.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and dissolves very quickly into your skin.  </li>
      <li>I still love this product, but the price has more than doubled since I first purchased it.  </li>
      <li>Now I have to find another light moisturizer with sunscreen that won&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and you can see improvement in skin texture.  ...</li>
      <li>It is a light lotion (critical for oily skin) and has a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very gently and creamy and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>the product was delivered quickly and it works well</li>
      <li>, I noticed a tingly feeling on my face, but that quickly went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The copper peptides provide healing properties and calm irritations.</li>
      <li>I had to stop buying this magnificent cream because the price became prohibitive, but after wasting my money on other products I went back to it.</li>
      <li>My skin is normal, not too dry, not oily and loved this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this blue lotion for many years.  </li>
      <li>After a few months of using it complete strangers would come up to me and comment on my beautiful complexion.  </li>
      <li>I wore soon after using the cream for the first time.  </li>
      <li>The first couple of times that I used it</li>
      <li>I have oily skin) and it really smooths out my skin.</li>
      <li>This face lotion has been up to its worth so far.</li>
      <li>The fact tht is has spf 20 is a real bonus.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; aspect, but I like how gentle it feels on my skin, it absorbs well, and my face looks dewy and even toned as a result.</li>
      <li>SPF 20 doesn&#x27;t really help that much...</li>
      <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
      <li>After researching it on the internet I find that it might be the Avobenzone found in so many of the new facial creams that is reacting with the high iron content in our well water.  </li>
      <li>However, this one seems like once you accidentally rub off a bit, you are literally starting to tear off a layer of significant surface area.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled to find VISIBLY FIRM for sale online!</li>
      <li>Following application, the skin feels soft, smooth to the touch, and well-hydrated.  </li>
      <li>And it really works for all types of skin, even very sensitive.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Since I love my skin I decided to spoil it a little bit, and guess what?</li>
      <li>It a wonderful product -  too bad</li>
      <li>I have trouble with oily skin and acne and this sunscreen is the first one that I&#x27;ve really liked in a long time -</li>
      <li>- i use it every day as i live in tropics</li>
      <li>/&gt;Based on the above, and other information from reputable sources, I decided to try using [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this face lotion and didn&#x27;t work for me, I have combination fair skin ,first signs or aging and thie lotion didn&#x27;t do anything, I knoe there&#x27;s no magic lotions but the appereance of skin didn&#x27;t improve also it leaves like a heavy film on the skin, also tried he serum and didn&#x27;t like it either ,</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t long before it was also no longer available locally, so I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Restoratives Skin Renewal Moisture with Helioplex.  </li>
      <li>I have only a couple little wrinkles, but this product somehow made them deeper and more visible.</li>
      <li>When it was no longer available in my area I discovered that Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Intensives Firming Moisture had the same ingredients, minus the copper, so I started using it.  </li>
      <li>I use this product a couple times a week, not everyday.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, or exacerbate my seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin silky soft.</li>
      <li>think that Visibly Firm moisturizes much better than Regenerist serum, the product I was using prior to trying this one.</li>
      <li>It feels weird and it smells not so good.  </li>
      <li>but i can live with that for the other positive benefits</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t rate things so low...</li>
      <li>Not sure how concentrated or effective the Active Copper is.</li>
      <li>I love Neugrogena Visibly Firm Face Lotion because of the ZINC OXIDE, which   keeps my skin young, heals acne and other imperfections, firms my skin,   and blocks the sun without a lot of chemicals which my skin cannot take.   </li>
      <li>I even called Neutrogena to ask if they have a new product that is similar, but no one seems to know anything about it</li>
      <li>The major problem is that there&#x27;s a layer of film which can literally be peeled off like a layer after you apply on your face for about a couple hours.  </li>
      <li>Most physical sunscreens form a layer of white film, but they are usually rubbed off bit by bit as you touch your face, etc.  </li>
      <li>and this cream firms like no other.</li>
      <li>It barely has a scent.</li>
      <li>However, apparently all is not lost.</li>
      <li>I started using Neutrogena&#x27;s Visibly Firm when it first came out.  </li>
      <li>My pores/lines are less noticable, the skin is much smoother &amp; firmer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this blue lotion for many years.  It a wonderful product -  too bad Neutrogena has discontinued it!!  It goes on like velvet and improves the condition of your skin.  Also, it contains a SPF rating of 20, so it is perfect to wear under makeup daily.  This lotion does not cause breakouts either.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> the active cooper percentage is REALLY low and it really doesn&#x27;t make any difference. SPF 20 doesn&#x27;t really help that much... and I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using it for about 5 months. It feels weird and it smells not so good.  I normally don&#x27;t rate things so low... but this time I had no choice.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with oily skin and acne and this sunscreen is the first one that I&#x27;ve really liked in a long time - it&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and you can see improvement in skin texture.  ...</li>
    <li> I was just walking by the Neutrogena section in Rite Aid and saw Neutrogena Visibly Firm Face Lotion SPF 20. Since I love my skin I decided to spoil it a little bit, and guess what? It worked. It protects my skin from the sun and also moisturizes it. It barely has a scent. It&#x27;s also very gently and creamy and easy to apply. I can apply it in the morning and not worry about my face until night, because it lasts a long time, almost all day long. It&#x27;s not as expensive as other store brands. And it really works for all types of skin, even very sensitive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This face lotion has been up to its worth so far. It has not done any miracles on my face but it feels very good on skin, and merges nicely. Good for oily skins! I have bought other face lotion from same company otherwise I would have purchased this one again.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t know for what reason Neutrogena people decided to give such an irritating design to the bottle! When last 10% of face lotion is left you literally have to shake the lotion down, or scrap from inside (which is no fun I tell you!) This is the ONLY reason I omitted another star from it. If this reason doesn&#x27;t look to you as big deal, I would say you gotta try this product!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for about four years now. It is a light lotion (critical for oily skin) and has a nice light scent. It works well and I don&#x27;t feel like it is blanketing my face in heavy goo. I don&#x27;t know how well it actually removes wrinkles but here in Florida you need sun block every day and this is a great lotion for that.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it was a face lotion more than anything. My skin is normal, not too dry, not oily and loved this product. I used it for years now and I can&#x27;t find it anymore.. I miss it. I wish I can find it somewhere..</li>
    <li> I have been using Visibly Firm lotion for at least 5 years; it is the only moisturizer that isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy on my face. It also has the perfect amount of sunscreen. Suddenly, Neutrogena has stopped making it and have not replaced it with anything comparable!    I even called Neutrogena to ask if they have a new product that is similar, but no one seems to know anything about it or when it will be replaced or back on the market. The lady I spoke with did tell me my local K-Mart might have some left. If they do I will have to buy it all!    Now I have to find another light moisturizer with sunscreen that won&#x27;t clog my pores. Neutrogena has lost a faithful customer. Sad.</li>
    <li> Update, January 2011:  I still love this product, but the price has more than doubled since I first purchased it.  I am very disappointed in Neutrogena for indulging what appears to be price-gouging practices. However, apparently all is not lost. Fellow Amazon shopper City Girl says:  \\&quot;Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Intensives Firming Moisture, SPF 20 with active copper, has the same ingredients as the Visibly Firm Lotion.\\&quot;  That&#x27;s music to my ears...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially purchased this product because it contained copper peptides, and because it is SPF-20.  The Mayo Clinic web page on wrinkle creams states that, \\&quot;The effectiveness of anti-wrinkle creams depends in part on the active ingredient or ingredients. Here are some common ingredients that may result in slight to modest improvements in wrinkles: Retinol, Hydroxy acids, Coenzyme Q10, Copper peptides, Kinetin, Tea extracts.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the above, and other information from reputable sources, I decided to try using [[ASIN:B000KKV3W4 Retinol Cream (Vitamin A 200,000 Iu Per Jar) - 2 Oz]] as a night cream, and this product as a day cream.  I wash my face in the morning to remove the traces of retinol, and apply the Visibly Firm face lotion. (DO NOT apply to your eyelids - if the lotion gets in your eyes, it will burn like crazy!) Even though it does contain zinc oxide, it does not look chalky or pasty on the skin. Following application, the skin feels soft, smooth to the touch, and well-hydrated.  The first couple of times that I used it, I noticed a tingly feeling on my face, but that quickly went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this combination of products for over two months, and am very pleased with the results.  My skin looks better than it has in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that Visibly Firm moisturizes much better than Regenerist serum, the product I was using prior to trying this one. Additionally, I am typically out in the sun quite a bit on the weekends.  I have not experienced any sunburn on my face at all when using this product, and I burn quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I make my next order, I will be signing up for subscribe-and-save, as I intend to keep using this product for a long long time.unburn on my face at all when using this product, and I burn quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I make my next order, I will be signing up for subscribe-and-save, as I intend to keep using this product for a long long time.</li>
    <li> The product I was using was discontinued, so I thought I would try this product.  I loved it, and it was very close in formula to the one that was discontinued. This is a great moisturizing cream. It is not greasy and dissolves very quickly into your skin.  Hopefully I will be able to get more when I need it.</li>
    <li> Tried this for about 3 weeks and finally stopped using it because it was making my wrinkles WORSE. I have only a couple little wrinkles, but this product somehow made them deeper and more visible. I have stopped using it for about 2 weeks now, and they have gone back to where they were before I started using.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great.  The fact tht is has spf 20 is a real bonus.  It makes my skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, or exacerbate my seborrheic dermatitis. Not sure how concentrated or effective the Active Copper is. I think it gives me a slight white or lighter tint, but I actually like that.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion every day after my shower.  It provides sun protection, has skin firming properties, and isn&#x27;t too greasy.  The one problem is that there are occasional clumps.  I use 3 pumps of lotion a day and about every 5th pump has a solid clump that has to be removed (i.e., not quite daily but often enough to be a nuisance).</li>
    <li> I started using Neutrogena&#x27;s Visibly Firm when it first came out.  After a few months of using it complete strangers would come up to me and comment on my beautiful complexion.  That had never happened before.  I loved the way it felt on my skin and it was a price I could afford.  When it was no longer available in my area I discovered that Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Intensives Firming Moisture had the same ingredients, minus the copper, so I started using it.  I didn&#x27;t like it quite as well, but it was acceptable.  It wasn&#x27;t long before it was also no longer available locally, so I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Restoratives Skin Renewal Moisture with Helioplex.  The white hair that frames my face is now orange as was the neck of the white turtle neck sweater I wore soon after using the cream for the first time.  I had experienced the discoloration of clothing once before when trying Neutrogena&#x27;s sun screen, so I called the company to try and find out just exactly what ingredient in their products was causing my problem.  They refunded some money, but gave me no answers.  After researching it on the internet I find that it might be the Avobenzone found in so many of the new facial creams that is reacting with the high iron content in our well water.  I am thrilled to find VISIBLY FIRM for sale online! It does what it is supposed to without ruining my hair and clothes.</li>
    <li> This product Visibly Firm Face Lotion with active copper is not available in my area so I was happy to find it at Amazon.com. The shipment arrived well packed and in a timely fashion. I will be ordering additional items. I am the wife of Lawrence Barrett, and the one using the face cream! We do share our e-mail account however,which is in his name ... but not the face lotion!</li>
    <li> no breakouts....which i tend to get.  my skin is moisturized (not greasy....I have oily skin) and it really smooths out my skin.</li>
    <li> I noticed instantly my skin was less oily during the day.  My pores/lines are less noticable, the skin is much smoother &amp; firmer.  I don&#x27;t have any problems going without foundation entirely for everyday purposes, and I am a 51 year old grandmother. The spf 20 is a bonus. It pays to shop around online for the cheapest price and buy in quantity.  I use this product a couple times a week, not everyday. I am thrilled with the results.</li>
    <li> I love Neugrogena Visibly Firm Face Lotion because of the ZINC OXIDE, which   keeps my skin young, heals acne and other imperfections, firms my skin,   and blocks the sun without a lot of chemicals which my skin cannot take.   I have used Zinc based products since my 20&#x27;s when I had a bit of acne.    It is ZINC that I credit for having kept my skin beautiful, despite my age &#x3D; 58 !    People always ask how I do it, and I tell them I use Lancome&#x27;s Pure Focus toner w/Zinc, Neutrogena Visibly Firm Face lotion w/Zinc, and Merle Norman&#x27;s Auqa Base make-up with Zinc  ...     Unfortunately Neutrogena&#x27;s Visibly Firm has been discontinued !!!!!   If anyone knows another facial lotion with Zinc Oxide, please let me know !!</li>
    <li> I love this product but the Safety Seal on the box and the dispenser on the bottle was also dampered with so I emailed and informed them of that&lt;br /&gt;sent me another.  Unfortunately that Safety Seal on the box was also broken but the dispenser did not appear to be dampered with so I&#x27;m throwing caution to the wind and keep it.  Hopefully my face will not fall off.  :)</li>
    <li> Discontinued item and my pet peeve is sellers take advantage of that fact....</li>
    <li> I tried this because I read somewhere that copper peptides are good for your skin. I don&#x27;t know about the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; aspect, but I like how gentle it feels on my skin, it absorbs well, and my face looks dewy and even toned as a result. The copper peptides provide healing properties and calm irritations. I like the feel and consistency of this lotion. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had to stop buying this magnificent cream because the price became prohibitive, but after wasting my money on other products I went back to it. Sagging is worse than wrinkles, although I do not have sagging skin. and this cream firms like no other. I&#x27;ll sacrifice other things just to buy this wonderful cream.</li>
    <li> The major problem is that there&#x27;s a layer of film which can literally be peeled off like a layer after you apply on your face for about a couple hours.  Most physical sunscreens form a layer of white film, but they are usually rubbed off bit by bit as you touch your face, etc.  However, this one seems like once you accidentally rub off a bit, you are literally starting to tear off a layer of significant surface area.</li>
    <li> the product was delivered quickly and it works well - i use it every day as i live in tropics and I  see a visible difference after in 1 week of use in condition of my skin &lt;br /&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;I am glad i got this product - the one downside is that my eyes burn towards the end of the day but i can live with that for the other positive benefits</li>
    <li> I really loved this moisturizer and had read that active copper was the best for anti-aging.  I am so disappointed that Neutrogena has discontinued it.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen always seems to make moisturizer stay on the top of my skin instead of sinking in to work as it should.  This was no different.</li>
    <li> I started using this the day I received it, and I could tell a difference in just 4 days!!  I was looking for something with the active copper and something to firm up the skin around my mouth.  It&#x27;s a wonderful creation!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this face lotion and didn&#x27;t work for me, I have combination fair skin ,first signs or aging and thie lotion didn&#x27;t do anything, I knoe there&#x27;s no magic lotions but the appereance of skin didn&#x27;t improve also it leaves like a heavy film on the skin, also tried he serum and didn&#x27;t like it either , may be it works for other types of skin.</li>
    <li> I wish I knew why Neutrogena stopped making this. I use—and care about—very few facial products. Sadly, this is one of them.</li>
    <li> does anyone know if they discontinued this product? I have a tough time finding it.  I used to love it and made my skin smooth, not needing foundation either.</li>
    <li> This is the best face lotion I have ever used! It has no fragrance and feels so good on your face. It works!</li>
