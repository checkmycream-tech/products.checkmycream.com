      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>These are some of my favorite razors out there!</li>
      <li>It gives you a nice trim, for these who gets razor bumbs, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore because the blades doesn&#x27;t cut so close to the skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice concept</li>
      <li>It trims nicely, and then I go over the edges with the blade to get that bikini tip.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a kind of comb with a razor underneath meant to trim (let&#x27;s be honest) the bush.</li>
      <li>cool colors and portable which makes this a great bargain.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE!</li>
      <li>Bic Soleil Shave and Trim Shaver has a good handle that fits comfortably in my hand.</li>
      <li>Great design, useful idea.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall though I am pleased and find this shaver excellent for shaving, leaving no skin burn, stubble bumps and my sensitive skin has not reacted to anything on it.</li>
      <li>Very easy and safe to use.</li>
      <li>;  I concur that her skin is very smooth, no areas of leg stubble found.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice, multi-blade shaver with a moisturizing strip; and the tilting head moves over the curves of the leg and underarm easily.  </li>
      <li>I love this razor.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve got, it does the job, but there are definitely better disposables out there.</li>
      <li>Worked ok.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product, because I love the protection from the guard; no nicks and/or cuts and you get a close shave.</li>
      <li>The Venus bikini trimmers were a better value.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s face it, many of us like a well trimmed bush.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve never been one to toy with the hair &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; so the trimmer had more to reckon with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The interesting part is the product can also be used as a trimmer.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did,</li>
      <li>But to be able to slide it off then shave your legs, etc</li>
      <li>Works very well, great product.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on an electric trimmer or aren&#x27;t sure if you want to spruce things up, the Bic Soleil Shave and Trim Shaver is an inexpensive way to try it out.</li>
      <li>These are my favorite razors.</li>
      <li>I think this would be great for travel and will probably keep one of these on hand for that very purpose.</li>
      <li>so could just be my sensitive skin, plus i didnt have any problems with razor burn when shaving my legs, so that&#x27;s a good thing!  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the Bic Soleil products in general, as they all are great!</li>
      <li>This Bic Shave &amp; Trim is a pretty good idea.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perhaps not the most perfect solution, but it is very close to it and for quite a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Easy, convenient, love.</li>
      <li>Ideally I would use an electric dry trimmer and a better razor.</li>
      <li>With bikini season right around the corner, I was thrilled to review this product.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>The Bic Soleil Shave and Trim Shaver is an all-in-one easy shaver to use.</li>
      <li>The plastic guide slides on over the razor head and is removable for easy cleaning.</li>
      <li>And the trimmer attachment is easy to attach and use.</li>
      <li>its easy to use and its affordable.  </li>
      <li>The trimmer attachment is extremely easy to use.</li>
      <li>It did however make setting a length of shave easy and effortless.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After I was done shaving my legs (and it did a fine job)</li>
      <li>The razors themselves are fine though, my preference is non-pivot head.</li>
      <li>I found it comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>These are perfectly fine.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a huge plus for me too.</li>
      <li>The trimmer on this thing is FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>The razors give you a smooth, comfortable shave and the attachment</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re traveling for summer vacation or spring break this is a great razor to throw in your suitcase because it&#x27;s essentially a two-in-one tool.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned several Bic razors before and never have experienced a problem.</li>
      <li>The snap on trim attachment is what makes this razor unique.  </li>
      <li>I had to repeatedly take off the attachment and clean it out since it gets clogged with hairs fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>you have to shave in a linear fashion and that just doesn&#x27;t work on an area full of peaks and valleys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shape fits nicely in the hand and works well with the natural curve of the leg.</li>
      <li>First off, as others have pointed out, I think the pricing on this is a bit much for just 3 razors and one plastic trim head, but it does do a pretty darn good job of shaving and trimming.  </li>
      <li>a razor, the Bic Soleil Shave and Trim is adequate, if overpriced.</li>
      <li>I bought this from my corner Walgreens because I needed something quick.  </li>
      <li>The included trimmer isn&#x27;t that great, not worth the price.</li>
      <li>the bic soleil shave and trim is my favorite new product</li>
      <li>#34;The razors really cut close and leave my legs smooth.  </li>
      <li>Still, would be nice to have different length options</li>
      <li>The 1/4&amp;#34; clearance keeps you from shaving too close and gives a nice all-over short look - no strays here!</li>
      <li>It gives a good, close shave without nicks and cuts that can result with some other shavers.  </li>
      <li>They trim right to the skin.</li>
      <li>and the trimmer slips right on.</li>
      <li>These are much easier to clean after use, stay sharp longer, and have a good lubricating strip on them.  </li>
      <li>The guard is great for keeping it really short without going bare and getting ingrowns.</li>
      <li>This is a great little number to throw in your travel bag since it does the work of two tools!</li>
      <li>The price is also very reasonable because there are four razors in each package.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is about disposable razors, but I just find them to be exactly what you pay for- cheap abuse of your sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>The razors themselves are your basic Bic disposables -- nothing outstanding, but they get the job done.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to go over the same spot more than once.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this razor. It&#x27;s perfect for maintaining your lady garden...highly recommend. Very easy and safe to use.</li>
    <li> this product works great!  its easy to use and its affordable.  the bic soleil shave and trim is my favorite new product</li>
    <li> These are some of my favorite razors out there! They trim right to the skin. and I&#x27;ve never cut myself with one of these. I am a huge fan of the Bic Soleil products in general, as they all are great!</li>
    <li> Easy, convenient, love. Wish I could find these more easily- not in grocery stores anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to keep your bikini area, er, under control. The razors give you a smooth, comfortable shave and the attachment makes trimming so much easier. Definitely a step up from trying to handle a comb and scissors down there for an even trim. It&#x27;s perhaps not the most perfect solution, but it is very close to it and for quite a reasonable price. I tried it on a whim and am glad I did; I will definitely be buying a new pack when this one runs out. On a side note, Amazon is the cheapest place I&#x27;ve found to buy them so far, if you&#x27;re interested in price comparing.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my wife to use and review and she loved it.  She stated that it was a close shave with no nicks and cuts.  She especially enjoyed the trimmer attachment because it did its job nicely with no problems.  She’s very happy with it. A happy wife is a happy life.</li>
    <li> The razors themselves are fine though, my preference is non-pivot head. This is over-priced for the fact that it comes with just three razors and one bikini trimmer that slides over each razor head. The included trimmer isn&#x27;t that great, not worth the price. If you like Soleil, you should just buy the usual package. If you buy this, I suppose you could use the plastic trimmer on other Soleil razors. I don&#x27;t have any others to try this. Good concept, not great execution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a big fan of disposable razors, simply because they are usually quite cheap and in my opinion don&#x27;t hold up to the quality of a razor with replaceable cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bic Soleil Shave and Trim Shaver has a good handle that fits comfortably in my hand. You get 4 shavers and a Bikini trimmer attachment, which you slide over the razor when you want to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; the bikini area area removing all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice concept and you can use it just when you need to, taking it off when you shave other areas. I didn&#x27;t use that item too much for the fact that it is not needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the closeness of the shave, I was pretty impressed on how well it worked without any nicks or cuts to my legs. It has a small strip of aloe at the top and there are 3 blades, which is ok for a decent shave.  I have had them a while and only just switched out to the second razor, so they last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall , a fair price for 3 disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really torn on how to review this.  I&#x27;ve used Bic Soleil razors for years and been very happy with them as razors.  I was looking forward to the &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; option, but was let down when I realized all that was a single snap on piece of plastic (one per pack of 3 razors) which really didn&#x27;t do much, but raised the price of the razors significantly.  I hate to rate the whole package down because I do like the razors (which are exactly the same as the standard Bic Soleil with an added little metal piece to assist with the snapping on of the trimmer), but the main reason for purchasing this product as opposed to something else would be for the trim option.  So, in the end, I dinged it one star because I didn&#x27;t feel like the trim option really worked well and caused the price to increase way too much for what it actually is.</li>
    <li> Worked ok. Has one removable bikini trimmer that can be put on the razors in package. It wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for. The Venus bikini trimmers were a better value.</li>
    <li> What a clever idea. Remember to slide the covers off rather than flip them off as is often the case. 3 shavers plus 1 trimmer. Small parts. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> With bikini season right around the corner, I was thrilled to review this product.  I typically use Nair or get waxed in the bikini area so as to avoid the dreaded red bumps in that area.  This is one product I will definitely use in between the above mentioned and I can already see that the red bumps are in the past for me IF i use this Bic Soleil Shave And Trim Shaver.  It&#x27;s easy to use by simply sliding the &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; attachment on.  The 1/4&amp;#34; clearance keeps you from shaving too close and gives a nice all-over short look - no strays here!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, multi-blade shaver with a moisturizing strip; and the tilting head moves over the curves of the leg and underarm easily.  The added trimmer is a plastic length guard that I found to be of little value; but depending on the type of trimming desired, it might serve a purpose.  It seemed that the trimmer left the  hair too long for a bikini trim; but not completely shaved.  I would certainly use the razors again, but probably not the trimmer guard.</li>
    <li> This is a great little number to throw in your travel bag since it does the work of two tools! The blade is sharp and well protected. The trimmer attachment is extremely easy to use. The shape fits nicely in the hand and works well with the natural curve of the leg. My only gripe, and it wasn&#x27;t important enough to take off a start, is that the handle is too thick for it to fit in the safely razor notch on my shower organizer.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. great grip.  cool colors and portable which makes this a great bargain. no nicks or cuts. and the trimmer slips right on.</li>
    <li> Great design, useful idea.  Would recommend.  I think Venus has something like this too, with the bikini shaver.  That&#x27;s great as well.  Wish the razor prices weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> The first razor out of the package felt as though it was dull from the very first swipe. These are intended to trim the lady bits -- the package comes with three razors and a separate trimmer attachment -- but I used it on my legs first, because nothing goes near the bits until I test it out first. I&#x27;m glad I did, because the conditioning strip did nothing, just felt like a piece of dry cardboard, and the razors were dull. It was irritating and uncomfortable right out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the second and third razors were better, so I&#x27;m thinking there&#x27;s a quality control issue here. It only lasted one shave on the legs, though, when most razors last two, sometimes three on the higher-quality disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came time to try the trimmer attachment. It&#x27;s a kind of comb with a razor underneath meant to trim (let&#x27;s be honest) the bush. It looks very similar in shape to the attachment on the electric razor I usually use. One swipe of this Bic attachment and it was clogged. Cleaned it off, did a second swipe, and it was dull enough I didn&#x27;t want to use it anymore, so I used a third swipe to &amp;#34;even things out&amp;#34; and moved on with my life. I&#x27;d say that this said more about the hair on my bod than the razors, but other brands have worked just fine, and I see other reviewers had similar issues, so I&#x27;m thinking the razor is the issue in this particular situation. I really cannot recommend these razors at all.</li>
    <li> There is not a lot of difference between this razor and other name brand disposable razors out there. The interesting part is the product can also be used as a trimmer. While it can do the trimming job, it&#x27;s not very good at it. Overall, I would pass this up as a trimmer and just use it with the expectations of a disposable razon and not a trimmer. Ideally I would use an electric dry trimmer and a better razor.</li>
    <li> We own a Panasonic bikini trimmer, which is good for getting hair down to a certain length but then becomes uncomfortable and a a little dangerous when the guard is removed. This product (disposable body hair trimmer and a guard) can produce a closer shave. Especially good for traveling, and unlike the Panasonic trimmer can be used in the shower.</li>
    <li> First off, as others have pointed out, I think the pricing on this is a bit much for just 3 razors and one plastic trim head, but it does do a pretty darn good job of shaving and trimming.  I was somewhat reluctant to try the trimmer, thinking that it might pull the hair, but was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the blades are and how easily it trimmed.  Still, would be nice to have different length options but this seems to work pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of the Gillette Daisy razors, and I always end up going back to them as they have always been great little shavers at a reasonable price (around $7 for 10 razors).  usually when I try a new type of razor I get cuts or razor burn. So I wasn&#x27;t too surprised when I had a little bit of razor burn near the bikini line after shaving with one of these Soleil razors.  It was minor so could just be my sensitive skin, plus i didnt have any problems with razor burn when shaving my legs, so that&#x27;s a good thing!  I&#x27;m still not convinced this is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; product for me, but I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it works as advertised and it&#x27;s convenient to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and by the way, I notice the description says this is &amp;#34;4 count&amp;#34; but there are only 3 razors in the package.  I assume they are counting the plastic trimmer head as the 4th item.  The trimmer head is designed to be used on all 3 of the razors.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, many of us like a well trimmed bush. No one wants to admit it, and no one wants to see the words &amp;#34;pubes trimmer&amp;#34; on the packaging, but that&#x27;s what the attachment on this shaver is for - your downstairs lady garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works well, as it should. I&#x27;ve owned several Bic razors before and never have experienced a problem. These have a nice big handle are are PINK, so you you know they&#x27;re meant for the ladies. ;) Wink wink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I was done shaving my legs (and it did a fine job), I thought I&#x27;d try out the &amp;#34;hedge trimmer&amp;#34;. I put on the attachment and went to work. It does instead &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34;...but I use that term loosely as it&#x27;s really hard to get a good, even length down there with this thing. There are just some areas of your lady garden that are going to be hard to go over with something that isn&#x27;t flexible. I had to repeatedly take off the attachment and clean it out since it gets clogged with hairs fairly quickly. It was quite a mess! I did eventually get the job done, but it&#x27;s uneven and using the attachment was a hassle. Unlike an electric trimmer, you can&#x27;t really pivot and dart in an out with this thing... you have to shave in a linear fashion and that just doesn&#x27;t work on an area full of peaks and valleys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like a well-maintained bush, this is not the product for you. I would not recommend this razor for that aspect. Now, if you want a regular leg shaver, this will get the job done.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife to try out, and as far as the razor goes, it works about as you would expect. It gives a decent shave, although right out of the package the blade seemed to be a bit on the dull side (the other included blades ended up being noticeably better). If it&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve got, it does the job, but there are definitely better disposables out there. That an $8 (MSRP) razor comes with dull blades was on the disappointing side and didn&#x27;t exactly inspire confidence that &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; would be any better. It wasn&#x27;t, and basically the blade dulled very quickly while the trimmer guard is clogged, requiring constant cleaning. My wife really didn&#x27;t seem to like the experience and even went so far as to say that it just &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a razor, the Bic Soleil Shave and Trim is adequate, if overpriced. As a trimmer, it seems to fail miserably and just doesn&#x27;t give you the kind of control you need around sensitive areas to actually do a good job. If you couple that with a dull blade (which some of them are), then you&#x27;re looking at disappointment and a product that accomplishes exactly the opposite of what is advertised.</li>
    <li> Y&#x27;all ladies know how frustrating it is trying to shave your pub with a razor. Not only that we have to deal with razor cut and, razor bumbs, we also have to deal with hair being stuck between the blades. The whole process just take forever and we don&#x27;t even get the result we want. Well your frustrating days are over. This product works great! It gives you a nice trim, for these who gets razor bumbs, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore because the blades doesn&#x27;t cut so close to the skin. It trims nicely, and then I go over the edges with the blade to get that bikini tip. I also go over it LIGHTLY to trim it down lower. I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;But I have to tell you, your pub has to be a certain length for it to work properly.</li>
    <li> Love these! The guard is great for keeping it really short without going bare and getting ingrowns. So happy I discoved these but they are sometimes hard to find in stores. Awesome that I can order them online :)</li>
    <li> The snap on trim attachment is what makes this razor unique.  Its very similar to what a barber uses on an electric head shaver.  But other than that its just another razor.  The wife was happy to try this out.</li>
    <li> I often compare razors to the cheap pink Bic disposables, since those were my go to for years. These are much easier to clean after use, stay sharp longer, and have a good lubricating strip on them.  Overall, would consider buying these in future.</li>
    <li> The trimming part that comes with this doesn&#x27;t really work, I think you have to have really long hair for it to catch anything and just the regular razor is every irritating.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my corner Walgreens because I needed something quick.  This trims my bikini area with no issues.  Very easy to use in the shower!  I will keep this on hand year-round because I preferred to be trimmed.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product, because I love the protection from the guard; no nicks and/or cuts and you get a close shave.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking forward to a trimmer. Anyone expecting results close to an electric one will be a bit disappointed but it&#x27;s close enough to work just well</li>
    <li> I have used Bic razors many times, &amp; they are usually very good quality. The price is also very reasonable because there are four razors in each package.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about disposable razors, but I just find them to be exactly what you pay for- cheap abuse of your sensitive skin. Unfortunately, these Bic disposables are no different than any other disposable razor. It gave me horrendous and painful razor burn, and still somehow managed to leave behind stubble. How does that happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is what intrigued me about these razors. It is a plastic piece that slides over the existing razor head. It has a guard and a blade inside, and you must drag it against the grain to truly trim your bikini line. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as an electric trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t do a bad job at all! In fact, if you like to landscape a bit without getting too carried away, this trimmer is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this package because of the razors themselves. They really aren&#x27;t any better than any other disposable razor brand- quite awful in comparison to the other of doing things with your razor and replaceable blades!</li>
    <li> The Bic Soleil Shave and Trim Shaver is an all-in-one easy shaver to use. The attachments slide over each other so you do not have to remove the other blade head before using the trimmer. However, I still fear for my fingers because water, shaving lotion and the shower and I can never cooperate. And I know I am not the only one. So while this shaver eliminates my usual two chances of slicing my fingers by allowing for the trimmer attachment to slide right over the shaver blades, the danger remains in doing just that -- sliding the trimer attachment over the actual blades you use to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is a little harder to clean out quickly if you wait to shave and the hairs are longer than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though I am pleased and find this shaver excellent for shaving, leaving no skin burn, stubble bumps and my sensitive skin has not reacted to anything on it. That&#x27;s a huge plus for me too.</li>
    <li> I got this set for my wife so she&#x27;s probably the best judge.  She said &amp;#34;The razors really cut close and leave my legs smooth.  I really like the way it feels.&amp;#34;  I concur that her skin is very smooth, no areas of leg stubble found.  The &amp;#34;private trim&amp;#34; works but might need someone to help out for that delicate touch.  If you&#x27;re doing all the trimming on yourself then it might not matter.  These are perfectly fine.  But for the really close shave in sensitive areas you&#x27;ll need a friend to inspect &amp; cut the lawn.  I found the razors wonderful to use for that.</li>
    <li> Works very well, great product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> So I bought this razor at a big chain drug store for much more and just used and felt compelled to write a review on here because I checked on here before buying it. I have a very sensitive bikini area and shaving down too low really irritates me. The trimmer on this thing is FANTASTIC. I would seriously buy it just for that. But to be able to slide it off then shave your legs, etc... is awesome. Its taken me the longest time to find the perfect razor and now I think I have found it. It does &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; pretty low. But not low enough to irritate your skin. LOVE LOVE! If you are looking for a great razor do not hesitate to get this. Btw this is on prime and its MUCH cheaper then in the drugstore, so that&#x27;s pretty much a no brainer. I&#x27;m definitely buying my next pack on here.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this as much as Venus. It doesn&#x27;t make things as even as the Venus so I ended up shaving waaaay shorter than I wanted. Like almost bald.</li>
    <li> In the package you get 3 shavers and 1 &amp;#34;trim shaver.&amp;#34; The shavers are same as other BIC Soleil&#x27;s that I have, so I already know that I really like them. The trim shaver is just a waste to me. #1 I&#x27;m not saving it for a month to use with the other shavers in the package. And #2 I like a close shave, so this is pointless to me. Overall maybe it would be right for someone traveling, in that they could upkeep themselves, but I am not sure that it would be worth the money to purchase this every month. It is not something that would work for me and I threw out the trim shaver.</li>
    <li> This Bic Shave &amp; Trim is a pretty good idea. I like the convenience of having one device act as razor and trimmer; everything can be taken care of in the shower at one time, and it&#x27;s much less messy than using a conventional trimmer would be. The razors themselves are your basic Bic disposables -- nothing outstanding, but they get the job done. And the trimmer attachment is easy to attach and use. My only problem with it is that it is so tiny that I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to lose it in the shower one of these mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging to this product says &amp;#34;4 count,&amp;#34; but that is a little misleading. The package contains three razors and one trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, I&#x27;m not completely blown away by this product, but it definitely works. I think this would be great for travel and will probably keep one of these on hand for that very purpose.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between this product and other shavers that I have used.  I probably would only specifically look for this shaver if I had a coupon for it and it was on sail. This is not a product that I simply must have compared to others.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re traveling for summer vacation or spring break this is a great razor to throw in your suitcase because it&#x27;s essentially a two-in-one tool. The Bic Soleil razors are just as sharp as any other disposable razors I&#x27;ve used (altho&#x27; to be honest I do still prefer the Schick Quattro disposable razors) and the trimmer attachment is extremely easy to use. The plastic guide slides on over the razor head and is removable for easy cleaning. If you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on an electric trimmer or aren&#x27;t sure if you want to spruce things up, the Bic Soleil Shave and Trim Shaver is an inexpensive way to try it out.</li>
    <li> Frankly, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between this and comparable products. This comes with a bikini trimmer that I only used once for the sake of this review and probably won&#x27;t use again. However, both the razor offered a close shave and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to go over the same spot more than once. The trimmer....nope. I think the curves of a woman&#x27;s crotch area are too complex for a trimmer that accompanies disposable razors. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve never been one to toy with the hair &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; so the trimmer had more to reckon with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that gave me the most issue was the plastic cover on the blade; getting it off was harder than it should have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, unless you are the type that pays attention to your bikini area enough to want it trimmed regularly, I&#x27;d skip the premium and just stick with the standard Bic Soleil Twilight razors.</li>
    <li> I like the Bic Soleil Shave and trim Shaver.  It gives a good, close shave without nicks and cuts that can result with some other shavers.  I found it comfortable and easy to use.  I tried the bikini attachment.  It was okay, but unnecessary for my use.  It did however make setting a length of shave easy and effortless.  There was no need to go over the same areas multiple times and I found it very good for a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Not really a lot to say about the razors.  They shave close and work as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only drawback I will mention is I don&#x27;t care for the smooth handle.  It&#x27;s rigid on one side and the other is smooth as glass plastic - when you have soap or suds mixed with that handle and a sharp blade, well it&#x27;s hard to handle which left me with a more than a few nicks.</li>
    <li> The razors were good but the single attachment to trim didn&#x27;t work as well as others I have used in the past. I ended up giving up on the trimmer and just using the razors.</li>
    <li> I received this before its anticipated time.  These are my favorite razors.</li>
