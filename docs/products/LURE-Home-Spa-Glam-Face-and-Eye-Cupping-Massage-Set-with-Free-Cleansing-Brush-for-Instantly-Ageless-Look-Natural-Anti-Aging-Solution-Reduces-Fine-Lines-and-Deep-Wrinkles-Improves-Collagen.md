      <li>I am sure with continued use</li>
      <li>I love how these Lure cups feel on my face.</li>
      <li>There is a cute scrubbing brush also.</li>
      <li>The size of these cups for the face were perfect - I used the smallest one around the eyes and mouth, and the larger one on the cheek, neck and forehead.</li>
      <li>I worked in a salon for many years as a manicurist.</li>
      <li>I also love that you can use this product on stretch marks  to increase blood flow and lessen it&#x27;s appearance.</li>
      <li>Very friendly and prompt customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First of all, let me say that I&#x27;m an esthetician, so was looking for something that did more than just felt good - the science and benefits had to be there as well.  </li>
      <li>I apply rosehip oil, before cupping, as it makes the cups glide on my skin more easily.</li>
      <li>It feels wonderful on my skin and gets into my pores for a deep clean.</li>
      <li>This is one of the easiest products to use that not only produces results but feels sooo good!</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re so easy to work with</li>

      <li>If you use this Face Cupping kit 5 minutes, every day, over time you can see a permanent reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>My skin looked and felt immediately radiant and fine lines looked filled in.</li>
      <li>I have tried it with my moisturizer as well and get the same great results.</li>
      <li>this is a great product for my physical therapy plus the ladies in our home use it for circulation and&lt;br /&gt;cosmetic use.</li>
      <li>The different size cups are great.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy seeing immediate results.</li>
      <li>and this product is perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to use chemicals or harsh procedures.  </li>
      <li>I’ll get fantastic results.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to those who would like to treat yourself with enjoyable massage at home.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
      <li>Perfect gift for the upcoming holidays as well as for anyone who loves beauty, massages or just wants to feel a little bit more relaxed and pampered.</li>
      <li>The small cup is perfect for around the eyes.</li>
      <li>Fun to pamper myself and take care of my skin!</li>
      <li>Love this so much!</li>
      <li>Best money spent and very highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I use them with my moisturizer and nighttime cleaning routine (love the free facial brush for cleaning and exfoliating the company included in this kit) to promote healthy skin tone and tighten and prevent wrinkles on my face.</li>
      <li>I like the continuous cupping better, but both ways work very well.</li>
      <li>Honestly I think the massage cups alone deserve 5 stars because they are so simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>You need to be very consistent, persistent and patient for this product to work.  </li>
      <li>Such a great unexpected useful gift!</li>
      <li>so I was curious to try these silicone massage cups that looked a bit primitive and too good to be true.</li>
      <li>This is a great little tool that someone came up with</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the results and look forward to the long term results.</li>
      <li>Regardless the above is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
      <li>All the oil was absorbed in my skin and the cup slid without an effort.</li>
      <li>I was offered to try these at a deep discount and give my honest opinion</li>
      <li>and I have noticed a definite improvement in my skin which I&#x27;m sure will only get better with more use.</li>
      <li>Loved the other one but will return this set.  </li>
      <li>The facial brush was ok, nothing special.</li>
      <li>You squeeze them to get the right amount of suction and slide them across those darn lines.</li>
      <li>It is an ancient method of skin care but the Lure Face cupping set has a new twist, since the cups are made of silicon and easy to maneuver.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how easy it was to use and once used for an extended period of time I did see results.</li>
      <li>My second set is shaped different an has great suction.</li>
      <li>before I felt like I was getting good cupping, and let me tell you, I am surprised at how this actually works!  </li>
      <li>The smallest one doesn&#x27;t have very much suction.  </li>
      <li>You can definitely see how it brings more blood and circulation to the area you are massaging.</li>
      <li>My first time using a product like this,  </li>
      <li>They come in a pretty satin draw string bag.</li>
      <li>and I can tell my skin looks smoother from the first use of the cups.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just got this in the mail. I am a beauty junkie and thought this would make a great addition to my routine. It comes in a nice silk pouch where you can keep them all organized which is an added plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little hard to use and figure out which size goes in which area of the face. Make sure you are not leaving them on for a long period of time or you may get some circles all over your face (they do go away).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it so I am not sure of long term results. I will update once I have had a chance to really utilize it to its potential.</li>
    <li> I worked in a salon for many years as a manicurist. We had a massage therapist who practiced Cupping. So, while this treatment option wasn&#x27;t new to me, I had never heard of Face Cupping. Cupping is actually an ancient technique that dates back around 5,000 years. It is more widely known and used in Asia and Europe.&lt;br /&gt;Cupping is when local suction is created on the skin. It greatly promotes healing by increasing blood flow to the area. On the face, it works to plump the skin, especially fine lines and wrinkles. It also speeds up the healing of acne. If you use this Face Cupping kit 5 minutes, every day, over time you can see a permanent reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. It can improve your skin tone and the increased blood flow will definitely diminish acne, fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this kit for over a week now. It is a really nice kit that includes:&lt;br /&gt;1 Large Silicone Face Cup&lt;br /&gt;1 Medium Silicone Face Cup&lt;br /&gt;1 Small Silicone Face Cup&lt;br /&gt;1 Silicone Facial Cleansing Brush&lt;br /&gt;Full Directions&lt;br /&gt;Drawstring Storage Pouch&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this kit, overall! I apply rosehip oil, before cupping, as it makes the cups glide on my skin more easily. Squeeze the cup in the middle to create suction and then slide the cup over your face, concentrating on problem areas, until the suction breaks. Then continue to repeat this process until you have treated your entire face and neck. Use the small cup around your lips and eyes. After use, I wash the cups with a mild soap and set them out to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this on wet skin, but I find the oil is more conducive for continuous flow of the cups. There is also a squeeze and release option where you squeeze the cup put it on one area, then release and go to another area. I like the continuous cupping better, but both ways work very well. When I finish my cupping session, I apply my night cream and I am finished. I was fortunate to be able to try this at an amazing promotional price. I am very pleased with the results and look forward to the long term results. The facial scrubbing brush, included with this kit, is just awesome! It feels wonderful on my skin and gets into my pores for a deep clean. It is very soft and has a suction cup base, so I can stick it to the shower wall while I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I just love these cups! High quality silicon, adjustable suction power.Highly recommend to those who would like to treat yourself with enjoyable massage at home.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I took a bath with the massage cups last night and had way too much fun. I am very congested from a cold and using them in my sinus area was a unique experience and helpful for relieving pressure. I have issues with blood pooling under my eyes and making them look tired. I will update on the long term usefulness of these little suction cups as I use them. You can definitely see how it brings more blood and circulation to the area you are massaging.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I&#x27;m open to trying anything non-invasive as far as my beauty routine goes and this product is perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to use chemicals or harsh procedures.  My first experience with cupping massage was at a spa where my esthetician used these silicone cups to massage my face. The sensation was surprisingly very pleasant and relaxing. My skin looked and felt immediately radiant and fine lines looked filled in. To maintain the effect I decided to try this face massager and so happy I did. I chose LURE facial anti-aging kit because it offered 2 different types of massage cups - smaller cups for my delicate eye area to reduce puffiness and a larger cup that I use all over my face. I also love the free face brush for cleaning and exfoliating the company included - nice touch! What can I say? This is one of the easiest products to use that not only produces results but feels sooo good! It sounds weird but it was like a deep tissue massage to my face, a little pressure and tension relief.  After applying my Argan oil to face, jawline and neck, I simply place the cup, squeeze it to produce gentle suction and glide around my face. Anytime. Anywhere! I already bought the bigger version for myself and 2 more of this one as gifts for Christmas.  Such a great unexpected useful gift!</li>
    <li> I purchased these facial cups because my most favorite thing in the world during a facial is the massage which you get in between treatments. I love how these Lure cups feel on my face. It is like getting an expensive massage and toning treatment but in the privacy of my own home and I can indulge every day! I use them with my moisturizer and nighttime cleaning routine (love the free facial brush for cleaning and exfoliating the company included in this kit) to promote healthy skin tone and tighten and prevent wrinkles on my face. Everyone knows how beneficial massage is for you.. and these are great at making you feel relaxed and stress free. This is a great little tool that someone came up with and I love the fact that you can use them in different ways. I encouraged my mom to get a set too and she also loves them for her mature and sensitive skin and crows feet around her eyes. Perfect gift for the upcoming holidays as well as for anyone who loves beauty, massages or just wants to feel a little bit more relaxed and pampered.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say that I&#x27;m an esthetician, so was looking for something that did more than just felt good - the science and benefits had to be there as well.  I was a little skeptical that something used at home could give clinical-type results, but I was surprised!  It took a little while to get the amount of suction right - too much suction left in the same place too long resulted in a slight bruise.  Nothing serious, and it went away in a few days, but had to deal with covering it up.  I expected to see a plumping effect, and can say that it helped in plumping up wrinkles nicely.  But for me, the greatest benefit came from it improving the efficacy of my treatment products.  I am a big believer in using retinol creams, and I immediately noticed the next day that it had increased the depth and efficacy of the retinol cream.  The size of these cups for the face were perfect - I used the smallest one around the eyes and mouth, and the larger one on the cheek, neck and forehead.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this holistic ancient approach these massage cups are very unique big winner this is a great product for my physical therapy plus the ladies in our home use it for circulation and&lt;br /&gt;cosmetic use. Best money spent and very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very easy to handle...Instant results!</li>
    <li> Loving this set from LURE!  It has definitely helped with the circulation of the skin on my face, reduced inflammation from sinus issues and helped minimize wrinkles.  Unlike traditional glass cups - these are flexible and moldable (because they&#x27;re made with silicone), which makes them easy to use, and allows you to control the suction and intensity level.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are expensive.  Work just ok.</li>
    <li> I received NO INSTRUCTIONS!  What do you do with it? I cannot believe a product would be shipped with NO information.</li>
    <li> Try it you&#x27;ll like it......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beauty junky and have every pricey tool/gadget imaginable so I was curious to try these silicone massage cups that looked a bit primitive and too good to be true. I was shocked to discover they truly deliver! Being a good friend that I am I shared with my girlfriends and we are all addicted! The massaging action you feel on your face is nothing you&#x27;ve ever felt or done. You can see and feel it working! My face radiates with pink glow, lines plump up and I see and feel the difference in the skin elasticity and firmness. Thank you LURE for bringing this hidden gem into my life!</li>
    <li> I purchased two Lure sets. Loved the other one but will return this set.  It does not suction well and keeps coming off. However, I really like the other set I purchased by the company.  My second set is shaped different an has great suction.</li>
    <li> Not only is my complexion benefiting from using the cups, but I also feel invigorated.  It also helps keep my sinues clear and lessens the bags and dark circles under my eyes.  It takes a little while to get a technique, but it is well worth the venture.</li>
    <li> Do not leave these suctioned on your face for more then a few seconds. I know, I tried and it left me with broken capillaries in my face that don&#x27;t necessarily resemble bruises or hickeys but tiny red dots that look like a rash. None the less I&#x27;ve been using them for a few minutes each day (the directions recommend 5 minutes) and already I can tell the difference in my pores. My skin is softer and less congested. If you&#x27;ve ever had an esthetician slap your face during a facial, this is the same idea. My sister pays a lot to have acupuncture and cupping and she comes out bruised. This is less evasive and cheaper. A must have in your daily kit of facial torture. Comes with 3 cups, 2 big and 1 small, a satin drawstring case, directions, and a facial brush. The facial brush was ok, nothing special. I received this product at a discount  in exchange for  my honest review.</li>
    <li> I had heard about face cupping but never tried it and was a little skeptical. At first I used a little to much suction and had a red mark. After trial and error I think I got it. You use it with a moisturizer or your favorite lotion. The small cup is perfect for around the eyes. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in only a couple days. Fine lines seem to go away.  I like that there are different sizes for different areas of the face. They really do massage. You squeeze them to get the right amount of suction and slide them across those darn lines. I love it. I have received this at a discounted price for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t figure out what to do with this.</li>
    <li> The cups work great at plumping up the skin. The set comes with 3 cups. Two of them seem to be the same size. The smallest one doesn&#x27;t have very much suction.  It works okay on the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both sizes are difficult to use on vertical lines above my lips and between my eye brows. The big one is too big and the small one doesn&#x27;t have enough suction .</li>
    <li> Nice set, but i wish it had 3 different sizes. 2 cups are the same size. Good instruction video.</li>
    <li> Love this so much! It&#x27;s like having a facial at home! It&#x27;s so gentle on the face but also make it feel tight and lifted afterwards! I also love that you can use this product on stretch marks  to increase blood flow and lessen it&#x27;s appearance. It comes with a little pamphlet that shows you where to use the cups and what steps to take before and after. It also comes with a little scrubby to help smooth and exfoliate skin.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how easy it was to use and once used for an extended period of time I did see results.</li>
    <li> I am part of a couple of skin care forums and I read ladies there talking about cupping and how it is good for skin. It is an ancient method of skin care but the Lure Face cupping set has a new twist, since the cups are made of silicon and easy to maneuver. If offers all the advantages of massage and then some. I was offered to try these at a deep discount and give my honest opinion and I couldn’t resist as I always wanted to try these. They come in a pretty satin draw string bag. There are three cups, two for face and one small one for around eyes. There is a cute scrubbing brush also. I used Emo oil on my face after cleansing it. Started using these by following the instructions and it was so easy to use. All the oil was absorbed in my skin and the cup slid without an effort. I used small one around the eyes and can see that my eyes look more open. I have tried it with my moisturizer as well and get the same great results. My skin looks plumped and radiant. The skin around my eyes looks tighter. I am sure with continued use I’ll get fantastic results. Anyone can use them, as long as you don’t apply too much pressure or leave the cup in one place for long time as it can result in bruising.</li>
    <li> These are great. They really do decrease the lines on your face. Just be careful to not let it on one spot for to long.</li>
    <li> I had never even thought about cupping prior to finding these. I was skeptical but decided to order anyways. So glad I did! They work great. The suction is gentle. After using this one time my face felt wonderful. It did turn red for a few mins but that went away very quickly. The bags I had under my eyes shrank just after one use. I will continue to use them and I&#x27;m not a believer in the cupping method. The different size cups are great. I can get very close to my eye with the smaller one and the larger ones work well on the bulk of my face. You can also use these in other ways like on your legs for Cellulite.  They give you directions on how to do this with the cups. To top it all off the bag they all come in is awesome to keep everything in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these cups at a discounted rate in return for my review. Regardless the above is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I was rather skeptical about using facial cupping to remove wrinkles.  You need to be very consistent, persistent and patient for this product to work.  I got it to use on my nasal labia folds (my frown lines by my mouth).  If you follow the directions and do it daily, you can see small results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works best when your skin is moisturized and you use suction and glide over a specific area for 5 minutes.  You can apply gentle suction to a area for a little longer as an alternative to keeping the suction cup gliding.  The suctioning brings blood to the surface of the area to stimulate blood circulation and skin renewal.  The skin treated will be slightly pink for a few minutes.  Mind you, too much suction will make your skin red and feel irritable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frown lines and scars by my mouth are smoothly out and becoming less noticeable slowly.  So results will depend on what effort you put into cupping your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a discounted price in return for my candid opinion expressed in this review.</li>
    <li> I have un even texture with acne scaring and my skin is starting to get sagging , i try this cups but they pull the skin too much. I guess if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing don&#x27;t waste your money on this, there is other face massage alternatives, with a less chance of damaging your skin. Also this product comes with three cups which one is too small and the other two are way too big for the face.</li>
    <li> I received the silicon brush, two larger cups (which are the same size), and the smallest size.  I believe I am missing a medium size cup but am not sure.  I will change my review once I receive all the product I ordered or an answer.</li>
    <li> I think you can get better deals on Lure products elsewhere. It&#x27;s a little spendy for what you get.</li>
    <li> good but it doesnt do miracles and should not be used frequently</li>
    <li> Massages, and relaxes the facial skin and it feels like heaven.</li>
    <li> I received this during a product launch, at a reduced rate, for my honest review.  First, we had fun with these little cups.  My kids thought they were unicorns.  I was confused at first, on how to use these, but after reading the insert that is included, it made sense.  I actually used Mitchell and Peach face oil around my eyes and crows feet areas, and the cups stuck right on, and were easy to move.  I had to try a few times before I felt like I was getting good cupping, and let me tell you, I am surprised at how this actually works!  I tend to get a lot of wrinkles on the top of my cheek, just under my eyes, and after one proper use of the cupping system, I could visibly see a difference, and I didn&#x27;t leave the cup on for very long on my first run.  I am willing to bet that after a few days of using this, it&#x27;ll be easy breezy.  I think the key is to have enough moisturizer or oil on your face so the cup glides smoothly.  This set comes with 2 medium size cups, and one smaller cup that will work on the crows feet area.  The set comes in a nice silver drawstring bag.</li>
    <li> First, I want to mention that when my kit arrived, I didn&#x27;t notice for a couple days that the small cup wasn&#x27;t in the bag, but I contacted the company and they sent a small one to me right away. Very friendly and prompt customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I just love this cupping set. I have a weird little crease above my upper lip which is worse in the morning, probably from sleeping on my side. I use the larger cup on that crease for a couple minutes in the morning, and it smooths right out. I thought I was going to have to get fillers, but now I don&#x27;t. Also, it&#x27;s really revived my aging skin. It seems to have improved all-over circulation and smoothed my undereye skin, making the area look less &amp;#34;hollowed.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I look 10 years younger? No, but I have only been using it a couple weeks and I have noticed a definite improvement in my skin which I&#x27;m sure will only get better with more use. As an added bonus, it&#x27;s very relaxing and helps a lot with allergy/sinus pressure and tension headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I heard about cupping massage from my cousin who&#x27;s pretty much addicted to it... I am a mom with three little kids and have no luxury of time to go to a spa. So my cousin shared her secret and introduced me to LURE! Honestly I think the massage cups alone deserve 5 stars because they are so simple and easy to use. I got both the facial and the body kits. The packaging is simple and I thought it was smart the cups came in a travel case. The instructions were pretty simple to follow, and I was really impressed by how many benefits the cupping massage has once I did some research. I even tried it on my husband and he really liked it! I experimented with different creams, but found Argan oil I already had worked best for my face. For body massage thought the company says you can use dry with creams or oil, I found it much easier to use with my regular body wash in the shower where the cups glide so nicely instantly relieving my tense muscles. Company recommends to use the product a few times a week, but I&#x27;m doing it every day now just because it feels really good and I enjoy seeing immediate results. I will update more in about a month for long term results (I hope those 3 baby deliveries stretch marks are going to be less visible!). Oh, and I&#x27;m definitely getting this as a holiday gift for a bunch of my family and friends, because this is one gift that keeps on giving.</li>
    <li> Just received my set of cups and I&#x27;m in love they&#x27;re so easy to work with and I can tell my skin looks smoother from the first use of the cups. Can&#x27;t wait to see the benefits from prolonged use of this method.</li>
    <li> I never heard of cupping until I saw a Youtube video about it but I believe in and was trying to do some facial massage.  I decided to order this as it seemed to accomplish almost the same thing as a massage with less manipulation of the facial skin.  You do need to experiment a little, however, with the cups to determine the right suction level.  To get suction, you squeeze the cup, put it against your skin (which should be heavily moisturized or oiled) and release the cup.  The more you squeeze the cup, the stronger the suction but too strong of a suction isn&#x27;t good for your skin.  It can cause broken capillaries and other damage so be careful.  And you should not just suction and leave it on one area of the skin.  That can also cause damage if you aren&#x27;t careful.  I just create the suction and then glide the cup along the skin in the direction as shown in the little booklet that comes with it.  I&#x27;m not sure if it will make a miraculous difference (I&#x27;ve only had it for a little while) but it feels nice to me.</li>
    <li> High quality,  well made.  My first time using a product like this,  but it is very easy to use.  Fun to pamper myself and take care of my skin!</li>
    <li> I love it thanks LURE great product</li>
