### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great find!</li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, I just apply once a week.  </li>
      <li>It took a while, but the end result looked great.</li>
      <li>I am quite happy with this purchase as I believe I have stumbled&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
      <li>to a great addition to my cosmetic regimen.</li>
      <li>I am more than impressed by it.</li>
      <li>That is good customer service.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Quick ship, color is good.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better brow products on the market.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works well for some.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Auburn and it is more of a medium brown color.</li>
      <li>It goes much better with my hair color than any of the Aquabrow shades.</li>
      <li>I was hoping I&#x27;d love it when reading all the reviews.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend !!!!!</li>
      <li>Blends beautifully&amp; easy to work into my brow.</li>
      <li>It is darker and more brown than I had hoped, but by using a very light touch and feathery strokes, I have been able to make it look completely natural.  </li>
      <li>My brows look great and it surprises me how much younger</li>
      <li>and I really feel it would better serve someone with more brow hair than I have.  </li>
      <li>After wiping the excess gel from the brush as I took it out of the bottle, I found it worked best to paint 1 or 2 &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; lines (like individual hairs) and then use the spiral brush to gently brush the lines in the direction of the hair growth.</li>
      <li>This is the first eyebrow gel that I have tried that I fell in love with from minute one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping was exactly as promised, and the Miles Kimball company even took the time to send me a separate email to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>Applying this product with light feathery strokes is the best way to go, however make sure that you have a Q-tip handy to wipe away any excess product, or you will end up with big thick manly brows.</li>
      <li>I bought the auburn as my hair is bright red.  </li>
      <li>I have used, and loved, this product for several years.</li>
      <li>I Iook with full brows.</li>
      <li>It lasts a couple days, but then fades quickly.</li>
      <li>I do have to say though, if you have oil-prone skin and plan on engaging in any activities or events that will make you sweat, this product does stay on pretty well without wiping off or smearing.</li>
      <li>I just love the way it looks so natural and not painted on!</li>
      <li>A container lasts about 4-6 months, making the somewhat pricey cost worth it.</li>
      <li>I received this today, and put it on right away.</li>
      <li>Also, my brows are simply thinning and this made them look more full.  </li>
      <li>For me, most eyebrow products have too much of a yellow undertone.</li>
      <li>I always make sure I have extra on hand.  </li>
      <li>It was much darker than I thought</li>
      <li>I still had reasonable brows after one shower where I gently washed my face with soap (homemade soap).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>No so much for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t go out much.</li>
      <li>While wet, mistakes can be easily corrected.  </li>
      <li>Even when you are finished and think its on good, a few hours later look into the mirror to find it has been clumping while you were not looking.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin - oily T-Zone and normal rest of face.</li>
      <li>I believe the tube of Wunderbrow will last a long time, but I will buy more when it is gone.</li>
      <li>even a little bit of that brow gel makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I saw it advertised in one of my Soft Surrounding catalogs, and figured it must be legit.</li>
      <li>I prefer a natural look.</li>
      <li>Also, no matter how well you blend this product with your natural brows, it just does NOT look natural.</li>
      <li>I also have acne prone skin, and the facial products I use to keep my face clear have seem to bleach out my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>If you try to paint the entire brow first, you won&#x27;t be able to brush the lines out as they will have dried out, and you will have thick, globby brows.</li>
      <li>Is much easier to apply than other products of this type, especially since it&#x27;s a 1 step product.  </li>
      <li>The Auburn color is not as red as my hair, but I fixed that issue with some red eyeshadow mixed into the gel.</li>

<li> I can&#x27;t comment yet about how long it lasts, but I&#x27;m allergic  to a lot of things, especially cosmetics, and I am not experiencing any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Before application, I washed my face with soap, used non-alcohol witch hazel as a toner, let my face air dry, and then applied Wunderbrow.</li>
<li> I have oily brow skin; my sister has dry.</li>
<li> I hate fakey looking anything and these look sexy but natural.</li>
<li> May try the blonde next time, since the auburn is a little dark, but after I put powdered foundation over the brow it lightens them up.</li>
<li> The makers of this product claim that it has staying power of up to 3 days, but that&#x27;s just not true, you will need to reapply by the next morning.</li>
<li> The brush needs to be used while the product is still wet.  </li>
<li> I am a pale redhead, and my eyebrows are whiter than white and have been thinning for years.</li>
<li> In fact, its worse than any pencil or gel I have ever used in terms of looking realistic.</li>
<li> You would use only a little, so this package would last at least 3-5 months.</li>
<li> It does not apply evenly, the color is deeper than I have had in the past and in general was a waste of my money.  </li>
<li> It did not go on even and was a bit dark.</li>
<li> It takes a little practice to get it on and textured with the &#x27;spoolie&#x27; brush.</li>
<li> Ends up being messy.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this!</li>
<li> Hard to control the flow.</li>
<li> Wunderbrow is a thick gel.</li>
<li> This product makes my eyebrows look fake and makeup-y.</li>
<li> This doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad</li>
<li> i do not have very thin eyebrows but</li>
<li> My sister &amp; I both use this; we have almost no eyebrows and pencils/powder look artificial.</li>
<li> It looks terrible.</li>

    <li> Great find! i do not have very thin eyebrows but even a little bit of that brow gel makes a huge difference. You would use only a little, so this package would last at least 3-5 months.</li>
    <li> I have used, and loved, this product for several years. It has changed dramatically and I will not buy it again. It does not apply evenly, the color is deeper than I have had in the past and in general was a waste of my money.  I will be giving smartbrow a try.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this!</li>
    <li> WunderBrow TM 1 sep Brow Gel is not what I s expecting. It is not user-friendly and does not do what I was needing. I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with this purchase as I believe I have stumbled&lt;br /&gt;on to a great addition to my cosmetic regimen. My brows look great and it surprises me how much younger I Iook with full brows. I hate fakey looking anything and these look sexy but natural. I can&#x27;t wait to arch my brows to make a point.</li>
    <li> Wunderbrow is a thick gel. After wiping the excess gel from the brush as I took it out of the bottle, I found it worked best to paint 1 or 2 &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; lines (like individual hairs) and then use the spiral brush to gently brush the lines in the direction of the hair growth. If you try to paint the entire brow first, you won&#x27;t be able to brush the lines out as they will have dried out, and you will have thick, globby brows. I tried to have as little product on the applicator brush as possible and made sure to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; using the thin edge. It took a while, but the end result looked great. I had no problems with Wunderbrow washing off. I still had reasonable brows after one shower where I gently washed my face with soap (homemade soap).&lt;br /&gt;I do not know why some reviewers had problems with it where water is concerned. Before application, I washed my face with soap, used non-alcohol witch hazel as a toner, let my face air dry, and then applied Wunderbrow. I have combination skin - oily T-Zone and normal rest of face. I especially like that Wunderbrow comes in an auburn shade. It goes much better with my hair color than any of the Aquabrow shades. For me, most eyebrow products have too much of a yellow undertone. I believe the tube of Wunderbrow will last a long time, but I will buy more when it is gone.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Quick ship, color is good.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw it advertised in one of my Soft Surrounding catalogs, and figured it must be legit. I ordered the Auburn and it is more of a medium brown color.

    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now.  I always make sure I have extra on hand.  I just love the way it looks so natural and not painted on!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Is much easier to apply than other products of this type, especially since it&#x27;s a 1 step product.  The Auburn color is not as red as my hair, but I fixed that issue with some red eyeshadow mixed into the gel.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would fill in the few eyebrow hairs I have left or at least make the brow look better.  Didn&#x27;t happen.  It was much darker than I thought and I really feel it would better serve someone with more brow hair than I have.  I&#x27;m sure it works well for some.  No so much for me.</li>
    <li> I bought the auburn as my hair is bright red.  It is darker and more brown than I had hoped, but by using a very light touch and feathery strokes, I have been able to make it look completely natural.  The brush needs to be used while the product is still wet.  While wet, mistakes can be easily corrected.  Also, my brows are simply thinning and this made them look more full.  I don&#x27;t know how it will work for nonexistent brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used it today, so I can&#x27;t comment yet about how long it lasts, but I&#x27;m allergic  to a lot of things, especially cosmetics, and I am not experiencing any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was exactly as promised, and the Miles Kimball company even took the time to send me a separate email to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase.  That is good customer service.</li>
    <li> I received this today, and put it on right away. I am more than impressed by it. I am a pale redhead, and my eyebrows are whiter than white and have been thinning for years. I also have acne prone skin, and the facial products I use to keep my face clear have seem to bleach out my eyebrows. When I color my hair to hide my greys I also try to color my eyebrows. &amp;#34;Try&amp;#34; is the key word here. It lasts a couple days, but then fades quickly. This is the first eyebrow gel that I have tried that I fell in love with from minute one. My eyebrows sweat, and pencils don&#x27;t stay on all day. Plus the pencils tend to color the skin below the hairs and not the actual hairs. This not only stayed on, but actually made me look like I have hair and eyebrows which have been disappearing for almost 10 years now.</li>
    <li> This product makes my eyebrows look fake and makeup-y. I prefer a natural look. I was hoping I&#x27;d love it when reading all the reviews. I also couldn&#x27;t get the hang of using it. It did not go on even and was a bit dark. This doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad, it&#x27;s just not for me...</li>
    <li> My sister &amp; I both use this; we have almost no eyebrows and pencils/powder look artificial. I have oily brow skin; my sister has dry. It takes a little practice to get it on and textured with the &#x27;spoolie&#x27; brush. But then it lasts 3 days, even with showering or swimming. Just don&#x27;t use soap on them---leave them alone and they will shed water. About the 3rd-4th day they start flaking off, so use soap or makeup remover and do over again. A container lasts about 4-6 months, making the somewhat pricey cost worth it. I order two at a time, thus reducing shipping charges. This is one of the better brow products on the market.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m 57 with thinning brows &amp; will not run out of Wunderbrow!!! Blends beautifully&amp; easy to work into my brow. Highly recommend !!!!!</li>
    <li> Like it. Tried it once. I don&#x27;t go out much.</li>
    <li> Hard to control the flow. Ends up being messy.</li>
    <li> Even when you are finished and think its on good, a few hours later look into the mirror to find it has been clumping while you were not looking. It looks terrible. Wish they had a no star rating.  Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Would recommend</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I just apply once a week.  May try the blonde next time, since the auburn is a little dark, but after I put powdered foundation over the brow it lightens them up.</li>
