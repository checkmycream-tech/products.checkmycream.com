<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It is lightweight so it wears well under makeup but it still incredibly moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the face. Not to greasy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great for extra sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Works great, keep skin soft.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the a.m. so use the p.m. both day and night.  I have sensitive, dry skin and this product is working well!</li>
    <li> CeraVe is amazing anyway, but this lotion is where it&#x27;s at, man. It has so many ceramides AND niacinamide, which is of course, literal magic for your skin. It&#x27;s super gentle, too, which is awesome for my delicate dermis.</li>
    <li> Best night cream for the entry price</li>
    <li> It goes a long way as just a couple squirts cover a face and neck. Made my old skin smoother and I haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle yet.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff. I work outside and in the winter it is brutal. This is amazing. I don&#x27;t go to bed with a greasy face and my skin is no longer dry</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I use this on top of my retinae at night and it seems to lock in moisture without being greasy as retinae dries out your skin. It&#x27;s been great so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months now.</li>
    <li> Very good product, indicated by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and love the results! When you use prescription retin-A on your face, a lot of other products can dry you out way too much. My dermatologist suggested switching to both. Using this lotion and the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser together (instead of the Bliss skincare line that I&#x27;d used for four years) has saved me mega-bucks and my skin is much happier! Soft and non-stressed skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Keeps your face moist but not overly heavy. You will never have dry skin again. Also try the AM lotion.</li>
    <li> I use the PM and AM lotions daily.  After one month, I noticed my skin was clearer.</li>
    <li> Best simple moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Works well for day or night but has no SPF which I prefer. No scent. Non greasy. Easily absorbed. No funky ingredients. My acne prone teen uses it successfully and it&#x27;s great on my 40 something skin too. Really good stuff.</li>
    <li> I decided to to try this out, because I like CeraVe body cream. I felt the difference on my dry skin, and it did  not&lt;br /&gt;leave it greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is really good for dry skin and does hold moisture.</li>
    <li> I have every product in the CeraVe line.  My dermatologist likes it and that was enough for me.  I&#x27;m older...really older...and this stuff nourishes my mature skin day and night.</li>
    <li> I find this lotion to be light, soothing and helpful in the drier areas of my face / neck and chest. It does make my T-zone very shiny and oily however. It is okay for the price, but not worthy of all the hype.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, gentle and does not cause pimples. I have very sensitive oily skin and it does not have that oil feeling.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well for a friend, but I found it to be just ok.  I usually add it to another type of moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled severe acne since a teen, and after trying an ungodly amount of skin care products to correct this, I&#x27;ve become a sort of skincare guru. After going through a course of accutane and having the acne come back, I came upon a routine that worked to reduce my acne to near nonexistence: wash my face with plain water or, if needed, the mildest cleanser available, and use Elta MD&#x27;s UV Clear sunscreen. The simplicity and efficacy of this routine was remarkable, having tried all sorts of combinations of cleansers, toners, serums, etc that well exceeded a hundred dollars a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research into what made UV Clear work so well, and that was an ingredient called niacinamide. Always on the lookout for better value, I researched other products I might find niacinamide. That is when i found CeraVe PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As luck would have it, I was also starting to experience dry skin on my cheeks from the coming winter weather and was looking for a facial moisturizer. After using it for two nights, my sister happened to come into town to visit, and she remarked on how healthy my skin looked, a compliment I&#x27;ve never heard before. Could it be the CeraVe PM? In just two days?? I mentioned the possibility, and when she went home, my nearly new bottle of CeraVe PM came home with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter; I can just pick one up from the local drug store for a ridiculously low price. CeraVe PM is probably one of the most inexpensive sources of niacinamide, which is amazing. After using it for a week, my skin does feel remarkably smooth, clear, and with no dryness at all. I love how it feels after applying: it feels like nothing at all. I love how it smells: it smells like nothing. It is exactly what my skin needs, nothing more, nothing less, and my wallet doesn&#x27;t cry when I&#x27;m using it. Overall, this is one of the best skincare products I&#x27;ve ever used in any category at any price.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really light, non-irritating.  No harsh smells.  I wear it daily, not just at night.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Incredible product.  I began having a problem with rosacea on my face--went to the doctor and got a $94.00 cream that only made things worse.  Read about this product online; bought it; used it; rosacea cleared up right away.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive but effective like any high dollar creme. It&#x27;s hard to find the night version in stores so thank goodness for amazon.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended this brand. They must not spend a lot of bucks on advertising but this is good stuff.  Great pricing through amazon for 2 pack.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended dis moisturizer 4 me 2 yrs ago n I been using it sense.. its very mild n it makes yur skn so so soft!!!</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight, non-sticky moisturizer, with no added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does have are ceramides, hyuralonic (however it&#x27;s spelled) acid, niacinamides, and some nice antioxidant and anti-irritant ingredients at a fantastic price.  It helps maintain even skin tone, and contains ingredients that are good for skin, even and especially sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you don&#x27;t have to have sensitive skin to appreciate a quality, affordable nighttime moisturizer.  And if you have oily skin, you simply must try this.  It&#x27;s not going to clear up zits, but it won&#x27;t clog your pores, and it doesn&#x27;t feel the least bit greasy.  It won&#x27;t spread over to your hair at night, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, if anyone hasn&#x27;t tried CeraVe PM, what&#x27;s the hold up?  A skin care product that won&#x27;t harm your skin is a must try, in an ocean of skin care products with dubious ingredients.  Two wings up!</li>
    <li> This product brand was recommended by my dermatologist. It hasn&#x27;t disappointed. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Mild, doesn&#x27;t have perfume or dyes and yet manages not to smell medicinal.  Good for sensitive skin, yet moisturizing.  I prefer it to cetaphil.  Plus, this is a great deal - cheaper than any I&#x27;ve found otherwise.  Shipped quickly, boxed as pictured. Have reordered once already.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin product ---- the PM is especially good for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, thanks for the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I use this product at the recommendation of my dermatologist, and it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s very moisturizing without any greasiness and it it does not irritate my skin. It&#x27;s also completely odorless.</li>
    <li> Very good price for a good moisturizes.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It was delivered on time and works great with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works really well on my aged drying skin.  No more flaking dry spots.</li>
    <li> I saw this advertised on Dr Oz and I have been a repeat buyer ever since. High quality moisturizer for last thing at night</li>
    <li> Love this, I am not oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and it&#x27;s awesome. Before when I had acne the area would peel without healing, but with this lotion my face is able to clear up and stay that way. I prefer the PM to the AM because it smells better and has a silky texture.</li>
    <li> Love all Cerave products.  My face always feels smooth and moist.</li>
