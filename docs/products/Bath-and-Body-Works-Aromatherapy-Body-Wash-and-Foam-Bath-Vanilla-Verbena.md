    <li> Glad they carry this fragrance, it is my favorite!</li>
    <li> stress relief indeed!!  Body wash &amp; hot water - best therapy ever</li>
    <li> The smell and aromatherapy quality of this product is very low. It barely smells good. When I tried making a bubble bath out of it, it produced a few bubbles and that was it. I noticed that this product is no longer on the Bath and Body Works website, and maybe they discontinued it. I also wonder if the product is expired, as there&#x27;s no expiration date on the bottle. I would not recommend this product for stress relief, nor as a body wash or as a bubble bath product.</li>
    <li> I use it with the bath soak crystals.  I am not allergic to it.  It is not overpowering.  No Headache.  It is relaxing.  My grandkids really like it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and the smell is the best....I don&#x27;t know why B&amp;B works doesn&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>

    <li> Love!!! Love!!Love!! My favorite scent!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful bath gel.  The scent stays with you and your shower smells beyond heavenly!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It&#x27;s very relaxing and not overpowering like the eucalyptus one. Too bad they discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I use it to shower every night. Have to try a bath with it though. It really relieves tension and stress and I feel so relaxed before bed.</li>
    <li> I love taking bubble baths with bath and body works aromatherapy gels. They smell great, give lots of bubbles, and out me in a great mood before bedtime. Completely happy, ache free after a good soak and the smell is soothing. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jilly</li>
