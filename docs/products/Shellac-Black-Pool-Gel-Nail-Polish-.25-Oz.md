    <li> Glossy for over two weeks!!  Takes a little extra time, but wroth it.  Professional looking.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish. I have had it for a couple of years and it&#x27;s still good.</li>
    <li> Love this color.  Apply thin and do at minimum three coats for best saturation.  Two thin coats wasn&#x27;t enough, but two thick coats was, so three thin would probably be better</li>
    <li> Nice color, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Blackpool is a great deep black without any metallic shimmer or glitter. You will need 2 coats, since it&#x27;s a runny color. Looks great when layered over with iced coral- comes out a turquoise-green shade. I&#x27;ve uploaded a pic of blackpool and iced coral and look forward to experimenting with other layering options.</li>

    <li> CND is amazing. This is a true black color that lasts two plus weeks without chipping. I love CND polish.</li>
    <li> Black polish in my opinion is a must have</li>
    <li> The polish came on time as advertised and was just as promised.  Looks great!</li>
    <li> Great color- no sparkles or anything. Great for layering, artistic details, or alone. It definitely needs 2 coats to be opaque and deep.</li>
    <li> I love this shiny black color so much more than I expected!  Very pretty!  Originally, I thought I would use this as a layering tool (think water color).  But, I am love, love,loving black nails too!!  Hahahaha!  I thought black nails were just for teenagers!</li>

    <li> The pigmentation of this polish is Great. It really gives you a solid lustrous black in two coats.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars is: Price versus Size. This is a very small container. (Half the size of a Gelish one)&lt;br /&gt;Is it better because it&#x27;s Shellac? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s a very good product. Just make sure you want to pay double for it.</li>
    <li> Shiny black! Love it!</li>
    <li> Love CND products. Worth the money</li>
