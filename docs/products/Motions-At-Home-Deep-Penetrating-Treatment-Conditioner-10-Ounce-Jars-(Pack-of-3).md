### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I will do my best to answer.</li>
      <li>Maybe the best results of any conditioner she&#x27;s tried.</li>
      <li>B000RHOBBU Motions Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion]] is amazing; one of the best hair products that I have used but this hair treatment is a miss.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product works great at conditioning my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, this would be a great product if you have the time to commit to it; but, don&#x27;t expect to just use it in the shower if you want the maximum benefit.</li>
      <li>This conditioner also have a very nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is scented, with a pleasant smell that is not over-powering.</li>
      <li>Neither my wife nor I loved this product.</li>
      <li>in all, I&#x27;d say this product is good value.</li>
      <li>We use this on his hair and it works wonders to keep his hair looking good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on very easy and smells great</li>
      <li>Hair is noticeably smoother, feels great, is easy to style, moisturized, and smells good.</li>
      <li>It says it&#x27;s for at home, but the directions talk about getting best results by putting on a cap and putting the &#x27;client&#x27; under a hot dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does smell good though :)</li>
      <li>the directions it indicates: \\&quot;For maximum conditioning benefits, cover hair with a plastic cap and place under a warm dryer for 5 - 10 minutes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The directions say that for maximum conditioning benefits you should use the product with a plastic cap under a warm dryer for 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I had access to a warm dryer I didn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it would be nice if they suggested a time</li>
      <li>I also felt without the warm dryer step,</li>
      <li>directions do not give any timeframe for use if you are not using a plastic cap with a warm dryer.</li>
      <li>While it isn&#x27;t the best deep penetrating condition I&#x27;ve ever used, I feel it is an effective one at this price point.  </li>
      <li>It has a mild scent and feels good when worked into the hair and scalp during a shower.</li>
      <li>It is easy to work into hair, after which you are supposed to leave in 2-3 minute then rinse out with warm water.</li>
      <li>And, I love it for myself.</li>
      <li>I think there are better options in this category.  </li>
      <li>when I washed out the product, while my hair felt better, I still had a feeling like the product was still in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love the way my hair feels and looks after use.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend had an excellent experience with this Motions At Home Deep Penetrating Treatment Conditioner.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a product that will probably be more subjective, as you can see from the 3-5 reviews on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The treatment did help control static in my hair.</li>
      <li>More research is needed.</li>
      <li>This seemed to work better for me.  </li>
      <li>love this product.  </li>
      <li>It worked great and restored some much needed hydration.</li>
      <li>But she does feel the product works, it just takes a bit more work that may test some people&#x27;s patience.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First I want to point out how much of this you get - 10 ounces is a excellent.</li>
      <li>It seems more like the sort of thing they expect to be used when someone&#x27;s going to quickly cap your hair and keep the product away from the rest of you and have all the right tools to make it work great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other then that I liked the product and felt like it works great, especially and damaged hair, so I recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I used other Motions products and don&#x27;t find them ideally suited for my type of hair (or my wife&#x27;s), but they are effective.</li>
      <li>Ideally, you&#x27;re supposed to cover your hair and let this work for several minutes.</li>
      <li>This stuff really does a good job.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The result was super-smooth hair that was easy to style and felt like silk.</li>
      <li>Untangles hair easily after use</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to deliver on the \\&quot;deep penetrating\\&quot; claim but to be fair, while it is easy to get plastic caps to wear over the saturated hair, we didn&#x27;t have the salon style hair dryers to sit under for the warm heat part of the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a fair conditioner at a decent price point.</li>
      <li>But I do have baby fine hair</li>
      <li>I have coarse/oily hair, so I always walk a fine line with shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Leaves har feeling smooth</li>
      <li>While it does a good job conditioning, the potential skin irritation and difficulty removing it, would only be worth it, if the product was wonderful.</li>
      <li>If you have any questions about the product feel free to leave a comment below</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important that one blow dries the hair with the product before washing it.  </li>
      <li>It may not cost a lot of money, but its certainly a cheap product.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping that it would do more for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but you are going to need some pro equipment for full effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was not bad, but it is not a product I will get again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably perfectly fine as a product in general, but I don&#x27;t see it as something that&#x27;s suitable for use at home.</li>
      <li>This conditioner also works well with other Motions products to provide great looking hair.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good conditioner for my increasingly dry hair.  </li>
      <li>The main issue was that it required more effort to rinse out than she was willing to commit to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to many perfumes and this product made me wrinkle my nose.</li>
      <li>I really did not feel as though this did anything more than my regular good quality conditioner and most of these are too much for daily use, so not all that helpful.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as nice as what you&#x27;d get at a saloon, but it&#x27;s also probably 1/7th of what you&#x27;d pay for a deep penentrating treatment at a saloon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>jar is very large with a ton of product, so you will get a lot of uses out of it, even if you apply it generously.</li>
      <li>After trying the Motions at Home conditioner, it has a nice light fragrance, but the final conditioning effect was no where near what I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
      <li>Firstly, it should be noted what the target consumer for this product is African-American women.</li>
      <li>I know the direction ask for more time and further measures, but I don&#x27;t have time for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At about $5, this is a very inexpensive product, and maybe worth the try</li>
      <li>/&gt;She did use the shower cap the first time</li>
      <li>The heaviness didn&#x27;t exactly appear to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product was significantly heavier than many other conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The first time I put it on in shower and let it sit for about 5 min.</li>
      <li>I love the Motions At Home Deep Penetrating Treatment Conditioner.</li>
      <li>This conditions does penetrat deep into the hair shafts to make hair stronger and more managable.</li>
      <li>: The treatment has a light floral smell and it does detangle the hair and leave it soft.</li>
      <li>This is an effective conditioner, if a bit extreme.  </li>
      <li>I have very thick and coarse hair and while I don&#x27;t use many products on it, morrocan oil and a great shampoo and conditioner can do what this product did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of course, this is targetted for women, but being long haired, this type of conditioner is OK for this guy.  </li>
      <li>10 minutes later, her hair was easy to comb (which is a miracle).</li>
      <li>, I have a large family, with lots of teens with processed hair.</li>
      <li>But for me, it&#x27;s fine as an occasional conditioner.</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>One of the rare products with chemicals that I use on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>conditioner left my hair feeling clean, light, but not dry...</li>
      <li>for the product it works very well.</li>
      <li>After drying, I could not see any real difference.  </li>
      <li>2nd time I kept it on the required time under a shower cap  (still no heat) and actually my hair felt kind of brittle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this could be due to many factors.</li>
      <li>It is definitely a deeper conditioner than the standard, and felt great as I rinsed it out, but as my hair dried naturally, it started to frizz a bit and wasn&#x27;t as smooth or shiny.</li>
      <li>Again, it&#x27;s not a bad product, it just didn&#x27;t really work well enough for me to continue buying it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It certainly is a deep penetrating, heavy-duty conditioning treatment, especially if used for more than a minute.</li>
      <li>I can end up with super frizzy hair or super sticky hair if what I use it too harsh or has too much residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We live in the high humidity of South Florida and your hair really gets damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s far thicker than most conditioners, making it slightly more difficult to work into your hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While she left it on her hair for more than five minutes, she felt that the product took a long time to wash out.  </li>
      <li>though very minor)&lt;br /&gt;- Very hard to get off (need a super strong shower</li>
      <li>If the product isn&#x27;t better than other deep conditioners, I can&#x27;t really justify putting up with the problems that it causes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that many deep conditioners don&#x27;t feel all that different from regular conditioners.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Feel different than most other conditioners</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what more I could ask for</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a rather large tub of white cream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife loves to dye her hair and try different styles, but that can take a toll on the softness &amp; durability of hair.  So, she&#x27;s always looking for something to counter the damage done by styling.  This works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it only a few times, her hair had more life, bounce, and strength than it had in a LONG time.  She absolutely loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make hair too oily or heavy, just high-quality and luxurious!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had an excellent experience with this Motions At Home Deep Penetrating Treatment Conditioner. Maybe the best results of any conditioner she&#x27;s tried. The result was super-smooth hair that was easy to style and felt like silk. Based on her experience, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and was hoping this deep conditioning treatment would help lessen my despair.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find it all that effective.  I wasn&#x27;t completely useless, but I can&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I mailed this product to my friend and this company shipped the wrong item. She stated it did not have DPT on it as I needed. It was a hold cream instead. I was unpleased with item. Will not buy again from this company.</li>
    <li> This product works great at conditioning my hair. It leaves it soft and manageable after washing. One of the rare products with chemicals that I use on my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good conditioner for my increasingly dry hair.  This definitely has quality ingredients and moisture.  I do feel that it is a quality product.  But I do have baby fine hair so I think it would weigh down my hair too much if I used it very frequently.  I try to mix it in about once a month and it works well</li>
    <li> This is not a product for everyone, and the results here have been mixed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves har feeling smooth&lt;br /&gt;- Untangles hair easily after use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- Very heavy (thick) on your hair&lt;br /&gt;- Feel different than most other conditioners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- seem to irritate skin (though very minor)&lt;br /&gt;- Very hard to get off (need a super strong shower head?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the extra inconveniences are worth the added cost and troubles. While it does a good job conditioning, the potential skin irritation and difficulty removing it, would only be worth it, if the product was wonderful. And it&#x27;s just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> First I want to point out how much of this you get - 10 ounces is a excellent. Far too often these kinds of treatments come with enough for only a few treatments. A month later of 2-3 times a week and there is still about half in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product it works very well. Hair is noticeably smoother, feels great, is easy to style, moisturized, and smells good.</li>
    <li> I think there are better options in this category.  I have thick curly/wavy hair prone to frizz.  I really did not feel as though this did anything more than my regular good quality conditioner and most of these are too much for daily use, so not all that helpful.  It was not bad, but it is not a product I will get again.</li>
    <li> I only used this product once because I did not care for the fragrance. I am sensitive to many perfumes and this product made me wrinkle my nose. This is not a desirable quality in a beauty product; wrinkling and nose-twitching are unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment did help control static in my hair. I looked up the ingredients on EWG.org and Pubmed and learned that several of the fragrances are considered to be a \\&quot;Possible human immune system toxicant or allergen.\\&quot;  Furthermore, there are concerns about preservative Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate which is toxic when inhaled and  Butylphenyl Methlyproprional which may be estrogenic. More research is needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that many deep conditioners don&#x27;t feel all that different from regular conditioners. This certainly wasn&#x27;t the case with the Motions at Home Deep Conditioner. The product was significantly heavier than many other conditioners I&#x27;ve used. The heaviness didn&#x27;t exactly appear to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heaviness actually makes this product significantly more annoying than one would expect. If your shower lacks a powerful nozzle, you&#x27;ll likely run into trouble getting this out of your hair. Conditioner should not be this tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem is that this product doesn&#x27;t necessarily work better than any other deep conditioner. If the product isn&#x27;t better than other deep conditioners, I can&#x27;t really justify putting up with the problems that it causes. It may not cost a lot of money, but its certainly a cheap product.</li>
    <li> Perhaps this isn&#x27;t meant for Caucasian hair. It does seem a bit heavy for regular use. It certainly is a deep penetrating, heavy-duty conditioning treatment, especially if used for more than a minute. I used other Motions products and don&#x27;t find them ideally suited for my type of hair (or my wife&#x27;s), but they are effective. This is an effective conditioner, if a bit extreme.  It has a mild scent and feels good when worked into the hair and scalp during a shower. I had no irritation after using it. While it isn&#x27;t the best deep penetrating condition I&#x27;ve ever used, I feel it is an effective one at this price point.  While showering, after shampooing I work some into my hair. I leave it in for a minute and rinse. My hair feels soft and manageable. I know the direction ask for more time and further measures, but I don&#x27;t have time for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fair conditioner at a decent price point. I&#x27;m not sure what more I could ask for though I do like Motion&#x27;s [[ASIN:B0072XUY7W Naturally You, Deep Conditioning Masque]] more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> My intent was for my lady to use this to condition and repair her hair.  We live in the high humidity of South Florida and your hair really gets damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, I decided to try it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put about a palm amount in my hair and left it on for about 5 minutes.  The cream feels almost glue-like but after a few minutes of being on, I washed it off and my hair immediately felt wavy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out and after a day of work and an hour of workout afterwards, I was surprised that that fragrance was still fresh in my hair late in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  And, I love it for myself.</li>
    <li> I have used &#x27;Motions at home deep penetrating treatment conditioner&#x27; three times.  The first time I put it on in shower and let it sit for about 5 min. then rinsed.  After drying, I could not see any real difference.  In all fairness you are supposed to leave it on, under heat for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd time I kept it on the required time under a shower cap  (still no heat) and actually my hair felt kind of brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3rd time I put it on when I went to bed and left it on overnight.  This seemed to work better for me.  My hair was softer and silkier after I had dried it vs the other times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression is that it is a good product but just not a great product.  I have very thick and coarse hair and while I don&#x27;t use many products on it, morrocan oil and a great shampoo and conditioner can do what this product did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you have normal hair that needs conditioning this would probably work for you, but for stubborn hair an overnight and dirty pillow is not the way you probably want to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little confused by this one. It says it&#x27;s for at home, but the directions talk about getting best results by putting on a cap and putting the &#x27;client&#x27; under a hot dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results have been sort of mixed so far. It seems greasy and hard to get out, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s not offering the full conditioning benefit just because home equipment doesn&#x27;t cover what it seems you&#x27;re supposed to have to use it best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t seem like something that&#x27;s meant to be used at home in the shower. It seems more like the sort of thing they expect to be used when someone&#x27;s going to quickly cap your hair and keep the product away from the rest of you and have all the right tools to make it work great. It&#x27;s probably perfectly fine as a product in general, but I don&#x27;t see it as something that&#x27;s suitable for use at home.</li>
    <li> I love the Motions At Home Deep Penetrating Treatment Conditioner. This conditions does penetrat deep into the hair shafts to make hair stronger and more managable. This conditioner also works well with other Motions products to provide great looking hair. This conditioner also have a very nice fragrance. I love the way my hair feels and looks after use.</li>
    <li> Lathered it in to my daughter&#x27;s hair, put on a plastic hotel shower cap, and used the hair dry. 10 minutes later, her hair was easy to comb (which is a miracle). It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but for occasional use we&#x27;d definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> The Motions at Home Deep Penetrating Treatment Conditioner tells you to saturate the hair from root to end, so the 10 oz product will last for a varying amount of time, depending on how much hair you have.  The directions say that for maximum conditioning benefits you should use the product with a plastic cap under a warm dryer for 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The treatment has a light floral smell and it does detangle the hair and leave it soft. The retail price is relatively inexpensive for a \\&quot;Deep Penetrating Conditioner\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions do not give any timeframe for use if you are not using a plastic cap with a warm dryer. Which suggests that it would need to stay in longer if you don&#x27;t have those items and still want as close to the maximum benefit that you can get but it would be nice if they suggested a time interval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have a large family, with lots of teens with processed hair. We tried the treatment for 20 minute intervals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the long term impact seemed about the same as a regular high-end conditioner that we might buy. It didn&#x27;t seem to deliver on the \\&quot;deep penetrating\\&quot; claim but to be fair, while it is easy to get plastic caps to wear over the saturated hair, we didn&#x27;t have the salon style hair dryers to sit under for the warm heat part of the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are a serious hair enthusiast with a salon style dryer, this might be your product. If you have minor damage this might be a reasonably priced product for use with your hair because of the generous size.</li>
    <li> We got this for our 16-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair; but, she only used it a couple of times.  The main issue was that it required more effort to rinse out than she was willing to commit to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this would be a great product if you have the time to commit to it; but, don&#x27;t expect to just use it in the shower if you want the maximum benefit.</li>
    <li> In my home we all have curly hair which means lots of products that lead to dry hair. This deep conditioner treatment was just what our hair has been asking for. It worked great and restored some much needed hydration. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Firstly, it should be noted what the target consumer for this product is African-American women. From their website: \\&quot;Alberto-Culver was one of the first companies to fill a crucial need for African American women - offer high-quality hair care specifically created for ethnic hair of all types and textures.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a rather large tub of white cream. It looks and feels like a face cream, like Ponds Cold Cream. It is scented, with a pleasant smell that is not over-powering. It is easy to work into hair, after which you are supposed to leave in 2-3 minute then rinse out with warm water. For maximum benefit, the website suggests wearing a cap and sitting under a drier for 5-10 minutes, but that&#x27;s a bit of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that after rinsing out, my scalp felt oily. At about $5, this is a very inexpensive product, and maybe worth the try if you don&#x27;t mind experimenting to find a product that works for your specific hair and scalp chemistry.</li>
    <li> Of course, this is targetted for women, but being long haired, this type of conditioner is OK for this guy.  Basically though, it seems greasier than other conditioners and just average in results.  It is, as one reviewer notes, rather difficult to rinse out.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad exactly, it just isn&#x27;t a miracle product. I was really hoping that it would do more for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry, damaged, not really curly but more of kinky hair. I&#x27;m always looking for products to use that can calm it down and make it manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This made my hair soft, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything to tame the frizz or repair the damage. Again, it&#x27;s not a bad product, it just didn&#x27;t really work well enough for me to continue buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is very large with a ton of product, so you will get a lot of uses out of it, even if you apply it generously. There is also not really a scent to it, which is nice because some of these types of products can have a terrible odor. It also does take some work to wash out afterwords as it is very thick.</li>
    <li> Motions brand products have been hit or miss for me. [[ASIN:B000RHOBBU Motions Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion]] is amazing; one of the best hair products that I have used but this hair treatment is a miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not great but the main thing is just the way it feels on my hair. It&#x27;s hard to describe because it&#x27;s not exactly greasy or oily but just coated. It feels weird on your hair from the moment you put it on and that weird coating doesn&#x27;t wash out. It lasted on my hair through several hair washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I blow dry my hair, my hair is left all bushy and yucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not impressed with it at all and won&#x27;t be using again.</li>
    <li> During  the summer my grandson lets his hair grow as he hates hair cuts. Thus his hair becomes very dry and wiry. We use this on his hair and it works wonders to keep his hair looking good. It moisturizes his hair and his scalp is never dry either.  It is simple to use and does not take long to complete. This is the easiest treatment we have found for him. His summer afro is now quite manageable.</li>
    <li> I have coarse/oily hair, so I always walk a fine line with shampoo and conditioner. I can end up with super frizzy hair or super sticky hair if what I use it too harsh or has too much residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner left my hair feeling clean, light, but not dry... definitely not sticky or weighed down. For those wanting &#x27;salon quality&#x27; stuff, you might want to look later. But for me, it&#x27;s fine as an occasional conditioner.</li>
    <li> Neither my wife nor I loved this product. Does it moisturize? Yes it does. It&#x27;s far thicker than most conditioners, making it slightly more difficult to work into your hair. Ideally, you&#x27;re supposed to cover your hair and let this work for several minutes. Even after I rinsed the product out of my hair, I could feel some residue from the product in my hair, on my fingers, and on my face (I think this was the pumpkin, listed in the ingredients). The product did appear to provide deep, penetrating moisturization for my hair, but I prefer a product that&#x27;s a little easier to work with.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very easy and smells great but you are going to need some pro equipment for full effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the directions it indicates: \\&quot;For maximum conditioning benefits, cover hair with a plastic cap and place under a warm dryer for 5 - 10 minutes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my usage I have found that without this step you don&#x27;t quite get all the benefits form the product.  I also felt without the warm dryer step, when I washed out the product, while my hair felt better, I still had a feeling like the product was still in my hair.  When I had access to a warm dryer I didn&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then that I liked the product and felt like it works great, especially and damaged hair, so I recommend it.  If you have any questions about the product feel free to leave a comment below and I will do my best to answer.</li>
    <li> I think this product if for ethnic hair, but I didn&#x27;t know that when I used it. I have dry brittle old Caucasian old lady hair. I followed the directions, but had no way to use heat on it. It washes out well, maybe too well. My hair didn&#x27;t feel much different from before use. this could be due to many factors. It does smell good though :)</li>
    <li> My wife has been looking for a product that deals with deep conditioning and so she gave Motions at Home Deep Penetrating Treatment Conditioner a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she left it on her hair for more than five minutes, she felt that the product took a long time to wash out.  It&#x27;s very thick and the conditioner is also very thick, but after repeated washings to get it out of her thick, long hair, after blow drying, she did feel the difference from standard conditioner and commented of how soft her hair felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is whether or not one has the patience to use a deep penetrating conditioner and if they have thick, long hair.  It does take a bit of patience and one should not look at it like a regular conditioner which you can put on, wait and wash.  This one takes time to put on the hair, let it sit but then having to wash it over and over to remove the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did use the shower cap the first time but she did not leave it on overnight as others have tested.  But she does feel the product works, it just takes a bit more work that may test some people&#x27;s patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a product that will probably be more subjective, as you can see from the 3-5 reviews on Amazon.  It&#x27;s important that one blow dries the hair with the product before washing it.  So, it does take time if you want soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But through multiple tests, my wife felt the product was definitely worth it, but emphasizes that this is not for the people who are short on time and are impatient.  But also to not do any shortcuts and follow the instructions as mentioned.</li>
    <li> I have thick, rich, dark black, curly hair that, sadly, splits after it reaches a respectable length beyond my shoulders. I have never colored my hair but it does often get quite dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to prevent my hair from splitting further, I always use a mask or a deep treatment after shampooing. This treatment is about the same as a regular store-bought variety. It isn&#x27;t as nice as what you&#x27;d get at a saloon, but it&#x27;s also probably 1/7th of what you&#x27;d pay for a deep penentrating treatment at a saloon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d say this product is good value. It doesn&#x27;t deliver nor does it promise miracles, but it doesn&#x27;t charge a few body parts for the miracle either.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;m a little pampered when it comes to haircare products but I&#x27;m always looking for low cost alternatives to the Alterna 10 I use now.  I do believe Alterna is seriously overpriced, but it does make a difference in the silkiness of my hair.  After trying the Motions at Home conditioner, it has a nice light fragrance, but the final conditioning effect was no where near what I&#x27;m used to.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s like trying to compare a Motel 6 with the Four Seasons so I won&#x27;t go there.  It is definitely a deeper conditioner than the standard, and felt great as I rinsed it out, but as my hair dried naturally, it started to frizz a bit and wasn&#x27;t as smooth or shiny.</li>
