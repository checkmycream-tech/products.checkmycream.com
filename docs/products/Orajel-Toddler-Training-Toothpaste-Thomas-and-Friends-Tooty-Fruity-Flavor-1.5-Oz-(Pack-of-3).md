      <li>I feel good about your product and am thrilled there&#x27;s no fluoride in it.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping/ great price !</li>
      <li>My toddler wants to brush his teeth all the time because this tastes so good to him!</li>
      <li>like to package this with a cute toothpaste, a book about brushing teeth as a 1st birthday gift (along with some $$)</li>
      <li>This is okay for a training toothpaste, but I think it&#x27;s overpriced for the amount you get.</li>
      <li>Great taste,my son love it so much.</li>
      <li>So ok I&#x27;ll admit it, I tasted it.  </li>
      <li>she loves it and love brushing her teeth every day.</li>
      <li>kiddos enjoy brushing!</li>
      <li>By knowing that the ingredients are safe, we can hand the toothbrush to her and let her try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>Sincerely, M.A.T.</li>
      <li>This is is my son&#x27;s favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Great product highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Nice mild, fruit-flavored toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>Its safe to swallow and cleans okay, not as good as adult but does clean.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s doing a great job since he recently went in for his cleaning and no cavities!</li>
      <li>Great value at a low price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love this toothpaste (hence the 4 stars), but it&#x27;s good enough to get the job done (it&#x27;s toothpaste)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Orajel was smart to use Thomas, his favorite character.  </li>
      <li>Again, many thanks.</li>
      <li>He will spit it out before you can get the brush in (atleast we know he can spit right?)</li>
      <li>Plus, it tastes a little too good, so</li>
      <li>Arrived exactly as offered.  </li>
      <li>Bought this to brush daughter&#x27;s first tooth.</li>
      <li>that it is a clear &amp; flouride free toothpaste for toddlers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He won&#x27;t or doesn&#x27;t like any other kind.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t speak to how well it cleans, but she certainly likes the taste.</li>
      <li>even though it&#x27;s fluoride-free, it&#x27;s hard to teach my son not to eat the toothpaste when they made it taste good.</li>
      <li>Thanks ...</li>
      <li>No wonder my kid wants to just grab the tube and suck the toothpaste out.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using this product since our daughter had her first tooth ( ~ 6 months old).  </li>
      <li>If anyone knows of a big boy toothpaste that tastes similar to this one, I&#x27;d love to find out about it.</li>
      <li>2yr old now wants to brush his teeth every night before bed without us prompting him.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not foam up like adult toothpaste, so in a way there isn&#x27;t much for the children to &amp;#34;spit</li>
      <li>Live the fact it&#x27;s swallowable</li>
      <li>so i bought him a new one.</li>
      <li>My 2 boys love this toothpaste so much that I&#x27;m having a hard time transitioning them to using &amp;#34;big boy&amp;#34; toothpaste and spitting the toothpaste out.</li>
      <li>My 2 year old son loves holding on to the Thomas toothpaste while i show him how to brush his teeth.</li>
      <li>I needed a toothpaste for my almost 3 year old.</li>
      <li>It is the only toothpaste my three year old will use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a small tube that after just a couple of brushings, it doesn&#x27;t take long to run out if he manages to suck out more of the toothpaste to swallow.</li>
      <li>First just let me say that I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for my grandson (3 yrs) at the onset of little teeth coming in.</li>
      <li>The price was not really a great deal or anything but considering you do get 3 tubes and it is hard to find training toothpaste in stores makes it fair.</li>

<li> /&gt;There were hardly any other toothpaste brands that offered over 24 months, so we went with this</li>

    <li> This was great for my daughter she loves it and love brushing her teeth every day. My daughter is 19 months. Great product highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My toddler loves the flavor</li>
    <li> This is is my son&#x27;s favorite toothpaste. Orajel was smart to use Thomas, his favorite character.  He also prefers the flavor over other brands we&#x27;ve tried.</li>

    <li> Good product and seller. Best toothpaste for child.</li>
    <li> Live the fact it&#x27;s swallowable</li>
    <li> Perfect for getting your child familiar with the idea of brushing their teeth.  We&#x27;ve been using this product since our daughter had her first tooth ( ~ 6 months old).  By knowing that the ingredients are safe, we can hand the toothbrush to her and let her try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Never let your child walk/run around with a toothbrush (or anything that stays in the mouth).  They can fall and do harm to themselves.</li>
    <li> My son loves this book. He ripped out the pages out of the last one so i bought him a new one. He loves it</li>
    <li> My toddler loves this!</li>
    <li> My toddler wants to brush his teeth all the time because this tastes so good to him! Be careful though, we caught him sucking the tooth paste out of the bottle and now keep it out of reach.</li>
    <li> Great value at a low price. I don&#x27;t shop anywhere else for baby products, Amazon does it for me all the time. Great buy and my baby loves the flavour!!!!</li>
    <li> I needed a toothpaste for my almost 3 year old. He still has a tendency to swallow, so training is still necessary. We can&#x27;t get him to put regular toothpaste in his mouth. He will spit it out before you can get the brush in (atleast we know he can spit right?) I don&#x27;t love this toothpaste (hence the 4 stars), but it&#x27;s good enough to get the job done (it&#x27;s toothpaste)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were hardly any other toothpaste brands that offered over 24 months, so we went with this and it&#x27;s doing a great job since he recently went in for his cleaning and no cavities! Baby steps</li>
    <li> Fast shipping/ great price !</li>
    <li> My little one seems to like and she loves to brush her teeth with it. The smell is fruity and reminds me of bubble gum. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> It is the only toothpaste my three year old will use.</li>
    <li> our daughter loves the taste and you can&#x27;t beat thomas.  great price also!  we like that it doesn&#x27;t upset her tummy at all, especially since she refuses to spit it out.</li>
    <li> working good item 100%  Thanks ...</li>
    <li> Bought this to brush daughter&#x27;s first tooth. Can&#x27;t speak to how well it cleans, but she certainly likes the taste. The picture of Thomas is a plus.</li>
    <li> This is okay for a training toothpaste, but I think it&#x27;s overpriced for the amount you get. Plus, it tastes a little too good, so even though it&#x27;s fluoride-free, it&#x27;s hard to teach my son not to eat the toothpaste when they made it taste good. It&#x27;s such a small tube that after just a couple of brushings, it doesn&#x27;t take long to run out if he manages to suck out more of the toothpaste to swallow.

The price was not really a great deal or anything but considering you do get 3 tubes and it is hard to find training toothpaste in stores makes it fair.</li>
    <li> Great taste,my son love it so much.</li>
    <li> My 23 month old hates it when I mess with his mouth or nose, but he loves this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> My 2 boys love this toothpaste so much that I&#x27;m having a hard time transitioning them to using &amp;#34;big boy&amp;#34; toothpaste and spitting the toothpaste out. Oh well. If anyone knows of a big boy toothpaste that tastes similar to this one, I&#x27;d love to find out about it.</li>
    <li> So ok I&#x27;ll admit it, I tasted it.  It tastes great.  No wonder my kid wants to just grab the tube and suck the toothpaste out.  Anyways, the only gripe I have it that there is too little products in the tubes.</li>

So thank you. We will continue to use your product. Again, many thanks. Sincerely, M.A.T.</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly as offered.  Good price, good service.</li>
    <li> 2yr old now wants to brush his teeth every night before bed without us prompting him.</li>
