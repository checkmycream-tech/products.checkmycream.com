### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They are also great (the clippers, not my toenails) for hang nails or torn nails on the hands.  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t operate very smoothly.</li>
      <li>so the top part doesn&#x27;t swing off to the side when you&#x27;re trying to clip.</li>
      <li>Since it would cost more to return it, I threw it in the trash and took the loss.</li>
      <li>This is a very cool and innovative product.</li>
      <li>Nails are clipped easily, but skin does not clip well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>easy to use</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to drop while</li>
      <li>So easy that I now clip them before every practice session</li>
      <li>shame, otherwise a fine product.</li>
      <li>However, I accept that issue because it is a somewhat elegant design and constructed of beautiful stainless steel that looks to be a professional grade.</li>
      <li>This is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>no problem.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I find is the surface where your thumb is suppose to go, is rather smooth</li>
      <li>Overall a good product but needs some improvements.</li>
      <li>May be good for finger nails only.</li>
      <li>Yes, wear your reading glasses, but the damage on your nail is going to come off cleanly, quickly, and painlessly.</li>
      <li>These are slightly better that normal, but may help some folks a lot.</li>
      <li>My other wish would be that it would have had a shroud for catching nail clippings, as many of the newer clippers come with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a nicely designed tool, solidly made of what seems to be stainless steel, and it cuts fingernails very cleanly.</li>
      <li>Went right in the trash, not even worth returning.</li>
      <li>I have had 9 surgeries and my hands, arms and right shoulder with a lot of nerve damage.</li>
      <li>Truthfully, the Clip-Rights work in a much more natural way than standard clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Second, by virtue of the handle placement, I have much more leverage to squeeze the handle as I need to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody and surprised it&#x27;s so cheap for the quality.</li>
      <li>These clippers made it seemed like I was putting a hot knife thru butter.</li>
      <li>May be great for big beefy hands or feet - but not for smaller slender hands.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve been having difficulty with conventional clippers (I was, because my left thumb isn&#x27;t as strong or limber as it once was), this is a good solution.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be very different from regular clippers but always figure that you get a lot more if you pay a little more and bought it anyhow.</li>
      <li>said, I would certainly buy it again and recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>You will need to be respectful of this little tool, because it allows you to bring more clipping force to bear with less effort, but that&#x27;s exactly why I purchased it, so I see this as a positive.</li>
      <li>Same was true for the toe nails...</li>
      <li>The clipper is large compared with typical nail clippers and easy to use design.</li>
      <li>Stylish, heavy duty, well built.  </li>
      <li>I welcome any product that can make things a little less stressful for me.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just right for smaller toenails (women).</li>
      <li>It is big enough for toenails but worked fine on fingers for me.</li>
      <li>The quality is fine with a heavy grade stainless steel.  </li>
      <li>Trim fingernails have a huge impact on the clarity of the sound because longer finger nails prevent pressing the strings down hard enough on the fretboard.</li>
      <li>Very solid construction - it must be steel (surgical steel maybe) and holds a super sharp edge.</li>
      <li>This clipper is silent most of the time and it is hard to tell when the nail is cut.</li>
      <li>It cut well, looked nice, but was difficult to get under the finger nails.</li>
      <li>Recently, I began practicing my guitar which I last studied nearly 50 years ago.</li>
      <li>The reverse design from &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; clippers is the key ingredient that improves two major issues.</li>
      <li>I find that clipping them a couple of times a week keeps them trim enough but with traditional clippers this is challenging because of a combination of poor design and size.</li>
      <li>The clever, double lever action makes cutting even my thickest nails an easy task.</li>
      <li>MUCH more accurate and less painful than traditional clippers.  </li>
      <li>The leverage factor on these little clippers has really helped me out.  </li>

<li> The other unusual thing is that my regular clippers make a clicking sound when cutting.</li>
<li> The iClip nail clipper suffers from none of the design flaws that more traditional clippers do.</li>
<li> First, I noticed instantly that as I pushed the Clip-Right toward a fingertip, the device tends to seat into my grip, rather than tending to be forced out of my grip, as with other clippers.</li>
<li> I like to keep my nails trimmed at all times, therefore my nails are not that long to begin with.</li>
<li> What I didn&#x27;t like was the opening doesn&#x27;t seem wide enough.</li>
<li> They are ruggedly built and wide enough to cut my nails each in a single clip.</li>
<li> I am a bit portly in my old age, and it&#x27;s hard to reach my toenails.  </li>
<li> These clippers do not open wide enough to cut thick nails.  </li>
<li> I bought 3 of these - 1 for each child - they are too big for small hands, even on some adults.</li>
<li> Another thing I like is the fact that the blade edges are SHARP.  </li>
<li> But when I used it the 2nd time it was a bit easier..I did find it hard to press down.</li>
<li> It takes two hands just to push the handle down.  </li>
<li> there is a down side, it would be the heavier weight of this tool.</li>
<li> but the mouth or cutting maw dull and too narrow for easy positioning of toe nail.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m at the age where my hands and fingers work noticeably less nimbly than they used to, so</li>
<li> Just an odd size for me.  </li>
<li> You just need to take a little care with positioning the blades, because you can clip your skin as well as a nail if you get in too</li>
<li> The blade curvature is too curved so it ends up cutting into the middle of the big toenails.  </li>
<li> I really like the ergonomic cutting</li>
<li> I had trouble getting my fingernail in the device.</li>
<li> They work but are not easy if your hands are a bit arthritic ....</li>
<li> Unfortunately, they are too clunky for anyone but a person with big hands.</li>
<li> However, even though it&#x27;s small for a toenail clipper</li>
<li> Cutting my toenails was impossible for me because I just could not squeeze hard enough with any type of nail clipper that I had tried so far.</li>
<li> Junk bad to hold not sharp.</li>
<li> What makes it frustrating to use is the gap between the blade is so narrow it makes it difficult to use on toe nails, for finger nails</li>
<li> Added to that, my toenails are very thick.  </li>
<li> Difficult to use.  </li>
<li> the cutting part of the clipper does not close</li>
<li> My part had a chip out of the cutting edge.</li>
<li> I can clip my thickest toenails without hurting myself or being afraid of tearing my toes up.  </li>
<li> so it is impossible to clip nails.</li>
<li> Terrible product.  </li>
<li> Worthless!</li>
<li> Worst item I have ever purchased from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.</li>

    <li> I am a bit portly in my old age, and it&#x27;s hard to reach my toenails.  Added to that, my toenails are very thick.  The leverage factor on these little clippers has really helped me out.  I can clip my thickest toenails without hurting myself or being afraid of tearing my toes up.  They are also great (the clippers, not my toenails) for hang nails or torn nails on the hands.  MUCH more accurate and less painful than traditional clippers.  Another thing I like is the fact that the blade edges are SHARP.  Yes, wear your reading glasses, but the damage on your nail is going to come off cleanly, quickly, and painlessly.</li>
    <li> The clipper doesn&#x27;t open enough to take in nail.  Worthless!</li>
    <li> The clipper is large compared with typical nail clippers and easy to use design. What I didn&#x27;t like was the opening doesn&#x27;t seem wide enough. I had trouble getting my fingernail in the device. The other unusual thing is that my regular clippers make a clicking sound when cutting.

    <li> The quality is fine with a heavy grade stainless steel.

    <li> I have had 9 surgeries and my hands, arms and right shoulder with a lot of nerve damage. Cutting my toenails was impossible for me because I just could not squeeze hard enough with any type of nail clipper that I had tried so far.These clippers made it seemed like I was putting a hot knife thru butter.Took almost no effort. I recommend them for anyone with strength issues in their grip.</li>
    <li> easy to use but the mouth or cutting maw dull and too narrow for easy positioning of toe nail. Tends to tear instead of cut. Cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> You will need to be respectful of this little tool, because it allows you to bring more clipping force to bear with less effort, but that&#x27;s exactly why I purchased it, so I see this as a positive. If you&#x27;ve been having difficulty with conventional clippers (I was, because my left thumb isn&#x27;t as strong or limber as it once was), this is a good solution. You just need to take a little care with positioning the blades, because you can clip your skin as well as a nail if you get in too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nicely designed tool, solidly made of what seems to be stainless steel, and it cuts fingernails very cleanly.</li>
    <li> Junk. Went right in the trash, not even worth returning.</li>
    <li> This is a very cool and innovative product. I&#x27;m at the age where my hands and fingers work noticeably less nimbly than they used to, so I welcome any product that can make things a little less stressful for me.

    <li> Note: male reviewer (fingernail size issues)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  Stylish, heavy duty, well built.  I really like the ergonomic cutting design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  For me the size is a too small for cutting my big toenails but a great size for the rest.  The blade curvature is too curved so it ends up cutting into the middle of the big toenails.  However, even though it&#x27;s small for a toenail clipper it&#x27;s also too big for fingernails, except my thumbs.  Just an odd size for me.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just right for smaller toenails (women).</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be very different from regular clippers but always figure that you get a lot more if you pay a little more and bought it anyhow. Very solid construction - it must be steel (surgical steel maybe) and holds a super sharp edge. The ergonomic handle locks in place which is a surprise to me so the top part doesn&#x27;t swing off to the side when you&#x27;re trying to clip. I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody and surprised it&#x27;s so cheap for the quality. It is big enough for toenails but worked fine on fingers for me.</li>
    <li> These clippers do not open wide enough to cut thick nails.  May be good for finger nails only. Returned immediately.</li>
    <li> These clippers are quite sturdy, well-made, and will probably last until the next century. Unfortunately, they are too clunky for anyone but a person with big hands. Nails are clipped easily, but skin does not clip well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 3.5&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Height: 1.9&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Width: 0.3&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> They work but are not easy if your hands are a bit arthritic ....tried using the counter as leverage but that was only easier for one side.. Same was true for the toe nails...But when I used it the 2nd time it was a bit easier..I did find it hard to press down.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this clipper at all.  It takes two hands just to push the handle down.  Since it would cost more to return it, I threw it in the trash and took the loss.</li>
    <li> Junk bad to hold not sharp. My part had a chip out of the cutting edge.</li>
    <li> I was wanting clippers that arthritic hands could use. These are slightly better that normal, but may help some folks a lot. Oh, there is only 1 clipper in the package even though the blister has 2 spaces for them. I thought I was getting both fingernail and toenail clippers.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  Difficult to use.  Worst item I have ever purchased from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these - 1 for each child - they are too big for small hands, even on some adults. It cut well, looked nice, but was difficult to get under the finger nails. I like to keep my nails trimmed at all times, therefore my nails are not that long to begin with. You need to had sufficient nail length in order to get the edge under the nail. May be great for big beefy hands or feet - but not for smaller slender hands.</li>
    <li> am returning these.  the cutting part of the clipper does not close so it is impossible to clip nails. [maybe i got a dud clipper???]  would not recommend,</li>
    <li> Recently, I began practicing my guitar which I last studied nearly 50 years ago. Trim fingernails have a huge impact on the clarity of the sound because longer finger nails prevent pressing the strings down hard enough on the fretboard. I find that clipping them a couple of times a week keeps them trim enough but with traditional clippers this is challenging because of a combination of poor design and size. The iClip nail clipper suffers from none of the design flaws that more traditional clippers do. They are ruggedly built and wide enough to cut my nails each in a single clip. The clever, double lever action makes cutting even my thickest nails an easy task. So easy that I now clip them before every practice session and it only takes me a minute or so.</li>
