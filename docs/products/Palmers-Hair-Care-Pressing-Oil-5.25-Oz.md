      <li>I like  this hair care product because it feels great on my natural hair..</li>
      <li>Fast shipment good quality</li>
      <li>This make a wonderful product for my natural people who want to go straight without having to burn your hair.</li>
      <li>This pressing grease really does keep your hair straight longer and who knew it had protein in it a great addition</li>
      <li>Leaves hair shiny and light.</li>
      <li>I actually thought it was oil in a jar, lol</li>
      <li>It does have a light sent, some may find intrusive, I however did not.</li>
      <li>I can use this product sparingly with a warm pressing comb once a week and the hair stays straight and does not revert with humidity and rain.</li>
      <li>The only problem I had with this product is that it seems to work best when your hair is free of other products, but I like to also use a heat controlling product too, so it takes more time and care to get the desired results.</li>
      <li>Pretty good prodcut if you want to press natural hair</li>
      <li>LOVED IT , WAS LOOKING FOR THIS A LONG TIME.</li>
      <li>This product left my hair really soft and it smells great.</li>
      <li>Nice overall</li>
      <li>This feels like tack and doesn&#x27;t go on any better in my hair, It feels like trying to put old playdough in my hair.</li>
      <li>and you didn&#x27;t have to use very much while using the hot comb.</li>
      <li>and my hair STILL burns when using the hot comb.</li>
      <li>It also causes SO MUCH flakes!</li>
      <li>First time using something like this</li>
      <li>It is light, not heavy on the hair but holds heat for the hot comb.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t seen any flakes in awhile but after using this when I wash my hair on hair washing days my scalp crusts over during the week this whole product and</li>
      <li>Smallest amount is need otherwise it makes my hair very greasy.</li>
      <li>This has worked very well on my edges.</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful for African American or coarse hair; especially when straightening.  </li>
      <li>Not too much.  </li>
      <li>and I can use it if I don&#x27;t put too much on</li>
      <li>thank u so much</li>
      <li>I like this product very much&lt;</li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light oil hair, so it does&#x27;t bog down pressed hair.</li>
      <li>Mainly, I use this product to manage my style and to control unwanted frizz rather than to straighten.</li>
      <li>I only used it a few times so far, but works fairly well.  </li>
      <li>so glad I found this again had to look too hard for it.</li>
      <li>You do have to be careful as to how much you are putting on your hair as it is kind of thick.</li>
      <li>I use a classic hot-comb to get my 4C natural edges to lay very flat, this, along with a heat protectant</li>
      <li>This product had too much protein in it for my hair which made my sponge like hair dry like a brillo pad.</li>
      <li>I have to learn the right amount to use or it weighs my hair down.</li>
      <li>But anyways maybe my hair lost was due to using heat for the first time in 5 years.</li>
      <li>This makes my hair so soft and makes it feel as if it has been deeply conditioned.</li>
      <li>but I tried is last night and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel brittle or rough after hot combing my hair.</li>

    <li> This makes my hair so soft and makes it feel as if it has been deeply conditioned. I add an equal drop of pomegranate oil and rosemary oil. This pressing oil is very light, which is fantastic!</li>

    <li> was an excellent product for pressing hair. it work well and you didn&#x27;t have to use very much while using the hot comb.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very light oil hair, so it does&#x27;t bog down pressed hair. I definitely plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> This feels like tack and doesn&#x27;t go on any better in my hair, It feels like trying to put old playdough in my hair. It sticks to it and my hair STILL burns when using the hot comb. It also causes SO MUCH flakes! I hadn&#x27;t seen any flakes in awhile but after using this when I wash my hair on hair washing days my scalp crusts over during the week this whole product and it&#x27;s side/after effects are gross! I would not recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well too. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and its very light. Package came on time. I did not have any problems. Would recommend.</li>

    <li> I like  this hair care product because it feels great on my natural hair.. And it make your hair shine..</li>
    <li> Always  pleased with  Palmers  products</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because of the great reviews. When the item came in the mail it was Hair Milk instead of Pressing Oil. I thought it would be a simple fix. Wrong, first they asked me to send an image of the bar code which I did. Then they said sorry about the inconvenience you can use the product or if you return it we will compensate you $2.00. The product was $6.00 which isn&#x27;t a lot but they refuse to send me the product I paid for. I will NEVER order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Perfect don&#x27;t go changing anything about this product.It&#x27;s perfect as it is !!!so glad I found this again had to look too hard for it.</li>
    <li> I only used it a few times so far, but works fairly well.  I will use it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment good quality</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for African American or coarse hair; especially when straightening.  It leaves the hair shiny but not greasy! I received this product before the scheduled arrival date.  I&#x27;m a Cosmetologists and my clients love this product!</li>
    <li> Very Good, made the hair feel good and was very shiny, worked well with the Hot Comb, do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this product 5-6 times total in a 3 week spand, using before I straightened my hair with a low heat temperature curling iron (temperature settings were 1-25. I used temperture setting #&#x27;s 11 &amp; 13) for my hair in which I had to go over 2-3 times and my hair was still thick as hell being 75% un-straightened and 80% stretched if that makes any sense. This product had too much protein in it for my hair which made my sponge like hair dry like a brillo pad. Now, the first time that I used Palmers pressing oil formula it made my super thick hair feel soft like cotton, but after 3 wks my ends started breaking off really bad. I lost 4 1/2 inches of hair out of 10 inches. I was devastated for the simple fact that I had been using 100% organic products for the last 5 years (meaning NO heat/chemicals/parabens/mineral oil, etc. But anyways maybe my hair lost was due to using heat for the first time in 5 years. Its a mystery to me, I don&#x27;t know...Apparently my 4C hair is way to thick to fall flat, and flow. I think that I will try the African threading method next time.</li>
    <li> It worked like a charm and that is saying a lot because my hair is thick.</li>
    <li> I liked fact I did not have to leave my house or go to the store. Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea!</li>
    <li> Not for my type of hair....</li>
    <li> LOVED IT , WAS LOOKING FOR THIS A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> Worked really realy great have had the one container for more than a year and still going strong!!!! Would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love the product it is perfect for my hair gives it a smooth very straight look, feel and shine.</li>
    <li> Pretty good prodcut if you want to press natural hair</li>
    <li> Smallest amount is need otherwise it makes my hair very greasy.</li>
