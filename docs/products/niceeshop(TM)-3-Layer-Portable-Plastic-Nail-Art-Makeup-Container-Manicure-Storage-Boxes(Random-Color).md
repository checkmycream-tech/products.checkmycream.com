      <li>I love it just what I needed for all my polish</li>
      <li>It was OK</li>

      <li>Nice for organizing nail polish, but cracked the first day I got it.  </li>
      <li>The lid cracked and broke the first time I used it, but it does keep all of my polish in one spot, and makes it very easy to find the colors I want.  </li>
      <li>so it cannot fit anything taller than 2 inches inside.</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>So you have to store them on their side to fit.</li>
      <li>Good for a young child to store things.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my six year old and her Shopkins collection of tiny figurines.</li>
      <li>Good to put your essential oils in</li>

      <li>Exactly as described - great little organizer for any type of crafting items.  </li>

      <li>This is a nice way to organize my ReMent and other miniatures.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this unless it&#x27;s for a tween that doesn&#x27;t have much stuff.</li>
      <li>My friend love it small just right for her.</li>
      <li>The material was much flimsier than I expected and once filled with polish and files the caddie was very unstable when carrying it.</li>
      <li>It was much smaller than we thought, and nail polishes don&#x27;t fit, but it&#x27;s good for other small things.</li>
      <li>It is big enough to fit my nail tips and glue.</li>
      <li>i gave it to my 12 yr old daughter to organize her Monster High doll clothes and accessories (which works great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shipping does take a few weeks as stated, but it was worth the wait!</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife thinking you can fit a regular nail polish, but the boxes was way to small.</li>

      <li>much smaller then this and also blue not pink.</li>
      <li>She only use this one for beads, needles and other small stuff that can fit in it..</li>

<li> She only use this one for beads, needles and other small stuff that can fit in it..</li>
<li> Entire 3 tiered box is about 7 inches wide&amp; deep by about 8 inches tall.</li>
<li> Although it is advertized as such, it is not large enough for nail polish!</li>
<li> I got the white one instead of the pink 1</li>
<li> Also, it came in white instead of pink.</li>
<li> I just wish it was a little bigger, just an inch or 2 would do it.</li>
<li> I wanted pink</li>
<li> I thought I was receiving  a pink one  </li>
<li> When I carry or my wife carried the caddie we must hold the handle with on hand and support the bottom with the other in fear that it will separate between layers and come crashing to the floor.</li>
<li> Not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
<li> Had to purchase other boxes for them.</li>
<li> Container is not even half the size listed here, buyer beware.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s less sturdy than I thought it would be, but I don&#x27;t have to lug around my stuff, so it does what I bought it to do.</li>
<li> Each little compartment is 3in X 2in X 2in.</li>
<li> but I purchased this product to store my little girl hair bows in here</li>
<li> The plastic  is heavy duty, so I am not worried about having it break.  </li>
<li> not what i exspected its small</li>
<li> Wrong color and smaller</li>
<li> Was what I needed however not very happy that all the trays were cracked or broken in some way</li>
<li> The item that I received was broken.</li>
<li> One was broken when received.</li>
<li> It is false advertising.</li>
<li> NOT a good idea!</li>
<li> I was skeptical about this product due to the bad reviews</li>
<li> It says you receive a random color, and the one I received is a sort of coral color.  </li>
<li> Item not as shown not to mention the fact that they wanted me to take a loss because of their false advertising now I&#x27;m stuck with this garbage!</li>
<li> They do not lock well together and afraid to carry when locked.</li>
<li> very disappointed</li>
<li> I am very disappointed and unsaticified with this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wrong color and smaller</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> not what i exspected its small</li>
    <li> I wanted pink but I got a blue one.</li>
    <li> I bought this to organize my manicure stuff and nail polish (based on the title). BUT, the height of the individual compartments are not deep enough for any of my nail polishes to stand up. So you have to store them on their side to fit. (Which isn&#x27;t what I wanted). i gave it to my 12 yr old daughter to organize her Monster High doll clothes and accessories (which works great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars, because the design is cute, it is sturdy, and it can be very useful for other things. I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for nail polish organization.</li>
    <li> did not receive correct one.  much smaller then this and also blue not pink. very disappointed</li>
    <li> This is WAY smaller than pictured. It is big enough to fit my nail tips and glue. It will work for what I wanted but was expecting more.</li>
    <li> Good to put your essential oils in</li>
    <li> Each little compartment is 3in X 2in X 2in. They were not deep enough for my wife&#x27;s polish to stand (2 inches) so they all had to be laid on thier sides. Some of the larger bottles had to have the divider removed so they could lay to take up two compartments. The material was much flimsier than I expected and once filled with polish and files the caddie was very unstable when carrying it. When I carry or my wife carried the caddie we must hold the handle with on hand and support the bottom with the other in fear that it will separate between layers and come crashing to the floor. The whole thing measures about 7 in tall X 6 1/2 in wide X 9 5/8 in long. The sides are so thin/flimsy they bow out. Don&#x27;t buy this unless it&#x27;s for a tween that doesn&#x27;t have much stuff.</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;Bernardine</li>
    <li> I am pleased for the most part.. good deal for what it cost. I took most of the square dividers out though as it was easier to store my things. Yes I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good quality - nice to keep my essential oils in.</li>
    <li> perfect for the  millions lol of polishes my daughters have</li>
    <li> I love it. It makes it easier to do designs.</li>
    <li> I love it just what I needed for all my polish</li>
    <li> Was what I needed however not very happy that all the trays were cracked or broken in some way</li>
    <li> It came to me in pieces going to send back.</li>
    <li> Nice for organizing nail polish, but cracked the first day I got it.  Cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product due to the bad reviews but I purchased this product to store my little girl hair bows in here and it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m about to order another one.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described - great little organizer for any type of crafting items.  I am using it to store safety eyes for my crochet projects.  I like the individual compartments and the ability to infinitely stack the case if you order more than 1 (I am considering purchasing another).  The plastic  is heavy duty, so I am not worried about having it break.  Very cute :)  It says you receive a random color, and the one I received is a sort of coral color.  The shipping does take a few weeks as stated, but it was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> is convenient for storage of sewing but NOT used to store nail polish</li>
    <li> It works for my nail polishes and containers of foil.  I just wish it was a little bigger, just an inch or 2 would do it.</li>
    <li> I got the white one instead of the pink 1 otherwise it would been a 5 star</li>
    <li> Item not as shown not to mention the fact that they wanted me to take a loss because of their false advertising now I&#x27;m stuck with this garbage!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed and unsaticified with this product. It is false advertising. This container is about 6•6 but I was supposed to receive a container 15•5•5. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> I bought this container for my neice to use as a nail polish organizer. NOT a good idea! Although it is advertized as such, it is not large enough for nail polish!</li>
    <li> Good for a young child to store things.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of them but one was cracked and broken at the top. This is a nice way to organize my ReMent and other miniatures.</li>
    <li> Great storage for nail polish with adjustable compartments!</li>
    <li> Item described is not what was shipped. Container is not even half the size listed here, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading on the actual size. I was still able to use it. It&#x27;s just smaller than what I imagined. Also, it came in white instead of pink.</li>
    <li> The item that I received was broken.</li>
    <li> Great gift to store nail polish.</li>
    <li> My friend love it small just right for her.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was expecting. Entire 3 tiered box is about 7 inches wide&amp; deep by about 8 inches tall. Each tier is about two inches tall so it cannot fit anything taller than 2 inches inside. I bought it for nail polish storage, it&#x27;s not going to work for that but I can use it for some of my smaller nail art pens and pots of nail decorations.</li>
    <li> This is more for art than it is for bottles of polish. It does hold my smaller bottles though.  The lid cracked and broke the first time I used it, but it does keep all of my polish in one spot, and makes it very easy to find the colors I want.  It&#x27;s less sturdy than I thought it would be, but I don&#x27;t have to lug around my stuff, so it does what I bought it to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife thinking you can fit a regular nail polish, but the boxes was way to small. She only use this one for beads, needles and other small stuff that can fit in it..</li>
    <li> It does what I need it to do but I think I will need another to connect to it. Overall, sturdy and nice.</li>
    <li> Great container for my nail tips arrived early and in tact I got a blue one which is great since I loathe pink</li>
    <li> Perfect for my six year old and her Shopkins collection of tiny figurines. Will have to buy another one soon!</li>
    <li> It was OK I thought I was receiving  a pink one  and the lid was cracked.  Also it wasn&#x27;t  tall enough for my finger nail bottles</li>
    <li> It was much smaller than we thought, and nail polishes don&#x27;t fit, but it&#x27;s good for other small things.</li>
    <li> One was broken when received. They do not lock well together and afraid to carry when locked. The compartments are expandable but the plastic dividers do not touch the bottom so items slide under and you have to put only larger items in to keep them divided.  I so buttons and that does not work well. Had to purchase other boxes for them. Would not purchase this item again.</li>
