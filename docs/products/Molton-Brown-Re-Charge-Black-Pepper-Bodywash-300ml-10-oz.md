      <li>Great from those special dinners or nights out on the town with my Mom.</li>
      <li>My most favorite Body Wash ever!</li>
      <li>I found that the best way to apply this wash is directly with my hands, though I image a sponge would do the job as well.  </li>
      <li>One of their better scents.. and the scent lingers throughout the day which is nice.</li>
      <li>I liked this product but my wife loves it even more</li>
      <li>The original formula had a great strong scent.  </li>
      <li>scent,\\&quot; because it&#x27;s strong without being overpowering, and it&#x27;s a warm scent, without being feminine in any way.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed this body wash and the scent is nice and not too strong once it has rinsed off.  </li>
      <li>better than the SilverBirch</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d call it \\&quot;a handsome</li>
      <li>will look for better products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Sept 2012</li>
      <li>I actually love this stuff.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better than advertised.</li>
      <li>Yes, it most decidedly is.  </li>
      <li>month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite bodywash of all time when I found it 7 years ago.</li>
      <li>I love this one, invigorating, sexy, manly, makes me want to share it with a lady.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite body washes...</li>
      <li>Definitely more for people going for a \\&quot;rustic\\&quot; aura.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love anything Molton Brown.</li>
      <li>and I have received many compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so totally overwhelming that I avoided him like the plague the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>Love this body wash, but don&#x27;t love the price.  </li>
      <li>but i love the smell.</li>
      <li>Then I knew there must be a product out there causing this overwhelming stink.</li>
      <li>and the people who smell you will love this.  </li>
      <li>Functionally, this product cleans very well and leaves a very nice scent about you.  </li>
      <li>High quality and great aroma though.</li>
      <li>This is a very popular high end product.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very true to its description.  </li>
      <li>The scent is amazing, and it will keep you fresh feeling and smelling all day and night.</li>
      <li>A friend recommended it to me because it is her stepfather&#x27;s favorite scent and thought my boyfriend might enjoy it as well.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it was for men, until I went to buy another full sized bottle for myself!</li>
      <li>Many of my female friends comment on the great smell.</li>
      <li>, the smell is strong and stays on the body for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s got one of the most distinctive and masculine scents: if you work in an office and don&#x27;t want to wear cologne, this is a great morning shower alternative to show up smelling clean and feeling great without possibly offending colleagues / co-workers.  </li>
      <li>This body wash is hands down the best I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>It smells very manly, and women love it!</li>
      <li>It really does smell amazing and wakes me up every morning.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and</li>
      <li>It makes me wonder if this is the genuine article and, if so, if it has been watered</li>
      <li>Still, I end up overlooking that because it really does smell great, is intense, and lathers up well</li>
      <li>Leaves me feeling very fresh without being overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Simply put, you&#x27;re paying around $40 for a somewhat meger amount of very nice smelling soap.  </li>
      <li>First time I used it, I put way more than I needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unique fragrance.</li>
      <li>Gone are my cheap, super market body washes.</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to using the  product after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>First I love this stuff, leaves you feeling clean, fresh and my GF attacked me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is so good my girlfriend was stealing it from me.  Only downer is the price tag, but you pay for what you get.  I am a believer.</li>
    <li> My son introduced me to Molton Brown, and at first I thought \\&quot;what&#x27;s the big deal\\&quot;, but after using it, I realize it lasts long after the shower, and although it might be thought of as a masculine scent....it could be used for male or female....fantastic product!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best bodywash ever.  My roommate Mike starting using this product before he would go out on the weekends.  After Mike came back from his first night using the bodywash (he came back in the morning) he told us how girls were literally following him around and sitting next to him so they could keep smelling him.  While the product is one of the better smells I&#x27;ve experienced, at the time I thought Mike was exaggerating.  A few days later my girlfriend was over at the house.  Mike had just taken a shower and gotten dressed and was walking past us to get in the kitchen.  My girlfriend smelled Mike as he passed and, without thinking about it, started following him in to the kitchen to keep up with the scent.  Yeah, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I have been won over.  Gone are my cheap, super market body washes. This smells and feels great. (Black pepper isn&#x27;t the aspect I&#x27;d highlight, as it&#x27;s a pleasantly musky, but mild scent and not overly peppery on the nose.) And a little can go a long way, so I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love anything Molton Brown. This is one of my favorite body washes... One of their better scents.. and the scent lingers throughout the day which is nice.</li>
    <li> Ran across this product while buying shaving soap.  The \\&quot;Black Pepper\\&quot; got my attention and although I thought it was pretty pricey I decided to try it.  Although my vocabulary is weak when it comes to describing scents, I would say this was refreshingly masculine and aromatic. Leaves me feeling very fresh without being overpowering.  Can&#x27;t say any females at work have come rushing up to me to tear my clothes off while screaming to know what the scent is but my wife has said she finds it quite nice.  If you&#x27;re on the fence as whether to try it or not I&#x27;d say to go ahead and pamper yourself.  I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This made a great gift for my husband.  It smells wonderful.  I tried it myself and found it too \\&quot;manly\\&quot; of a smell for me, but smells great on him.  Lathers well. I think it would make a great gift for any man, from a quality brand.</li>
    <li> I read rave reviews about it online and hence got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the smell is strong and stays on the body for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the lather produced is to enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am not sure how well it cleans the body. It certainly does not exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably not buy a new one when this finishes. will look for better products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Sept 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a year now. The bottle lasted me for almost a year, using it almost 20 days a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the product. I had remarked earlier I will discontinue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I change my mind. I will continue with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this  for my son and loved when  he used it, it has a lovely spicy scent than doesnt smell like  pepper but is warm and spicy. Well worth the $$</li>
    <li> Found out about this mens line through a Magazine -husband and I love the clean unique scent looking forward to trying other items and fragrances in the Molton brown line</li>
    <li> I just discovered the Molton Brown Black Pepper collection, this stuff is made from peppercorn oils. The reason I was looking was to solve a mystery. This past week at work I&#x27;ve heard several of the guys complaining in disgust about how bad one of our co-workers smells. And sure enough he came over to talk to me and I wanted to vomit. He smelled like 185 pounds of black pepper, I could only imagine he had eaten a PepperCorn encrusted steak the night before and it was all coming out of his pores. It&#x27;s so totally overwhelming that I avoided him like the plague the rest of the day. I work in an aircraft factory with lots of fans to blow air around on people, but within 6 feet of this guy it&#x27;s all about peppercorns. Then I went down to see my wife where she is putting on a summer camp for Civil Air Patrol Cadets.....she had my pickup and I needed it. But when I got in.....\\&quot;Oh God NO\\&quot;.....there was that same smell. I don&#x27;t know who she let ride in there but it better not happen again! Then I knew there must be a product out there causing this overwhelming stink. Leave it to the Brits......Molton Brown&#x27;s Black Pepper collection, eu de Toilete, and Body Wash. Now that I know who the enemy is......I can educate the other guys at work to drop enough polite (or otherwise) hints and get this guy to stop using these products. Believe me......it isn&#x27;t pleasant,it isn&#x27;t masculine, it&#x27;s awful. I may get a squirt gun and fill it with Old Spice just to expedite his education!</li>
    <li> I highly urge anyone buying this product to ask for the COMPLETE ingredients list from the manufacturer (there&#x27;s a reason why they ask you to call them and not disclose all ingredients on their website).  Many of the ingredients have been generally rejected by the beauty industry a long time ago, yet this company still uses them, e.g. Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Propylene Glycol, Synthetic Coloring agents, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning mine promptly for false / misrepresented advertising.  They claim antioxidant rich, lol, what good are these \\&quot;anti-oxidants\\&quot; in a chemical stew?</li>
    <li> This body wash is hands down the best I have ever used.  It has a very pleasant sent and does not leave any lingering residue on your skin.  My only regret is that my kids have discovered it in the shower and I am now plowing through it three times as fast...</li>
    <li> My son bought this for me and I love it!  It is truely a unisex fragrance.  I have purchased more since and also the eau de toilet.  I don&#x27;t care much for floral fragrances.  Black Pepper is refreshing, clean and invigoating!!  You really need to try it!</li>
    <li> Really, my husband should be writing this review, since he uses this product every day. I love it, however, because it smells so wonderful. I&#x27;d call it \\&quot;a handsome scent,\\&quot; because it&#x27;s strong without being overpowering, and it&#x27;s a warm scent, without being feminine in any way. He used this product first on our honeymoon, provided by our B&amp;B, and hasn&#x27;t stopped using it since. Expensive, but a little goes a long way (I think he uses about a dime sized amount per day).</li>
    <li> Luxurious soap and amazing, lasting scent but too expensive for a regular purchase and use. I started using Dr. Bonner&#x27;s which hydrates less and doesn&#x27;t carry this amazing scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he really loves the scent. It&#x27;s manly without being too overpowering. However, this body wash is very expensive. I would only buy/use it on special occasions.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my boyfriend for his birthday and both of us are thrilled with the purchase.  A friend recommended it to me because it is her stepfather&#x27;s favorite scent and thought my boyfriend might enjoy it as well.  The scent is very true to its description.  It is spicy and masculine without being overpowering.   This was a plus to me when buying it for my boyfriend because I often find male grooming products to be too heavily perfumed.  This one succeeded at having a distinguishable aroma without being over powering, a perfect compromise.  My boyfriend enjoys that it cleans well and smells great while he&#x27;s in the shower.  I appreciate that I the scent has longevity so I can often continue to smell it distinctly long after he has been out of the shower.  I never noticed this before with the body washes and face washes he previously used.  The only thing I will say about it was that my boyfriend did comment that the scent was \\&quot;different\\&quot; and probably not something he would have picked out himself.  This is largely subjective of course.  However, a man who is not adventurous in his scents may not want to take a risk on this product.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and while pricy, delivers a wonderful scent for the money.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas last year, and he requested it again this year.  He was really happy to find it in his Christmas stocking!</li>
    <li> I love this one, invigorating, sexy, manly, makes me want to share it with a lady.  It lasts a good while too.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells clean and masculine, it last all day long and leaves you feeling refreshed and ready to start your day.  A little on the expensive side, but I would buy this product again in a heartbeat.  If you ladies are looking for something for your man for X-mas or Father&#x27;s day this is the one.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but my wife loves it even more and I have received many compliments on it.  A very manly scent.</li>
    <li> Good scent in the morning, wakes me up, makes me feel like the Alpha I am and I step out of the shower ready to conquer the femininas and the no talent rookies in the office.  Babes seem to like it too, but that&#x27;s probably more me than the body-wash, either way, highly recommend, and Ill prob try some of their other scents when I run out of this one.</li>
    <li> My mother gave me a sample she had gotten at a resort in Mexico. I loved the scent and used the small travel sized bottle immediately! I didn&#x27;t realize it was for men, until I went to buy another full sized bottle for myself! My boyfriend loves this stuff too! Well worth the price, as a little goes a long way! And a great gift idea for a man or woman- sure to please those hard to buy for people!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great!  However, I have been using colloidal silver deodorant because I tend to get a skin reaction if I use the regular stick deodorant.  This stuff interacted with the deodorant and gave me a rash for a while.  I went back to just using the deodorant.  Rash disappeared soon after.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on DetailsForMen.com and figured I&#x27;d see what this was about since it got glowing reviews. Everyone is right,this stuff is great! I figured showering with pepper would be odd but hey, why not. I was getting tired of the &#x27;Mountain Fresh\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sport\\&quot; scents anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not overpowering and you can feel the warming powers of it as soon as you start to lather up. I definitely feel more invigorated in the morning but it could just me playing mind games with myself. A little goes a long way so start off small. First time I used it, I put way more than I needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real &#x27;complaint&#x27; is that the bottle is a bit small (300 ml) for the price compared to your normal department store products. I realize this is a premium product, but being a guy I&#x27;m not use to paying a lot for things like this. Was it worth it? Yes but a bit of sticker shock is all I&#x27;m saying. If you&#x27;re on the fence about the product, I&#x27;m telling you that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> See review of Bracing Silverbirch.  My son was so impressed with this product that  he requested it as a Xmas gift.</li>
    <li> He love LOVES this product! I&#x27;m surprised this is not available in stores anywhere. I never thought I would pay $30 for body wash, but this is definitely worth it. A little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling body wash, Had a lot of compliments while using it.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using the  product after reading so many positive reviews.  Obviously smell is a very personal thing, but I was not impressed.  I was hoping for  a clean , fresh  masculine scent.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t meet any of those criteria.. Its hard to describe but  it&#x27;s sort of a combination of  the  1960&#x27;s \\&quot;white bottle\\&quot; old spice, with  a bit of cigarette ash, medicine ( Iodine)  and maybe twigs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very strong when using it, but the smell mellows after the rinse, and at that point its not too bad. The smell does stay with you for the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel that it is worth $30.00, especially with the small size of the bottle. Additionally it doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
    <li> This is a very popular high end product.  It&#x27;s worth every dollar.  Highly concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.  If you can believe it........it&#x27;s better than advertised.</li>
    <li> My most favorite Body Wash ever! I just cannot afford it...&lt;br /&gt;If Molton Brown ever has a sale I am there. I will have to stick to $5 body wash for now.</li>
    <li> Love this body wash, but don&#x27;t love the price.  I ended up switching to a similar one that is made by Everyman Jack</li>
    <li> Ok. It&#x27;s for me. Do I care??!! Absolutely not!!! I love the subtle fragrance and the way it lathers in the bath</li>
    <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t lather well, and the smell can be overpowering at times.  I really didn&#x27;t find it worth the price tag and will be buying cheaper products from now on.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last 10 years, it has a distinct and powerful scent. Many of my female friends comment on the great smell.</li>
    <li> Molton Brown are the best. I wish I had shares in this company. I will never use regular body wash again. The after smell lasts for hours. A++</li>
    <li> This body wash is great, my room mates always use it unless I keep it hidden in my room. One bottle lasts me about two months, so it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Some of the other reviews are well-appreciated, regarding the chemicals in this bodywash.  Still, I end up overlooking that because it really does smell great, is intense, and lathers up well (so you don&#x27;t need that much).  Also, it&#x27;s got one of the most distinctive and masculine scents: if you work in an office and don&#x27;t want to wear cologne, this is a great morning shower alternative to show up smelling clean and feeling great without possibly offending colleagues / co-workers.  I tried the Pecksniff&#x27;s and sniffily returned to this.</li>
    <li> After reading a good deal of reviews for &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; bodywashes, I finally bought a bottle of Molton Brown Re-Charge Black Pepper.  I wanted something that both cleaned well and left a distinct, pleasant fragrance without getting into the Tom Ford Private Blend price range, and this fits the bill pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good.  If you&#x27;re concerned with the presentation of your bathroom, this wash is finely packaged and will look very good sitting by itself.  Functionally, this product cleans very well and leaves a very nice scent about you.  It&#x27;s masculine, clean, understated, and relativity unique.  I&#x27;d liken it to a fine oil-and-spice aroma rather than the traditional perfume-like smell of standard bodywashes.  It won&#x27;t be overly pronounced to others around you, but when they get close, they&#x27;ll notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash cleans very well.  During and after washing with this, it leaves an ever-so-slight tingle on the skin that lingers for a while.  It&#x27;s certainly not as strong as menthol, but it is noticeable.  I have pretty sensitive skin and yet this manages to not upset any part of my body.  The feeling it leaves you with is one of being exceptionally well washed -- it&#x27;s a very, very nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the not so good.  I hadn&#x27;t used Molton Brown bodywashes before or payed much attention to the volume of the actual bottle, so once my order arrived I was a bit surprised at how little there was.  Yes, I should have realized that 300 mL isn&#x27;t a lot, but how often do we note the size of the stuff that we use to wash with?  Simply put, you&#x27;re paying around $40 for a somewhat meger amount of very nice smelling soap.  If you use a standard bodywash, then this is roughly eight times the price for two-thirds the volume of wash that you&#x27;d normally get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second grip concerns the lather.  The water where I live is fairly soft, so most soaps lather up quite nicely.  Re-charge Black Pepper doesn&#x27;t quite seem to foam up into a rich consistency which is slightly disappointing.  I found that the best way to apply this wash is directly with my hands, though I image a sponge would do the job as well.  The result of its mediocre lather is that you have to use a bit more than you&#x27;d like to completely clean yourself, and combined with the high price-per-litre, you&#x27;re going to go through your forty-dollar bodywash faster than you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is this product worth it?  Yes, it most decidedly is.  It smells fantastic both on you and in your bathroom, and it leaves you feeling exceptionally clean while being surprisingly gentle to your skin.  Is it a questionable value for the money?  Well, yeah.  It&#x27;s certainly more of a luxury item, but if you&#x27;re even considering dropping $40 on soap, chances are you can afford a little treat for you or your special someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You and the people who smell you will love this.  Four stars.</li>
    <li> Decided to go for this product after seeing the user reviews.Well frankly this did&#x27;nt live up to the expectations.The aroma does&#x27;nt stay for long enough and also this isn&#x27;t a great scent.I would say this is just another body wash with nothing special,except for the much hype created by others.</li>
    <li> First I love this stuff, leaves you feeling clean, fresh and my GF attacked me.  It really does smell amazing and wakes me up every morning.&lt;br /&gt;But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather isn&#x27;t that great so you end up using a little more.  For a product this expensive you should be using less not more.  And yes I mentioned expensive.  The price is a drawback.  There are other brands that get the job done for a lot cheaper.  I just wished they smelled this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:  Use a loofa or lather gloves.  Helps save some money.</li>
    <li> I have been using only molton brown soap for years.  This is a scent made for men.  The bottle may seem expensive but a little soap goes a long way.  You will never find a woman who does not think the scent is amazing.  Highly recommend the Re-charge Black Pepper to everyone. You will never go back to plain soap again, and yes they will all seem plain after using this.</li>
    <li> Recommended for luxury bathers. The fragrance is amazing. The other fragrances that Molton Brown has to offer don&#x27;t compare. Even other products labeled under the &amp;#34;Black Pepper&amp;#34; scent do not compare. This was just a great mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, this is a luxury product. It is rather pricey for a small bottle. BUT, do realize that it lathers well. In terms of cost-time analysis, I probably use 1 bottle for as long as I use 2-3 bottles of something cheap like Old Spice body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really shouldn&#x27;t dismiss this product until you smell it!</li>
    <li> My Husband loves this. Nice spicy scent with good suds. Could be less expensive.</li>
    <li> My dad saw this body wash in Men&#x27;s Health Magazine and he asked me to order it for him. He&#x27;s been raving about it ever since he first used it. It smells great without being overbearing. We call it \\&quot;the peppery man smell\\&quot; because that would explain its scent in a nutshell. I would definitely recommend this body wash. Great from those special dinners or nights out on the town with my Mom.</li>
    <li> I like to have several different body wash scents and I really like this one.  The quality is very good so you only need a small amount.  I will buy another when mine is gone.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t ordered Molton Brown products in a while, but things have really changed in their production process since my last purchase.  The Body Wash now has the consistency of water, as opposed to the thick, luxurious gel-like consistency in the past.  The product still lathers up well -- just strange how watery it is.  It makes me wonder if this is the genuine article and, if so, if it has been watered down.&lt;br /&gt;The odor of this product is also strange to me, but that&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.  If I were in a hotel and this was the bodywash on offer, I would not have used it out of fear that it was somehow contaminated.  &amp;#34;Black Pepper&amp;#34; is not what comes to mind when I smell this.  &amp;#34;Wet dog&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Soiled smoker&#x27;s 1975 Chevy Vega interior&amp;#34; do, though.  Some may find the odor comforting or manly, but I find suspicious and odd.</li>
    <li> I actually love this stuff. I gave it four stars.. leaving off the fifth star simply as a warning to consumers that this product is not for everyone. It&#x27;s incredibly unique and deeply layered, but I can see it being very polarizing. It has vague hints of whiskey and even ashtrays, but in a familiar, welcoming way. Definitely more for people going for a \\&quot;rustic\\&quot; aura.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite bodywash of all time when I found it 7 years ago. I just love the smell and it is a high quality product. the price has gone up over the years and I&#x27;m reluctant to continue purchasing it for it&#x27;s high price point. It started out around $22 dollars and now it&#x27;s over $30. High quality and great aroma though.</li>
    <li> It smells very manly, and i like it. The only downside i would say is that it is a little pricey.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent and body wash, it really is a treat for your senses. I look forward to taking my showers when I have this stuff! It smells very manly, and women love it! The only cons are that it doesn&#x27;t lather quite as much as some soaps so you need to use a good amount of it which makes it very expensive to buy. I treat myself to it a few times a year, but if it was cheaper this would be the only body wash I use.</li>
    <li> Where did the Molton Brown people get the technology to bottle awesomeness? This is probably the greatest body wash known to man and some chimps....... I honestly think that Thor uses this same body wash.</li>
    <li> Unique fragrance. Lasting.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT...FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> The best of the lot!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could have given it another star, I would have&lt;br /&gt;Even better than the SilverBirch</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this body wash and the scent is nice and not too strong once it has rinsed off.  If you are on the fence about buying this like I was I suggest taking the gamble.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It is a little pricey, but trust me it is worth it. If you tired of smelling like a middle school locker room, give this a try. Very grown up masculine scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased the bodywash for my son&#x27;s birthday.  He had previously tried the bar soap and mentioned he would like to try the bodywash.  Because of the high price, I knew he wouldn&#x27;t run out and buy it for himself.  He raves about the products and loves how the scent stays with him, long after showering.  All the more reason it makes a great gift.  I love getting him things that he might not splurge on for himself!!</li>
    <li> Molton Brown changed their formulation for this product and it is now not as good.  The original formula had a great strong scent.  This new formula (as admitted by Molton Brown) is more muted and has very little scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They took a great thing and messed it up.  Too bad.  I won&#x27;t buy again until they go back to the original formula.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer for christmas. Its a bit pricey for body wash but i love the smell. Highly recommended for you gentleman looking for a manly smelling body wash.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I purchased some of the other scents as well.  Simply Perfect!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best bodywash that I have ever known of.  The scent is amazing, and it will keep you fresh feeling and smelling all day and night.</li>
