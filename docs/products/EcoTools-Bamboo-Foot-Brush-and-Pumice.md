      <li>Otherwise great product.</li>
      <li>Great product over all however.</li>
      <li>Great brush...</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>With good care it&#x27;s holding up well, feels good on one&#x27;s tootsies, and does an excellent job.  </li>
      <li>Very handy</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE, July 2013:&lt;br /&gt;After using this brush all this while, it still works great but the drawback I noticed is that the glue used to stick the pumice to the bamboo isn&#x27;t usually very strong.</li>
      <li>Thank you for your exceptional business.</li>
      <li>but boy am I glad I bought it!</li>
      <li>It has become a part of my shower ritual, and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s been so effective.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice foot brush.  </li>
      <li>I love all three.</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>I guess it is okay as it did work.</li>
      <li>Satisfied...</li>
      <li>Recommended... : )</li>
      <li>This allows me to clean in between toes easily.</li>
      <li>If I would have paid more for the file/brush I would have been more upset, but at around $5 I guess I cannot complain too much.</li>
      <li>After the first scrub my feet were SO smooth, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
      <li>Ok brush, bristles are really soft, pumice stone was cracked when I received it, but stayed attached, still searching for a better brush.</li>
      <li>Ecotools definitely makes good products; I have their other foot scrubber and it works great too</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m prone to callouses being a runner, so found this for in the shower quick scrubbing.</li>
      <li>I wanted it for dry brushing skin, which is good for circulation.</li>
      <li>One can&#x27;t just use any old scrub brush on our feet as most of us</li>
      <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right.</li>
      <li>I opted to use something like this more frequently for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>This brush allows one to keep up the pressure for a longer period of scrubbing that really gets ones feet clean.  </li>
      <li>I recommend hanging the brush somewhere where it can dry effectively.</li>
      <li>I have found the brush to be a little soft for my feet, the stone however works great.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are good quality, but of a soft hemp that absorbs a little more water during use than regular bath brushes.  </li>
      <li>I only bought this brush so I would get free shipping</li>
      <li>The stone was separate from the whole brush so no point of keeping it.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Nice wooden material and design, but bristles were not hard/firm enough for me. . .  </li>
      <li>Nice and stiff for sloughing my feet in the shower.</li>
      <li>While I love the actual brush, the seam around the pumice stone filled with black mold in a matter of days.  </li>
      <li>but the file is great, and the brush is alright as long as I remember not to scrub too hard.</li>
      <li>20 seconds a day is all it took for me to have normal heels again.</li>
      <li>Quality is good, my only discerning comment would be that the bristles are VERY stiff on the brush.</li>
      <li>I have always had SUPER dry, crusty and cracking heels.</li>
      <li>also very tiny you would be better off buying a larger one for the same price.</li>
      <li>&quot; its long enough to do the job comfortably without being ungainly.  </li>
      <li>I hang it in the shower but not in any direct contact with water.  </li>
      <li>They are just too sensitive for that.  </li>
      <li>My feet are so soft I can&#x27;t stop rubbing them against each other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The porous bamboo however quickly turned black and I had to throw it away after a month.</li>
      <li>When I moved out of my sister&#x27;s place I accidentally left it, and she loves it so much she refused to give it back!</li>
      <li>The brush is a little soft; I prefer the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; feel but the pumice stone works well and has been going strong for a few months now.</li>

<li> And its so comforting that it can be used on other parts of the body that may be too sensitive for regular bath brushes as well.  </li>
<li> Personally I just don&#x27;t hang mine up to drip dry after use, but shake it well and occasionally run a towel over the bristles before storing.  </li>
<li> About the only thing I would recommend is that after use you rinse well, shake, and air dry it regularly.  </li>
<li> I use it in the shower a few times a week to keep my feet soft.</li>
<li> The pumice stone on the back is neither too hard nor too soft.</li>
<li> high quality but veryyy hard</li>
<li> Pretty poor quality all around.  </li>
<li> The bristles are firm without being painful, having the file is a nice touch.</li>
<li> But the bristles, to me at least, are way too soft.</li>
<li> of rough, but sturdy brush.</li>
<li> The foot brush did nothing to improve condition of my foot&#x27;s rough skin.</li>
<li> Be careful not to drop it, as it may break off.</li>
<li> A true disappointment.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t wait to see other products.</li>
<li> I have all the little foot scrubbing and dead skin shaving gismos, but this finally did it for me.</li>
<li> I like the softness, but would like them a little bit harder, and longer in length.  </li>
<li> I know, not very ecological, but I am not about to have mold growing on something I use for scrubbing my body.</li>
<li> The pummice stone fell off with a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoyed it while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
<li> Stiff bamboo bristles will always do the job.</li>
<li> Hangs with my other Brushes !!!!</li>
<li> The rope immediately went bad as well.</li>
<li> Really disappointed in this product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wonderful and arrived on time!  The product is excellent!  Satisfied...</li>
    <li> I guess it is okay as it did work. The pumice stone on the back is neither too hard nor too soft. But the bristles, to me at least, are way too soft. A word of warning though; once you have finished with your shower or bath I recommend hanging the brush somewhere where it can dry effectively. I only owned it for about a month before I began to notice some growth in the hemp rope loop used to hang it. In the end I had to remove that and replace it with a nylon bit of rope. I know, not very ecological, but I am not about to have mold growing on something I use for scrubbing my body. If I would have paid more for the file/brush I would have been more upset, but at around $5 I guess I cannot complain too much.</li>
    <li> The stone was separate from the whole brush so no point of keeping it.  I had to return the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m prone to callouses being a runner, so found this for in the shower quick scrubbing. Works well, wishes the handle was water proof though. Otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> The pummice stone fell off with a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoyed it while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;Still use the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of rough, but sturdy brush.</li>
    <li> A true disappointment. The foot brush did nothing to improve condition of my foot&#x27;s rough skin.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Doubles as a back brush.</li>
    <li> Ok brush, bristles are really soft, pumice stone was cracked when I received it, but stayed attached, still searching for a better brush.</li>
    <li> Stiff bamboo bristles will always do the job.</li>
    <li> high quality but veryyy hard briscles- hardest ive ever felt on a bath brush. this should be used on feet only because of that. also very tiny you would be better off buying a larger one for the same price.</li>
    <li> While I love the actual brush, the seam around the pumice stone filled with black mold in a matter of days.  I hang it in the shower but not in any direct contact with water.  I&#x27;d imagine this type of product would be mildew and mold resistant considering its nature.</li>
    <li> I have found the brush to be a little soft for my feet, the stone however works great.  The porous bamboo however quickly turned black and I had to throw it away after a month.</li>
    <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right. I have always had SUPER dry, crusty and cracking heels. I have all the little foot scrubbing and dead skin shaving gismos, but this finally did it for me. Not that the design is revolutionary, just that I already scrub my feet with a foot brush in the shower and since I lost my last foot brush, I bought this one. This one has a sand paper like thing on the back side, so since I&#x27;m already scrubbing my feet I flip it over and scrub each heel for about 20 seconds. 20 seconds a day is all it took for me to have normal heels again. It has become a part of my shower ritual, and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s been so effective. When I moved out of my sister&#x27;s place I accidentally left it, and she loves it so much she refused to give it back! So I bought another one. Great product.</li>
    <li> Nice and stiff for sloughing my feet in the shower. I bought it for it&#x27;s bristles, not the file or pumice stone on opposite side. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> These days the highlight of my shower is scrubbing my feet with this brush. I hadn&#x27;t had a pedicure in over a year so you can imagine how rough and chapped my feet were, always having whitish lines near the ball of my feet. After the first scrub my feet were SO smooth, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I only bought this brush so I would get free shipping but boy am I glad I bought it! My feet are so soft I can&#x27;t stop rubbing them against each other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, July 2013:&lt;br /&gt;After using this brush all this while, it still works great but the drawback I noticed is that the glue used to stick the pumice to the bamboo isn&#x27;t usually very strong. I now have 3 brushes which have lost their pumice. In any case the &#x27;scrubability&#x27; of the pumice had worn out almost by the time that happened so it was time to replace the brush. Plan to use about 4 of these a year (no wonder they sell a a pack of 4!)</li>
    <li> Quality is good, my only discerning comment would be that the bristles are VERY stiff on the brush. If what you&#x27;re looking for is a scratchy scrub for your feet, this would be ideal. I, however, wasn&#x27;t... but the file is great, and the brush is alright as long as I remember not to scrub too hard.</li>
    <li> I have diabetic neuropathy and various foot problems. This allows me to clean in between toes easily. Great product. Very handy</li>
    <li> Works well though one has to be careful,when using the pumice business end!</li>
    <li> Sturdy brush at a great price. The bristles are firm without being painful, having the file is a nice touch. Be careful not to drop it, as it may break off.</li>
    <li> This company makes great quality products. I have the back scrubber and the nail brush as well. I love all three. Can&#x27;t wait to see other products. Thank you for your exceptional business.</li>
    <li> Nice wooden material and design, but bristles were not hard/firm enough for me. . .  I wanted it for dry brushing skin, which is good for circulation. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> Great brush... however the brush handle is a lot tougher than the bristles.  I like the softness, but would like them a little bit harder, and longer in length.  Great product over all however.</li>
    <li> Pretty poor quality all around.  Really disappointed in this product.  The wood needed to be treated in some way to survive the shower.  The rope immediately went bad as well.</li>
    <li> Hangs with my other Brushes !!!! Great for bath day !!!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice foot brush.  At just under 10\\&quot; its long enough to do the job comfortably without being ungainly.  And best of all the bristles are the perfect tension for me.  One can&#x27;t just use any old scrub brush on our feet as most of us well know.  They are just too sensitive for that.  This brush allows one to keep up the pressure for a longer period of scrubbing that really gets ones feet clean.  And its so comforting that it can be used on other parts of the body that may be too sensitive for regular bath brushes as well.  I think its perfect and plan on ordering another one.  About the only thing I would recommend is that after use you rinse well, shake, and air dry it regularly.  The bristles are good quality, but of a soft hemp that absorbs a little more water during use than regular bath brushes.  Personally I just don&#x27;t hang mine up to drip dry after use, but shake it well and occasionally run a towel over the bristles before storing.  With good care it&#x27;s holding up well, feels good on one&#x27;s tootsies, and does an excellent job.  Recommended... : )</li>
    <li> I use it in the shower a few times a week to keep my feet soft. Combined with a moisturizer, it does the trick. The brush is a little soft; I prefer the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; feel but the pumice stone works well and has been going strong for a few months now. Ecotools definitely makes good products; I have their other foot scrubber and it works great too (it just wears away faster and I don&#x27;t feel like spending $12-$15 every month, so I opted to use something like this more frequently for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;).</li>
