      <li>I absolutely love this.</li>

      <li>Plus my 8 oz body/hair sprays can&#x27;t fit under in the bottom-most compartment which is kind of a deal breaker.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to measure your counters that they are going on and do it twice....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wayyy better than I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
      <li>No problems at all - just as advertised and pleased with it - they want me to use more words so using more words</li>
      <li>This product was of good quality and was exactly as described by seller.  </li>
      <li>I think that, the organizer is easy to be broked.</li>
      <li>Holds quite a large amount of items - love this organizer!</li>
      <li>looks nice at first, but it’s made of cheap flimsy plastic that cracked and broke after 1 year.  </li>
      <li>It makes putting on makeup a breeze with 3 levels of easy accessible storage that spins.  </li>
      <li>think this product needs more attention for how useful it is.</li>
      <li>It spins relatively smoothly and feels stable.</li>
      <li>But so far so good</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get home to put it together.</li>
      <li>I love this organizer so much!</li>
      <li>that could have bought alot of useful products more worth the price for me.</li>
      <li>I think if you have limited space &amp; or want a great organization for makeup items this item holds a lot of things.</li>
      <li>Overall good</li>
      <li>Really cleans up the clutter off the counter for sure.  </li>
      <li>They should use either glass or acrylic with wood or stainless steel or something else that looks better.</li>
      <li>Just make sure that the bottom that is supposed to part of the bottom that turns is put in exactly the right position.</li>
      <li>Having many products and not enough space to keep them at display, what tended to happen was for me to carry and stash everything away in many places.</li>
      <li>Was delivered quickly &amp; packaged adequately.</li>
      <li>It definitely serves a great purpose and hold so much stuff</li>
      <li>in a really cool and pretty way!</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I think this thing is great, but the price could be knocked down a bit.</li>
      <li>Spins really easily and is high quality!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>Even a big tall can of hairspray fits easily in one of the cups on top.</li>
      <li>Such an amazing  product.</li>
      <li>Although I felt as though this product was a bit pricey at the beginning, now that I have received the product and have gotten to use it, I think it was well worth the money.</li>
      <li>But I have a big counter, so if that is where you want to put it, then you need to measure to make sure it will fit.</li>
      <li>This is a really useful organizer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally sucked it up and ordered it because it turned out to be well worth the price.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an organizer for a lot of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; you want easy and clear access to, this product is for you.</li>
      <li>It is not made for rough treatment, but it is a fantastic item that I love.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super flimsy and falls apart if I so much as touch it.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is a higher price, but you get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>If my products were not on this tower they would take up so much space and be sprawled all over the place!</li>
      <li>It makes doing my makeup in the morning so much faster and easier!</li>
      <li>I use it daily to hold all my make- up, brushes, lotions, and more.</li>
      <li>I have used the top tier for some things, but I still have some room left.</li>
      <li>My bathroom counter top did not have enough space, so I put it on my night stand in my bedroom instead.</li>
      <li>, I know exactly which I have to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I saved so much space on my vanity with this!</li>
      <li>The clear plastic sleeves on top should be made of a more solid plastic/material, but they can be easily removed and rinsed off.(thus the minus 1 star).</li>
      <li>It is missing 2 of the so called tubes that fit on top.</li>
      <li>The tall shelf has large cups</li>
      <li>A little bit taller than I would have liked,</li>
      <li>I expected something stronger and better than that.</li>
      <li>I can fit all my daily makeup, hair products, makeup brushes, skin care, and vitamins in it.</li>
      <li>Plastic tubes could be a bit sturdier so you have to be gentle with them.</li>
      <li>I really REALLY wanted to like this item.</li>
      <li>I use this every day, and my morning routine goes much smoother now that I don&#x27;t have to go searching through drawers for makeup and hair items.</li>
      <li>For $70, they should improve the quality by a whole lot.</li>
      <li>but it works very well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was of good quality and was exactly as described by seller.  I have been using it for several months now and absolutely no issues.  Really cleans up the clutter off the counter for sure.  Holds quite a large amount of items - love this organizer!</li>
    <li> Do not order this!! I hate that I didn&#x27;t open the product immediately upon receiving it because now I can&#x27;t return it. It is missing 2 of the so called tubes that fit on top. It&#x27;s super flimsy and falls apart if I so much as touch it. The &amp;#34;side walls&amp;#34; are just pieces of plastic wrapped around the base with tiny notches meant to hold it in place. They don&#x27;t work! The other both he&#x27;s meant to fit into the tiers are the same way so it&#x27;s constantly falling over. This product is very cheap and doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> The clear plastic around it comes apart.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this! All my supplies are in one spot with a small foot print on my bathroom counter. If my products were not on this tower they would take up so much space and be sprawled all over the place! I am even thinking about getting one for my craft room,  heck you could even use it in the kitchen or even the garage ! It keeps all your supplies in one place and i love that it spins!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product. Much bigger then I expected. Holds all my makeup &amp; on top part I put all my hairbrushes &amp; combs. I&#x27;ve got mine on the bathroom sink counter. But I have a big counter, so if that is where you want to put it, then you need to measure to make sure it will fit. The Makeup &amp; Cosmetic Organizer is Big. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome..the wife loves it.  The clear plastics parts are a smidge flimsy but they work well.</li>
    <li> For the price I think the plastic could a bit stronger, but given the transformation to my bathroom counter, I must give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Because of the price, I held off on buying this for months while I looked for a similar product for less. I&#x27;m glad I finally sucked it up and ordered it because it turned out to be well worth the price. The plastic is high quality and I expect it to last years. I use this every day, and my morning routine goes much smoother now that I don&#x27;t have to go searching through drawers for makeup and hair items. I can fit all my daily makeup, hair products, makeup brushes, skin care, and vitamins in it. Even a big tall can of hairspray fits easily in one of the cups on top. I&#x27;m thinking of buying a second one in one of the maker&#x27;s other smaller designs to hold my perfumes.</li>
    <li> This caddy is perfect for beauty supplies and make up! I saved so much space on my vanity with this!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my veterinary clinic. We use it everyday. The compartments are so handy and well thought out. Such an amazing  product. I&#x27;d give it 100 stars if possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month.  The price deterred me from purchasing this organizer sooner. It&#x27;s well-made, holds a lot and is visually appealing.  Love the right-sized compartments, the tube holders and the ability to spin in any direction.  It&#x27;s wider and taller than I thought but it still fits well in my small apartment bathroom.  Shipping took longer than I wanted, especially since the shipping charge was pretty high.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product shipped so fast it was creepy. However, the price is too high for the flimsy materials that it is comprised of and I still don&#x27;t understand how it didn&#x27;t fall apart in the mail. Also the photos make it look like this thing works miracles  but I still had to put my vitamins in my top drawer and I can&#x27;t fit my nail polish collection/accessories in it. :( my hair products and makeup take all the space which makes me very sad. Plus my 8 oz body/hair sprays can&#x27;t fit under in the bottom-most compartment which is kind of a deal breaker. Oh well, I&#x27;m stuck with it now.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever for organizing my clutter!  I love this product and it looks amazing in my bathroom!</li>
    <li> I really REALLY wanted to like this item. I actually was so confident I would, that i did not truely put items on it till today. What I found is that the tall portions were to tall and the short areas to short for the items i wanted to put on it. Also, very FEW items can fit in the different slots. Now that could be me fault, or the fault of the design not to have averaged out the sized of products properly. All I know is as the product junkie I am (struggling to be somewhat organized) this just does not cater to MY needs. Not to say it won&#x27;t be a great asset to another persons dresser, but for the WILDLY expensive price I expected SO much more. I&#x27;m so upset that I cannot return this item through Amazon. Is there any one at the company I can talk to about that?? I&#x27;m absolutely kicking myself for spending near $70 on it :( that could have bought alot of useful products more worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> I have searched and searched for something to organize my make up, which was spread all over the bathroom counter.  I picked up 2, one for my make up and the other for face/skin care products, and misc things that I use to dig through the bathroom drawer to find it.  The organizer is solid, sleek, and hold so much stuff, it&#x27;s unbelievable.  Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> For $70, they should improve the quality by a whole lot. I like the design and functionality. It is an excellent organizer, but at this price point, the quality should be a lot better. The cheap looking plastic everywhere looks ugly. They should use either glass or acrylic with wood or stainless steel or something else that looks better.</li>
    <li> Besides the price, I think this thing is wonderful, more importantly, so does my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking around for a counter solution for my wife for some time. She manages to cover a his and hers bathroom counter entirely with her makeup and beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her complaint is: &amp;#34;if it is put up I won&#x27;t see it, therefore, won&#x27;t use it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was searching, this wonderful thing popped out like the holy grail of makeup and counter organizers. I think this thing is great, but the price could be knocked down a bit.</li>
    <li> Having many products and not enough space to keep them at display, what tended to happen was for me to carry and stash everything away in many places. This resulted in forgetting I even owned some products and overall, disorganized clutter. Although I felt as though this product was a bit pricey at the beginning, now that I have received the product and have gotten to use it, I think it was well worth the money. It was initially purchased to hold my lip products in an organized fashion, but it ended up holding all of them along with all of my face/eye makeup and brushes (minus palettes). It spins relatively smoothly and feels stable. The plastic that makes the holders for the brushes and the walls of the compartments feel a little cheap (can bend and probably crack under pressure), but they are made of a sturdy plastic material; as long as one does not try to bend or over-stuff the compartments, there should be no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product needs more attention for how useful it is. This is an organizing gem.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. I use it daily to hold all my make- up, brushes, lotions, and more. Love all the levels and that it spins. Looks great on my vanity. The only thing negative I would say was the price because it was spendy. But so far so good and I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this to organized my bathroom products and love it.  I love that I can just turn it to access what I need.</li>
    <li> Teenager daughter loves it (and mom loves it, too- keeps everything off the counter and looking nice!) Plastic tubes could be a bit sturdier so you have to be gentle with them.</li>
    <li> looks nice at first, but it’s made of cheap flimsy plastic that cracked and broke after 1 year.  They don’t sell the parts individually, so you are left with nothing when the plastic cracks.</li>
    <li> This is the very very best make up organizer I have ever found, and I have looked for years.  It cleans up the bathroom counter from clutter totally organizer.  The only learning curve is remembering what slot you have stored things.  I ordered 2, one for each side of the sink...worth the price and more!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! It is the perfect size. I use it for my perfumes, hair products, and makeup.</li>
    <li> I got this organizer for my vitamin and mineral supplements and I was pleasantly surprised at how much this organizer can hold. The tall, big bottles are on the bottom tier and the shorter bottles are on the second tier. I have used the top tier for some things, but I still have some room left. This makes it very easy to know which bottles I have to buy again and which I don&#x27;t, as it makes it very easy to know what I have and what I don&#x27;t. I do have extra bottles thrown in another box somewhere to replace the ones that are emptied but when I no longer have another bottle of a certain item, I know exactly which I have to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful, though, as this product is plastic and needs to be carefully handled...however, for what this product is designed, it is a great item. I&#x27;m thinking of buying another in the future for other items that I need organized. Just make sure that the bottom that is supposed to part of the bottom that turns is put in exactly the right position.</li>
    <li> Great way to have everything right at your fingertips!</li>
    <li> Great work item arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I expected something stronger and better than that.I think that, the organizer is easy to be broked.Iam so disappointed</li>
    <li> Nice organizer for my makeup, makeup brushes, and room for any accessories. It is made of a tough black plastic. The clear plastic sleeves on top should be made of a more solid plastic/material, but they can be easily removed and rinsed off.(thus the minus 1 star). It makes putting on makeup a breeze with 3 levels of easy accessible storage that spins.  It is not made for rough treatment, but it is a fantastic item that I love. No instructions &amp; none needed. I think if you have limited space &amp; or want a great organization for makeup items this item holds a lot of things. It is a tall.. Was delivered quickly &amp; packaged adequately. Nice gift for any woman.</li>
    <li> Whoever designed these and brought them to be, is a genius. They were a bit expensive I thought but after getting them and putting one to use I can honestly say I do not feel that way now. Every lady should own at least two. What a god send for cluttered counter tops. Try them, you will not regret it. Just be sure to measure your counters that they are going on and do it twice....</li>
    <li> When I opened the box, several of the side pieces were already off the carousel, and the entire piece seems very flimsy. I should have taken heed of other reviews warning of this. Thankfully, Amazon accepted the return, but I still had to go to the trouble of shipping it back. I bought a smaller stainless steel cosmetic carousel on Amazon that I really like.</li>
    <li> I love this. It is the perfect way to organize all those cosmetics and get rid of the clutter.  However, you do need to have enough cabinet space. My bathroom counter top did not have enough space, so I put it on my night stand in my bedroom instead. It works just as well because I just grab what I need and take it in the bathroom and then put it back.</li>
    <li> This will work for someone with a massive vanity. I only had a small area to put this on and it was too big. Gave it away and will search for something smaller. Probably should have measured the area. My fault</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter as a present. She says she &amp;#34;freaking loves it&amp;#34;. I think that says it all.</li>
    <li> This is a really useful organizer.  I read all the reviews before I bought it, and after receiving it and seeing it myself, I must say that this is a well-designed and durable product.  The turntable is the reason I bought it.  Yes, it is a higher price, but you get what you pay for.  I also took a before and after photo to share with you, so let me see if I can post it. If you are looking for an organizer for a lot of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; you want easy and clear access to, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> No problems at all - just as advertised and pleased with it - they want me to use more words so using more words</li>
    <li> Overall good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my eye on this organizer for several month.  I guess the price was what initially kept me from buying sooner.  Once I did research and couldn&#x27;t find anything like it for less (and frustrated with the junk on my counter) I broke down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it late on a Wednesday and received it on Friday. I used Prime so it was guaranteed.  I was so excited to get home to put it together. Guess what? There is no assembly required. Only the four round plastic tubes need to be inserted at the top.  Okaaaaay now. About that plastic the ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the quality of the plastic keeps your things from falling out. I expect for $70 they would have used acrylic that snaps into place vs plastic. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the material is sturdy but visually you may be thinking hmmmm, how much did it cost to make this vs how much I paid.  Can&#x27;t blame the person who invented it though. They are making a killing as it probably only cost $10 to make it. Hey, if people will pay you $70 for your product then charge them for it! LOL :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NONETHELESS, I still love it for what it does. It definitely serves a great purpose and hold so much stuff it&#x27;s unbelievable. If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d be giving these out as gifts or maybe even buy another one.  Trust me though, it is on my counter and is being put to GOOD use.</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail yesterday.. It&#x27;s wayyy better than I&#x27;d hoped for. No assembly is required,it spins beautifully,and,organizes all my makeup. Whoever invented this is a genius. If you looking into buying a makeup organizer,THIS is the one for you. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Yes just plastic especially the cups (just flat plastic sheet rolled and slit /tab) but it doesn&#x27;t look bad and it holds so much! Way more organized. I can see stuff I forgot I even had.</li>
    <li> this item was just like I expected</li>
    <li> I love this organizer so much! It makes doing my makeup in the morning so much faster and easier! Spins really easily and is high quality! Plus it displays all of my makeup (which is a lot!) in a really cool and pretty way!</li>
    <li> A little bit taller than I would have liked, but it works very well.  The tall shelf has large cups so you don&#x27;t have to worry about things falling out.</li>
    <li> WOW! This thing is AWESOME!  Idk where to start,  fast shipping,  QUALITY product,  bigger &amp; sturdier than I expected.  You get what you pay for &amp; with this,  you get an incredible product.  You will not regret this purchase!!!!! I&#x27;m in love😍</li>
