<ol>
      <li>Best nail color for all occasions.  </li>
      <li>The color was great.</li>
      <li>The durability was no so great.</li>
      <li>GAW-JUSS!!!.....looks great w/</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful, metallic rose gold.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake off, dries smooth and looks great!</li>
      <li>Even with a great top coat.</li>
      <li>Love the irredescence!</li>
      <li>have always liked Sally Hansen products</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this color</li>
      <li>I receive many complements when I wear it.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
      <li>Firefly comes out as a beautiful soft gold with pink shadows, sort of a rose gold aurora borealis, but in the bottle it looks gold/pink/green.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>but it is still a fun color</li>
      <li>I only get the soft rose gold, but it&#x27;s quite lovely and worth the reduced price you pay here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the entire lustre shine collection.</li>
      <li>Still pretty.</li>
      <li>Pretty, but it does not look like the picture</li>
      <li>the color is very brown</li>
      <li>Still, it made a nice basecoat for another product but has a much stronger odor than other recent polishes.</li>
      <li>I actually was looking for polishes that were hologram colors &amp; this color caught my attention right away.</li>
      <li>The polish arrived sooner than expected and was exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this purchase to anyone looking for somethinng new in their polish collection.</li>
      <li>ex-model here, have always preferred Sally Hanson over more expensive brands..,( lasts much longer&lt;br</li>

<li> Long lasting, too.</li>
<li> Same as the other Sally Hansen Lustre</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t not look like the bottle when nails are painted and the effect is only slightly visible in the sun.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go by the bottle on these lustre polishes, sadly, but they are still very pretty.</li>
<li> Comes in a wide range of colors.  </li>
<li> Not the color I expected</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> Not exactly what I expected</li>
<li> But other than that, I like it.</li>
<li> Whether the shape of the bottle forces the interference particles into a greater curve than the polish can achieve on nails or the bottle creates an optical illusion, I have a very thin orangey (Firefly) polish rather than dramatic interference orange and green.</li>
<li> disappointed in color - color is simply copper; andit is very thick and comes off easy.</li>
<li> For $8 in the drugstore I would&#x27;ve been extremely disappointed.</li>
<li> but this one is very disappointing.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t hate it</li>

    <li> the color is very brown</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this color and I am ordering it on Amazon b/c I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful, metallic rose gold. I get compliments all the time. It&#x27;s my go-to color and goes with everything.&lt;br /&gt;Jewelry for my fingertiips.</li>
    <li> The color was great. The durability was no so great. Even with a great top coat.</li>
    <li> Pretty, but it does not look like the picture (it&#x27;s lighter and there&#x27;s no blues or greens). But other than that, I like it.</li>
    <li> Does not show the iridescent effect as hoped. Still pretty. Not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. But it&#x27;s not bad</li>
    <li> GAW-JUSS!!!.....looks great w/a suntan.....ex-model here, have always preferred Sally Hanson over more expensive brands..,( lasts much longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;)</li>
    <li> disappointed in color - color is simply copper; andit is very thick and comes off easy. have always liked Sally Hansen products but this one is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> If the reflective properties of the nail polish equaled that of what the bottle shows I would have been overjoyed. Whether the shape of the bottle forces the interference particles into a greater curve than the polish can achieve on nails or the bottle creates an optical illusion, I have a very thin orangey (Firefly) polish rather than dramatic interference orange and green. Still, it made a nice basecoat for another product but has a much stronger odor than other recent polishes.</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t not look like the bottle when nails are painted and the effect is only slightly visible in the sun. Overall, I would not purchase this color again. Don&#x27;t hate it but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake off, dries smooth and looks great! Comes in a wide range of colors.  Oh and it lasts for weeks!</li>
