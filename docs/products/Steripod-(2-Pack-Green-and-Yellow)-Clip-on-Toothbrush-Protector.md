      <li>These fit great, and whether the anti-bacterial thing works or not</li>
      <li>it is nice that they offer some sanitary protection.</li>
      <li>Nice for travel</li>
      <li>If they shaped it to conform to a toothbrush head, then I suppose they wouldn&#x27;t be able to call it a &amp;#34;pod&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I think they could offer better color choices and combinations.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>but this is so much better.  </li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>It saves a lot more space</li>
      <li>It does have a strong medicine smell to it</li>
      <li>Clever, good product.  </li>
      <li>Keeps the toothbrush covered nicely, but has a very sterilizing odor which I didn&#x27;t care for.  </li>
      <li>I feel safer with them on and they are cheap.  </li>
      <li>Great for traveling as well as every day use to keep as clean as possible.  </li>
      <li>and it will keep your brush as clean as it can be given the circumstances.</li>
      <li>There is no yuck factor because you are using a clean brush.</li>
      <li>I took this baby with me on a two month backpacking trip through Latin America, and it kept my toothbrush protected and clean.</li>
      <li>Keeps toothbrush clean</li>
      <li>but it smells clean and</li>
      <li>thats good enough for me</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised!</li>
      <li>Great little invention.</li>
      <li>they are very easily removed and put back on.</li>
      <li>I like them because I can get them in different colors for a family of six, which makes it very easy to tell whose toothbrush is whose.  </li>
      <li>Wish more people knew about this germ potential.</li>
      <li>These are a bit expensive, but they are awesome for covering my electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>keep your tooth brush safe from toilet spray.  </li>
      <li>These are pretty cool, clip onto toothbrushes of nearly any size or shape.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really good, clean, and helpful but the yellow one is a little crack</li>
      <li>Easy and simple to use.</li>
      <li>Easy, simple to use.  </li>
      <li>I like them so much</li>

      <li>I really like these tooth brush covers.  </li>
      <li>Clever product.</li>
      <li>I love these little steripods.</li>
      <li>I love these little things.</li>
      <li>Fresh minty smell, last for three months.</li>
      <li>Very handy for travel and keeping toothbrush heads sanitary and not touching hotel counters or each other.</li>
      <li>First, they have the faint smell of mouthwash (and not the &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; kind), and secondly, they depress the bristles at the top of the toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>People sensitive to chemical/medicinal odors may not like these.  </li>
      <li>These were bought to replace old ones.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they technically sterilized my toothbrush, but I definitely feel better using them, even if it is a placebo effect.</li>

<li> keeps germs released when flushing your toilet from getting onto your toothbrush.</li>

    <li> Works for my Oral B electronic toothbrush. It saves a lot more space and I don&#x27;t have to worry about nasty germs getting all over my brush</li>
    <li> they are great for telling my husbands toothbrush from mine and they also seem to be keeping bacteria at bay.  I feel safer with them on and they are cheap.  Great little invention.</li>
    <li> Covers the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These work to cover your toothbrush head, whether it be manual or electric.  I had been looking for a cover for my electric toothbrush for some time and to find these was perfect.  They are even antibiotic.</li>
    <li> I love these little steripods. I&#x27;m not sure if they technically sterilized my toothbrush, but I definitely feel better using them, even if it is a placebo effect. Some people that see that I use them think it&#x27;s silly and unnecessary, but when you share a bathroom with 3 other people, it keeps ones mind at peace. If anything, they are great to travel with.</li>
    <li> These are so handy! Plus, they have a disinfectant (dry) in them that smells like mouthwash, so not offensive. Nice for travel but I also use it at home because it helps keep my toothbrush germ-free.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised! Clever product. I think they could offer better color choices and combinations. Good germ protection for your toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good, clean, and helpful but the yellow one is a little crack and I hope it does not brake</li>
    <li> I took this baby with me on a two month backpacking trip through Latin America, and it kept my toothbrush protected and clean. There wasn&#x27;t any weird taste or smell. Although, the toothbrush head took on the color of the Steripod. However, a little rinsing prior to brushing got rid of the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I really like these tooth brush covers.  These were bought to replace old ones.  I&#x27;ve been using them for at least a couple of years.  I find them easier to put on the brush then other snap on products and it is nice that they offer some sanitary protection.</li>
    <li> Fresh minty smell, last for three months. Perfect two pack, good for me and my hubby. Easy and simple to use.</li>
    <li> These clip around the brush keeping them from being exposed to bathroom surfaces. There is no yuck factor because you are using a clean brush.</li>
    <li> I love these! Keeps all the germs out. It does have a strong medicine smell to it but it doesn&#x27;t effect the smell or taste of the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I got these to protect my tooth brush for things getting on it, and these are great and they leave you brush smelling good also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them before so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. It arrived on time and in good condition. I would definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> Easy, simple to use.  Keeps toothbrush clean</li>
    <li> Clever, good product.  I use these at home (read about toilet spray and you will, too) and while traveling.  I feel like it keeps my toothbrushes cleaner.</li>
    <li> It is fine, but when I put it in my bag, I always be afraid that some dusts may still get into the toothbrush head since it is not completely sealed.</li>
    <li> I like these pods, but I&#x27;m deducting a star for two reasons. First, they have the faint smell of mouthwash (and not the &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; kind), and secondly, they depress the bristles at the top of the toothbrush.  It&#x27;s a square peg/round hole thing.  If they shaped it to conform to a toothbrush head, then I suppose they wouldn&#x27;t be able to call it a &amp;#34;pod&amp;#34;.  Not deal breakers for me, just a heads up.  (BTW, we use small, compact head brushes).</li>
    <li> These are a bit expensive, but they are awesome for covering my electric toothbrush. I hate the idea of the toilet kicking up nasty stuff into the air every time it flushes and getting on my toothbrush. These fit great, and whether the anti-bacterial thing works or not, I don&#x27;t really care nor can I testify to it.</li>
    <li> I love these little things. they are very easily removed and put back on. you can grab your toothbrush and it is ready for travel. keeps germs released when flushing your toilet from getting onto your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It keeps my toothbrush from falling on the floor and covers the bristles while allowing air to dry the brush. I am not sure about the sanitizing part, but I would not recommend using infused antimicrobial toothbrushes in the holder as a film tends to occur, just use traditional toothbrushes and it will keep your brush as clean as it can be given the circumstances.</li>
    <li> I wrote another review for this but for a different color.  Very nice and handy, easy to use the clips.  Just put your toothbrush in the cover and it gets sanitized without lights or batteries.  Nice color and good quality.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a few years now.  Great for traveling as well as every day use to keep as clean as possible.  Don&#x27;t put the brush in the pod wet, taking one piece of tissue, dry the bristles off before covering. This seems to help keep the pod looking cleaner which makes me feel like it actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t actually know if these sanitize my tooth brush or not but it smells clean and thats good enough for me</li>
    <li> Are you a fan of not having poop particles on your tooth brush? This is the product for you. I love them.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore.  Very handy for travel and keeping toothbrush heads sanitary and not touching hotel counters or each other.</li>
    <li> I have no way to tell whether these Steripods actually kill germs.  I like them because I can get them in different colors for a family of six, which makes it very easy to tell whose toothbrush is whose.  I also like having covered toothbrushes, just in case germs land on them from the air.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  I had been using a paper cup to cover my toothbrush but this is so much better.  Wish more people knew about this germ potential.</li>
    <li> I love these. I had actually already picked some up for myself at a local retailer. I like them so much I ordered these for my daughter and son-in-law. Great product!!</li>
    <li> always use them for our toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use these and love them!  They keep our toothbrushes protected in the bathroom and when we travel, we can just toss them in the suitcase!</li>
    <li> Keeps the toothbrush covered nicely, but has a very sterilizing odor which I didn&#x27;t care for.  Also, after several uses there&#x27;s a white  build-up inside the clip.</li>
    <li> These are pretty cool, clip onto toothbrushes of nearly any size or shape. The chemical smell is a little off-putting which is why I gave these 4 stars instead 5.  People sensitive to chemical/medicinal odors may not like these.  I travel often and I like the idea of my toothbrush being protected and sanitized whether on the hotel sink or in my cosmetic travel bag.</li>
    <li> keep your tooth brush safe from toilet spray.  I dont know if they actually sanitize.  I have know way of knowing</li>
