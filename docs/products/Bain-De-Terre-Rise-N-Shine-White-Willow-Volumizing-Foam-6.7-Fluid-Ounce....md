      <li>guess this post was kind of sloppy</li>
      <li>am a super big fan of Rusk Mousse and will always go back to Rusk, as long as they keep making it.</li>

<li> I have thin, limp hair and this product gives me lots of body without weighing my hair down.</li>
<li> Very heavy</li>
<li> at least 16 years.</li>

    <li> My husb and I have been using Bain de Terre Green Meadow shampoo as a staple shampoo&lt;br /&gt;for at least 16 years. (we use others as well on rotation). My salon used to stock&lt;br /&gt;it and I am truly addicted to the smell. I am soooooooo glad that they haven&#x27;t changed&lt;br /&gt;it one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this Rise N&#x27; Shine and thought my husb would like it since he fingers shine&lt;br /&gt;pomade or mouse through his hair each morning and he loves the smell of the Green Meadow&lt;br /&gt;so I thought it would be a win win situation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, he doesn&#x27;t like it at all. It didn&#x27;t do anything for him shine wise so I thought&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d try it. I put a palm full in my hair - I evenly distributed it through the ends&lt;br /&gt;of my hair and used a wide tooth comb and combed it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blew dry it after about an hour and it was sticky and I had an AWFUL hair day. It&lt;br /&gt;felt dirty!!!  So it is now in my hair basket with other products I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;but not sure of.... I will try it again when I know I will be blow drying and curling&lt;br /&gt;it quickly after putting it in my damp hair and I may update this review if it works&lt;br /&gt;out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking the stickiness is meant to hold curlers, straight iron or curling iron&lt;br /&gt;like a setting spray. If that is the case then it should be labeled that way.  I normally&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t curl my hair except for special occasions. NOrmally I just blow dry it and&lt;br /&gt;clip up my bangs and leave my long hair down or throw it up in a low pony.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  I have a short haircut and this product adds just the right amount of body but does not leave a sticky residue.</li>
    <li> The product wasn&#x27;t packaged carefully and was leaking through the packaging. Great product itself. I have very fine hair and it gives great volume.</li>
    <li> Tried it at marshalls In titusville &amp;loved it keeps my fine hair curled.  GRear price my friend bought it.  Good job   guess this post was kind of sloppy but no one could keep my hair  to be in good condition. I tried to find it again at Marshalls &amp; then we went on line wa laaa. thks for a fine product 7 I have got to have my friends try it. a happy gal I am</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Rise &#x27;n&#x27; Shine mousse for years. I have short hair which needs a bit of help to bring out wave and shine. I&#x27;ve experimented with pomades and gels. Trust me, this is the one. Easy to use, pleasant smell and definitely not icky-sticky. You can work it into damp hair and then style and blow dry. Or let your hair dry, rub it in and give it a scrunch for a slightly spiky effect.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. First received it as a gift and it just works great for every day use.  Creates volume for fine long hair.  It&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
    <li> An excellent product that I would recommend for  human hair wigs after washing and before styling. Rinse and Shine was recommended to me and his product gives hair beautiful shine and volume and helps maintain style.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is great for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference with this product. It gives my hair a bit of a strange texture but it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to stop using it. I&#x27;ve added this to my normal hair routine. The smell is very pleasant and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Good product, adds volume!  Leaves your hair nice an shiny, does not build up on hair.  Lasts throughout the day for that professional look.</li>
    <li> It does give volume, doesn&#x27;t make you hair sticky and allows your hair to bounce,</li>
    <li> I tried this product at a friend&#x27;s house and just had to have it. The price was great and I received the product promptly.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. A friend gave me some to sample. Creates fullness and body; the scent is very pleasant.  I ordered six bottles. Gave one to a friend and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> Loved the product!! Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I like this foamy mousse-but, I think I like the Frizz Ease Curl Reviver mousse a lot better.....and Frizz Ease also makes a spray called Dream Curls to touch my curls up.....so, I do like the Rise /n/ Shine, but, I will not re-purchase it because I like my other products better.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m happy that i can still purchase this product!  The Bain De Terre Rise N&#x27; Shine is light with great hold.  I don&#x27;t have thick hair so this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down &amp; still creates hold.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Bain De Terry Rise N&#x27; Shine works wonderfully and smells great!  I have thin, limp hair and this product gives me lots of body without weighing my hair down.</li>

    <li> i have very thin hair and this product gave me a lot of volume !! im very pleased :) i will use it over and over</li>
    <li> Arrived and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and it&#x27;s so nice to get it online,&lt;br /&gt;will order again when needed, Thanks for having it and&lt;br /&gt;getting it to me so quickly..</li>

    <li> I love this mousse it is the best I have found, my hair is long thin and dry this helps me allot. I will never buy another brand again and it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> OK, the product is great - 5 stars, right?  Well almost.  My issue with this is not with the product but with the cost.  Wow!  This stuff is really expensive.  SInce my rating is supposed to encompass the whole experience - 4 stars.  Drop the price to &#x27;reasonable&#x27; and you get a five.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair volumuzer I will ever use again! I have long, fine, thin hair, and this product is the only  one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, while maintaining style, lift, and softness. You won&#x27;t regret buying this product!</li>
    <li> Did not see much difference in hair but a little volume</li>
    <li> My hair is veryfine and this is the best product to give me some volume.</li>
    <li> This mousse is ok. Once again, not my favorite. You must be very careful about the amount that you use and you must use hair dryer while hair is very damp. If not, hair becomes very hard to work with. Probably will not buy again. Very heavy scent.&lt;br /&gt;I am a super big fan of Rusk Mousse and will always go back to Rusk, as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product it was priced well and it was shipped quickly and most of all they were very helpful.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible. It provides volume and control in a light foam. I have fine hair and many products weigh my hair down, but not this one!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Wish I could find it around here.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product,and the quick delivery</li>
