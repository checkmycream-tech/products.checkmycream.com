<li> br /&gt;It brakes down after applying and getting un contacto with moist (saliva)&lt;br /&gt;Would never recomend.</li>
<li> but other than that, I give it a thumbs up!</li>
<li> I have looked everywhere in the town where I live and it  is impossible to find orthodontic wax that is not flavored with mint.  </li>
<li> but it was too hard.  </li>
<li> They are live savers for those annoying poking wires.</li>
<li> It is a ver y bad product&lt;</li>

    <li> nice quality and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> These are a little longer than what the orthodontist gives me for free in his office.  I&#x27;m grateful to have them, they help A LOT!  I like that they each come in their own little cases so I can put one in my purse, one in my car, leave one at work...  Very helpful.</li>
    <li> Good quality, not too soft not too hard, it stays on perfectly for as long as you need it.  I would like to see this product come in a more clear color as it is very noticeable in my mouth, like bright white. but other than that, I give it a thumbs up!</li>

    <li> We&#x27;ve tried it all and have finally found the best wax on the market.  I stocked up so my teen can get through braces</li>
    <li> It is a ver y bad product&lt;br /&gt;It brakes down after applying and getting un contacto with moist (saliva)&lt;br /&gt;Would never recomend. Its cheap and bad quality.</li>
    <li> This is great for sharp braces my daughter recently got. They do not hand this out at some dentists.. mine did years ago.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with the dental wax. They are live savers for those annoying poking wires. Thanks much!</li>
    <li> As an adult who recently got braces, I needed more wax that the Dr. gave me.  I tried the brand they sell at the pharmacy but it was too hard.  These are softer and are easier to put on my teeth.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The package has no label.  No product name, manufacturer, indication/usage, place of production, or expiration date.  Very concerned about its quality.</li>
    <li> This product completely meets my needs - other than having my braces removed. I like that it is a softer wax, it is more pliable, yet adheres very well. I will be purchasing more as it is much more economical than purchasing the single packs in stores.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I just had to get it compared to the price the other stores were selling it for; this was definitely a steal.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really stick to the braces in the spots you want it, so the inside of the lips is still getting irritated at night.</li>
    <li> It sticks perfectly on your bracket. Easy to put it on and remove. Not too soft like the Gum brand that sold in store. It has no flavor which is a plus. Love it.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  I have looked everywhere in the town where I live and it  is impossible to find orthodontic wax that is not flavored with mint.  This wax is perfect.</li>
    <li> It doesnt stay on the braces very good at all. It comes off at the slightest hint of moisture. I&#x27;m comparing it to the Walgreens brand and Walgreens is 10x better.</li>
    <li> It is a good price. It is true to the picture. I found that this wax is too soft for me. I find that I have to replace the wax on the bracket more often than other waxes. Besides that the wax is great.</li>
    <li> Good value. Works well for me and is sticky enough.</li>
    <li> Wax is soft and pliable!  Nice little container!  A must for dental braces as it lasts for hours until you need to remove it. A lifesaver for your lip irritation!! Plus a little bit goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> This works great for me. Much better than the Gum and CVS brands that I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a mouth injury so I&#x27;ve been covering a tooth with the wax. It goes on much easier than the other brands and stays on. It&#x27;s pliable and it stays on very well. I do have to replace it from time to time. I take it off each time I brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s unflavored and made in USA - ulink the stinging mint flavor that I could only find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews say it melts off. I haven&#x27;t had that problem. I do know another brand said to dry the area first, so I alway dry the tooth with a kleenex and then put it on.</li>
    <li> These are going in my emergency first aid kits, so they haven&#x27;t been tried.  The intended use - for my family - is for emergency dental plugs.</li>
    <li> Good quality wax and works perfectly</li>
    <li> I have had the most difficult time finding just plain wax.  Every time I would need to buy some it always ended up being mint wax and I don&#x27;t really like the mint.  I purchased this bunch and it is just as good as what you buy at the pharmacy or other box store.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had to do a saliva test and this stuff really works!</li>
