      <li>Happy to find such a great price.</li>

      <li>Great color, good staying power, but does need the gloss it comes with several times a day..</li>
      <li>used it for years best overall</li>

      <li>My mother has a more tan skintone that it looks much better on.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite color and it is nice to stock up on it at such a great price.</li>
      <li>This is a great longwear lipstick, and it definitely will stay on, if you can keep up with it better than I do.</li>
      <li>I am loving this color very very much...</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for extremely light skintones like myself,</li>
      <li>Once you find the color that works with your completion and taste, it is very consistent from one run to another.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as bright as I expected.</li>
      <li>Now, the color will stay in place, and feel incredibly natural and comfortable IF you remember to re-apply the balm.</li>

      <li>The same still stands true for all the Outlast lipsticks, but the new colors just don&#x27;t stand up to brazen raisin.</li>
      <li>This lip color really does last all day.</li>
      <li>Disappointed, but confident I will find a shade eventually that will fit he bill!</li>

<li> I had hoped for a long lasting lipstick that didn&#x27;t dry out during the day, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be it.  </li>
<li> If you forget, and leave it too long, the lipstick dries out and starts rapidly flaking and peeling off your lips.</li>
<li> It does stay on a very long time &amp; doesn&#x27;t bleed out of the lip line!</li>
<li> It only barely started to come off in the inner area of my lips, after eating greasy fried chicken.</li>
<li> I am giving this 4 stars, not because there&#x27;s anything wrong with the lipstick, but really because I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very dark color</li>
<li> It dried up after 2/3 hours, never believe of 24 hours.</li>
<li> I have used this lipstick for at least 5 yrs!</li>
<li> I was so disappointed when I heard it had been discontinued!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The lipstick does stay on but when I added the gloss, the lipstick looked greasy and clumped.</li>
    <li> a lovely shade that lasts all day. it might last two days if I didn&#x27;t scrub it off before bed.</li>
    <li> I love Outlast, it stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color and it is nice to stock up on it at such a great price.</li>
    <li> I had hoped for a long lasting lipstick that didn&#x27;t dry out during the day, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be it.  However, the color is great, and it has a nice fragrance so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> beware of crumbling lips</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and love it.  I get several hours of coverage.</li>
    <li> I am loving this color very very much...</li>
    <li> Great color, good staying power, but does need the gloss it comes with several times a day..</li>
    <li> This lip color really does last all day. The only draw back is that it dries out my lips so that I have to keep moisturizer on them</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Apply just once a day.  Once you find the color that works with your completion and taste, it is very consistent from one run to another.  You can always depend on Cover Girl Outlast to do its job beautifully.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to reApply, it dies come off with a kiss or on a glass.  1 tube lasts 6 months!!</li>
    <li> I gave it away, a lot darker than it looked.</li>
    <li> I love this brand &amp; lip color! It does stay on a very long time &amp; doesn&#x27;t bleed out of the lip line! I have used this lipstick for at least 5 yrs! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for myself but for my mother, She likes this lipgloss quite a bit since it lives up to it&#x27;s name, Unless you&#x27;re eating something incredibly greasy, It&#x27;ll stay on all day. It&#x27;s a very dark color so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for extremely light skintones like myself, My mother has a more tan skintone that it looks much better on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as bright as I expected. It&#x27;s darker than the color posted on description.It dried up after 2/3 hours, never believe of 24 hours.</li>
    <li> stays on all day. love this</li>
    <li> I love this brand of lip color and have used it for many years!</li>
    <li> I have worn Brazen Raisin for probably 20 years! I was so disappointed when I heard it had been discontinued!  I could throw it on before I went to work and never look at my face again until I washed it when I got home. The same still stands true for all the Outlast lipsticks, but the new colors just don&#x27;t stand up to brazen raisin. Disappointed, but confident I will find a shade eventually that will fit he bill! I ordered from here by bulk - just in the case I don&#x27;t find something soon enough!</li>
    <li> I receive an open box product</li>
    <li> Have loved and used this exclusively for many years.  Happy to find such a great price.</li>
    <li> used it for years best overall</li>
    <li> I have used this lipstick every day for just over a week now, so that I could give some informed feedback. I am giving this 4 stars, not because there&#x27;s anything wrong with the lipstick, but really because I&#x27;m lazy. This stuff works great for what it is, but I don&#x27;t always remember to re-apply the balm that goes on top. Now, the color will stay in place, and feel incredibly natural and comfortable IF you remember to re-apply the balm. If you forget, and leave it too long, the lipstick dries out and starts rapidly flaking and peeling off your lips. If you can keep up with it, believe me, it will stay as advertised. It will stay after you shower, after sleeping and even after eating. It only barely started to come off in the inner area of my lips, after eating greasy fried chicken. However, I would like to mention one small caveat, that is sugary foods like glazed donuts or ice cream will remove the balm, and cause the lipstick to start coming off pretty rapidly. My advice, if you know you&#x27;re going to eat something sugary, wear another lipstick, or bring some makeup remover so you can remove and re-apply it after you eat. This is a great longwear lipstick, and it definitely will stay on, if you can keep up with it better than I do. If you can&#x27;t you should expect it to peel and flake.</li>
    <li> Received my order quickly and really was amazed at the low cost, will order again when need to, thanks for the savings</li>
