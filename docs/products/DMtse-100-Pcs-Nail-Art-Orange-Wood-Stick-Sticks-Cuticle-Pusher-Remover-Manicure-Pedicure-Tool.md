<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as expected/described</li>
    <li> Love the size of these!!  I am a Jamberry Nails consultant so I mail out a lot of samples and hand out a lot of prizes and these are just perfect to include with my samples.  They fit perfectly in the mail and in my prize baggies.  They are also a great size to use for demos at home parties.  The bigger ones are just so wasteful.  I absolutely adore this size.  Perfect size to throw in your purse too!!</li>
    <li> They took a while to arrive, but they&#x27;re exactly what I needed. I use them to clean up my mani/pedi as I go, and I go through a few of them a month. I&#x27;m not sure if I were buying them in bulk for professional use if I couldn&#x27;t find a better deal, but for just me, they&#x27;re a great deal.</li>
    <li> I could pass out orange sticks to the neighborhood ladies! Shared them instead with daughter-in-law and grand-daughter.</li>
    <li> They were never actually delivered. Lame.</li>
    <li> They are fine, although shorter than I expected.</li>
    <li> Shorter than I expected, but will work</li>
    <li> I used these while in beauty college &amp; hadn&#x27;t used them again til now. I loved these then &amp; I LOVE them now. You can moisten the flat end with cotton to remove anything, use them to place dots of glue, polish-let your imagnition be your guide. I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND ;-)</li>
    <li> Too short hard to hold on to</li>
    <li> These were way longer than I had anticipated! I&#x27;m guessing at least 9&amp;#34; or more! They are good quality just longer than I had really wanted to fit in my sample packs.</li>
    <li> They arrived in about 3 weeks. They were only 3 inches instead of the 4.5 in the description.</li>
    <li> The pieces in the order I received were 3 inches long total (imagine the length of a toothpick). The description indicated 4.5 inches but that is NOT what I received. I must say that I was upset and disappointed when I received my order. 3 inches is just too short especially if the person using this item is an adult and has average to large hands.BUT I gave it 3 starts for the excellent quality of the product and fast shipping. An upside is that it&#x27;s short enough to keep in my makeup bag. I suggest this Seller change the description to reflect 3 inches in length rather than 4.5 inches. I&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;ll be purchasing from this Seller again.</li>
    <li> Just as described by seller.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> Exactly what they say they are.</li>
    <li> I like the product and its good for my small hands.I ordered this for my personal use and stock. This is also good for one use which i liked.Yes i will recommend this!</li>
    <li> Perfect condition !! Works wonderful !!! Would recommend !! And very durable</li>
    <li> I love these! My only complaint is that it took a long time to ship.</li>
    <li> This was packaged quite well and came quickly and was in good quality.&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly as described and will work really well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> They are great, the only thing was the month that it took to get them</li>
    <li> I just got mine 15 days after 😊</li>
    <li> Love these orange sticks very strong</li>
    <li> They served their purpose and are a great buy! I actually purchased them twice because I loved them so much the first time!! I use them for Jamberry and myself in general.</li>
    <li> Are these sticks really made from the Orange bush/tree?  If so, I didn&#x27;t know they were so sturdy!  Love these sticks.  They don&#x27;t bend so the tips are perfect for clean up after manicures/pedicures.  I swirl cotton around the pointy ends to keep my supply of cotton swabs up!  :-)</li>
    <li> Cheap and work great! I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Recieved merchandise very fast. They are alittle smaller than I expected but until I give them a try, thers nothing wrong with them.  Look forward to seeing oyher merchandise they sell and hope to do further business wign them.</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Good price and what I needed. A couple were splintered/broke on the flat end but I&#x27;ll keep those for personal use since I don&#x27;t use that end much.</li>
    <li> These are approximately 3-4inches in length with a pointy end and flat end.  Look like thick tooth picks.  If you are looking for real orange wood sticks used in the salon, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> what can I say?  they work just fine</li>
    <li> Claims to be 4.5 inches in length, but is only 3 inches in length!  If I wanted them this short, I would&#x27;ve saved the old ones and cut an inch and a half off to freshen the ends.  In the photo, the bottom one is from the order I just received -- pretty clear it&#x27;s not even close to 4.5 inches (&amp;#62; 11 cm), but is only 3 inches (7.5 cm).</li>
    <li> Excellent product, solid, sturdy &amp; the perfect size!  Great quantity (100 pieces) for the price.  I hand out with Jamberry nail wrap samples.  Took about 4 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> there isn&#x27;t much to say about these they are what you use them for. they have many uses and can be used in crafts of all kinds just not for doing nails.</li>
    <li> All great will purchase again</li>
    <li> Great. Arrived in shorter time than expected. Product was as described</li>
    <li> Great price on these orange sticks and they are of excellent quality. I have been very happy with them and will order again.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and seem well-made.  Not flumsy. Probably couldn&#x27;t snap them in half easily. The pointy end is pointy and the flat-ish end is flat.  I was sort of expecting them to be a little longer.  They are put put golf pencil sized.  I have small hands so they will likely work out fine.</li>
    <li> Great price and lots to spare.</li>
    <li> Only 3 inches long.  not 4.5</li>
    <li> So many orange wood sticks for so little money. Nice quality!</li>
    <li> Work good on my nails</li>
    <li> I am not sure what is a fair review, I received these with 24 sticks in the package. I contacted the seller and they did promptly offer a refund but did not offer to replace. I took the refund and ordered off ebay after for a little less money.&lt;br /&gt;The sticks were the right size, which was nice. I like that they are smaller and fit nicer for on the go. I just wish I had all 100 for when I needed them!</li>
    <li> fabulous orange sticks!  I like the flat side and the pointed side!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t have to much I can say about these other than the value. They are a good quality (no splintering or poorly cut ends), and for the quantity you get a great deal. I use these for wiping polish off my cuticles when painting them (regular and gel polish), and also for pushing my cuticles back after I use a cuticle softener and remover. Once these get wet from the cuticle softener, they lose their rigidity and don&#x27;t really serve their purpose. For this reason, they need to be cheap since they&#x27;re disposable after a use. This is the best deal I could find for a quality product and with prime shipping. I&#x27;m a happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful, please take a minute to let me know with the voting buttons below. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the size of these! They are cheap, and the perfect size for gift bags!</li>
    <li> These orange sticks arrived in a timely manner and were exactly as described. The price was amazing for the quality of the sticks. No random splintering at all. I would totally order these again!!!</li>
    <li> My staff loves these sticks. Makes it so much easier for them to get into tight places while working and cleaning</li>
    <li> Very low quality.  These come direct from China so they took a VERY long time to arrive and we not packaged well.  Very soft wood that splits and splinters super easily. You definitely get what you pay for.  There are better options out there.</li>
    <li> More cuticle sticks than I will ever use but it is nice to not worry if I lose one or two or many.</li>
    <li> I do nail art design and go through these like crazy.. and since you can&#x27;t really sterilize these after using them on someone, it&#x27;s cheap to buy it like this instead of buying them 5 in a package at your local drugstore or even the dollar stores..</li>
    <li> They were exactly what I wanted. The 3 star rating is because they took forever to arrive. Overall the quality is good.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy cleaning firearms and are looking for a way to get into the nooks and crannies without scratching things up, these fit the bill nicely. Wrap a cleaning patch over either end and you will find it very easy to clean residue from rails, bolts, ect.  They hold up nicely.  Get several bags at this value price.  Give them to fellow shooters as gifts. They will be amazed at how well they work.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use and give away with Jamberry applications and wraps.  Nice size.  Not a thick as ones from Jamberry or as long but more portable and no problems with them at all.</li>
    <li> The quality was good and shipped faster than I expected, but was a little disappointed that they didn&#x27;t have a flat end.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot and will last me a while</li>
    <li> These manicure sticks were made in China.  If you use wooden toothpicks, they too are made in China, then you will understand that the manicure sticks have splits down the middle making them break in two quite easily, plus the ends are not clean and have &amp;#34;shaggy&amp;#34; wood ends that might cause splinters under your fingernails when using.  Be careful.  Bottom line, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Just as described, decent shipping time...awesome deal!</li>
    <li> They definitely are orange sticks</li>
    <li> Great price. Holds up just like more expensive versions.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best cuticle sticks I&#x27;ve bought ! Just the right size!</li>
    <li> As decribed by the seller. Good product.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> sticks are nice - were longer than i was hoping for. work well though</li>
    <li> Slow shipping. Good product.</li>
    <li> I love these sticks! I use them to remove excess nail polish on the sides of my nail bed and they work well. They are very strong, wooden sticks that can be reused. This pack is very affordable and comes conveniently in 100 pcs. Now I have stock good for 3 to 4 lifetimes.</li>
    <li> Wow. Made in china JUNK. I am shocked at the high star ratings on this product. I was afraid to use this for fear of splinters. One side which i thought was the flat side for pusging down cuticles was smaller than the &amp;#34;pointy&amp;#34; side of the tweezerman orange sticks(which im trying to replace because i dont like them). The other side is a sharp point which i assume is to clean under your nails. Again, i would be afraid of splinters. To add insult to injury these were shipped from china, went through customs and then the post office required a signature for delivery. All in all, i waited a month to get this junk. I cant be bothered to return. Perhaps theres some other use for these. Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> FROM SHIPMENT, PRICE, WORKS WELL. THE STICKS ARE STRONG AND DURABLE TO THE POINT WERE YOU CAN GET TWO USES OUT OF ONE IF YOU IS USING IT FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY. I WILL BUY MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> Lets be honest, this is not that kind of product to be very excited of, these are just wooden sticks. Personally to me, it worked very well and I have nothing to complain about, therefore I give it 5 stars. Low price is a benefit, not meaning you will receive a bad item. I use it at once, I throw it, it is just a wooden stick.</li>
    <li> perfect sticks, perfectly shaped and smooth, i love rosewood sticks as they push easier on my cuticles and these are priced appropriately, compared to sally&#x27;s at 5 sticks for 4 bucks. will def buy again when finished</li>
    <li> Shorter then expected but works all the same.</li>
    <li> Got them today, they took a while to get here but that&#x27;s expected because it comes from China, plus the shipment is free so I don&#x27;t mind. I was surprised to see the sticks were not as short as some reviews described, overall they look great.</li>
    <li> Just perfect and very functional.</li>
    <li> The orange wood sticks do the job I need them to and are gentle enough to work with. It did take a bit for my package to arrive, but for the price, not such a big deal.</li>
    <li> Perfect for use if you need to correct the  runny  nail polish.  Use them for hand nail only  I do not thing they are strong  for cuticule  for the toes. Use metal one there.</li>
    <li> The description says they are 4.5&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;and they are just under 3&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I really want to give zero stars but it appears I am required to give at minimum 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;And there was not 100 sticks in the bag.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, good quality</li>
    <li> Use these all the time. They are nice and sturdy, great to use on my manicures. I only use them on myself, and I use each one a few times before discarding. They&#x27;re short, but perfect for my needs. I&#x27;ve used them for several months now, and have no complaints at all!</li>
    <li> they work.  Many of splinters and the edges are rough but I&#x27;ve got nail files and it&#x27;s easy to clean them up enough to use them.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s a good thing they are inexpensive.</li>
    <li> These sticks are great for anyone using them for nails etc. I used them to help push back cuticles before applying Jamberry nails. They are cheap enough and come with enough to share with your customers so they can have plenty when applying their Jams also :)</li>
    <li> These are great for removing under your nail dirt and grime.  One end has a flathead and the other a point.  They have been incredibly useful and worth having around the house.</li>
    <li> I live in West Houston just off of Westheimer, 8 lanes of traffic, 4 going in each direction.  Shopping abounds up and down the street.  However, I could NOT find orange sticks at any of the 4 different beauty supply stores near my home.  These were just the right price, so I purchased 2 packs.  They are a must for my manicures.</li>
    <li> However, my stuff finally came.  It was a week later then what they said it would take.  Then I counted the sticks and there was only 95.  I use these for my business.  They are smaller than I was thinking.  Not happy about the size either.  They will do for what I need them.  I doubt I will order from them again.  I ordered from them on a recommendation.</li>
    <li> Some of my sticks were splintered and I couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> wood sticks, orange sticks, cuticle pushers, either or, they are what they are, little wood sticks used for whatever...i happen to use them in my nail salon.</li>
    <li> great for keeping handy for keeping under nails clean. For those of us that are O. C. D. about keeping our nails clean.</li>
    <li> Cheap, decent quality, arrived quickly, and I throw 1 or 2 in each of my nail wrap shipments as a little perk for ordering from me. Good deal!</li>
    <li> Great price! Bought a second pack already! I am a consultant for jamberry nail (http://kimerz826.jamberrynails.net) and do in home parties. These are wonderful. I also include them with my samples. That is probably why I go throught them so fast!</li>
    <li> Great.. took a while sent as requested... over all good</li>
    <li> I received these 11 days before they were scheduled to be delivered. I also got 108. They are perfect. The funny thing is that I didn&#x27;t look at the length when I ordered them. They are cute little sticks. Just as heavy duty as any others, but I don&#x27;t feel as wasteful with these. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I paid for 100 stick and only received 75.  But I guess I can&#x27;t complain, they were like only 3.00</li>
    <li> I purchased these because of the price. I pay $1 for one at the beauty supply store but I see why. You get what you pay for,some of the sticks came in the package where split and frayed on the cuticle pusher end and the ones that didn&#x27;t when you use them wet they fray and split, OK for dry use only.</li>
    <li> these are half size orange wood sticks so don&#x27;t think you are getting the full length ones as I did because you will be disappointed but they still work.</li>
    <li> These are the most essential things in manicure history, great for cuticles, removing excess polish, water marbling, you name gotta have it</li>
    <li> Not much you can say about this product.  It does what it is supposed to do.  I also use to clean crevices anywhere in the house because they will not scratch whatever surface.</li>
    <li> What can I say alot of great orange sticks 😊</li>
    <li> Received my item quickly I like the product it does what it suppose to do I will order more once I run out but 100 will last me a while awesome price thanks!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and were exactly as stated.  Thank you</li>
    <li> It does its job, and for the price and sheer number who can complain. I would get again when these finally get used up.</li>
    <li> Great price for Orange Sticks!  Perfect for party favors!</li>
    <li> This was not communicated in the purchase nor checkout pages that this would take a month and a half to get to me.  This is not acceptable business practice.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great for cleaning up nail polish around your cuticles &amp; you can get closer with these than a qtip. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Great price, but takes a long while to receive.</li>
    <li> These are much smaller and break easier then all of the other nail art sticks I have purchased in the past. They took over a month to arrive, and then when they did I was pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> It came on time and was what I wanted. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Great! I ordered two packs and they&#x27;re exactly what I expected. Perfect price, too.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re the same quality as the more expensive smaller packs you can get at drugstores or beauty stores. They are even double ended - slanted flat one end, pointy on the other end - something I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d get due to the low price.</li>
    <li> Great price, and very fast shipping especially for overseas.  I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> They was much shorter than expected</li>
    <li> The perfect size for what I have in mind for them.</li>
    <li> Typical orange sticks, nice quality, good price.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product,fast shipping</li>
    <li> These are awesome orange wood sticks. I wanted one pointy end and one end to be able to push back my cuticles. I tried getting a big pack in store, but could only find packs with five sticks that were over four dollars. They are also a good length too. Highly recommended! Great on shipping time as well, in fact they came before the due date.</li>
    <li> Order arrived timely and was as stated.  I would buy this again when needed, but plenty were in the package.</li>
    <li> These sticks are great. However, some did come splintered! I wanted these sticks to help clean up the extra polish that sometimes gets on my skin. The ones that splintered I used for water marbling. Really these are great sticks for the price. If you&#x27;re looking for a great cuticle pusher, get a nice metal one. They will not splinter and will do a good job.</li>
    <li> Right price. Right product. That makes it REALLY RIGHT by me!</li>
    <li> These are perfect sticks for the project I am working on right now. I can&#x27;t tell you details yet but these sticks are exactly what I need!!!</li>
    <li> These are shorter than I expected and are just long enough to hold comfortably (not a problem, just be aware).  They have nice, smooth edges.  These were an excellent deal and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a little shorter than I expected, but they work wonderfully! I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase if I ever run out of these! lol</li>
    <li> I have waited on these for about a month now and they still have yet to arrive. I don&#x27;t think even the price being so cheap is worth the wait of it.</li>
    <li> The bag contained quite a few damaged sticks that broke easily. Overall, good product.</li>
    <li> I use these for my Jamberry business. They&#x27;re the perfect sample size and are great at removing the cuticles from your nails before applying the Jamberry wrap!</li>
    <li> got all 100pcs they are the small ones though</li>
    <li> Product worked great. Was as expected</li>
    <li> Now I can use them and throw them away. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are great for pushing back cuticles and to put in my gifts.</li>
    <li> These are adorable,mini orange sticks! I am a consultant for a nail company and these could not be more perfect for my prize and sample packets!</li>
    <li> Shipping took longer than estimated But the product is good.</li>
    <li> Fabulous value and good, &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; wood that&#x27;s just right for cuticle care. I will for sure buy these Orange wood sticks again</li>
    <li> As described, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the quality or price.</li>
    <li> These work fine but the package of 100 was short by 4.</li>
    <li> Too small...size of half a pencil.</li>
    <li> I thought,these were full sized orange sticks but there about half the size of actuall orange wood sticks</li>
    <li> These are hard to find with the flat angled pusher edge on both sides. Item is exactly as described &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Love them awesome size for sending in the mail with other nail accessories thank you.</li>
    <li> Item is as described.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE SHORT, ONLY ABOUT 3 INCHES</li>
    <li> I ordered these Orange sticks for my Jamberry business. I will be using these in my sample packs.  Fo the price I couldn&#x27;t pass them up. Although I think they are a little smaller than the description says they are, but they will still work for what I intended them for.</li>
    <li> Shipping was incredibly slow, but for the price I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter! Product arrived and was as described.</li>
    <li> These Orange Wood Sticks came before expected date. They were a bit shorter than I had expected, but they work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being bored I actually counted them up &amp; got exactly 100. They were in great shape except for 5 of them. Either the pusher side was chipped or the part where you hold it looked as if it would give me a splinter when using. I thought more would have been ruined so I was happy with the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular tooth pics just don&#x27;t do the job like these do. Every store I have went to they are $6 for a handful of maybe 10 or less. So this is deffinetly a steal!</li>
    <li> For Electric Watch Repair these are Great.</li>
    <li> Great for use pushing cuticles, or with nail art. I&#x27;ll use the more pointy end to paint, or remove polish that pool around the cuticles. All around very useful tool to have when doing you nails.</li>
    <li> These are just ok.  Yes, they&#x27;re the correct shape and size but as another reviewer stated, they have splits and splinters in quite a few of them.  I use them with a bit of cotton wrapped around the pusher end so I and the friends I&#x27;m using them on stay safe.</li>
    <li> These are short enough to fit in your hand and use with more precision than the longer ones.  I like that the can store in a smaller area as well.  These are your typical orange wood sticks, they shipped fast and were priced fairly.</li>
    <li> Few had flaws. Came fast in mail. Great overall.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> i love bulk and will buy again</li>
    <li> They are a great fit for what I need and very affordable.shipping took about a month.so if you need in a hurry you might want something else.</li>
    <li> Perfect.,...love them...no issues</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really find these anywhere and absolutely not in a pack this bug. We use them for so much stuff including cleaning under nails, pushing cuticles back, helping undo a knot in shoe laces, separating eyelashes that have  clumped together and unclogging hairspray nozzles.</li>
    <li> Orange sticks are orange sticks.  Not much to say about them.  Took a while for shipping.  Does what I wanted them for.  Would recommend if you are wanting orange sticks.</li>
    <li> They work wonderfully</li>
    <li> what are you going to say about orange sticks?  I use them for what I want.  The product is as advertised</li>
    <li> I found it to be sharp for the cuticles so I rubbed lotion on the stick before using it.  That did the trick.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of my own nail art, and sometimes I get nail polish very close to my actual nail on my skin. It&#x27;s great for removing dirt from your nails and taking off polish with some polish remover. I advise to be really gentle if you push your cuticle back. I would suggest a metal cuticle pusher for a more precise procedure.</li>
    <li> I received 91 instead of 100, but other than that they are fine. Typical orange sticks. They do the job.</li>
    <li> Point end is good, but push end is angled to harsh making it very thin and sharp. Also, needed sanding as mine are all ready to give you a splinter. If you just want the pointy end and are careful not to give yourself a splinter, then you&#x27;ll be happy with them as the pointy end works well. Genuine wood.</li>
    <li> My wife loves them when she is putting on her nail polish when she is using her shellac polish.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> All the way from China nice size stick they took a long time to come but came in by the date stated</li>
    <li> A bunch of wooden sticks.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy, and the quantity is insane, I have so many, they&#x27;re going to last me a very long time! I love the dual sides &amp; the length gives you a good grip on them.</li>
    <li> Great amount of orange wood sticks. I should be set for a long time.</li>
    <li> These orange sticks were exceeded my expectations. I have recently started using Jamberry nail wraps. One of the essential steps of application is the use of these orange sticks to ensure no oils from your fingers are transferred onto the wraps. These orange sticks are the perfect length while being smooth and strong enough for normal use. These ended up being a fantastic bargain and will last forever. I bought some more expensive ones from target before finding these and I believe these are far superior. Shipping was great, they arrived faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> I do my nails on a daily/every other day basis, so I tend to go through orange sticks pretty fast, I love that I was able to buy in bulk/</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Jamberry business! I include these with my samples! (echomayernik.jamberrynails.net)</li>
    <li> I never got the product at all, so I don&#x27;t have a clue about what they are like. Update: Hooray! They finally came today! Very nice product, too, at a fraction of the cost at local stores. I&#x27;m very pleased! It takes exercising a little patience, though, because they are coming from Hong Kong. It took a month and two days for my order. Thankfully, I was not needing them right away.</li>
    <li> Work great- super cheap!</li>
    <li> Only source I could find.  They met my needs.  Would have preferred to buy USA made and grown wood.  I avoid products made in communist China when possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to a somewhat thicker stick, but these will work fine.  I use them for &#x27;detailing&#x27; collectible dolls I paint from blank vinyl kits- and the little creases sometimes need a bit of work with the sticks to make sure paint is even and not smudged.  They work great for getting a bit of the Genesis heat set paints out of the jars as well.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Handy.  Nicely made.  Good product.  Very dependable .</li>
    <li> Good deal, but shipping took forever.  Useful for manicures!  I use the flatter end to clean up the polish around the sides of the nails.</li>
    <li> Small, but i really like them that way! Super easy to use, came pretty fast and came with the right amount.</li>
    <li> They are short which I like and packaged very nicely</li>
    <li> Beware these are not your regular size orange sticks. They are half the size.</li>
    <li> items performs as advertised</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Item as said</li>
    <li> These came direct from China to my doorstep. That was kind of neat for my kids to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it came as described. This is a set of 100 orange wood sticks. They are not long like you might expect if you use these for sewing. These are about half the length of a sewing orange wood stick. But for nail art they are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each end is slanted at a different degree angle so you can use each end for something different. They are also sturdy and do not break easy. They are good for several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I ordered these knowing that they where going to be OK. After reading previous posts about how a few came out splintered, I decided to take my chance at them anyways (who knows, they could have just got a bad batch). They arrived quickly, and as with most of the over seas orders from Amazon I get I did an inspection as soon as I got them. 12 came out splintered, but at least one end of them was still useable (which is OK with me for the price, I will just use them for when I have to mix my polish with thinner after they get to that point). However counting must not be a big thing because I only got 72 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, they&#x27;re decent. I wont have to buy them for a long time. Price/shipping wasn&#x27;t horrible either. If I would order again? Eh. I doubt it.</li>
    <li> They work perfect for heating up my nail wraps.</li>
    <li> As explained in the details.  Rod quality is good. Fairly solid.</li>
    <li> These sticks are durable and are smooth.  They are not cheap ones that fall apart easily when a little pressure is added.</li>
    <li> This item was described as being 4.5&amp;#34; long. They are 3&amp;#34; long.</li>
    <li> Item description lists length as 4.5&amp;#34; but they are only 3&amp;#34; and too short to hold well.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to arrive other than that they are exactly what they say they are.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very slow, product as described</li>
    <li> The title says 100 pieces but it came in two bags of 40 (so 80 pcs total).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise they are as described and work as expected.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for jamberry</li>
    <li> Lots of sticks for great price.</li>
    <li> They are strong and sturdy and months later I still have a lot! and I paint my nails every two weeks/ When they finish, if it ever finishes lol, I will order again.</li>
    <li> Arrive in good condition.</li>
    <li> I love that this is disposable and are short in size so it is easier to handle. Sometimes the slanted ends seem sharp but I just file it off a little or make it smoother with an emery board. I also like its price.</li>
    <li> I like that these are short and I love the pointed end. I use them for more than pushing back my cuticles. They&#x27;re also good for cleaning up and placing stones, This design allows for more precision.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get this item! I can&#x27;t belive the price and how many come in the package! I always take care of my hands and nails! This item is a must if you feel the same way.</li>
    <li> Good quality and perfect for my Jamberry nail wrap in-home demos, vendor shows and demonstrations for potential clients.  I use these for one-time use (as you should since you don&#x27;t want anyone to get viruses, bacteria and germs from each other) but these are cheap enough.  It&#x27;s something that must be done, haha!  You can search for Belinda Henry on the jamberry site if you&#x27;re interested in learning more.  Click on &amp;#34;find a consultant&amp;#34; and then submit search with my name.</li>
    <li> Love how short these are!</li>
    <li> These are great for gel polish manicures.  I use to take off polish, prep my cuticles, clean off excess polish before curing, and doing nail art with the pointy end.  Good quality, nice smooth sticks.  not too long, not too short.</li>
    <li> missing 13 out of package!!!</li>
    <li> The product came earlier than expected, which is great, but the actual orange sticks were only 3 inches in length. The description stated they were 4.5 inches. The sticks are easier to use &amp; handle when they are 4.5 inches, but they will do the job.</li>
    <li> Received my shipment today! Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for, a necessity for a good manicure and promotion of strong, healthy cuticles and nail beds. It&#x27;s hard to understand why such a common and reasonably priced item isn&#x27;t available in the nail care section of pharmacies, groceries, and large department stores. I was beginning to think I&#x27;d never find them anywhere! Great product, smoothly finished, and splinter-free!</li>
    <li> I ordered these on March 1st and they didn&#x27;t arrive until the 31st. Which is fine, the last time I ordered they took awhile to receive since they come from China. However these are TINY. I just measured, they are 3 inches long. Really disappointed that the length was misrepresented in the description. I can&#x27;t use these for clients, they are like kid sized. Also, received 92 instead of 100.</li>
    <li> They are great to use on one person then toss them out or give them to the person you used it on.</li>
    <li> Product was as described. Fast and easy delivery!</li>
    <li> There shorer than i thought  they would be.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my business and is just what I need! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> These arrived in about a week and are just as expected. I just started water marbling my nails, and these were perfect for cleanup of the water. Haven&#x27;t used them for anything else.</li>
    <li> Does what it should. The price was good. Shipping took a bit but it came from some distance.</li>
    <li> quick shipping, exactly what I wanted, great quality</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get them but I did get them. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> The items are as described, the quality is not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. It did take several weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> We only received 89 sticks and 1 was broken.  Many of them were splitting.  I would not recommend them AT ALL.</li>
    <li> They work great, were shipped a bit faster than was expected per the email, and they were the best price I found.</li>
    <li> There are about 93 pieces, not 100.  I love the short stick.  I always feel i waste a lot of the longer orange wood sticks for my maniqures.</li>
    <li> These are NOT 4.5 inches. They are barely 3 inches long. Many of mine are damaged and splintered. They also shipped from China and took 4 weeks to arrive. Purchase elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Lots of Orange Wood sticks for the price.</li>
    <li> Great, handy little cuticle pushers! Purse size.</li>
    <li> These are 1/2 size of a normal orange stick, but that is perfect for me as I am using them as a part of a gift for my Jamberry wrap customers</li>
    <li> These are great for helping to remove those tiny bits of polish on your cuticles. I use them with every manicure. Teh ywere an excellent deal as well.</li>
    <li> These orange sticks are very smooth. They aren&#x27;t super long like some I&#x27;ve gotten. They&#x27;re the perfect length. I&#x27;d definitely order them again. Just make sure you order them with plenty of time in advance. They say they can take 22-24 days to get, although I received mine in about two weeks.</li>
    <li> I do like these cuticle pusher sticks, but they are quite smaller than I thought they would be. They&#x27;re very small and skinny. I however am liking the thinness of the pusher end because its easier for me to control it and really pushes the cuticles back far without hurting my clients.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was not great. They come in a thin plastic bag and when I opened the yellow/orange shipping envelope, all of the sticks were out of the bag. The sharpness of the sticks ripped the plastic and they all came out. But they were all in the shipping envelope, none came out of the package itself.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped quickly. I ordered it May 6th and it arrived May 10th.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m overall happy with this purchase.</li>
