      <li>Its definitely pricy and although the jar it comes in is cute, it can be hazardous and difficult to open and close.</li>
      <li>The Body Shop Spa Wisdom Africa Honey &amp; Beeswax Hand and Foot Butter is so luxurious and comes in such a cute little container.</li>
      <li>I do shop with the Body Shop direct, but it&#x27;s just so much simpler to order immediate needs from Amazon, as I only need my password-no rigamarole!</li>

    <li> This stuff is awesome and arrived early. Just wish it was a bigger jar</li>
    <li> The smell is heavenly, and the jar lasts for about 3 months for me (if not more - this is both hands and feet). Don&#x27;t count on it to repair really cracked feet however, use [[ASIN:B0046XL5U6 The Body Shop Hemp Foot Protector, 3.45 Ounce]] for this purpose.</li>
    <li> I am not one to apply lotion on a Regular basis although I should.  This has a nice light scent and is not greasy.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Leaves your hands silky smooth but not greasy.  My cat loved it so much she wouldn&#x27;t stupid rubbing her head on it acting as if all hyped up on catnip.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to help my foot heal and it has done a great job</li>
    <li> I bought this hand and foot butter after reading other reviews. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would be as rich and easy to spread because of the beeswax, but I was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s not greasy and soaks into your skin immediately without leaving you feeling dry however I like my skin to have a sheen to it and that it did not provide. More importantly, it did heal my dry and irritated skin. Its definitely pricy and although the jar it comes in is cute, it can be hazardous and difficult to open and close.</li>
    <li> I read multiple beauty reviews looking for the best lotion for my dry hands. My research paid off, this lotion is incredible. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is not the best smelling lotion ever, but it does smell good and feels thick and moisturizing on my hands.</li>

    <li> I gave this 4 stars because I was hoping the lotion was going to be a bitter thicker as I use it on my feet. But, for the rest of my body this lotion is absolutely wonderful and has an amazing smell to it. Definitely will recommend this to friends! And you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m a baker and wash my hands constantly. This is my new go to lotion :)</li>
    <li> It does the job extraordinarily well and we are totally satisfied.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I plan to reorder before my supply runs out because this is exceptionally good for dry skin.  I personally love the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this hand cream in the dead of winter to battle dry skin.  The actual cream is okay, however the jar and latch drive me crazy...it&#x27;s hard to clamp shut when you&#x27;ve just applied hand cream.  I&#x27;ve pinched fingers and cracked nails openning and closing this jar.  It would be a great product if it just came in a tube or a jar with a screw-on lid.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that this product works just great for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Truly a treat for the feet.  So moisturizing-you don&#x27;t have to reapply the same day like some others I have used. A little goes a long way.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> The Body Shop Spa Wisdom Africa Honey &amp; Beeswax Hand and Foot Butter is so luxurious and comes in such a cute little container. i live in the Northeast where keeping hands and feet hydrated during the cold winter months is a challenge. This stuff does the trick, and has a mild pleasant scent too. Like it so much I ordered the subscription service.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this product, even it&#x27;s pricey, I thought I&#x27;ll give a try.  Used for a week and half, still not see any improvement on my dry skin.  It smells good but useless on my hand and foot, I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> i love this product.  it was given to me as a gift several years ago, and i thank my friend every time i use it.  it is not oily.  it&#x27;s scent is not overpowering and it makes your hands and feet feel wonderful.  a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this! It really works on Dry Winter hands and feet. Without being Oily! Everyone I show it too,try&#x27;s it and Loves it too. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive :(</li>
    <li> Best hand cream I ever used, non greasy, skin unbelievably soft!</li>
    <li> This butter is marvelous! Received as a gift, as giver knew my feet would make the roughest sandpaper blush. I use this product after every shower. In the past, I would destroy all my pumice stones in no time flat, and am just now finding that dealing with the problem before it becomes one is the best prevention! I do shop with the Body Shop direct, but it&#x27;s just so much simpler to order immediate needs from Amazon, as I only need my password-no rigamarole! Thinking of auto delivery for the winter-what a great concept!</li>
    <li> This product is like none my wife has ever used.  I get her a new bottle about every six months and she loves it on her feet and hands.</li>
    <li> I keep ordering this lotion. It&#x27;s the ONLY thing that has helped with dry, scaly knees. Love the smell, love the product.</li>
    <li> I had hoped to purchase a cream for my hands and feet that would be a bit richer in texture than this.  Application is easy and non-greasy with a light fragrance; however, it really has not done much for my dry hands in the weeks I have used it.  For the price and recommendations, I did expect more.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a hand cream that contained *both* beeswax and honey because I have found that the combination works best on my dry hands(keeping them from bleeding too!)  The cream does not feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, and even keeps the skin soft following a hand washing. I got it on the subscribe and save program so that I will never run out!</li>
