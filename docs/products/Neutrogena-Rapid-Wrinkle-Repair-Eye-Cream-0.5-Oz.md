      <li>if so, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>Not bad, could be better.</li>
      <li>However, after using the product for several weeks I wanted to report the remarkable results.</li>
      <li>but im getting the crows feet by the eyes when I smile and some fine lines underneath also...</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m 37yrs old and starting to notice wrinkles around my eyes when I smile.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I do like Neutrogena products in general, they&#x27;ve always had a good line of products for guys not looking to get into all these crazy girlish cosmetic lines.</li>
      <li>After several weeks of using this eye cream the wrinkles don&#x27;t look as pronounced and coincidentally it has reduced the look of a scar near my eye.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye Cream works extremely well for these two issues - dark under eye circles and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>

    <li> Not bad, could be better.</li>
    <li> I think I may have written a review for Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye Cream before, so please excuse if this is a duplicate. However, after using the product for several weeks I wanted to report the remarkable results. I have had dark circles under my eyes for years. It feels as though I have tried every product on the market to alleviate the dark circles, all without any results. I had to report the efficacy of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye Cream because it works tremendously well. After using it for about a month, my dark circles are noticeably lighter - in fact they are just about gone. I know this is &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; cream and it does do an excellent job smoothing wrinkles around my eyes. Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye Cream works extremely well for these two issues - dark under eye circles and fine lines and wrinkles. After my past experiences with other products, I did not have the highest expectations. However, Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye Cream works incredibly well! I already ordered another tube to have on hand so I don&#x27;t run out. Please remember everyone&#x27;s experience may be different, but it works for me. It&#x27;s also relatively inexpensive (especially compared to department store brands... yes I have tried those too.) Please remember this is just my opinion and experience, your mileage may vary.  If you try Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye Cream I hope you have as good an experience as I did... if so, you&#x27;ll love it. I highly recommend Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye Cream. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Order with confidence, as Neutrogena and Amazon stand behind their products.</li>
    <li> I dnt think is working for me , I won&#x27;t buy this product again</li>
    <li> Great product-and affordable</li>
    <li> Works well.  It is easy on skin and a good moisturizer.  If you are looking for a &amp;#34;fix it&amp;#34; product, this is not it.  However, a mild product the does not irritate skin and helps with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I think that this eye cream works great for the price. I&#x27;m using it as more of a preventative. I have very sensitive skin and this has caused no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> THIS EYE CREAM WORKS .... I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN AND WRINKLES AROUND MY EYES... I AM 48 AND HAVE SEE A HUGE DIFFERENCE WITH THE DAILY AND NIGHTLY USE OF THIS PRODUCT .... HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase.  Continues to work exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I used this as prescribed  and was disappointed I saw no changes on my eyes...Im 50 year old and have pretty good skin but im getting the crows feet by the eyes when I smile and some fine lines underneath also...Ive been using it for over 4 weeks...So waste of money and Im already tight wit money...read others reviews and heard great things but not for me...also there was no tingling whatsoever...and it feels a bit dry now and I didn&#x27;t have those issues before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not expecting something to be magical BUT I was expecting at least a bit of difference...wish I still had the packaging would had returned</li>
    <li> Creamy and spreads nicely.  Now just hope it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream daily for a month now. The crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes haven&#x27;t reduced a bit. Once the current tube is used up I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I only have minor lines around my eyes but so far I think I can actually tell a small difference with this product vs all others I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin either.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a bit of difference.  It doesn&#x27;t do much for moisturizing under the eye either.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple weeks and I do like the results.  I&#x27;m 37yrs old and starting to notice wrinkles around my eyes when I smile. I&#x27;ve never used moisturizer or eye creams on my face or eyes in my life until now.  After several weeks of using this eye cream the wrinkles don&#x27;t look as pronounced and coincidentally it has reduced the look of a scar near my eye.  Maybe the simple fact I&#x27;m using some sort of moisturizer around my eyes is helping but I&#x27;m sure the ingredients in this product are helping (retinol &amp; hyaluroic acid).  Either way I&#x27;m liking the results I&#x27;m getting from this product.  I do like Neutrogena products in general, they&#x27;ve always had a good line of products for guys not looking to get into all these crazy girlish cosmetic lines.</li>
    <li> It is thicker tan expected and I have not seen a difference yet after using nightly.</li>
    <li> Not efective its a fake</li>
