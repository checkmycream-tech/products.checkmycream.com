      <li>I gave the gel a 5 star because I loved it, however, I did notice if not rubbed in</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s just some kind of lotion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is by far the best wrinkle reducer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>oh sure, another miracle product but this time...</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s OK,</li>
      <li>Hopefully I will be able to use most of the product.</li>
      <li>but then, you wouldn&#x27;t need it if your friends were a distance from you. : )</li>
      <li>I am totally impressed and will definitely be ordering a full-size item.  </li>
      <li>So be sure to rub it in well.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>but the weirdness is worth the results!!</li>

      <li>The product works great but the pump isn&#x27;t working properly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great especially if your going to be taking pictures!</li>
      <li>Thank you for making such a great product.  </li>
      <li>I have tried just about every type of cream available.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it is great for pictures or special events.  </li>
      <li>Wow, what an amazing product.</li>
      <li>I am getting ready to order more.  </li>
      <li>Works Great, but don&#x27;t use too much or you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re wearing a white mask.  </li>
      <li>like i put a mild form of superglue under my eyes...</li>
      <li>it was worth the cost to try it for those wrinkles under eyes-&lt;br /&gt;think</li>
      <li>but I do see some results with smile lines.</li>
      <li>I rarely return anything.</li>
      <li>Its nice to find something that actually does what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>I, like many received the mailed sample of Hydroxatone Instant Effect 90 second and loved the tiny sample and had to have more.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do any good and took quite a while to dry.</li>
      <li>So when I found it here I was very pleased but had reservations, it would be the same, read all the reviews and they were all for the most part positive about the cream working the same as the sample.</li>
      <li>I experienced a definite tightening sensation with the sample product, especially around the eyes, that I have not noticed with the purchased product.</li>
      <li>The item worked exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I use it after makeup is applied because to use it first, then apply makeup, smears it off.</li>
      <li>Well, at first I thought I was getting a deal on this product.  </li>
      <li>This serum did exactly what is said it would do.  </li>
      <li>Seems there are certain side effects that they just can&#x27;t seem to get right...</li>
      <li>The product was good but left a white powder on the areas applied.</li>
      <li>I certainly did with the product when I purchased it.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>and I felt it really working.</li>
      <li>I thought about a facelift, but the cost was too much.  </li>
      <li>You really have to use this stuff sparingly.</li>
      <li>But again, it really does reduce the puffiness.</li>
      <li>This product works and looks great for a few minutes - then you get that white chalky dust, and the smoothing effect disappears before you even get out of the house - just like most other under eye wrinkle reducers promising to last and smooth the lines out.</li>
      <li>It really does what it says it&#x27;s going to do ... not like most other products.</li>
      <li>The results are the very best of any product I have ever used in the last past ten years of my life.  </li>
      <li>This really helps me \\&quot;grow older gracefully\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered the free sample, and will wait to see how well it does in the long run.  </li>
      <li>but it appeared to be only about 1/4 full.</li>
      <li>I am in my 60&#x27;s and this product really worked for me around the eyes, and on my upper lip where my smile wrinkles are etched.  </li>
      <li>Hardly enough to make sure even, that the product actually works.</li>
      <li>If you only have a few small, finely wrinkled, problem areas, I would recommend having some on hand to make them look better for special occasions.  </li>
      <li>I look so YOUNG!</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I smile a lot and tend to crack the surface once it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
      <li>Also too much will leave a white residue, therefore use sparingly ...</li>
      <li>It leaves a white chalky film on your skin which is very visable.</li>
      <li>It does leave white around your eyes if you use too much.</li>
      <li>old.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this in quite a while...don&#x27;t like the white residue it leaves, but maybe I&#x27;m using too much of the product</li>
      <li>WOW...</li>
      <li>saying they can&#x27;t believe I am 51 years old...</li>
      <li>is smooth.you are young.</li>
      <li>I was so surprised..</li>
      <li>90 second Wrinkle Reducer NEW IN BOX!]]</li>
      <li>I am in my mid -sixties, and am still teaching Jr. High.  </li>
      <li>I cannot rate this item high enough.</li>
      <li>It will last for a few hours, depending on how much you smile and make eye expressions.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product that really reduces undereye puffiness of the numerous products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not going to handle a face full of wrinkles, unless you are willing to have the tube last only a few days.  </li>
      <li>, use very little , tap on with a que tip, don&#x27;t smooth on with fingers..would buy again but cost triple what I paid last year..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does reduce fine wrinkles.  They&#x27;re still there, but not so noticeable.  And it does last as advertised.  It did not improve my deeper wrinkles.  However, each tube holds only a very small amount of serum, which makes it quite expensive, even at Amazon&#x27;s  significantly reduced prices.  If you only have a few small, finely wrinkled, problem areas, I would recommend having some on hand to make them look better for special occasions.  It&#x27;s too expensive, at least for me, to use everyday.  It&#x27;s definitely not going to handle a face full of wrinkles, unless you are willing to have the tube last only a few days.  If it were not so expensive, or if the tubes were larger, I would give it 4 1/2 stars.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product in the mail and thought, oh sure, another miracle product but this time...wow! I was so surprised.. Nothing I have used to date has been able to help me with my heavy eyelids which make me look older, tired, and just plain miserable.  This serum did exactly what is said it would do.  I am totally impressed and will definitely be ordering a full-size item.  Its nice to find something that actually does what it says it will do.  Great job!</li>
    <li> What it is: A temporary fix for wrinkles under the eyes    How long it last: 4-6 hours    Cons: can leave white residue behind, and if u need to fix your eye make up you have to start all over.    It&#x27;s great especially if your going to be taking pictures! I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the day... It&#x27;s just a little much but at night it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> A little pricey for what you get.  It does minimize wrinkles but there is not much so, use sparingly. Best use under makeup.</li>
    <li> This product works and looks great for a few minutes - then you get that white chalky dust, and the smoothing effect disappears before you even get out of the house - just like most other under eye wrinkle reducers promising to last and smooth the lines out. Seems there are certain side effects that they just can&#x27;t seem to get right...Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The Hydroxatone Instant Effect 90 second works only four to six hours after application. And I have to used it after applying my hydratante regular. Otherwise it will removed.</li>
    <li> I, like many received the mailed sample of Hydroxatone Instant Effect 90 second and loved the tiny sample and had to have more. That sample was wonderful and loved it and I felt it really working. So searching as I didn&#x27;t want to buy from Hydroxatone directly because I didn&#x27;t want to be obligated their instant ship on my credit card method. So when I found it here I was very pleased but had reservations, it would be the same, read all the reviews and they were all for the most part positive about the cream working the same as the sample. I waded out the pump breaking or the whiteness  which mine doesn&#x27;t do) For this is why I&#x27;m extra disappointed when my purchase arrived and I was able to try it and it was nothing like the mailed sample. I didn&#x27;t get that same tingling feeling, or that tightening that the sample did.  Very disappointing.. I&#x27;m planning to return it if I can do it for free.. if not I&#x27;ll throw it away and add to my online buying reservation list. This cream doesn&#x27;t do anything. Don&#x27;t buy it!! I give it one star because it doesn&#x27;t allow me to do no star&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I am on the \\&quot;mail sample\\&quot; lover convoy. Got a sample in the mail and too was amazed by the nearly instant results. Even my teenage daughter was taken aback and tried some herself. I must have more! I gave the gel a 5 star because I loved it, however, I did notice if not rubbed in well enough it left a white patch. So be sure to rub it in well. It feels a bit like a thin mask on the face. If it dries on your fingers you can roll it off if you rub them together. Wow, what an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love the product but was disappointed as it seemed like it was almost empty.  Not sure if that was intentional or not, but it appeared to be only about 1/4 full.</li>
    <li> Have not received item yet, it was lost in the mail but I was called to tell me they were reshipping this.  I can recommend this company as standing up for quality, and very good customer service</li>
    <li> Seriously.... No wrinkles left!! Feels good on my skin and even makes laugh lines go away. God sent product!!! Would not live without it again!!!</li>
    <li> The fast shipping I received from this place is unbelievable ... I do not live close by or in a big city. We live in a remote area in Montana.  I ordered on a Saturday morning, it came US Postal Service, and I received it two days later on Monday. This product cannot be described anything other than ... \\&quot;Wonderful\\&quot;! It really does what it says it&#x27;s going to do ... not like most other products. My daughter wanted to know what I did, and told me I really looked good. I&#x27;m 58, I do have wrinkles ... and this made my day.  Just remember not to make any facial expressions for at least a couple minutes, so it can set. Also too much will leave a white residue, therefore use sparingly ... I cannot rate this item high enough. :o)</li>
    <li> ...and I didn&#x27;t like the effect. Didn&#x27;t really do any good and took quite a while to dry. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for anything, but I am AMAZED at the results of this product.  I have always genetically carried luggage under my eyes and have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of the black circles and puffiness but nothing has ever worked.  I was completely shocked when I put this product on and the bags and circles literally disappeared.  I can&#x27;t stop smiling!  It&#x27;s seriously unbelievable.  This one actually works!!!  As a side note, it does feel a little weird... like i put a mild form of superglue under my eyes... but the weirdness is worth the results!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  I tried the sample and thought I would give it a try.  I am getting ready to order more.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am in my mid -sixties, and am still teaching Jr. High.  I thought about a facelift, but the cost was too much.  I have tried just about every type of cream available.  This is the only one that truly works.  When I start to run out I order 2 -3 at a time.  Thank you for making such a great product.  It gives me renewed confidence in my appearance.</li>
    <li> I too got a sample in the mail and have to have more! I love what this gel does for my eyes! It smooths the skin and removes the puffy under eye look.</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s incredible.first I thought it was really.it&#x27;s amazing.recommend.thank you.Easy to use and the result is instantly.goodbye to wrinkles.the face is smooth.you are young.</li>
    <li> The effects of this product does not seem to be as noticeable as the sample I received in the mail.  I experienced a definite tightening sensation with the sample product, especially around the eyes, that I have not noticed with the purchased product. And, I could see a difference in the mirror as well.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Hydroxaton Instant Effect 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer does seem to work, but I could not apply it without leaving with marks on my face. It doesn&#x27;t dry clear. It was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!  A very, very little goes a long way!  I just put a teeny tiny amount on my finger and work it in around my eyes or problem areas, and WOW...what a difference!  I have people coming up to me saying they can&#x27;t believe I am 51 years old...I look so YOUNG! and where are the wrinkles????  :)</li>
    <li> I thought this would be just another waste of money but was surprised it gets some results. I use it after makeup is applied because to use it first, then apply makeup, smears it off. Use sparingly and allow to dry. THIS IS NOT A MIRACLE WORKER but I do see some results with smile lines.</li>
    <li> I could use only a small portion of this product as the case was damaged when I received it and most of it was dried up. I managed to dig some out of the bottom through the crack and it worked the way it was advertised. Not enough product to use often. I was thinking of buying it again but I cannot afford to have another mishap with the container. I thought about returning the broken tube but it was such a hassle that I just forgot about it. I rarely return anything.</li>
    <li> i had a mail sample and could not belive what it did to my under eyes..I looked like I never had a wrinkles..Wow!</li>
    <li> This dried up after only one or two sparse uses. Hardly enough to make sure even, that the product actually works. To my mind, a total waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Works Great, but don&#x27;t use too much or you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re wearing a white mask.  Glad I bought 2 vials!</li>
    <li> I was not as happy with the product after I purchased it like the sample I received  in the mail which work better.    if I knew this I would have never order it. It does leave white around your eyes if you use too much.</li>
    <li> The product works great but the pump isn&#x27;t working properly. When pumped the lotion dosen&#x27;t come from the spout but from under the white piece. Hopefully I will be able to use most of the product. I don&#x27;t think I kept the papers in order to return the item.</li>
    <li> These pumps do not work and the vendors do not cover /respect frustration /offer return cost re shipping.  The product was good but left a white powder on the areas applied. If you cannot apply the product, or get it out of the pump, what good is that?!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  It leaves a white chalky film on your skin which is very visable.</li>
    <li> The picture is wrong, I received the blue tube, not the silver one that is pictured, so I overpayed, thinking I was getting the one I wanted.</li>
    <li> work as it said it would, love it.  Share it with my girlfriend and she order some too. would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I guess I am the third person to try a sample from in the mail.  I am in my 60&#x27;s and this product really worked for me around the eyes, and on my upper lip where my smile wrinkles are etched.  I have good skin, but this took a couple of years off my face.  I too want to use this product and see what long term effects it demonstrates. I look forward to using this product....</li>
    <li> And I guess I&#x27;m the 4th person to try a sample in the mail.  The effects are instant and unbelievable.  Unfortunately, you lose some of the tightening effect when you smile. I&#x27;ve ordered the free sample, and will wait to see how well it does in the long run.  This is by far the best wrinkle reducer I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m 65 ½ yrs. old.</li>
    <li> I have used this and it&#x27;s OK, but I would not rave about it.  It is honestly no better than any other similar product.</li>
    <li> The results are the very best of any product I have ever used in the last past ten years of my life.  Strangers never believe my age.[[ASIN:B004O3T0AU Hydroxatone Instant Effect 90 second Wrinkle Reducer NEW IN BOX!]]</li>
    <li> This is the worst product that i have ever bought in my life, when you apply it leaves white marks on your face and doesn&#x27;t do any of the work that they were talking about</li>
    <li> So, so.....not really a big deal you want it to be.</li>
    <li> The item worked exactly as described. Not enough product for the price though. Yes I would definatly promote this product to every one.</li>
    <li> this product is not what I expected!  It turns white on your skin. If you add an moisturizer your wrinkles will still be there!!!  After using the product 2 times the pump stop working!!! Dont waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product that really reduces undereye puffiness of the numerous products I&#x27;ve tried. The only complaint is that it leaves a white film. You really have to use this stuff sparingly. Even when you use it sparingly, you may end up with a little bit of the white residue. But again, it really does reduce the puffiness.</li>
    <li> My puffiness retreats and my wrinkles fade when I use Hydroxatone Instant Effect 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer. The effect lasts long enough to get me through a morning job interview, lunch with my friends, and dinner with my husband. It is less expensive than Botox treatments or a mini face-lift and I can use it whenever I need to and then wash it off. I have never used makeup so any product I use to reduce my signs of aging has to be transparent and non-irritating. This product is perfect for me. I recommend Hydroxatone for those who want to see less puffiness and fewer crow&#x27;s feet around their eyes as an inexpensive temporary remedy. This really helps me \\&quot;grow older gracefully\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Well, at first I thought I was getting a deal on this product.  But when I went to use it I found I was sent an empty container.  I have returned it very disappointing.</li>
    <li> When you put on skin, it dries white so doesn&#x27;t do any good. Not natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this in quite a while...don&#x27;t like the white residue it leaves, but maybe I&#x27;m using too much of the product</li>
    <li> This product is useless, it is not the real Hydroxatone Instant Effect.  I&#x27;ve tried this product at an ULTA store twice and it is amazing - this product did nothing.  It&#x27;s just some kind of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend finding this product elsewhere though, it made me look 20!  (I&#x27;m 33)  It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it is great for pictures or special events.  It will last for a few hours, depending on how much you smile and make eye expressions.</li>
    <li> This stuff works if you apply a very thin layer and don&#x27;t add makeup over it.  I smile a lot and tend to crack the surface once it&#x27;s dry.  It also feels kind of weird because it pulls on the skin around your eyes.  It makes you look great from a distance.... but then, you wouldn&#x27;t need it if your friends were a distance from you. : )</li>
    <li> This product really works.</li>
    <li> This product worked however is pricy- it was worth the cost to try it for those wrinkles under eyes-&lt;br /&gt;think I would stick with the botox or other similar products. It seemed to leave the area of application a little dry.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, cost a lot less last year., now price sky high..product works for me., use very little , tap on with a que tip, don&#x27;t smooth on with fingers..would buy again but cost triple what I paid last year..</li>
    <li> It is pretty expensive for what it does.  The little canister it is in, needs redesigning, it squirts across the room, so I have to put my finger almost over the little nozzle so it won&#x27;t get wasted.  Then it will kinda minimize a wrinkle, but dried with a white film. Still I use it until I find something better.  There are many wrinkle fillers out there. When in a pinch I have been known to put hair gel on a wrinkle, seems as good as this stuff.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a sample of this in the mail. I used it and loved it.That&#x27;s why I decided to purchase it. I never noticed the white flakes under my eyes with the sample. I certainly did with the product when I purchased it. The seller was prompt but the product I give a BIG thumbs down.</li>
    <li> Good concept, bad product.  Very difficult to keep it from scaling.  Makes eyes look like they are peeling.  It is worse under makeup.</li>
