<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last several months and feel I&#x27;m at a place to confidently review it. Overall, I really like this product. Pluses include: easy to apply, quick drying, NO SCENT (this is so huge for me), great for sensitive skin like mine (re: doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts),affordable and also 72% organic. Changes I&#x27;ve seen: It leaves my skin smooth and glowing and I noticed an immediate difference in look and feel of my skin. My only negative is: user error and not having enough usage information I need on the product bottle - I&#x27;m not sure whether to use this with or without  (before or after!) additional moisturizer, because as I&#x27;ve transitioned into colder months using this product, I do require an additional moisturizer on my skin. Otherwise I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a serum that brightens and tightens skin naturally!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews of related products  - and am so happy to have purchased this product for several reasons: 1) it does not require that I use a moisturizer in order that I see results, 2) the gel goes on easily &amp; smoothly, and dries in just the right amount of time for me to apply makeup, 3) my skin is perfectly evened out in order to apply my powder based make-up; other products I used under make-up would dry unevenly and I&#x27;d end up with obvious darker patches of base powder or blush and would have to start over, 4) this product is NOT drying or pinching, as others have talked about the necessity or applying a moisturizer to &amp;#34;seal in&amp;#34; the product - I use alone, 5) my skin shows less wrinkles and a smoother appearance immediately, 6) the smell is fresh and natural, 7) the dispenser is perfect (once I figured out that it must be pumped very near the opening vs. farther back). 8. FINALLY, I need to say in all honesty that I had (at 55yrs. ) decided to forego the expense and tedious process of attempting to keep my skin younger-looking. With THIS product, however, it is 1. Simple 2. Very reasonably priced. 3. Can use alone without a bunch of other products, and best of all ,4. IT WORKS ON CONTACT without having to wait for results. Simple. Effective.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I love this serum. First impression, it has a pump and a tab which prevents it from leaking out during shipping. It measures out just a small amount which is the perfect size. One pump size is the right amount for me. The serum is clear and scentfree. It is a cooling gel that even after drying is not sticky, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth. It has reduced some of the fine lines and my skin looks more youthful. I would recommend this serum to anyone looking for a healthy boost to there complexion.</li>
    <li> Morea offered to send me a bottle of their hyaluronic acid serum to test out, and I&#x27;m always willing to try a new product. That said, I do have rosacea and sensitive skin, so that makes finding an ideal skin cream really tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it&#x27;s slowly becoming cooler here in Vermont, that&#x27;s when my rosacea really starts flaring up. I&#x27;m currently on Metrogel to help get it under control. Therefore, I used Morea&#x27;s serum over my Metrogel. One of the side effects of Metrogel is that it can dry out the skin, so a good moisturizing serum or cream is essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Impressions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is really pleasant. It&#x27;s smooth without being greasy. There&#x27;s no detectable scent, which is great for my sensitive skin. It goes on well and after a full week, my face hadn&#x27;t broken out, which is common of my sensitive skin. That aspect alone impresses me! I&#x27;m not noticing that it is stopping the Metrogel from drying my face out. But, nothing seems to help, so I definitely do not blame the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series does boost skin plumping benefits. I don&#x27;t really have many lines or wrinkles, so I saw no improvement there. That said, I also decided to test it out on my hands which do seem to age faster than my face and have some lines. I won&#x27;t say it made all the lines on my hands go away, but it definitely cut the numbers down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients given also make me feel good. There is hyaluronic acid, though the source is not listed. I wrote blogs for a number of plastic surgeons and know where hyaluronic acid typically comes from. It does say it is a vegan form on the labeling though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C and green tea extract are also listed. Most ingredients are organic, such as aloe and jojoba oil. There are also ingredients like witch hazel, vegetable glycerin, Vitamin E, and geranium oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Take&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with the improvements I&#x27;m seeing on my hands. I have a feeling that the serum would also be amazing on my face if I wasn&#x27;t on Metrogel. Therefore, I&#x27;m giving it four stars.ing on my face if I wasn&#x27;t on Metrogel. Therefore, I&#x27;m giving it four stars.</li>
    <li> Container: Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid (HA) Age Delaying Serum comes in a white plastic pump bottle. There is also a small stopper to cover the dispensing opening. This is a near perfect container because it is easy to use and also fully protects the product from oxidation, pollution or stray contamination. It is a generous 1.7 oz. size. It is Paraben Free, Cruelty Free, and 72% Organic. The only thing missing is an indication of the shelf life once the product is opened. The indications for use and directions are minimal and don&#x27;t really describe the full benefits of this great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Witch Hazel, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, MSM, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Jojoba Oil, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Geranium Essential Oil, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: This product is in a gel form when dispensed. Only 1 pump is needed to dispense enough to cover the face, with another pump for the neck area. The gel spreads easily and quickly.  Once applied there is a cooling feeling to the skin as the product is quickly absorbed. There is a slight mild rose scent which fades as the product is absorbed. I could instantly feel my skin becoming hydrated and soothed. This is an excellent gel for morning or night. Because it absorbs so quickly and fully, with no stickiness, the product is perfect to wear under makeup. Once absorbed, my skin felt much softer and smoother. This effect continued until the product was removed by cleansing. I have talked before about the benefits of hyaluronic acid. It is terrific for aging skin, fully hydrating and helping the skin retain the moisture, without being greasy or heavy. Morea Naturals HA Serum does this perfectly. Continued use of this serum helps the skin to remain hydrated and smoothes tiny lines and wrinkles. I definitely recommend this product as it works well for my skin and has fewer ingredients than other similar products. Some products add in a whole variety of ingredients, but too many can lead to sensitivity and side effects from use. Morea has just enough to do the job. They also have a lifetime guarantee in case there are any issues.as fewer ingredients than other similar products.

    <li> I love this product. I have noticed an improvement in my skin after only 11 days. I intend to re order this product.</li>
    <li> still using it but i like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry out right away like other serums i own. Will update my review when i see progress.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I was so excited when I was able try this for my review. It&#x27;s already helping with my fine wrinkles and keeps my skin super soft</li>
    <li> i have used many serums in the past and present, however this hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin c is really making an improvement quickly! my fine lines are smoother and softer and i really like how it absorbs quickly and gives my a beautiful glow! it also feels great going on and smells pretty good too! so glad i got free for testing and review.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my usual moisturizer and used this as a short term alternative.  I&#x27;ve now been using it daily as part of my routine for almost a month and it really is great stuff.  My skin gets dry and red but has been clearer, less dry, and brighter without being too shiny.  It&#x27;s not harsh on my skin and hydrates without feeling greasy or clogging pores. It goes on like a clear lotion (gel?) and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or shine when it&#x27;s dry. A great addition as a moisturizer. When I ran out of my first bottle, my skin went back to breaking out, drying, getting red, ect. and I had to wait to buy more.  This stuff really worked and I hope I can continue to find it.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizing serum. It is thick, goes on smoothly and absorbs well into the skin.  Does improve skin tone, however for me there was no improvement as claimed for fine lines.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I have used more expensive kinds and this one is comparable. Do yourself a favor and try it.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It combines two of my favorite things in a serum, vitamin c and green tea! I love the effects it has on my skin. My skin feels healthy and hydrated after using this serum. It doesn&#x27;t soak in as quickly as some but still only takes a few seconds. I love the pump. It makes it so much easier to apply. Sometimes the droppers that normally come with serums can be a bit messy. Overall this gets an A from me! I greatly appreciate the chance to review this item!</li>
    <li> My skin is oily but when using this product I don&#x27;t get that shiny look on my forehead. I comes in a easy pump bottle and mess free. Love using this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum! The pump is a nice change from the usual dropper that I find in serums. It dispenses a good amount of product, and it&#x27;s easy to push. The serum itself is a little thicker than I&#x27;m used to, but I like that it&#x27;s unscented. Having said that, I don&#x27;t like it as much as Murad&#x27;s Vitamin C serum that smells like natural citrus. The product seems to be making my skin look smoother. The packaging is nice, but I kind of wish I could see the product inside. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin, as promised by this product, after using it for a month.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, smooth skin and awesome quality</li>
    <li> About a month ago, I started using Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum and my skin has never looked younger or better! Now that I am 40 years old, I am always looking for natural, effective products that work on my more mature skin. This is a wonderful serum with mostly organic ingredients tht is light and pumps easily onto my fingers for application. Thanks Morea. I received the product for free to faciliate this review but the opinions within are my own.</li>
    <li> I was contacted by this company and asked if I would write a review. I won&#x27;t receive any compensation other than a sample of their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-is a clear gel that is absorbed quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-left my face feeling soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-has almost no scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-goes a long way so I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money on it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-has worked best on the lines between my brows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked this product. I have been using it for over a month now and it hasn&#x27;t caused any ill effects (quite often skin products can make me break out). I especially appreciated that it didn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky so using makeup over it wasn&#x27;t a problem. I would love to say that it made me look twenty years younger after only a month but that would be untrue. What I HAVE found is that the lines between my brows are definitely not as deep and the same is true for the area above my lips.  I would recommend this product, especially as a preventive to hold aging skin off as long as possible.</li>
    <li> I have tried 4 different Vit C with Hyaluronic Acid serums. This one is BY FAR the best.  My skin looked much brighter and tighter after a couple of weeks. I have oily and acne prone skin. This product works well for oily skin and does not promote acne. Absorbs completely, spreads easily.  I will definitely purchase more of this serum and use it regularly.</li>
    <li> This Serum is great!  It absorbs quickly and is not sticky.  My crows feet are significantly softer as well as my forehead lines.  I put this on after I wash my face then put a Lumene moisturizer over and my face is radient!</li>
    <li> This has a great airless pump which is my favorite type of container. It almost never fails me. Haying this serum in a solid colored container is also another plus. While I would like to see how much I have left I know this is probably protecting it for break down as well, since lighting can cause these products to wear out or break down quicker. The consistency is thick and gel like and applies easily, dries quickly and gives extra hydration but be sure to apply your moisturizer after this dries to maintain the moisture in your face. There is no scent that lingers on your face. A great product to maintain moisture. I use this one during the day and think it has been doing a great job. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my unbiased thoughts and opinions.</li>
    <li> great product, container pumps out just the right amount.  the first few days the pump was not regular and I would over pump, but now it works great.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Reviewed by Amy W.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for review&lt;br /&gt;Review originally posted at Romancing the Book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be the first person to admit to being skeptical about the many claims that Morea Naturals makes regarding its beauty serum. However, after trying the product for two weeks, I can report that while I haven’t seen a dramatic change, I feel like this is a quality product worthy of being on my shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in a well-protected mailer to ensure no damage would occur. Upon opening the cap, I was pleased to see that the serum is dispensed via an airless pump bottle. This was much more convenient than having to squeeze out of a tube or use a special applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the packaging, this serum is loaded with Vitamin C and green tea, which would explain the slight fragrance. It’s not exactly unpleasant, but my husband did ask me to identify the odor. The application process itself was very easy, with virtually no mess left behind. I was especially impressed that the formula was light as opposed to greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I completely sold on hyaluronic acid being the key to glowing skin? Maybe not, but it certainly didn’t hurt anything to try it.</li>
    <li> I like this product so much after I have used it for a while my face is bright. Just wonder how could amazon doesn&#x27;t let this product to be available in the shelter anymore.</li>
    <li> makes my skin super soft</li>
    <li> I apply this everyday as soon as I wake up.</li>
    <li> My first time using this and I love it. My normally dry skin is so smooth and not the least bit flaky.</li>
    <li> As someone who is prone to breakouts when using facial products I have to say I absolutely LOVE the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. The Green Tea oil in the serum helped clear up my skin with no further breakouts. My skin feels &amp; looks healthier after the use Morea Hyaluronic Acid Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I recieved this product free of charge in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
    <li> I had never tried a serum like this that also had vitamin C so I was excited to try this.  I have been using it about a week and a half now,I am 47 and have combination skin.  I think this serum really works well, especially on my older combination skin.  It smooths on easily after you wash your face, I wait and let it soak in a bit before applying moisturizer. I did only use this at night but it seems to be working well.  My skin is looking great, isn&#x27;t dry or tight and wrinkles are less noticeable.  I also noticed some brown spots left from acne scarring faded.</li>
    <li> I will cut right to the chase for you: this serum by Morea erases age spots and sun spots. That is a pretty remarkable feat for a product that mainly contains natural and botanical ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this hyaluronic acid serum for about six weeks to a patch on my leg that had some bad sun damage and brown spots, figuring I would put the serum to the test against my worst tanning damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of my six week trial, my spots had faded noticeably. I will continue to use the serum in the same location until the marks are eradicated. I am so happy with these results, because I hated those embarrassing spots so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared Morea&#x27;s serum to another one issued by a different manufacturer. Sadly, the competitor&#x27;s offering did absolutely nothing for me--no changes to the slight hyperpigmentation along my hairline where I applied it. That serum contained only 2.5% hyaluronic acid. In contrast, this serum from Morea has double the amount--5% of 100% pure hyaluronic acid content. I think this is the key element that makes Morea&#x27;s serum so potent and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert and a believer. This is definitely a serum I will buy again. I should mention that the serum is odorless, absorbs mega-fast, and leaves skin feeling smooth and polished, all without irritation. I recommend this product wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> The serum worked very well.  It&#x27;s thick so one pump is all you need.  It&#x27;s mildly scented, so if you have allergies it will not irritate your senses.  It&#x27;s not sticky unlike most serums and does not leave any residue.  Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a correction to my skin tone being more even within the first couple of weeks. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product again. Cleared up some dark spots from acne. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I discovered this serum about 2 weeks ago and I love it!  I wish I could give it 4.5 stars.  It&#x27;s super lightweight, there&#x27;s no fragrance and it comes in a pump dispenser.  It&#x27;s perfect for my breakout prone skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it once a day at night and my skin already feels softer.  I can&#x27;t wait for them to come out with more products!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product like this for a while and I have finally found it! This serum is AMAZING! As a 27 year old  makeup artist and future aesthetic nurse, it is time to start thinking about preventative measures, and maintaining my appearance! I started using coconut oil as an anti-aging treatment and found that the big jar was inconvenient and not travel friendly; moving it to a separate container was messy and resulted in spills! This MOREA serum is not only a  convenient and portable anti-aging product, it feels great, is light and non-greasy and leaves my skin looking refreshed, rehydrated, and rejuvenated! I will be incorporating this product into my normal beauty routine from now on!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for a little over a week and I have definitely seen noticeable results first off let me start by saying when I did first try it out I was sick so my skin was very dull and colorless. After just one application I could notice the life coming back to my skin, my cheeks looked dewy and had a nice sheen to them. The serum itself is thick I was able to turn my finger upside down without any dripping which made it very easy to distribute evenly around my face it also wasn&#x27;t greasy which I have had issues with in the past. It was actually quite refreshing. I know now that I have found my new favorite skin serum. I will check back after a month or so to update my post with any new results.&lt;br /&gt;**Morea provided me with a sample to test out.</li>

Vitamin C and green tea antioxidants will make your skin look brighter.

The icing on the cake is that it comes with a lifetime satisfaction guarantee.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid is amazing for your skin and Vitamin C makes it even better! I got this directly from the company to review and I am just in love with it! i&#x27;m going to be buying my mom-in-law this for xmas for sure :)</li>
    <li> How I love thy let me count the ways, seriously though this stuff is amazing. I have super dry sensitive skin and this did not irritate or flare it up, on the contrary it helped sooth my skin. It hydrated my face after the first application. I love that they use natural organic ingredients in their formula and even though it is not 100% organic, I do appreciate the effort at 72%, plus it is paraben and cruelty free. The serum comes in a white bottle with an easy to use pump; it is clear in color and odorless. One pump is enough to cover your entire face and neck. Your skin is left feeling refreshed and toned. I apply it after washing my face morning and nights. I do not apply any extra moisturizer on top of the serum, its that good at hydrating. I have noticed that my makeup glides on smoothly now. My fine lines have been erased and my overall complexion has improved. I am also pleased with the serum because it has made my pores visibly smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up this serum is gentle on sensitive skin, it does an amazing job at hydrating, diminishing fine lines, reducing pore size and overall complexion improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have not used a serum before, so I was a little skeptical, I also do not have \\&quot;aging\\&quot; skin so I was unsure how this product would work with my younger skin. I have to say though that my skin after using this serum for a week or so is much softer! While not moisturized (I still had to use my aloe face cream) it is smoother and dare I say it.. glow-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not to say the product is 100% wonderful, it is not. Yes it makes your skin soft, supple and dewy but it also is sort of sticky Let me explain, the serum itself is clear and thin, it is easy to apply and you do not need a lot of it to cover your face. However, after the cooling tingle wears off (I enjoyed the cooling tingle after washing my face with warm water) and the serum dries it leaves your face with a kind of tacky feeling, if you poke your cheek your finger sort of sticks slightly and pulls the skin, this was a minor inconvenience as I found that I could not stop poking myself until the stickiness went away (about 5-10 minutes.) The serum has a pleasant smell, it has the chemical smell of most beauty items of this nature but it also has a very slight floral smell that is not unappealing. I will continue to use this product until it is out, but because of my skin I probably will not buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also really like the fact that are animal friendly and mostly natural/paraben free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
    <li> First off, I love this product because it doesn’t have a scent to it. I am very sensitive to certain scents and smells – so I am very appreciative of that. It is also organic – and I truly love that as it works well for my sensitive skin! My skin is quite tricky…so my T Zone tends to get very oily, while some parts of my face tend to get very dry. Needless to say, it was very hard to find a happy balance, as far as the products I use go. Morea Naturals’ Serum has given me that happy balance that I have been looking for. It doesn’t leave my skin looking like a hot oily mess and at the same time, it moisturizes all the corners of my face that would normally have dry patches, no matter what I do to it. Great buy…excellent quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> age: 57  skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rosacea     Morea naturals with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C + green tea: hydrate, brighten, restore - 1.7 oz.-- A light unscented serum in a pump bottle. This serum packs a lot of punch for the price! I am impressed!    I&#x27;ve tried a lot of serums and face creams, so feel almost like I&#x27;m becoming an expert. I&#x27;ve applied the gamut of products from expensive to \\&quot;not so expensive.\\&quot; What I&#x27;ve discovered, as you may guess, is that price has no indication of result. And this product is one of those that while under $15.00, it is an effective serum.    A pump-action bottle (which I do like and many serums are now going in this direction) provides a gel-like substance that glides over the face and is absorbed quite quickly into the skin, leaving the skin soft and supple. No stinging; no break-outs; no burning or itching--which is important to those of us who have senstive skin and/or rosacea.    It does add in the softening of fine lines and there is a \\&quot;brightening effect\\&quot; to the skin. I use this both alone, under a moisturizer, and as well, before I apply foundation. However, I find good results in applying the serum in the morning, waiting a few minutes, then applying my SPF moisturizer cream, then just a little blush and mascara, lipstick, and I&#x27;m good to go for running errands, etc, about town. At night I use it under a \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; face cream--or if I&#x27;m in a hurry, I&#x27;ll use the serum only. If you are going for a full make-up experience, use the serum as a \\&quot;face primer\\&quot; and your make up will smooth on nicely.    With long-term use, I will be curious what other benefits come, though I recognize that face creams can offer only limited results; however, I like the good ingredients listed that I can be confident will aid in the better health of my skin.    An added plus is it is made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this serum and I love it! I mix it with my moisturizer at night and notice my skin looking softer and glowy ever since. I only put it on at night. But it also would be good to try underneath make-up. My pores have also felt tighter and I overall feel like my skin is benefiting from the vitamins in it and is healthier. :]</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It smells sweet and not messy. I love that it is cruelty free. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, not oily like cold creams. This is great on its own. I use it before putting on makeup and very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks and so far I am quite pleased.  I love the clear gel formula...  it feels very light on my skin and leaves it feeling moisturized.  There is virtually no smell which I like.  I have noticed that my skin is getting clearer and less blotchy and it feels smoother.  I do not have deep wrinkles but do have light lines around the eyes...  and yes, I have seen a small improvement.  I will definitely continue to use this product.  I received this first bottle as a free sample but I&#x27;m happy enough with the results to break out the wallet and buy another bottle when I finish with this one.&lt;br /&gt;If I notice any negative changes over the next few weeks or after I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months I will come back and update my review...  but, for now I would feel pretty good about recommending this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and have already noticed slight improvement overall. I didn&#x27;t have really noticeable wrinkles or problem skin before, but now after using  this I have a more youthful appearance to my skin, and feel that it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Best thing about this product for me is that it is unscented. Another thing is it is very light on the skin unlike other products that apply on heavy and clog you pores. My skin honestly felt amazing after use. Highly recommended to anyone</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my mother in law and she loves it! Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I am a obsessed with keeping the skin on my face soft and wrinkle free.  I added this product to my daily regiment about a week ago and am happy with it so far.  The product is clear and is easily absorbed.  It has no scent and works well underneath my makeup.  I cannot attest to any wrinkle reduction because I don&#x27;t have any.....yet.  Hopefully using this product will prolong the inevitable.  I am so excited I was chosen to test this for quality and express my opinion about the product.</li>
    <li> As I have entered my forties and began seeing drastic changes in my skin, it has become very important for me to find a product that can do what it claims.  I hate to admit it but I have spent hundreds of dollars trying products that claim to soften my skin and help reduce the look of my wrinkles.  I have never spent as much money on skin care before!  I have decided to start reviewing the products I use because I feel it&#x27;s important to let others know how their money is going to be spent.  So, let me tell you of my experience with this products because I know I am not the only one with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this product is only $19.99!  Be still my swooning heart!  I&#x27;m already in love so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I love the packaging. I know that doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin but I can&#x27;t help it.  I like the simple design with easy to read directions. Your skin is not the only thing that changes after forty ladies!&lt;br /&gt;Third,  I looked at the ingredients and found that many of them were things I had actually heard of and knew what they were supposed to do!  Sometimes, I won&#x27;t try a product because I can&#x27;t even pronounce the words, much less try and figure out what they are going to do to my skin!  The ingredients that the product contains are Hyaluronic acid (to reverse the signs of aging), Vitamin C and Green Tea (promote collagen production and protect your skin from UV damage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am going to explain how I used this products so I&#x27;m not doing it differently than anyone else.  I washed my face with my cleanser and patted it dry.  I then shook the bottle and pumped twice onto my fingers.  The products looks like a gel but, when I put it on, it glided like silk.  There was no burning or tingling, which is always a plus!  It rubbed into my skin just fine and I was able to use the two pumps worth to cover my face and neck.  So far so good, right?  I did notice that while I was putting it on, there was no scent and the gel was clear.  The product says you can put moisturizer on after using it but I wanted to be able to know if it worked without the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up the next day, my skin was still soft!  I have these lovely areas of dry skin on each side of my face beside my nose.  I know, TMI, but it&#x27;s important that I tell you that so you can appreciate the fact that those areas were soft!  I was thrilled!  Even at the end of the day, my skin was still soft.  I still have all of my wrinkles but the description does say it helps those gradually.  I have hope!  After all, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days at this time.  I have noticed that my sensitive skin has not erupted in pimples or a rash as it has after using other products.  I guess they mean it when they say it&#x27;s safe for sensitive skin.  I have noticed that there is a slight improvement in the skin under my eyes.  It doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve gone a week without sleep anymore.  That is surprising for me because I&#x27;ve always had those dark bags under my eyes.  I&#x27;m excited about this development!  Glowing complexion?  Well, I haven&#x27;t noticed that yet either but I honestly think that would be something someone else would notice first.  The only people I&#x27;ve been around since starting to use this product are my family and they wouldn&#x27;t notice if I dyed my hair purple.  I will be going back to work tomorrow so we shall see.  If I get any compliments, I will edit this to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I like the fact that this product is Paraben free, 72% organic, and not tested on animals.  That is important to me or I wouldn&#x27;t have even purchased this product.  I also like the fact that this is a pump bottle.  I&#x27;m not getting any germs or bacteria into the product like I might if it were a dropper or I had to put my finger on the opening to get the product out.  This product is also made in the USA so another plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope this review helps other women make an informed decision about purchasingthis product.  With the thousands of products out there for our skin, all making claims that we will be transformed, it&#x27;s important to know when your money is spent well or if it&#x27;s another bottle that gets added to the under the sink pile, only to be thrown away later.  So far so good and I do plan on continuing to use this product because I like the results and isn&#x27;t that what matters?</li>
    <li> Thicker than most Vitamin C serums, the Morea naturals potent hyaluronic acid serum is easy to apply. It comes in an opaque bottle so it&#x27;s a little difficult to see how much is left - but because so little is needed for each application, that&#x27;s a minor quibble. It worked well on my naturally oily skin - I actually had a co-worker tell me I looked radiant. Considering how little sleep I&#x27;ve been getting lately, and that nothing else about my &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; routine has changed besides this, I will continue to keep using the product. It&#x27;s also improved my adult acne spots.</li>
    <li> This is a light, hydrating, amazing serum! It smells so nice and makes my skin feel wonderful. I received this for review a month ago and have really been enjoying it. I always try to keep my skin in good condition - need to combat aging for as long as possible! I hope that, by using this product, I&#x27;ll be able to continue to ward off the aging process more!</li>
    <li> But, I have thyroid disease and food allergies and one of those is causing my, under-the-eye swelling in the mornings and because of the swelling increasing then fading, it has left me with fairly bad wrinkles below the puffiness.  I thought this might help but so far I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  I used it every day for 30 days.  When I drink green smoothies, that seems to help more than anything than something I can apply on my skin.  I really liked this serum otherwise as far as ease of application and absorption.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels on my skin. It made my skin glow. It tightened my pores which I need because I tend to have oily skin and large pores. I need products like this that help my skin tone. It makes my skin look younger. It smells great. My skin is glowing. This is a great serum at a fantastic price!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum -- after using for 6 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a nice brightening of my skin, and the texture is soft and smooth.  I am not sure about the diminishing of fine lines, but my usual \\&quot;smile lines\\&quot; around my eyes are the same... which is fine; I am more than happy with the results that I can see!    The pump that dispenses the serum works very well, and I have had no problems with it clogging or breaking.  Each pump gives an almost perfect amount of serum -- a little goes a long way! -- but if you need a little more, you can control the amount of the next pump just by being a bit careful.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and very convenient!    The serum itself is thick, not watery, but it absorbs really well and quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or overly dry, which is a plus for me, since sometimes my skin can feel really dry after using a Vit C serum.  Regardless, I always use a moisturizer after I use the serum and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.    I received a complimentary sample for review.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I have some of this on my face right now. It has a built in pump, just one pump will squirt out enough of this clear, scent-free liquid to cover your face. My skin feels better and a lot less dry after applying this. Will be using it once per day from now on. There is probably at least a month&#x27;s worth of a supply in this container.</li>
    <li> My husband on the other hand, has really enjoyed the serum from Morea Naturals.  He really enjoys that it’s refreshing and soothing.  He suffers from rosacea and psoriasis and I think this is a great product for his problem skin.  I’ve noticed that the redness has really decreased since he began using this product.  Plus it’s great that it is 72% organic and paraben free.</li>
    <li> Love this serum, it&#x27;s been helping with my combination skin, keeping me not too dry or too oily. It gives my skin a beautiful glow! I love that it&#x27;s paraben free and made in the US!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this! And at such a great price, it&#x27;s worth trying it for the first time without breaking the bank!</li>
    <li> potent is right i went from dry lifeless hands and skin to compliments on my skin left and right, i can not get enough of this product not only does it smell great it makes my skin healthy looking enough to turn heads, it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue behind like some products on the market and sure doesn&#x27;t have a medicine smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> With aloe and witch hazel as the first two ingredients, you get an idea as to the thickness of the [[ASIN:B00LWGCC84 POTENT Hyaluronic Acid Serum With Vitamin C - 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid. BEST to Instantly Fill Fine Lines and Boost Radiance For A Youthful Glow. Paraben Free &amp; 72% Organic - SEE RESULTS OR YOUR MONEY BACK!]].  There is no added fragrance, it is 72% organic, and it goes on the skin easily, being absorbed very quickly.  The price for the serum is not high and the bottle of 50 ml or 1.75 ounces will last for awhile.  The white plastic pump container is easy to use and arrives with a tiny plug that needs to be removed from the opening prior to use.  Unfortunately, the serum has found its way to my sink, wall and even the mirror because of the poor action of the pump.  I like the serum but do not like the pump sending the serum every which way than onto my fingers.  I was hoping this would improve over time, but it hasn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m now pumping into my palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as filling fine lines or boosting radiance, this is not a miracle serum, but it feels nice on the face and gives a few moments of a tightening sensation.  Honestly, it&#x27;s likely the same experience I would have if I put aloe or witch hazel on my face, but I don&#x27;t do that.  I&#x27;ve been using a different Vitamin C serum which is dispensed by an eyedropper and that is so much easier to apply.  Its viscosity is much thinner than this product and I can&#x27;t say yet whether or not this one has won me over.  As much as I like this serum, I would be hesitant to purchase this again only because of the squirting pump which takes up more space on my counter and cannot be reused, but must be recycled.  In its defense, this was not packaged in any other disposable materials like a box or plastic clamshell package.  The product is good but I am a consumer who prefers to see the product and not have it concealed in the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided the product for an honest review and did not purchase it myself.se it myself.</li>
    <li> Not working at all for me. I was asked to try this for review. Honestly, it has not done anything. I get no effects, not even moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;This is one I do not recommend ..&lt;br /&gt;Honest review</li>
    <li> This item was pleasant to try. It came in a very nice wrapping, the colors of the products pavkaging was quite soothing. It had no smells, unlike most products i know, and it is way more product in the bottle thsn most people ask. I am in LOVE and will most definitely be purchasing once i run out!! Youtube Review coming soon will updat with links and photos.</li>
    <li> I got a promotion to try Morea Naturals Potent Hyaluronic Acid Serum for free. I been testing many brand. But Morea natural gives out very natural smells. I just apply in the morning of it. Due to dry skin, It&#x27;s gives out pretty great moisture to my face and skin. I could feel my face being hydrated again. Feel more healthy!!n Well do continue the whole botte since it&#x27;s winter. Highly recommend others to buy it and try it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used on my skin, I felt a change after the first application!!! My skin feels so soft and I can almost feel the skin tightening up. I would recommend this to anyone who needs some Anti Aging products. Disclosure: I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Im glad i was able to find this item. Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid, enriched with Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Green Tea. I think that it is important to note that Morea HA is 72% organic and Paraben Free.That is such a nice combo of natural materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One think i liked about this product is the packing. Its cute and simpae on the outside however. IT has an air-less pump container with a very small plastic tip inserted into the opening of the pump spout.I think this is a way to keep the seerum nice and fresh. I knnow all of you out there have items that arent sealed that come apart and you have to shake it back together. This didnt have to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is nice and goes on smooth. It didnt leave me feeling all sticky.  This serum is clear and odorless, and although it comes out in a gel, it liquefies upon application.There is no sting or any irritation, It just leaves your skin feeling  cool and refreshing feeling after drying, leaving NO sticky residue,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One great thing is a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is my first trial of a product containing HA. I have been wanting to see all the hype is worth the price. I was contacted to review a bottle of this serum and now I see what everyone is raving about.&lt;br /&gt;No, I don&#x27;t look 10 years younger. I still have bags under my eyes that nothing short of surgery will erase. This is not a magic serum that will make all your facial issues disappear. But here&#x27;s what I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;My face feels oh so soft. When I first tried this serum, my biggest facial issues (those that can be handled OTC) were rough patches and just dull skin. The rough patches were my biggest complaint. It just didn&#x27;t feel like nice smooth skin should feel. Now after about a month, my skin is back to baby soft. Even my husband noticed! I was very diligent and used this every day after washing. Trust me, it&#x27;s worth the little extra time it takes to work it in.&lt;br /&gt;The dull look has been replaced with fresh looking skin. I don&#x27;t have that tired look. It looks like I just washed my face and am ready for the day, even late in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;The tiny lines around my eyes and mouth are going away. There is a bit of plumping that goes on when you put this on. Like your skin is drinking it in and filling up. That works great for some minor sagging that you would get from a night out on the town.&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t erased years of sagging, but I&#x27;m still going to keep using it to see how much more it will improve my skin. There is improvement, but only diligence and effort will tell if it is the one I&#x27;m truly looking for. I think I need to test it for more than a month before I can give it a final review, but for right now it is doing what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff feels great when you put it on. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it! A full pump is more than enough to do my face and neck. I actually only need to use about half of a pump. There is a lot of product in here! It feels kinda sticky at first, but don&#x27;t worry, it will work in just fine. I thought it made my face feel tight and dry when it dried, but it goes away in seconds, leaving your skin feeling wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of how much is in here, if you look at the amount compared to others, you are getting quite a deal. The price per ounce is way better than other HA products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;About those promises, here&#x27;s one you won&#x27;t want to miss. 100% satisfaction, guaranteed. Hey. If you don&#x27;t like it. You get your money back. Here is the perfect opportunity to try an HA serum without breaking the bank. You can give it an honest try because this isn&#x27;t just a &amp;#34;sample size&amp;#34; container. You can give it a good month, or longer, of trial without having to take out a bank loan.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product with everything in it that your face needs, without all the stuff that you don&#x27;t want.de my face feel tight and dry when it dried, but it goes away in seconds, leaving your skin feeling wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of how much is in here, if you look at the amount compared to others, you are getting quite a deal.

    <li> I love the product!I have a little  trouble with the pump at first.But now i don&#x27;t have any problem used itThe smell is wonderfull,clean,fresh.Is not greasy and all natural!Leave your skin wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It is odorless. It does not make my face itchy as I have very sensitive face. It makes my face smooth. I am in-love with this new product. I found the best moisturizer for my sensitive face. I highly recommend this to everybody.</li>
    <li> The first time I used MOREA Naturals Hyaluronic Acid I had to pump the bottle a few times until the serum dispensed (so don’t worry if nothing comes out right away). Once the serum came out, it was a clear liquid/gel type serum. I will tell you to make sure you do not pump a whole bunch at once because the serum spreads very easily and covers a lot of area. Once applying the product, it did not take long for it to absorb into my skin, there was no sticky feeling once it had absorbed. While I haven’t visibly noticed a difference, I can feel a difference around my eyes while using this product, they do not feel as dried out and saggy as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for review, read the rest of my thoughts here: http://freesocial2011.com/2014/10/review-morea-naturals-hyaluronic-acid-age-delaying-serum-with-power-antioxidants-vitamin-c-green-tea-moreanaturals.html</li>
    <li> I really liked this product! It smelled a lot like witch hazel to me which i find to be very natural and organic. It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate the skin, and it gives the user a firm, softer face. It is slightly drying (as natural witch hazel is) however this is great for slightly oily skin as it balances it well. I like how the bottle was in a pump, as many creams come in a jar harbor bacteria and harmful things. This was easy to use, and made my skin look lovely!</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of trying Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid, enriched with Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Green Tea.  I think that it is important to note that Morea HA is 72% organic and Paraben Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Morea Hyaluronic Acid comes in an air-less pump container with a very small plastic tip inserted into the opening of the pump spout.  I think that this is an ingenious extra safeguard, the air pump delivery protects against bacterial contamination, and the plastic tip inserted into the tiny spout prevents the serum from both drying and clogging up the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply the Morea Hyaluronic acid, I first gently shake the container to ensure the different ingredients are blended, and it only takes 1-2 pumps to cover both my face and neck.  This serum is clear and odorless, and although it comes out in a gel, it liquefies upon application.  There is no sting or any irritation, just a cool and refreshing feeling after drying, leaving NO sticky residue, instead smooth, and cool skin.  Hyaluronic Acid holds 1000 times its weight in water, and it is one of the most powerful hydrating and moisturizing ingredients on the market today. I then use a moisturizer on top as a surface sealant to lock in this moisture.  My Results: my skin tone is brighter, some of the finer lines have diminished, deeper wrinkles are still the same, but my overall complexion is healthier.  I think that this can be contributed to the hyaluronic acid retaining the moisture from the drying effects of the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has the necessary thin consistency; as it contains the molecular character of the ingredient of Vitamin C, which needs to be tiny to penetrate through the dermis (skin), to nourish the lower layers.  Skin rejuvenates, from deep inside, and eventually after several weeks to at least a month this nourished new skin, reaches our upper surface levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Morea Hyaluronic Acid serum twice a day, because the antioxidants Neutralize the free radicals UVA, UVB, and infrared radiation A, from the harmful rays of the sun, and is the cause of those ugly brown age/sun spots.  The antioxidants also help to protect our skin from the environmental pollution that we are subject to in our daily lives.  Then in the evenings, before bed is another crucial time to nourish your skin.  This is supported by findings that many of the major restorative functions in the body like muscle growth, tissue repair, protein synthesis, and growth hormone release occur mostly, or in some cases only, during sleep, therefore skin cells do benefit and are able to rejuvenate during our nightly sleep cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are some of the benefits provided in the ingredients of Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Anti-Oxidant And Anti-Aging Properties Including Preventing And Reducing Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Anti-Inflammatory And Astringent Properties - Skin Repair Properties For: Bringing Down Redness, Swelling And Stinging, - Eczema, Acne, Psoriasis, Minor Bacterial Infections, Cuts, And Sunburn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Anti-Bacterial Properties, Accelerates Cell Growth - Healing, Soothing, Moisturizing, Relief Of Burning, Itching, And Cuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Dry &amp; Mature Skin, Lack Of Elasticity, Wrinkles, And Fine Lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Softens, Smoothens, Hydrates, Moisturizes And To Prevent Moisture Loss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Smooth And Soften Scars And Helps To Heal Skin Sores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Evens Out Skin Tone - Diminish Hyperpigmentation, Dark Pigmentation, Age Spots, Melasma, Pink/Red Acne Scars, Freckles, Sun Damage, And Allows Natural Skin Brighteners To Penetrate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Regenerates Skin Cells, Encourages The Restoration Of Collagen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) Effective For Oily Skin - Does Not Block Pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10) Benefits Bruises, Blemishes, Scars, Scrapes, Cold Blisters, And Warts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A SUNSCREEN IS STILL A VITAL IMPORTANT ADDITION, it should be applied after your entire skin care routine, and before the cosmetic make-up.  Although, Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid serum does contain some anti-oxidants, the surface skin still needs the extra protection that a separate topical sunscreen provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid would be an excellent choice, because it contains ingredients for just about every skin condition and each unique complexion issue.  As I mentioned above, the ingredients are 72% organic, and the serum is Paraben Free.  Used in conjunction with your other skin care products, along with a healthy lifestyle; a wholesome diet, appropriate exercise, adequate sleep, and keeping your body properly hydrated with water, you should see some very attractive and positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  HA Serum provided for an evaluation without any obligation, and my opinions, research and results are my own.provides.

    <li> Out of my household, I would have to say my mother was the most excited to try out Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Age Delay Serum. Morea Naturals has created a high quality product for an affordable price. It’s hard for me to find skin serums that work for my skin, because it’s so sensitive and breaks out so easily. I wash my face once in the morning and once at night; each time I used this Hyaluronic Acid Age Delay Serum. This product is paraben free, 72% organic and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about a week,  I noticed a huge difference in my skin. My skin wasn’t getting as oil and my fine lines around my eyes have a lighter appearance. This serum is great because the ingredients are all anti-aging and very beneficial for your skin. It’s loaded with Vitamin C and Green Tea to promote the production of collagen and helps save your skin from harmful UV rays.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of vitamin C serums lately; I think I&#x27;ve lost count. This one was offered to me by Morea Naturals to try out for free. I immediately noticed it&#x27;s a larger amount of serum than I get from comparably priced serums and it&#x27;s in a totally opaque bottle, which I honestly don&#x27;t often find. The serum itself is a bit thicker than the ones I&#x27;ve tried in dropper bottles and it feels like I don&#x27;t need nearly as much to get the same benefits. So I get more product and I use less of it. That&#x27;s enough to convince me to buy it when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opaque bottle makes me happy because skincare ingredients can break down when exposed to light and the pump style makes me more confident that I&#x27;m not getting bacteria in the bottle every time I use it, which is kind of how I feel when I use a dropper style product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It honestly can take a while to see any real benefits from using a vitamin C serum, so I&#x27;m not going to make up a story about my skin looking 10 years younger after just one week. What I will say is that my skin hasn&#x27;t had any bad reactions, the quality of the serum seems high (thicker, with beneficial ingredients), the packaging is better than what I&#x27;m used to, and overall, I feel like I&#x27;m being good to my skin using a vitamin C serum. I just want to stay looking like I&#x27;m 5 years younger than I actually am for as long as I can and I feel like I can do that using this serum every night.</li>
    <li> Written by Craig&#x27;s wife:&lt;br /&gt;In my quest to find the perfect (read: works but doesn’t require a second mortgage) anti-aging solution, I came across the MOREA Hyaluronic Acid serum.  As with everything in my life, I applied it along with a generous helping of skepticism.  Thus far, I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it hasn’t reversed the hands of time to the point that I get carded when buying a bottle of wine…but there has definitely been subtle changes in the gathering fine lines under my lower eye lashes and at the corner of my eyes.  More remarkable was the almost instant reduction in dark circles under my eyes which have plagued me for years.  I’ve not seen any other product have even a fraction of the brightening effect that this has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very impressed and will continue to use this around my eyes.  As I notice other areas of need I will try it and hope to slow down this speeding train of aging…</li>
    <li> My first thought when I got this product was that it sounds very harsh, it sounds like it would burn my skin. So, what is hyaluronic acid? I asked myself the same question so I decided to do a little research. I was surprised to find that hyaluronic acid is actually \\&quot;a naturally occurring carbohydrate in the human body.\\&quot; It is found in large amounts in between skin cells, and in the fluids in the eyes and joints. As your body ages, it produces less hyaluronic acid. Using a serum that contains hyaluronic acid is one of the ways to restore a youthful look and feel to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I found out what this product is, it was time to try it out. This product comes in a airless pump which makes for easy application. When it comes out of the pump, it is a clear gel like substance. It has a light and clean smell. I applied a small amount to my face after showering and was pleasantly surprised. This hyaluronic acid serum is not harsh at all. It absorbs quickly and was light enough to apply foundation on top of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Age Delay Serum also contains Vitamin C and Green Tea. Vitamin C is an antioxidant which slows the rate of free-radical damage. Green Tea is known for having many benefits for skin including reducing skin inflammation, and protection from UV radiation exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also 72% organic, Paraben free and cruelty free. Morea Naturals also offers 100% satisfaction money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it day and night and have seen an improvement in texture of the skin, but even better than that I have had a sort of a glow restored to my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.  Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.od for my readers.</li>
    <li> great product, absolutely love it...works great</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of reviewing this product and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with how smooth and even my skin has become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type: Sensitive - Combination/Oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture before product: Healthy but very tiny bumps on my forehead  and cheeks due to allergy  from previously  tried serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture after product: Healthy, smooth, radiant,  very even, and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Light formula&lt;br /&gt;2. No heavy fragrances&lt;br /&gt;3. Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;4. Leaves skin feeling very hydrated&lt;br /&gt;5. Does not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;6. Pump dispenser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; Packaging - wish the packaging was more sleek and chic. I&#x27;m a sucker for beautiful products in beautiful packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am pleased with the results from using this product. It definitely helped my skin to clear up without any additional harm and left my skin so hydrated and smooth. I absolutely recommenrecommend his to anyone who might want to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- stilettosandblush.com</li>
    <li> Love it!!! This is amazing!!! The shipping was fast, but I waited to write a review to be able to try the product and see the results. Great product. I just ordered 3 more.</li>
    <li> Time will tell if it helps...</li>
    <li> Good serum for the price.  Although i wish it was a little thicker, i still use daily and my face feels soft and renewed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about products that have names I have difficulty pronouncing. Hyaluronic? Never heard of it. When it comes to testing out age-defying products, I&#x27;ve discovered that I&#x27;m not familiar with most of the names so this was no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application (texture): The product is a lightweight gel. It applies easily and evenly and is not sticky/tacky like some products. It dries quickly without feeling heavy or sticky, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage (fragrance): It has a light fragrance but I can&#x27;t place what to compare it to. It&#x27;s simple which is perfect for someone like me that has issues with products that are strongly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage (quantity): I am able to use just over a pea-sized amount to cover my entire face. A little goes a long way since it applies so evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin sensitivity: I have sensitive skin but had no issue with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Age defying products can be expensive but this one is under $15 (at the time of writing) and the bottle will last a while since it doesn&#x27;t use much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions, it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out, application was easy (and clean) and the product doesn&#x27;t require a large amount per use. Overall, I found this to be a nice product that I would consider purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> I use Hyaluronic Acid everyday and it is truly facelift in a bottle. It has only been a couple weeks of use and I can see a difference in fine lines and wrinkles.  This product was received for the purpose of testing and  review.</li>
    <li> *I was given this product free for review purposes*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I could see the difference in my skin in just a week of use (minor, but definitely a change), I broke out every time I used it.  I know I have sensitive skin, but based on the reviews I did not expect this.  I don&#x27;t use anything particularly &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34;, usually just oil of olay and neutrogena. So I&#x27;m a bit flabbergasted why this one caused me to break out.  I thought it was just chance... so I laid off of it for a few days and my skin cleared up. I then tried again and it broke out again, so it&#x27;s definitely the serum.  Very disappointing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it applies like a smooth, clear gel and I used this in replacement of moisturizer after washing my face. It moisturized it well and gave my skin a nice glow.  Just wish it didn&#x27;t cause the breakout.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum I got to try a sample of it and it has a lot going for it . it drys very quickly so you can put on your other beauty products without waiting forever. Its a nice easy to use gel that has in it everything you would want in a beauty serum</li>
    <li> I had the privilege to try Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum With Vitamin C for free.  The company offers a money back guarantee. I love the packaging. No light is able to get in which keeps the product safer from bacteria. I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this serum.  I like that it is an aerosol-less pump. It is mess-free and easy to use. The product is odor-less. It comes out like a gel , but liquefies on your face. My skin is softer and brighter. This serum is a wonderful part of my skin care routine. I highly recommend trying it out.</li>
    <li> By far one of the BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum I have tried! I&#x27;ve had the chance to review several serums and when I was given the chance to try this to review I was excited. This serum is not thick nor runny it absorbs quickly into the skin, and works it magic over night! Just like the name it&#x27;s potent but gentle all at the same time! I highly recommend you trying!</li>
    <li> no difference noted at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 2 months with no notable changes to my skin, good or bad. I do not have excessive wrinkles, just an average amount of fine lines and mildly dark circles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This product is clear and goes on smooth. It begins to get sticky right away but dries quickly, so I put it on and immediately follow with my normal face lotion and have had no problem with application. I normally break out anytime I make changes to my facial routine, however I had no break outs when I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to discuss the Claims:&lt;br /&gt;•INSTANT RESULTS: Skin will glow instantly and improve brightness with Vitamin C and Green Tea Antioxidants&lt;br /&gt;**I did not notice a glow or improved brightness.&lt;br /&gt;•ANTI-AGING BENEFITS: Reduce the appearance of wrinkles *instantly* by plumping fine lines with PURE hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;**There has been no reduction in the appearance of wrinkles, either instantly or over time.&lt;br /&gt;•PAMPER YOUR SKIN: Boost moisture by revealing a noticeable improvement to skin tone and texture&lt;br /&gt;**My skin tone and texture has remained unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this is one of the lesser expensive products on the market and they make all the same claims. It&#x27;s hard to say if it is this particular product or if the ingredients just don&#x27;t live up to the hype. There is also the possibility that these products work best over extended periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I won&#x27;t purchase this product again because I don&#x27;t feel it is benefitting my skin in any way.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this Hyaluronic Acid Serum from the manufacturer for evaluation and review.  I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see if there will be any changes as far as improving the quality of my skin or lightening up any dark areas under my eyes. I will update my review after I have used this a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed though is that this serum feels pretty nice on my skin. After washing my face, I apply a tiny bit to my face and neck area. For a few minutes it feels a bit sticky but it does dry and soak into my skin with no sign of residue anywhere. As for any fine lines or wrinkles, I noticed that some of the fine lines appear to have diminished somewhat. I really can&#x27;t give that much credit to this serum though (at least not yet), as I believe that just about any product that adds moisture back into your skin will help diminish fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does feel really good on my skin though. Once it absorbs into your skin you&#x27;re just left with super soft feeling skin. I also like how this is made in the U.S.A. using good for your skin ingredients!</li>
    <li> I recently have had the opportunity to try and review the product, Hyaluronic Acid Age- Defying Serum with Power Antioxidants, Vitamin C and Green Tea by Morea Naturals. It claims to hydrate, brighten and restore.  The directions say wash and dry face, and then apply a small amount of the serum to face and neck.  The serum is clear and fragrance free.  It seems to have the consistency of water, so it is very light.  You do only need a small amount because a little goes a long way.  It is 72% organic, and goes on very smoothly.  It leaves the skin feeling soft and supple.  I was pleased with this product as it is not greasy and feels very natural.  There is not a feeling of residue on your skin and you can use it at night before bed, or in the morning before applying your makeup.  This product is well worth trying.</li>
    <li> I want to thank you so much for letting my try your product. I really loved it but the only thing is at first when you put it on it was leaving a burning feeling was that supposed to happen? Not sure, but after it made my face smooth, soft, shiney, and looking good. It did have some tighting action going on. I could feel it under my eyes. Again thank you Morea for letting my try this product for free and thanks to tomoson.com for introducing me to your company. Thanks to amazon for free shipping</li>
    <li> My skin tends to be high-maintenence: combination oily/dry, sensitive, breaks out with some products and changes with the seasons. Because of these things, I have a very hard time finding products that make my skin look good without adding extra shine, are overly drying or contain ingredients that cause breakouts. I&#x27;ve tried expensive department store products as well as drugstore brands and have only had mixed results. This Morea Naturals serum is really a good fit for my skin. My complexion immediately feels smoother, more toned and hydrated, but without added greasy shine that I find in other products. I use this serum in the evening after using my cleanser and in the morning before I put on my sunscreen and foundation. My skin looks great and has a nice, even finish to it as if I&#x27;m wearing a primer. It minimizes pores too. I love that it&#x27;s unscented (I have alleriges to products with perfumes) and contains natural ingredients. Also no parabens and cruelty-free. It&#x27;s a good price for this size bottle too. This is a product that I&#x27;ll continue to use because of the improvements I see in my skin.</li>
    <li> Worthless don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I got this for my dry skin. I didn&#x27;t see much of an effect. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid serum is a great addition to my beauty regimen.  This serum by Morea is great because it is unscented.  I prefer cosmetics that are unscented so this makes me love the product even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using this serum daily, my skin has brightened a great deal.  It is a nice consistency.  Not too watery and not too thick.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.The pump dispenses the perfect amount and honestly a little goes a long way.  I am so happy I was given the opportunity to review this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sample provided for reviewing purposes</li>
    <li> I bought this serum to see if it would help the overall look of my skin. I was starting to notice bigger pores and dark circles under my eyes but this product really seemed to minimize the look of both those issues. I&#x27;m noticing clearer and brighter skin. So thrilled I tried it :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and while I like that it absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t have a smell or leave any residue, I have not noticed any results at all. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any different whatsoever after using this product than it did before. It doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized or toned and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin&#x27;s texture. I haven&#x27;t had a bad reaction to it either so I will not give it a bad review. I understand that not everyone&#x27;s skin will react the same so I will not bash this product in any way, it just simply didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I was honestly pretty surprised by how well this product turned out. One of my friends at school had forwarded me the link and suggested I try it and I was a bit anxious about it because I had tried so many similar products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background, my skin is very oily. I usually hate skin products because they make my face even greasier and shinier, but I was really very satisfied with how effective this was without giving me that glazed, oily look. I can even use it a couple times a day and it doesn&#x27;t look any oilier. I usually use this once in the morning and once in the evening as part of my daily routine, and I love it. I find that it not only makes my skin look more vibrant and youthful, but also doesn&#x27;t have the effects a lot of products have if you use them often.</li>
    <li> I have found that this product simply glides on like liquid silk. I wait for it to dry to get the full benefit before applying other products. I could just stop there, but if going out I go a bit further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next is moisturizer and I wait for it to absorb. Next I apply whatever makeup that day calls for.  If I&#x27;m staying at home and going &amp;#34;makeup-free,&amp;#34; I simply apply the Morea Naturals Hyaluronic Acid and wait for it to dry and then apply a bit of moisturizer day cream. Later during the day, I might freshen my face with a bit more of the Morea Naturals. It really hydrates and tightens the skin.</li>
    <li> Been searching for a Hyaluronic Serum and this one, for my skin, is okay. I have sensitive skin and this one is a little to potent for me. I mix it with my daily moisturizer and only use it about once every couple of weeks. I suggest a skin patch test.</li>
    <li> Made in the USA! I am always skeptical on products made outside of the states. Hyaluronic acid, vitamin c, and green tea all aids in antiaging.  As I&#x27;m getting older,  collagen production decreases, so products that help build elasticity in my skin is prudent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this over the last month and I already notice more of glow to my skin.  It&#x27;s soft and smooth.  Applying this product every morning and evening before my moisturizer.  Small amount does go a long way! Apparently, this little pump system helps to preserve freshness, which indicates the company cares to invest in a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product received for free in exchange for a honest review.</li>
    <li> Potent is the best way to describe this product.  I have a variety of Haluronic serums and this is by far the strongest that I have tried.  I have very dry skin and I am fighting aging skin with every thing that I can find.  After cleansing my skin I apply Morea serum and then my regular moisturizer.  I am so happy to receive this at a slight discount because of my skin issues.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
