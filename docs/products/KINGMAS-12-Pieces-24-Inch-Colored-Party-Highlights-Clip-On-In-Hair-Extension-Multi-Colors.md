      <li>4 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED IT</li>
      <li>This was a very fun set of clip on&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>So much fun!</li>
      <li>And it is true that they shed but not a lot</li>
      <li>great deal I say would be great for older kids who want to add a little color to there hair and cute to put in little kids hair for dress up :)</li>
      <li>and they arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>They are super fun.</li>
      <li>They are fun and rainbowie, just like she wanted.  </li>
      <li>Fun colors.</li>

      <li>old and people love the way they match the color of the clothes I wear.</li>
      <li>These clip ons are fun and colorful.</li>
      <li>They took quite awhile to arrive, but they are lots of fun to add a splash of color.</li>
      <li>and a couple broke right away, and the extensions themselves got pretty tangled after wearing a couple of times.  </li>
      <li>I got them very fast</li>
      <li>and they are exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Love the different colors.</li>
      <li>They did have some bends in them from shipping, but i was able to straighten them out with my flat iron on lowest heat.</li>
      <li>U may need to cut depending on the length of ur hair, and dont brush the extensions too much because they tend to shed.</li>
      <li>but neat looking in straight hair.</li>
      <li>I will be looking to purchase more in the near future!</li>
      <li>They held firmly in my hair, and my hair is very fine.</li>
      <li>decent for my daughter.</li>
      <li>So cute for my nieces my little pony party</li>
      <li>They were cheap, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting great quality, so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
      <li>but I would defiantly be worth the extra money to buy some nicer ones.</li>
      <li>Got lost in the mail, got new ones shipped out</li>
      <li>way too long for my daughter but work fine after trimming and even could make a 2nd one with some of them</li>
      <li>Good for people with very dark hair, the clips are black.</li>
      <li>LONG extensions with vibrant colors!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!  </li>
      <li>I was surprised when I came home and found that they came.</li>
      <li>These were a hit for my 11 year old niece.</li>
      <li>My 3-year old wanted &amp;#34;rainbow hair&amp;#34; so I bought these.  </li>
      <li>Strands are very long, so will have to cut to the length you prefer which is a plus, because better too long than short!</li>
      <li>the only problem was that i didnt get the colors i expected, they were still cool colors though.</li>
      <li>, so she doesn&#x27;t have a very long attention span, and these definitely provided their money&#x27;s worth of entertainment.</li>
      <li>They took a while to receive and when they did come in some of them were damaged and missing hair or they weren&#x27;t the full 24&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what I expected!  </li>
      <li>The hair feels so soft though I will need to cut them because they are longer then my actual hair length.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what i expected:  plastic  ~ 1 inch wide hair extensions</li>

    <li> I got this for my daughter and she just love them and plays all day when she can with them.</li>
    <li> bought them again for a gift!</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I came home and found that they came. I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to get here until May 5 but I&#x27;m so happy that they came. The hair feels so soft though I will need to cut them because they are longer then my actual hair length. And it is true that they shed but not a lot and they don&#x27;t look plastic to me. 😆</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I expected!  LONG extensions with vibrant colors!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!  I will be looking to purchase more in the near future!</li>
    <li> Got lost in the mail, got new ones shipped out and they arrived quickly. I have thin hair and these actually stay in my hair. Love being able to add a pop of color to my hair!</li>
    <li> So cute for my nieces my little pony party but we had to use bobby pins to make them stay put.</li>
    <li> was used as part of a custom and it worked out great.  The different colors were great to change the look. I am very glad to have bought it.</li>
    <li> They took a while to receive and when they did come in some of them were damaged and missing hair or they weren&#x27;t the full 24&amp;#34;. I seen better hair extensions at a dollar store!</li>
    <li> Cheap. Wrinkled upon arrival. Lengths seem to be all different. Washing didn&#x27;t help. Slow to get here. Just fine for a kids party. That&#x27;s about all.</li>
    <li> Those took forever to get in the mail and they were garbage. They would not stay on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I love these! Perfect amount of color pop. They did have some bends in them from shipping, but i was able to straighten them out with my flat iron on lowest heat.</li>
    <li> Great extensions. Great colors. And a great price. All around a good deal. Put them in my wig and their perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a 13 year old relative who wanted to dye her hair pink but her parents would not let her. She loves them and switches them out every day to match her outfit. They are super fun.</li>
    <li> These took so long I forgot I ordered them, but they did come from across the county. I didn&#x27;t get 12 different colors, two sets of doubles, and the one color I wanted in this pack fell apart because they aren&#x27;t made that well. I might be able to use a needle and thread to fix it, but I was still disappointed.</li>
    <li> 4 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED IT</li>
    <li> the product is great, held up very well in my daughters hair. the only problem was that i didnt get the colors i expected, they were still cool colors though.</li>
    <li> way too long for my daughter but work fine after trimming and even could make a 2nd one with some of them</li>
    <li> Good for people with very dark hair, the clips are black. My daughter loves them.</li>
    <li> They are  so awesome I ordered so more  just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> These are nice but I would defiantly be worth the extra money to buy some nicer ones. You can totally tell that the hair is kinda plasticity and it totally looks  and the clips to clip It in your hair flips around. They were alright but I didn&#x27;t love them.</li>
    <li> The hair seems cute. Only problem is that it was folded when shipped and is now permanently bent crazy. I&#x27;d straighten it but I&#x27;m sure it will melt. So as of now it&#x27;s not wearable</li>
    <li> There great I use all of them and I have a wonderful rainbow hair look people love it and so do I!</li>
    <li> The clips came apart from the hair before I even got a chance to use them I opened the package and there they were unattached from the hair and clips laying in the box. I will never get these again. Considering the price I should have known.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get these. they were beautiful and liked having different color extensions. The pale pink extension the clip was on backwards so I couldn&#x27;t use that one. the strands of hair inside they extensions do fall out when you comb them. they were just a okay product for me.</li>
    <li> These clips are the perfect touch to any outfit. the colors are summer time fun. Don&#x27;t be afraid to add some color to your hair. I am 48 yrs. old and people love the way they match the color of the clothes I wear.</li>
    <li> my grand daughters loved these  they wear them often</li>
    <li> I bought these for my son&#x27;s 5th birthday party to give to the girls. They loved them! And some moms too!</li>
    <li> Extensions got tangled a lot with my hair.</li>
    <li> These clip ons are fun and colorful. They took quite awhile to arrive, but they are lots of fun to add a splash of color.</li>
    <li> This was a very fun set of clip on&#x27;s. I enjoyed them came well packed with a versatile and strong clip. Thank you ... very fun indeed !!!</li>
    <li> Fun to wear but not the best quality.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, but the hair keeps falling out of the clip. They shed a lot, especially if you comb them.</li>
    <li> So much fun! Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> decent for my daughter. but they don&#x27;t curl which is what she wanted them to do. but neat looking in straight hair.</li>
    <li> fun and playful and works great for what I needed</li>
    <li> Came as described. Strands are very long, so will have to cut to the length you prefer which is a plus, because better too long than short!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay but they tangle easily.</li>
    <li> I love these.  I got them very fast and they are exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Very cute came quick as shown I love them :) great deal I say would be great for older kids who want to add a little color to there hair and cute to put in little kids hair for dress up :)</li>
    <li> I  love the hair extensions.  The Colors are bright  and vibrant. I  just wish they were curlable.  Then I  would give them a 5  star rating.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what i expected:  plastic  ~ 1 inch wide hair extensions and you get 12 which is an amazing deal! I hope to style my hair in some rocking rainbow styles. As soon as they arrived and i was sure that this deal was not too good to be true i bought 2 more!</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a Christmas gift for my teenage niece. She absolutley loved them! Excellent array of colors, super long! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> My grand kids will love these  colorful  clip on air pieces.</li>
    <li> Bought for granddaughter and she said they were OK but fakey looking!</li>
    <li> These were a hit for my 11 year old niece. As she was looking at each one and staying, &amp;#34;Oh my friends are going to be jealous!!&amp;#34; lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s over the moon happy with them and has already used a couple.</li>
    <li> I use them  all the time love them!!!!!! They are fake but they do look real.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t curl or use any heat on them so only use when you are keeping a straight look.</li>
    <li> My daughter enjoys these! They look cute!</li>
    <li> Fun colors. Long enough that you can cut to the length you want.</li>
    <li> Love the different colors. Don&#x27;t expect a lot. Just to wear occasionally.</li>
    <li> I love the colors of these clip in hair extensions and I don&#x27;t think I could have found such a great deal anywhere else.  I think I paid somewhere between 6 and 7 dollars, which includes shipping from China to USA for 12 different colors.</li>
    <li> My 3-year old wanted &amp;#34;rainbow hair&amp;#34; so I bought these.  They are fun and rainbowie, just like she wanted.  They were cheap, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting great quality, so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The clips didn&#x27;t stay in that well and a couple broke right away, and the extensions themselves got pretty tangled after wearing a couple of times.  But my daughter&#x27;s only three, so she doesn&#x27;t have a very long attention span, and these definitely provided their money&#x27;s worth of entertainment.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of colors. They held firmly in my hair, and my hair is very fine. U may need to cut depending on the length of ur hair, and dont brush the extensions too much because they tend to shed. Besides that they worked nicely, I would recommend. 👍 *Mary H.</li>
