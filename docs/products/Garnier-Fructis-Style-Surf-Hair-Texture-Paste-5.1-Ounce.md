      <li>It was the perfect texture, had a wonderful, light scent and kept my hair perfect all day long.</li>
      <li>Thank u again and the packing was great :)</li>
      <li>and she was very satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I find that the best way to apply it is to use it right after the shower.  </li>
      <li>The tousled look stays and I just love it!</li>
      <li>It is an easy product to just scrunch into your damp hair and go, and it gives it great texture as opposed to lifeless waves.</li>
      <li>SMELLS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!!!</li>
      <li>I honestly hope NO ONE buys their replacement product.</li>
      <li>so the surfer hair comes in handy.</li>
      <li>took over at Garnier and they replaced the good formula with more inexpensive materials.</li>
      <li>Works well, but it is still kind of crusty or clumpy if you don&#x27;t keep messing with it.  </li>
      <li>Why would you change something that was so popular Gariner?</li>
      <li>I am SO glad to see SO many people up in arms about the switch of this product!</li>
      <li>I LOVED the original 5.1 oz Surf Hair.</li>
      <li>I know the hold is strong, but this makes it nice to look, but not touch..</li>
      <li>I love this goo.</li>
      <li>probably that&#x27;s ok for women, but for men a bit inappropriate.</li>
      <li>Then repeat with more paste and more gripping.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and my hair has been looking fantastic!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great because I don&#x27;t really like the stuff that makes my hair glossy.</li>
      <li>Maybe I need to use more?</li>
      <li>I also tried Crew Fiber which is okay</li>
      <li>Would like a tad bit more shine</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was my favorite hair product by a mile.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, but will be returning.</li>
      <li>Sexy, tousled, piecey waves.</li>
      <li>I love the just got out of bed and beach hair look.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;the airport confiscated it because it was more than 3 oz, and I forgot and tried to carry it on.</li>
      <li>I wanted texture, separation and something to enhance my waves and give my hair more body.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for prob 3-4 years now and it WAS perfect for a dry non-cruntchy look.</li>
      <li>I love the original formula -- but I am not going to pay $17 for one container (that used to be $3.50 at Walmart).</li>
      <li>Now that they are discontinuing it will be harder to find but this is an amazing product and has a great smell.</li>
      <li>It provides a strong hold yet is moldable.</li>
      <li>I have short to medium length hair, and this product works great.</li>
      <li>Fantastic and my go-to product from now on.</li>
      <li>Worth trying for sure.  </li>
      <li>After an hour of light housework (tidying etc)did a mirror check</li>
      <li>The price was cheap....</li>
      <li>I feel like I have been robbed by pirates in cheap perfume.</li>
      <li>Smooth a drop over them and they stay put and frizz free</li>
      <li>It even looks great the next day.  </li>
      <li>Should you be a professional trying to look good for your day at work...</li>
      <li>After realizing that yes, I had curly hair, and daily blow drying it straight wasn&#x27;t going to be feasible, I decided to hunt for the perfect product.</li>
      <li>So I sure hope I ordered the right stuff</li>
      <li>Much better than the new stuff they have it now to replace it and has more ounces too</li>
      <li>Despite how well his product was selling, the VP of marketing  wanted better margins and higher sells...  </li>
      <li>I purchased this because I love Garnier Fructis and their products never fail me...</li>
      <li>As many others have said, this new version of the product has changed significantly from what was used by many loyal customers for years.  </li>
      <li>After trying some mousses, gels, etc, I think I finally found the perfect combination for defined, yet still soft curls that still feel like hair</li>
      <li>While my hair is damp I put as much as I want in my hair and more as needed once my hair dries</li>
      <li>I like the way it looks love this this stuff already thank u again so much</li>
      <li>Im giving this 5 stars because not only does it make my hair look good</li>
      <li>They probably would sell more of it if they marketed it for curly hair rather than - surf hair aimed at people with straight hair</li>
      <li>Ordered and it showed up quickly.  </li>
      <li>so its worth a shot</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s worth a try, I assure you.</li>
      <li>And for the price it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for an inexpensive hair product for your elementary school student on picture day, this is for you.  </li>
      <li>I will only use this on the sides or the back of my hair if I need help controlling fly aways or something because the hold is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>It does have a pretty strong hold without using much product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that there are many other people like me.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would never have tried it if it had not been for a friend that had it while we were traveling together and I was desperate for something to keep the frizz down. I&#x27;m so glad I tired it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is blonde, fine, and quite wavy in humid climates. In non-humid climates it can be quite frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;How I use this product is after I shower, I blow dry with a round brush, straighten lightly with a flat iron (especially the short layers around my face) then I flip my head over and start adding this texture paste (no more than a pea-sized dab) in small increments gripping my hand into a fist. Then repeat with more paste and more gripping. After I flip over I do a much smaller amount to the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It brings out my natural wave without an ounce of frizz. The tousled look stays and I just love it!</li>
    <li> I used to get a bunch of these at a time from Wal-Mart, but it seems, not matter which Wal-Mart I go to, there are none there. So now I rely on &#x27;ole faithful Amazon to get this. This stuff is great because I don&#x27;t really like the stuff that makes my hair glossy. It&#x27;s like your hair is naturally going in the direction you style it without looking like there is gel in your hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> I recently got my shortish hair cut with \\&quot;texture\\&quot; on top and like it. This paste keeps the hair in place well without undue smell, stiffness, or artificial look.</li>
    <li> Works like I had hoped. Keeps type 3c curls under control, not heavy and not sticky. Applied to damp towel dried hair, small bits at a time and diffused. After an hour of light housework (tidying etc)did a mirror check and I still have some volume and no frizz with lots of curl. Would like a tad bit more shine, so, next use I will add some shine serum. But overall it works like gels in that it holds, and like a mousse, in that it adds volume. I like it.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair pasty, dirty looking, and weighed down by the end of the day. I recommend just using Shea Moisture, because that is the only brand that does what it actually says, and uses no harmful or unknown chemicals</li>
    <li> I read reviews on this product and everyone seemed to like it.  Ordered and it showed up quickly.  Works well, but it is still kind of crusty or clumpy if you don&#x27;t keep messing with it.  It does have a pretty strong hold without using much product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with short to medium thin hair.  I&#x27;m half asian (and half white) so my hair is like thin and flat.  It&#x27;s pretty difficult to style because a lot of stuff is too heavy and gels and stuff like that don&#x27;t look great with thin hair.  I don&#x27;t even remember how I came across this stuff but it is the only product that I continue to get because it&#x27;s the only thing that make my hair look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s great about it is that it&#x27;s light and gives you volume without making it look dry or frizzy.  Results have varied though.  I find that the best way to apply it is to use it right after the shower.  Dry my hair with a towel a little then rub about a blueberry size amount in the fingertips and through damp hair like really vigorously and try to get it all over the hair.  Then use a blow dryer to dry the rest.  The result, my hair looks fuller and not too formal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried other stuff like the Fructis gummy stuff and some similar stuff by Pantene but this one is the best.  I also tried Crew Fiber which is okay but can really make your hair look bad if you use the wrong amount and at the wrong time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leads me to the conclusion that this stuff works for guys who have thin, flat hair that want more fullness, volume, and texture.</li>
    <li> The best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used and now it&#x27;s GONE!!! GONE FOREVER!! YOU SUCK GARNIER F FACES!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I like a messy(ish) style with texture and hold for the entire day and this does it perfectly. It provides a strong hold yet is moldable. It also leaves your hair looking natural with no shine and adds thickness to it. I&#x27;ve tried many, many hair products, some much much more expensive. Nothing comes close. Fantastic and my go-to product from now on.</li>
    <li> Have been dropping into drug stores and other places trying to find this product for a few months, just thinking the individual stores were all stocked out. Tried the other Garnier Surf Hair stuff (not texture paste/matte) and they were horrible - hated them. Now I find out it&#x27;s discontinued. Great job Garnier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my favorite hair product by a mile. I guess no more Garnier stuff for me.</li>
    <li> The product is very good. It works as supposed to - after usage your hair still looks clean and very naturally (I have very soft hair - so using regular wax product my hair looks very dirty). The only disadvantage is the odor - it is too fruity - probably that&#x27;s ok for women, but for men a bit inappropriate. I would prefer if they create the same product without any odor. However, the odor is much less stronger after first use - so, now, I am good this product. Because of price and since it worked as expected I would recommend this product to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million and one product to help my frizzy, curly hair. At first, this product DID work quite well. But maybe it&#x27;s just my hair? It kept frizzing up anyways. I have yet to find a product to conquer my frizz. My hair is pretty long...it&#x27;s to my bellybutton. Maybe I need to use more? I have no idea. But it&#x27;s worth a try, I assure you. It just doesn&#x27;t work too well for ME. That&#x27;s just my experience. The price was cheap....so its worth a shot, right? Good luck. :p</li>
    <li> I am a woman of color and you probably wouldn&#x27;t think I would use this product but I love in on my short sides. I was heartbroken and highly upset that Garnier decided to discontinue the Texture Paste. I went scrambling all over town trying to find it only to find the replacement product that is a bunch of &amp;#34;MESS&amp;#34;!!!!! So my 2nd thought was to go online....I did find some here on Amazon but the sellers try to raise the price 3 to 4 times the actual cost which is unreasonable amounts because they know you won&#x27;t be able to buy it from the stores anymore. Garnier, your development team for this new replacement product(s) for the Texture Paste is an absolute waste of money!!!! Please bring back the Garnier Fructis Style Surf Hair Texture Paste and leave well enough alone.</li>
    <li> As many others have said, this new version of the product has changed significantly from what was used by many loyal customers for years.  The old product had great texture, you did not need to use much of it, held your style all day, had no overwhelming scent and was reasonably priced.  This new product is sticky, horribly scented, you get less of it in the container and pay more.  A downgrade in every way and I haven&#x27;t bought anything from this company since.  By the way, many of us are still looking for a decent replacement, Garnier, so if you act quickly and return to the old style you might regain some of the customers you have lost.</li>
    <li> not thick creamy like i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a little greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t give a matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 2</li>
    <li> Use this and you won&#x27;t have such gluey hair during the day.  It works well for guys.  I found that a little goes a long ways.  I&#x27;m still using the same tub I purchased several months ago.  I would recommend this.  I discovered that amazon had it online so I quit buying it from the grocery store and discovered I could get a little bit cheaper online even with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in ~2012 for $3.50.  I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the airport confiscated it because it was more than 3 oz, and I forgot and tried to carry it on. D&#x27;oh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to re-order today, and price is $16 !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; 400% price hike.  Sorry, Amazon, as much as I love the service, this is a little too much to swallow.</li>
    <li> I have been using this same product for about 10years now, however it did have a different name quite some time ago.  I only have to use a tiny bit and it really goes a long way.  I bought the pack of 6 when it was on super sale last holiday and still have a few left.  My buddy was debating with me about his crew hair stuff so I had to come on here and say my piece publicly.</li>
    <li> The picture and description of this product is the old surf hair.  But people keep writing bad reviews and complaining about that they changed it and its not like the old stuff.  I already bought a 3 pack of this stuff for $17.  So I sure hope I ordered the right stuff.. :/  If this is still the old stuff they&#x27;re selling on here and people are just griping and complaining then they need to go to a different site for that.  Because its confusing the hell out of me.  I&#x27;m thinking I ordered the wrong stuff now. Can somebody please clarify for me that this is the old 5.1 oz surf hair and not the new 3 oz \\&quot;surfer hair\\&quot;?..</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend and she was very satisfied with it. I would recommend that others buy it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Much better than the new stuff they have it now to replace it and has more ounces too</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that gave me a nice wavy texture that wasn&#x27;t too heavy on my hair. I purchased this because I love Garnier Fructis and their products never fail me... Until I purchased this... Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does create a nice style for my hair but.. Not the style it promises on the label. FYI: (Since many products work differently on different types hair textures  I am a black woman with relaxed hair, my hair is short like halle berry short, I have a razor cut and my hair is very thick... This product is a good product if I want spiky hair.. I will definitely reach for this... It didn&#x27;t give me the surf wavy type hair texture I was hoping for.. Just made my hair really straight and spiky and hard to style...lol. If you style your hair like with a flat iron.. This will ruin your style... I would only use this like if I know I&#x27;m going to wash my hair the next day because it is kind of heavy on my hair.. Like I feel like my hair is weighted down with product and I hate that feeling.. Just really sticky.. The good thing about this product is that it leaves no flakes... This surprised me because most product that leave my hair feeling heavy usually create tons of residue flakes in my hair but not this. Garnier is really good at no flakes. It has a very strong hold I am assuming this is why it feels so sticky and heavy on my head. I will only use this on the sides or the back of my hair if I need help controlling fly aways or something because the hold is pretty strong.</li>
    <li> Product completely changed. I even made SURE that the SKU number on the product that I ordered was the same as the SKU on my jar at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived timely BUT..... it is &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; the same as before.&lt;br /&gt;***** Although the SKU numbers matched on my jar and the ordered jar - they were clearly not the same.&lt;br /&gt;AND they put stickers over the SKU as if to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are different.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is very different.&lt;br /&gt;The hold is no where near as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be abandoning this product for something else from a different company....unless they wise up and go back to what people loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke ....</li>
    <li> While it holds your hair in place, it leaves that cheap damp crusty look that I find unappealing. I was in search of a product that simply held my hair in place and not one that gave me the appearance of a &#x27;50s greaser.  If you are looking for an inexpensive hair product for your elementary school student on picture day, this is for you.  Should you be a professional trying to look good for your day at work...keep looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to product to anyone. I have short to medium length hair, and this product works great. If I use it with wet hair, it leaves my hair a little stiff, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to mess it up a little and get rid of that look. Otherwise, it&#x27;s keeps my hair in place without making it look like I&#x27;m using some sort of gel. I&#x27;ve had other products that make my face break out near my hairline, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem with this product. Lastly, a girl moved into our house recently, and guess what, she uses the same exact product. Guys, girls... great for anyone.</li>
    <li> Probably the best on the market for styling my hair. I searched far and wide too.</li>
    <li> Surfer Hair used to be good when it was fragrance-free. The new formula that just came out in January 2013 now has a perfume smell and totally different texture. Why would you change something that was so popular Gariner? In addition it used to cost $3.33 at Walmart for 5.1oz. The new formula has 3oz and costs $4.99. Are you freaking kidding me. I loved this stuff and now it sucks! Anyone know of a good fragrance-free product similar to the old Surfer Hair I should try. The new smell of Surfer Hair is too much for me. I don;t want to smell like perfume all day.</li>
    <li> New formula released in January is terrible ! Way more expensive and doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Severely disappointed.  Bring back the real surfer styler!</li>
    <li> I am SO glad to see SO many people up in arms about the switch of this product! I LOVED the original 5.1 oz Surf Hair. It was the perfect texture, had a wonderful, light scent and kept my hair perfect all day long. I started to notice that it was disappearing from the shelves back at Christmastime 2012. Not long after, I couldn&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE! I wrote to Garnier and they denied that they were discontinuing it (of course, typical corporation). Imagine my disgust when I saw it come back at nearly HALF the weight and nearly double the price. Absolute corporate greed! I was a faithful user of this product and would have recommended it (and Garnier) to anyone and everyone. Now, with this game of theirs, I&#x27;ll definitely find another product (and different manufacturer).</li>
    <li> While it does hold the hair it feels HORRIBLY greasy!  I usually use the Fructis Fiber Gum - which I love - but everywhere I went was out of it.  Tried this instead and ended up just washing my hair in the bathroom to get it out!  Taking it back for a refund tomorrow!</li>
    <li> I cannot use this.  It caused even my face to REALLY itch when the hair touched my face.  If you can, you will probably like it.</li>
    <li> Garnier!!! Why!!!! I used to use the old \\&quot;surf hair\\&quot; 5.1 oz product. I LOVED IT!!! And they got rid of it???? Are you kidding? I used the old product for close to 10 years every single day. It was THE BEST product I&#x27;ve ever use on my hair! Kept my hair in place all day long...... Their replacement product is HORRIBLE! Garnier has for sure lost me as a customer!! And that&#x27;s a big problem cause I would send hundreds of $$ on their products each year. I&#x27;m sure that there are many other people like me. I honestly hope NO ONE buys their replacement product. Someone in the company really made a bad bad mistake!! Come one guys! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!! Who was the person/persons who made this decision. I am so so sad! Bring back the old!</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I actually prefer this over the $20 designer pomades. I get compliments almost daily! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this goo. I apply it after washing my hair to get beach curls. The only thing is my hair gets sticky and thick, even with minimal or a decent application. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair. I know the hold is strong, but this makes it nice to look, but not touch.. AT ALL.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this for his hair and LOVES LOVES LOVES it.  Now that they are discontinuing it will be harder to find but this is an amazing product and has a great smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local store about 40 minutes ago. I feel like I have been robbed by pirates in cheap perfume. This is an awful, awful product, on every level. Avoid.</li>
    <li> the product arrive on time.  Do what it promise, good for texture.  Only problem is that it makes my scalp itch.  Probably would not use it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product -usually I use gel, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try based on reviews.  It is awesome!!!  Even though it is a cream/puddy consistency it doesn&#x27;t make white flakes in your hair like other products.  It works wonderful if you have bangs.  Smooth a drop over them and they stay put and frizz free all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick curly hair that can tend to be frizzy and this stuff really works at keeping the frizz down and creating great curls. Im pleasantly surprised.  And for the price it is worth it.  As mentioned in other reviews you don&#x27;t need a lot of it, so I suspect the jar will last quite a while.  Worth trying for sure.  They probably would sell more of it if they marketed it for curly hair rather than - surf hair aimed at people with straight hair but whatever...it&#x27;s good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use a little gel with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have a cabinet FULL of products that didn&#x27;t work on my crazy hair.  So when one does I must mention it.  Curly girls check this one out!</li>
    <li> perfect consistency to hold hair without making it look gelled to death. I&#x27;m from California so the surfer hair comes in handy.</li>
    <li> After realizing that yes, I had curly hair, and daily blow drying it straight wasn&#x27;t going to be feasible, I decided to hunt for the perfect product. After trying some mousses, gels, etc, I think I finally found the perfect combination for defined, yet still soft curls that still feel like hair - it&#x27;s the Garnier Curl Calm Down cream and this surf hair afterwards - and a little goes a long way. Just enough to cover my fingertip is enough to keep my med-long curls/waves in check.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this due to the rave reviews. Once I received it, about a third of the product wasn&#x27;t in the jar. Pic included. Also mine wasn&#x27;t paste, it had the consistency of hand lotion. I still gave it a try. It did hold my hair, but not as well as my suave paste. Love the smell, but will be returning. I may have received a bad unit or it became over heated in transit.</li>
    <li> Paid $3.49 two months ago for 5.1 oz...looks like its time to switch... Any suggestions for a similar alternative? A</li>
    <li> Glad I could find this on Amazon--sometimes hard to find locally.  This works better for me than many more expensive products.  Adds body and allows me to style my hair, but looks natural (no greasiness, clumpiness, extra shine, ...).  Prevents my hair from getting limp and matted during the day.</li>
    <li> I just got it in the mail today it came right on time and I open it up and it smells really good and I put it in my hair I like the way it looks love this this stuff already thank u again so much and I will be getting more soon!!!!! Thank u again and the packing was great :)</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy and thin, and I like this product because it helps define those waves without using any heat tools! I am not sure how well it would work for straight hair, though (I&#x27;m guessing not that well). It is an easy product to just scrunch into your damp hair and go, and it gives it great texture as opposed to lifeless waves. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to quite a few people over the years, and I&#x27;m still using the same container for almost 4 years now! Last forever, and I love it.</li>
    <li> As the previous review said - it has been discontinued and the replacement is more expensive with 2 oz less product in the container. I&#x27;ve used this for prob 3-4 years now and it WAS perfect for a dry non-cruntchy look. Has the formula changed now? Why does it smell/stink now? Your focus group got it wrong Garnier and you should have kept it the way it was. I refuse to buy it and even try it. Infact - I won&#x27;t buy any Garnier products going forward.</li>
    <li> I have thin, long Asian hair but it&#x27;s naturally wavy.  I wanted texture, separation and something to enhance my waves and give my hair more body.  I love the just got out of bed and beach hair look.  Sexy, tousled, piecey waves. My hair looks awesome when I spend the day at the beach. This product straightened out my hair for some reason.  When I wake up the next morning my hair is totally limp. It gives it some texture but it doesn&#x27;t do enough for my hair.  I like hair products that make my hair feel thicker.  I used Sebastian Xtah Crude Clay religiously and I&#x27;m looking for a product that will give my hair the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I have to update my review.  I have been experimenting with it and have been putting generous amounts in my hair.  Before, I used it sparingly because I have thin hair and I get that greasy, weighed down look when I use too much hair product but I decided to try a heavy coat and see what would happen.  While my hair is damp I put as much as I want in my hair and more as needed once my hair dries and my hair has been looking fantastic!  My bangs look awesome and keeps its hold without hairspray and it makes the curls in my hair look really cute.  It even looks great the next day.  I have flyaway hair and its just not attractive and this stuff helps hold my hair in place and gives it a rumpled look.  Im giving this 5 stars because not only does it make my hair look good but I got it for under $4.</li>
    <li> NO PROBLEMS WITH SHIPPING...HAIR PRODUCT CAME EARLY, FAST, TRUSTWORTHY SELLERS!!! GREAT CONDITION AS ADVERTISED IN PERFECT CONDITION!!! I WOULD DEFINITELY ORDER FROM THESE SELLERS AGAIN!!!  THEY ARE NOW MAKING A REPLACEMENT PRODUCT!!! CHECK IT OUT !!! SMELLS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product -- until Garnier changed it.  I love the original formula -- but I am not going to pay $17 for one container (that used to be $3.50 at Walmart).</li>
    <li> The packaging is no good it showed up with product all over the inside of the lid and in clumps!  I don&#x27;t know if this is how it&#x27;s suppose to be but if it is it&#x27;s junky.  definitely not worth the price.  Actually if it was free I wouldn&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> I loved the 5 Oz product...  now you get 3 Oz and pay more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what happend....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was late at night. The brand manager, of Surf Hair was still awake... he was worried. Despite how well his product was selling, the VP of marketing  wanted better margins and higher sells...  he had to meet his quarterly growth quota... but how?!.... In a moment of brilliance he thought \\&quot;If we give our customers 40% less product, they&#x27;ll have to buy it more often! and with the new package they won&#x27;t even notice it! MUAHAHAHAHA....\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier... Really? Is this why you hire MBAs?.. so they can trick us? so we have to pay the same for less and if everything goes well not realize it?... you guys are making a big mistake and I am not buying your products anymore...</li>
    <li> Less product for more money.  Greed at it&#x27;s finest.  You&#x27;ve just lost another customer... until you bring back the old product.</li>
    <li> This stuff used to be the best (for the money). Now it&#x27;s terrible. The package is actually BIGGER, but the amount of product in it is just 3 oz compared to the previous 5.1 oz. Horrible decision by Garnier. This is the last time I&#x27;ll buy this stuff.</li>
    <li> This used to be THE BEST paste/wax hair product for guys with short-medium hair who wanted a matte beach look with a good hold. This new formula is terrible in every regard:&lt;br /&gt;1) The scent is bad and overpowering now&lt;br /&gt;2) Hold is now WEAKER and texture is oily/gross&lt;br /&gt;3) Price is OUTRAGEOUS &#x3D;&amp;#62; nearly $20?? You can get high end designer products for cheaper that that if you really want to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just seems like corporate greed and nonsense took over at Garnier and they replaced the good formula with more inexpensive materials. I am actively looking for a product that works like the old one did. If you are looking for a new hair product, I would never recommend this one unless you can somehow find left over SKUs with the old formula.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hair at all. Gives some volume but too weak to style it. Preferred the stronger &amp;#34;Manga Head&amp;#34; version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Gatsby which is much stronger and requires less.</li>
    <li> The smell is strong but isn&#x27;t so bad once it&#x27;s in your hair. Does the job. Be careful not to use too much though. I usually use 1-2 pea sizes and spread it around my hands and then brush my layers with my hands.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula, making it less hold, adding a disgusting perfume scent, oily consistency, and making the container appear larger while cutting the amount by 50% AND raising the price by 50%+! Never buying any garner products ever again! Nice marketing!</li>
