      <li>Try this if you like Neutrogena or are just looking for an excellent skin cleanser.</li>
      <li>This product works great!</li>
      <li>I hope Neutrogena don&#x27;t discontinue this product, because this is one of the best OTC in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m not expecting miracles; I will not have a perfect face tomorrow</li>
      <li>This is the best cleanser I have used in years.  </li>
      <li>This is the BEST cleanser I have found.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Absolutely a great buy.</li>
      <li>This product seemed perfect and the reviews had me dreaming of amazing skin for days before the product got here.</li>
      <li>I thought this product would be great to help both issues,</li>
      <li>but I was happy to get it.</li>
      <li>It does a great job</li>
      <li>It also has a pleasant fragrance that does not linger once you&#x27;ve rinsed</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell, non-irritating, non-drying</li>
      <li>So, this is good stuff.</li>
      <li>imagine who this product is good for.&lt;br /&gt;Ick.  </li>
      <li>Arrived on time good packaging</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>my skin is pretty close to flawless.  </li>
      <li>I get this through Subscribe and Save through Amazon, and the price beats Walmart&#x27;s, and is delivered to your door with FREE shipping!!</li>
      <li>and my skin looks and feels amazing.  </li>
      <li>The Neutrogena Healthy Skin anti-wrinkle worked surprisingly well.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it seemed to be doing me some good</li>
      <li>It even has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>The cleanser comes out appearing like a cream, but it lathers up nicely, which I like.  </li>
      <li>would recommend this product to anyone, really works for me 1 of the best on the market today that I have been able to find</li>
      <li>It lathers up very nicely though, and the smell is kind of a light citrus-y smell, nothing special there either.</li>
      <li>My skin was very smooth and softened, makeup went on much better too.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the effect it has on my skin,</li>
      <li>I have been very impressed with all of Neutrogena&#x27;s facial products.  </li>
      <li>Love the fact that it helps with wrinkles and acne.</li>
      <li>My cousin had Healthy Skin cleanser and with her encouragement</li>
      <li>I LOVE this face cleanser.</li>
      <li>So this product review will not be as in-depth as many of my others but that is because there is not a lot of in-depth info to post.</li>
      <li>Love the creamy texture of this product.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for sure, no hesitation.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Much better than &#x27;acne&#x27; products.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle - my skin is prone to hating most things and this is cheap and great.</li>
      <li>probably works best on those with minor acne..</li>
      <li>I have always been a huge fan of Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle moisturizer (the one with Retin-A) and figured that coupled with the glowing reviews</li>
      <li>As soon as I returned to using this product my skin was clear and feeling great.  </li>
      <li>in fact, it&#x27;s actually a good thing it doesn&#x27;t lather too much</li>
      <li>When you squeeze it from the tube, it kind of &amp;#34;balls up,&amp;#34; and can roll right off of your hand.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure they sprinkle magic into this or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I started getting fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>However it is still a good compliment to the Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Anti-Blemish clear skin cream.</li>
      <li>The concept of this cleanser is great; it sounded perfect for people like me in their late twenties or early thirties who still deal with mild acne.  </li>
      <li>Also, my skin just didn&#x27;t feel clean after using it.  </li>
      <li>I notice if i&#x27;ve had to use another (while away) that my skin is dry but with this it has made my skin feel great.</li>
      <li>nothing special for me...</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin clean, fresh and smooth, without drying it out.  </li>
      <li>Somehow my skin maybe over reacted to this product because I got more wrinkles and about 8 more pimples in the 14 total days that I used it before I quit.</li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly and was packed well.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s not too much lather, not harsh, and I have seen more control over my face.</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m pretty much convinced that the only thing that will really address wrinkles effectively is a retinol product, overall I&#x27;m very happy with this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the feeling of soap (with the latter), than the cleanser that are cream, for me the fresh clean feeling that this product leave on me its amazing</li>
      <li>The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are barely noticeable, my skin tone is even and bright, and my face is INSANELY smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>even my mom said that my skin was pretty!</li>
      <li>My face looks brighter and more clear</li>
      <li>because contain Alpha Hydroxy acid your skin will become more sensitive to the sun.</li>
      <li>Even as I keep my Neutrogena products on hand for emergencies,:) , for the day to day use you maybe want to check out the Lush products that are also on sale here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>For my skin, that seems to be enough to keep my face breakout free, as well as save me some cash and keep me from having to smell like this stuff more than I should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t do anything for wrinkles but is a nice face wash overall.</li>
      <li>The wrinkles come back after a day or two, so you really have to use this product daily for best results.</li>
      <li>it is almost to thick to be separated or lathered, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it lol, but it makes my skin smooth after use..</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s just right)</li>
      <li>I agree with others who said it was slimy and would slide right off your fingers into the sink.  </li>
      <li>I noticed the acne diminishing almost right away</li>
      <li>Keeps my breakouts under control like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used, rinses easily &amp; leaves my skin feeling clean &amp; not dry.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Eye cream is nice and smooth, I can already see a difference in the dark circles around my eyes even though this is the first use</li>
      <li>One of my favorite things about using it is that it doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel itchy and tight like most cleaners for acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, after showering I saw the difference right away.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much, I will buy more later and I will tell a friend too,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t lather at all.</li>
      <li>In short, I love it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle, Anti-Blemish Cleanser several weeks ago from Ulta for $6.95 shipped.</li>
      <li>First, some background.  </li>
      <li>Really like it!</li>
      <li>, you don&#x27;t need the pearl sided amount, I just dot along my eyes and that is more then enough to get the job</li>
      <li>The first week my face did look noticeably better; my skin was tighter and the wrinkles on my forehead and white bumps were gone.  </li>
      <li>and my skin was smooth and hydrated - not tight.</li>
      <li>but it does leave the skin clean and soft.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good buy for a relatively low price.</li>
      <li>I use it with the Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, White and have seen fabulous results (no miracles ... but definitely a clearer, smoother complexion).</li>
      <li>It does not have a strong smell or any cons EXCEPT possibly one.</li>
      <li>Starting early to prevent those! :-)</li>
      <li>Oh the joys of growing older!</li>
      <li>Dream Creme, amazing moisturizer(also for people who have dry skin due to Caner treatments !!!!) , Vanishing creme, amazing moisturizer for acne prone skin, deminishes redness, acne scars, and Herbalism, an organic cleanser.</li>
      <li>This does seem to improve my complexion, but the trade off is it really dries out my skin.  </li>
      <li>I like it, and I haven&#x27;t been breaking out as much.  </li>
      <li>I try to avoid the sun as much as I can</li>
      <li>My husband uses this to control his occasional (mid life) breakouts and it really does work nicely.</li>
      <li>Really helps to treat and prevent acne.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about 10 days now and it has really kept the blemishes at bay, without drying out my skin.  </li>
      <li>It is so gentle, but cleans so well.  </li>
      <li>Once you realize it, you can be more careful.</li>

    <li> Thank you very much, I will buy more later and I will tell a friend too,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naz Sami</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Healthy Skin anti-wrinkle worked surprisingly well. I have some winkles in the face from where I smile, but this cream actually removed them by stretching the skin. The wrinkles come back after a day or two, so you really have to use this product daily for best results. However, it&#x27;s one of the few products that actually shows visible results the same day. I&#x27;ve tried several other creams, which tended to moisturize the skin or made it feel better, but did nothing for wrinkles. Overall, it&#x27;s a good buy for a relatively low price.</li>
    <li> I am almost 33 year old.  My body and hormones seem to be confused between puberty and peri menopause.  This product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Really like it! Keeps my breakouts under control like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used, rinses easily &amp; leaves my skin feeling clean &amp; not dry.</li>
    <li> This worked wonders on my acne and wrinkles.  However, I now am using plastic gloves to wash my face.  I got a terrible rash with blisters on my hand I was using it in.  I believe the salycilic acid and alpha-hydroxy actually burned my hands.</li>
    <li> No harsh fragrance. Easy to use and leaves my skin feeling soft. I also feel that the area around my eyes look a little younger. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne prone skin and I started getting fine lines around my eyes. I usually like Neutrogena products but this one is a dud. First, it doesn&#x27;t lather at all. I&#x27;ve had an issue w/ it actually sliding off my hands a few times since it doesn&#x27;t lather. Second it has a weird smell. Third it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m delusional in thinking that a few months using the product will suddenly make my fine lines disappear but there is no difference at all. Plus my skin is still oily and I&#x27;ve broken out several times since I started using it. After this bottle I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;m in the market for something new.</li>
    <li> Makes me have red eczema-like spots on skin when used. I normally am not very sensitive to anything. Makes me wonder.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item in conjunction with the Fight and Fade gel (a spot treatment), to try and get a handle on both wrinkles and blemishes.  I&#x27;m 43, caucasian, and live in a dry climate.  I have oily skin and I&#x27;m usually broken out somewhere on my face.  Although I&#x27;m pretty much convinced that the only thing that will really address wrinkles effectively is a retinol product, overall I&#x27;m very happy with this cleanser.  I have been using it for about 10 days now and it has really kept the blemishes at bay, without drying out my skin.  In fact, I&#x27;ve had just one new blemish since I started using it, which is highly unusual for me for that duration of time (even over a camping trip, which is unheard of for me!).  It leaves my skin clean, fresh and smooth, without drying it out.  The cleanser comes out appearing like a cream, but it lathers up nicely, which I like.  It also has a pleasant fragrance that does not linger once you&#x27;ve rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have no negative comments about this product and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle, Anti-Blemish Cleanser several weeks ago from Ulta for $6.95 shipped. I LOVE this face cleanser. I use it with the Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, White and have seen fabulous results (no miracles ... but definitely a clearer, smoother complexion). I only use this cleanser every 2-3 days. I alternate it with other Neutrogena cleansers so that I do not overdry my skin (especially as we are approaching winter). So far, my skin looks much clearer and smoother. I get those occasional blemishes in the T-zone area and this clears it up. I have even noticed that my pores and those fine lines are less visible. It even has a nice smell. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, and still randomly breakout. I have oily skin and live in the Sunshine state.&lt;br /&gt;This product works great for me! I love that it&#x27;s not too much lather, not harsh, and I have seen more control over my face. It doesn&#x27;t over-dry my face, but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t look oily either. I&#x27;m not sure how good the &amp;#34;anti-wrinkle&amp;#34; part is since I don&#x27;t have any yet, but I&#x27;m using this along with a different company&#x27;s anti-wrinkle daily cream. Starting early to prevent those! :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 2 months now that I&#x27;ve been washing my face wish this every night.  The first week my face did look noticeably better; my skin was tighter and the wrinkles on my forehead and white bumps were gone.  Then they came back, and they&#x27;ve stayed back, and it&#x27;s like this wash doesn&#x27;t do anything at all. I don&#x27;t know if my skin got used to it or what, but I might as well be using a regular facewash. I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I like it, and I haven&#x27;t been breaking out as much.  Will definitely purchase again. It has lasted a very long time.</li>
    <li> This cleanser really worked for me. It leaves my skin cleaner, softer and it prevents new blemishes. You might want to try this.</li>
    <li> This product surprised me.  I expected it to not cause blemishes but it did.  I was so dissappointed.  It is Neutrogena after all. Now I am using CeraVe.  It seems to work very well and leaves my sking not feeling dried out.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with all of Neutrogena&#x27;s facial products.  I especially like this one because it targets blemishes and wrinkles.  Yeah, bad combination, LOL!  Really works well, and my face is very touchy.  The salicylic acid works well for me.  I get this through Subscribe and Save through Amazon, and the price beats Walmart&#x27;s, and is delivered to your door with FREE shipping!!</li>
    <li> I prefer the feeling of soap (with the latter), than the cleanser that are cream, for me the fresh clean feeling that this product leave on me its amazing; I have very oily skin maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like the cream version;  after those I get the feeling that I still have product on my face, because my skin is oily a have a lot of breakouts; and I just can keep my hands away from my face (I know; my mistake). But I&#x27;m not expecting miracles; I will not have a perfect face tomorrow but my face has improve since I&#x27;m using this product so I will keep using it; I use it in the morning as soon as wake up, after my workouts and at night before going to sleep. It does not dry my skin; even though of my face type I have found my skin dry after using other products. Other thing that I like is that is also the anti-wrinkle; I have to be aware of that too because my skin is aging same as me:). And I have to say that because contain Alpha Hydroxy acid your skin will become more sensitive to the sun. I try to avoid the sun as much as I can but when I just can&#x27;t, I use a sunscreen; I I&#x27;m already having a lot of problems with my skin to add a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this product; because it worked for me!!!</li>
    <li> So, this is good stuff. It&#x27;s a fair amount more expensive than store brand cleanser, or just using bar soap, but if I start to break out a little, nothing handles it like this, but I have two small complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I think it&#x27;s a little drying. This is really subtle, and it could just be in my head, so I&#x27;m not going to take a star off for it, but if you have really dry skin to begin with, I might buy some moisturizer at the same time, or pick a different cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I HATE the smell. I won&#x27;t take a star off for something that is entirely a matter off taste like that, but it smells . . . like a geriatric home to me. Like medicine for the elderly. I&#x27;m overstating it, and I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of people complaining, so I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;m in the minority, but it&#x27;s the only thing I use that I don&#x27;t like the smell of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, that should tell you how much I think of the job it does on blemishes. If there were anything that worked half as well, I&#x27;d switch in a heartbeat, but this is number one by a mile. So I use this about every third day, and some store brand stuff the other two. For my skin, that seems to be enough to keep my face breakout free, as well as save me some cash and keep me from having to smell like this stuff more than I should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a great buy. Watch out with dry skin, and I warned you if you don&#x27;t like the smell, but nothing works as well.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything for wrinkles but is a nice face wash overall.</li>
    <li> I am 40 yr old brown skin women with oily to normal skin. My break-outs normally surface at a particular time of the month.  I have been using this product for over 3 years and noticed that my breakout lightens rapidly while using this product.  I have tried other products, but it left my skin dry and my pore more enlarge.  I have read several site that this product will discontinue.  I hope Neutrogena don&#x27;t discontinue this product, because this is one of the best OTC in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con to this product is you must use it daily for it to work.  If you miss a few days, it definitely shows on the face because skin starts to look a little oily.</li>
    <li> This product works great!</li>
    <li> At age 30 I had a sudden acne breakout and newly forming wrinkles. This product seemed perfect and the reviews had me dreaming of amazing skin for days before the product got here. Shipping was SLOW but I was happy to get it. I tried it for a week and nothing changed. In fact it seemed that my skin got worse! Somehow my skin maybe over reacted to this product because I got more wrinkles and about 8 more pimples in the 14 total days that I used it before I quit. Now 2 weeks later my skin is finally starting to recover using more natural products.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST cleanser I have found. Not only does it keep breakouts at bay, but it makes your skin soft and complexion even. I definitely notice a difference in my skin since using it. One of my favorite things about using it is that it doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel itchy and tight like most cleaners for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> All the neutrogena are very effective when it comes to anti wrinkle and acne fighting, only draw back if you are prone to have sensitive skin like me, be careful how much you apply, and how often you apply it, otherwise it will really dry your skin out and your skin becomes very itchy.  So make sure to follow the directions, do only apply to the effected area, stay away from anywhere from the eye area, about 1 inch at least, and try it out first and use it every other day or so.  Even as I keep my Neutrogena products on hand for emergencies,:) , for the day to day use you maybe want to check out the Lush products that are also on sale here on Amazon. Dream Creme, amazing moisturizer(also for people who have dry skin due to Caner treatments !!!!) , Vanishing creme, amazing moisturizer for acne prone skin, deminishes redness, acne scars, and Herbalism, an organic cleanser.</li>
    <li> Really helps to treat and prevent acne. But the consistency does not allow spreading into the face. I would give five star...</li>
    <li> I bought this 2 weeks ago along with the rapid wrinkle repair. Now I&#x27;m only 29 so I don&#x27;t have horrible wrinkles or horrible acne, however, I do have a couple deep forehead wrinkles and my chin always gets a couple small breakouts. I thought this product would be great to help both issues, sense, you know, it claims to help both issues. Unfortunately what ended up happening is after 2 weeks my face is still dealing with the worst breakout I&#x27;ve ever had. I kept sticking with it hoping my skin just needed to get used to it, but no it just doesn&#x27;t work. As far as the wrinkles go mine actually look deeper instead of lighter. I would not recommend this to anyone, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have used in years.  I have 30 year old skin that is starting to look a tiny bit tired after two kids and lack of sleep.  In addition I have break outs still on a regular basis or should I say I did until using this product.  Since using this product my skin is looking refreshed and I have ZERO breakouts, even around that time of the month.  I ran out and was using some sample products I had on hand and what a mistake, my blemishes came back almost instantly.  As soon as I returned to using this product my skin was clear and feeling great.  I use it once a day in combination with the Neutrogena lavender face wipes at night.  This product is not a scrub, but a creamy sort of cleanser.  I would recommend this product for sure, no hesitation.</li>
    <li> I had been using Proactiv on and off for the past 10 years and figured it was time to find something less expensive.  The concept of this cleanser is great; it sounded perfect for people like me in their late twenties or early thirties who still deal with mild acne.  However, my skin immediately started to break out.  I continued using it for about a month hoping that my skin just needed time to adjust, but it just got worse.  I didn&#x27;t get any of those deep, painful zits, but I did develop small bumps all over my forehead.  Also, my skin just didn&#x27;t feel clean after using it.  I agree with others who said it was slimy and would slide right off your fingers into the sink.  I did find, however, that if you rub it around in your hand to create a small froth first, you can avoid that problem.  I guess one positive of this cleanser is that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like Proactiv.  Alas, the search continues...</li>
    <li> Face wash is very creamy and think which means you can use a lot less of it compared to thinner face washes, I do definitely feel the softness of my skin when using this, no strong smell, no residue, all in all I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye cream is nice and smooth, I can already see a difference in the dark circles around my eyes even though this is the first use, you don&#x27;t need the pearl sided amount, I just dot along my eyes and that is more then enough to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF 15 face cream, there is not a strong smell with any of these products which I like and so far no skin irritation even though I have never used retinol for anything before, again you do not need to pearl sized amount even though this is thick if your skin is warm it will almost melt into your skin and you wont need nearly that much. My face looks brighter and more clear and I have a lot of acne scars that are obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note I did not use the face wash that came with the eye and face cream, I used the Neutrogena anti-blemish anti-wrinkle cream I can not comment on the face wash that came with the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will leave another update if anything changes with these products.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell, non-irritating, non-drying does it what it claims! I was depressed over how my skin was looking &amp; tried Proactiv but that stuff made my condition worse, with this &amp; the Neutrogena, Anti-Wrinkle, Anti-Blemish cream, I noticed a noticable difference the next day even my mom said that my skin was pretty! Don&#x27;t expect a big lather with this in fact, it&#x27;s actually a good thing it doesn&#x27;t lather too much (it&#x27;s just right) because that can be drying to your skin just as they say you don&#x27;t want an uber soapy shampoo that lathers too much because that can strip the oils from your hair drying it out. I LOVE THIS STUFF, &amp; being on a fixed income I needed something I can afford that actually delivered on it&#x27;s promises!</li>
    <li> I always use this product. I&#x27;m 62 and still have acne.  This works better than any other products I&#x27;ve used over the years.  It was shipped quickly and was packed well.</li>
    <li> Nice face cleaner, not too harsh but has some added benefit of anti-wrinkle and anti-blemish.  Lasts a long time because only a dime size amount cleans your whole face!</li>
    <li> I was going to wait until I finished the bottle to see how well this works, but I don&#x27;t need to!  First, some background.  I am a 26 year old African American woman.  I have overall decent skin, but I have very mild acne that likes to rear its ugly head from time to time and GIANT pores.  Well, I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cleanser for two weeks and my skin looks and feels amazing.  Since using this cleanser (along with the Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night Cream and the Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Tone Correcting Moisturizer) my skin is pretty close to flawless.  The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are barely noticeable, my skin tone is even and bright, and my face is INSANELY smooth and soft.  Oh, and the very fine lines that were starting to develop from me being perpetually angry (law school will do that to you) are GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Aveeno, Biore, Simple, Clean and Clear, Clearasil, and none of them have done even half the job Neutrogena has.  I will never use anything else.  I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the cleanser.  It is so gentle, but cleans so well.  I will be a repeat customer for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d prefer if this were a scrub, but it&#x27;s not. However it is still a good compliment to the Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Anti-Blemish clear skin cream. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does everything that says on the label.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This does seem to improve my complexion, but the trade off is it really dries out my skin.  I guess you can&#x27;t have everything in this world!</li>
    <li> So this product review will not be as in-depth as many of my others but that is because there is not a lot of in-depth info to post. I have always been a huge fan of Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle moisturizer (the one with Retin-A) and figured that coupled with the glowing reviews, this might be the way to go for cleansing. In short, I love it. It does a great job (T-Zone, combination skin, daily moisturizing, daily sunscreen use, rarely wear make-up, mid-thirties with minimal wrinkles). I have not broken out at all since I purchased this (except for recently when I tried a new face mask). It does not have a strong smell or any cons EXCEPT possibly one. When you squeeze it from the tube, it kind of &amp;#34;balls up,&amp;#34; and can roll right off of your hand. Once you realize it, you can be more careful. It rolled off my hand a few times into the shower, so from then on, I knew that would happen so took steps (cupped hand, etc.) Try this if you like Neutrogena or are just looking for an excellent skin cleanser. If you have any questions, just ask.</li>
    <li> I have used this product to clear up my body of psoriasis. I know this product is a cleanser, but I use it as a lotion because it&#x27;s difficult to find lotions that contain mild salicylic acid. It&#x27;s not sticky. I put a thin layer of petroleum jelly on top sometimes or other lotions. It has cleared up my skin.</li>
    <li> I guess this product isn&#x27;t for everyone...I love the smell and it seemed to be doing me some good the first couple uses at twice a day but after a couple days my skin Broke out like crazy and dried out and turned red so I cut down to once a day but still no luck. like other reviewers, I also continued use hoping I just needed to adjust...but I&#x27;m fed up.</li>
    <li> so this is a product that def kills two birds with one stone, being 27 I am wrinkle consciousness but i have still not have outgrown my occasional adolescent breakouts, I have used everything from dermatologic, to philosophy , etc proactive , murad, and for drugstore, this with my clarisonic brush works the same if not better!</li>
    <li> would recommend this product to anyone, really works for me 1 of the best on the market today that I have been able to find</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cleanser, I&#x27;ve yet to find one that works as well as this one does, and I&#x27;ve tried at least a 100 of them. The first time I used it, after showering I saw the difference right away. My skin was very smooth and softened, makeup went on much better too. My friends even commented and asked what I was doing different!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a pearly white cream, nothing really special. The consistency reminds me a bit of clearasil, it&#x27;s pretty thick. It lathers up very nicely though, and the smell is kind of a light citrus-y smell, nothing special there either. I have mild acne, and a few fine lines, and this cleanser really helps. I LOVE the effect it has on my skin, like I said nothing else really comes close, I&#x27;m pretty sure they sprinkle magic into this or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad they have it on Amazon, because it&#x27;s not available at my store anymore. This is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve bought a second tube of, and I&#x27;m definitely going to stock up. Everyone should try this!!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this to control his occasional (mid life) breakouts and it really does work nicely. Much better than &#x27;acne&#x27; products.</li>
    <li> this stuff is ace, i&#x27;m buying my third one now. I notice if i&#x27;ve had to use another (while away) that my skin is dry but with this it has made my skin feel great. it&#x27;s gentle - my skin is prone to hating most things and this is cheap and great. buy it!</li>
    <li> This broke my face out terribly after just a few uses. Caused dry patches and redness.</li>
    <li> this is a decent face wash...nothing special for me...the consisitency however, is extremely frustrating...it is almost to thick to be separated or lathered, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it lol, but it makes my skin smooth after use..i don&#x27;t see any effectiveness concerning my acne problem though...probably works best on those with minor acne..</li>
    <li> I like how my face feels and smells after using this cleanser, but as far as anti-aging is concerned I have seen NO difference, and I&#x27;ve been using it for  a couple months now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and I like it. I placed my order while I was traveling so it would be home when I returned. This packing/shipping was BAD. My items were thrown into the box with no wrapping or anything. The top of the item opened and the product has come out and was all over my other items. Not sure how much I lost but it was a mess. I didn&#x27;t have time to do the return thing but I will not order this way again. Next time I&#x27;ll just go to Target.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. At 47, I believe it has helped me keep my skin relatively wrinkle-free and definitely blemish-free.</li>
    <li> I am a mid-life woman who rarely had acne problems when I was young, but started dealing with wrinkles AND acne recently. Oh the joys of growing older! Anyway, I had tried all kinds of products with no relief. I had settled to just covering the mess up. My cousin had Healthy Skin cleanser and with her encouragement, I gave it a try. LOVE IT! I noticed the acne diminishing almost right away and my skin was smooth and hydrated - not tight.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very thick and creamy. Not sure if it helps with wrinkles but it does leave the skin clean and soft. But it is so thick it comes out in a glob and you have to rub it between your fingers to cream it up before applying it</li>
    <li> Love the creamy texture of this product. Love the fact that it helps with wrinkles and acne. Arrived on time good packaging</li>
    <li> Worst face product EVER.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something with salicylic acid to fight blemishes, but that was not for teenagers and therefore too drying.  I prefer not to use products with sodium laurel sulfate, either.  I&#x27;m a mid life person, but still fight the occasional whitehead and greasy face mid-day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was AWFUL.  It made me break out in huge pustules, and also made my face very tight and dry at the same time.  It&#x27;s taken almost a month without it to get back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And folks weren&#x27;t kidding about the creepy smell.  Closest I could describe it is like hospital smell, or purell.  Not clean, just creepy.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t imagine who this product is good for.&lt;br /&gt;Ick.  I didn&#x27;t even try to give it away, just threw it out.</li>
    <li> I used this product and had a major break out. I switched to the normal Neutrogena and break out went away after 3 or 4 days. Will not order again.</li>
