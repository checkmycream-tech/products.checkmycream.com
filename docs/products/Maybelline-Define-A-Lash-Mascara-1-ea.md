      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping he&#x27;ll make good on and send me the correct one, since I&#x27;ve ordered from him befor and consider him a 5 star seller!</li>

      <li>A good mascara for the price.</li>
      <li>The product was good for the price.</li>
      <li>The price and availability were good .</li>
      <li>but the product is very good, one of the best for me of all different kinds tried.</li>
      <li>I continue to love this mascara for its volumizing effect on my lashes!</li>

      <li>was THRILLED to find that Amazon has stock, and even better was the price.</li>
      <li>I love the brush.</li>
      <li>recommended, we&#x27;ll purchase more once its needed :)</li>
      <li>One of my favorite mascaras of all time.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>Found it on line and bought as many of them as I could find.  </li>
      <li>Mascara that lengthens my eyelashes, gives more volum and thickness ...&lt;</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Been using different Maybelline mascaras over the years and have found this one for me is the best at separating lashes and not clumping.  </li>
      <li>This was supposed to be at the top, but I don&#x27;t agree.  </li>
      <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>I do love this mascara.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, the brush is perfect for my eyelashes, and a tube seems to last me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It flows quite nicely for an economically priced mascara.</li>
      <li>Amazons price is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Hope it will always be available to me.</li>
      <li>Though I haven&#x27;t opened the product I&#x27;m assuming the quality will be great as when I ordered it last year .</li>
      <li>This one has &#x27;rubber&#x27; bristles rather than the soft brush kind, and it just seems to work better for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;P.S. brown as well as black are very good.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes have a nice thickened but natural look when I use this.</li>
      <li>Women often ask me what mascara I use and tell me how much they love my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>really great, does its job very well, one and only</li>
      <li>I have tried many different mascaras and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>i thinks its my third or 4th purchase of this product, I&#x27;m really glad I&#x27;ve found it since ones that are available at my place</li>
      <li>This mascara not only lengthens nicely but it doesn&#x27;t clump and it helps curl.</li>
      <li>so buying it on here is very convenient!</li>
      <li>Amazon helps me find it for a price much more reasonable than my local retailers.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine for application, but when you try to put it back in the container it feels like it is going to snap off because it is so flexible.  </li>
      <li>Just what I wanted thanks</li>
      <li>It works very well for me.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for something affordable that really defines the lashes and don&#x27;t think this is it.  </li>
      <li>not to do the \\&quot;quick in and out several times\\&quot; that manufacturers warn against.  </li>
      <li>Normally my lashes will stay curled all day, but with this on, I look like Snuffleupagus (think Sesame Street) in a matter of minutes.  </li>
      <li>I have used this mascara for a few years, and I love it.</li>
      <li>but it seems that this one was maybe old</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad mascara, but just average.  </li>
      <li>I found it to be not thick enough</li>
      <li>So glad to have gotten a few to  hopefully last for several years.</li>
      <li>The brown-black color is almost impossible to find locally and I was happy to find online.</li>
      <li>Oddly though, it weighs down my lashes much more than the exact same product in black.  </li>
      <li>It started out fine, but after about a week of use, each time I pulled the applicator out, it was half covered in a goopy mess of mascara.  </li>

<li> No clue why this color does it and the black doesn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Cannot find the brownish black in stores anymore.</li>
<li> hope Maybelline reconsiders taking the brownish black off the market.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have  used Maybelline Define-A-Lash for years in brownish black and was disappointed when it was obviously being phased out at my local stores.</li>
<li> Also, like the brownish black color which was hard to find.  </li>
<li> These usually sell for around $7 each in stores.</li>
<li> It can be hard to find sometimes</li>
<li> Also, the flexible wand is hard to work with.  </li>
<li> I had a hard time finding this at the store and tried amazon..</li>
<li> so it turned out to become too thick in 3 weeks.</li>
<li> was really disappointed to find recently that Maybelline no longer seems to be making the brownish black in this mascara.</li>
<li> I bought this based on fairly high ratings, but was very disappointed.  </li>
<li> But wrong mascara...</li>
<li> If you do, it will start to flake and the tube will go bad quicker.</li>
<li> After about two weeks, it got so bad</li>

    <li> I have been using this mascara for years now and I often can&#x27;t find it in stores, there would usually be one left and it would be waterproof one and I don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup. I have been and still receive a lot of compliments when I wear this mascara. Women often ask me what mascara I use and tell me how much they love my eyelashes. This mascara not only lengthens nicely but it doesn&#x27;t clump and it helps curl. My eyelashes have a nice thickened but natural look when I use this. Hope it will always be available to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on fairly high ratings, but was very disappointed.  It started out fine, but after about a week of use, each time I pulled the applicator out, it was half covered in a goopy mess of mascara.  I am careful not to do the \\&quot;quick in and out several times\\&quot; that manufacturers warn against.  This stuff just gooped up on it&#x27;s own.  After about two weeks, it got so bad I just need to throw it away.  Also, the flexible wand is hard to work with.  I could get used to that if the mascara itself was any good, but it&#x27;s not.</li>

    <li> Been using different Maybelline mascaras over the years and have found this one for me is the best at separating lashes and not clumping.  I think the brush shape may be a key but the product is very good, one of the best for me of all different kinds tried.</li>
    <li> I have been using the mascara for some time now.  It works very well for me.  It never seems to clump, smudge, or smear.  Amazon helps me find it for a price much more reasonable than my local retailers.  :)</li>
    <li> I used to like it but it seems that this one was maybe old so it turned out to become too thick in 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> i thinks its my third or 4th purchase of this product, I&#x27;m really glad I&#x27;ve found it since ones that are available at my place are not the same as this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its really great, does its job very well, one and only Mascara that lengthens my eyelashes, gives more volum and thickness ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended, we&#x27;ll purchase more once its needed :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. brown as well as black are very good.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted thanks</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s the washable one. I have never tried the water proof. I love the brush. However, you ONLY apply it once, while it&#x27;s wet. Once it dries, don&#x27;t put on anymore. If you do, it will start to flake and the tube will go bad quicker. I do love this mascara.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different mascaras and this is my favorite. I had a hard time finding this at the store and tried amazon..thankful I found it here, so ordered several</li>
    <li> A good mascara for the price. It flows quite nicely for an economically priced mascara. The brown-black color is almost impossible to find locally and I was happy to find online.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  Cannot find the brownish black in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Just like the stores&#x27; but cheaper.</li>
    <li> But wrong mascara...I ordered the &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; version of this mascara, which I&#x27;ve used before and I love but received the waterproof version, which is dry and very difficult to remove.  I&#x27;m hoping he&#x27;ll make good on and send me the correct one, since I&#x27;ve ordered from him befor and consider him a 5 star seller!</li>
    <li> I have  used Maybelline Define-A-Lash for years in brownish black and was disappointed when it was obviously being phased out at my local stores. I decided I&#x27;d &#x27;stock up&#x27; while I still could. I continue to love this mascara for its volumizing effect on my lashes!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on the date as promised . The price and availability were good . Though I haven&#x27;t opened the product I&#x27;m assuming the quality will be great as when I ordered it last year .</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in the stores anymore.  So glad to have gotten a few to  hopefully last for several years.</li>

    <li> I have used this mascara for a few years, and I love it. It goes on easily, the brush is perfect for my eyelashes, and a tube seems to last me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed to find recently that Maybelline no longer seems to be making the brownish black in this mascara. Multiple trips to various retail stores and all I could find was black.&lt;br /&gt;I was THRILLED to find that Amazon has stock, and even better was the price. These usually sell for around $7 each in stores. Amazons price is fantastic. I bought 6 tubes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried about 4 or 5 other Maybelline mascaras, and I just never seem to like the different brushes. This one has &#x27;rubber&#x27; bristles rather than the soft brush kind, and it just seems to work better for me. I have short, thin eyelashes, and a regular soft brush just never seems to get enough mascara onto my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I hope Maybelline reconsiders taking the brownish black off the market.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product, and especially at the price I got it for from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite!!!! Makes eyelashes look long and never clumpy</li>
    <li> I could not find Black/Brown Define a Lash anywhere.  Ordered here and when it arrived it also included a Define A Line eyeliner with each mascara....I&#x27;m set for a year. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and I can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.  Found it on line and bought as many of them as I could find.  I hope this is not a product which is being discontinued by Maybelline !!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  Goes on perfectly.  Also, like the brownish black color which was hard to find.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
