      <li>For the money, I thought that this set would be a good value, which it is if you buy comparable components separately.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Vendor was good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not Barber Quality as advertised,  but good for consumer use....</li>
      <li>My husband love this!</li>
      <li>Not a pro, just cut my own hair with a guard.</li>
      <li>I own a set of these clippers and gave them away to my dad, but im buying them again.</li>
      <li>Nice combo</li>
      <li>Andis products are great but this may not be an original.  </li>
      <li>Works great, definitely worth the price.  </li>
      <li>clean cut, durable, good blades, look good,&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I love this product the combination  </li>
      <li>You have to adjust them yourself, but its better not to exsplain and maybe ask others you know or use youtube.</li>
      <li>but most clippers are.</li>
      <li>They work better than a barber&#x27;s clippers and cut like a pro.</li>
      <li>Very pleased so far!!!!!</li>
      <li>The clippers do not get hot and the trimmers will give you a good quality line.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried ALL of the other name brand and these are  THE BEST CLIPPER COMBO!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how easy these cut in comparison.</li>
      <li>Quick Shipping, outstanding set of clippers.</li>
      <li>These felt cheap.</li>
      <li>Enjoy</li>
      <li>We needed something a bit more powerful than typical hair cutters and did not want battery operated ones, they run out too quick,  this one is perfect.</li>
      <li>effective, highly recommended to all barbers</li>
      <li>So far, we love it!</li>
      <li>I have to say once I learned how to use a mirror to do a full haircut</li>
      <li>My father loves his new clippers, great deal, great long lasting quality,</li>
      <li>First the clippers work very good with exception of the clippers getting hot (it does get red hot</li>
      <li>The trimmer functioned well as expected: good lining, good dry shaving.</li>
      <li>Excellent product for professional or everyday grooming needs</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall worth the money</li>
      <li>Had to return the clippers to the manufacturer because of a faulty on/off switch that was iffy right out the box</li>
      <li>tk work again, and thats the first use.</li>
      <li>Item was exactly as disclosed.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>love these clippers, they are quiet and i do not have to spend alot of time on hairlines like the cheaper store brand andis clippers!!!!</li>
      <li>The trimmer is not as sharp as I would prefer, but is far better than what comes in most combo units.</li>
      <li>I’m not a licensed barber, but I decided to splurge on a good set, at least that’s what I thought.</li>
      <li>I was forced to return defective set back to the merchant and endured returned shipping cost—not too happy about the shipping.</li>
      <li>Returned these and bought new wahl.</li>
      <li>The clipper turns off frequently by itself, unless I twist the cable in a certain way to get it back</li>
      <li>Clippers get a little warm at times but that should be expected.</li>
      <li>The trimmer blade was not sharp and kept pulling my hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I had to manually open the main trimmer once and re-adjust the power button, outside of that</li>
      <li>Kind of expensive</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, after less than a minute of using the clipper, the on\off switch experienced a short—clipper turns on, then immediately turns off.</li>
      <li>Shipping/delivery was a little ahead of time which was very much appreciated.</li>

    <li> Had to return the clippers to the manufacturer because of a faulty on/off switch that was iffy right out the box</li>
    <li> Quick Shipping, outstanding set of clippers. Sharp and long lasting quality. Clippers get a little warm at times but that should be expected.</li>
    <li> Great product! Just as advertised!</li>
    <li> The clippers came broke.</li>
    <li> Great clippers¡!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for professional or everyday grooming needs</li>
    <li> Kind of expensive but I got it for the t outliner over all its a gd deal for both.</li>
    <li> Both were broken in the box. Even if they were not I would have been returning anyway. I was replacing my wahl. Returned these and bought new wahl. These felt cheap.</li>
    <li> This purchase was a huge disappointment. The trimmer blade was not sharp and kept pulling my hair. Andis products are great but this may not be an original.  I don&#x27;t recommend this store.</li>
    <li> Pros: clean cut, durable, good blades, look good,&lt;br /&gt;Cons: over heats causing burns to skin, not enough accessories,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth the money</li>
    <li> For the money, I thought that this set would be a good value, which it is if you buy comparable components separately. I’m not a licensed barber, but I decided to splurge on a good set, at least that’s what I thought. The trimmer functioned well as expected: good lining, good dry shaving. Unfortunately, after less than a minute of using the clipper, the on\off switch experienced a short—clipper turns on, then immediately turns off. I was forced to return defective set back to the merchant and endured returned shipping cost—not too happy about the shipping. However, I did order separate Andis components to compromise what I was looking for in a set.</li>
    <li> I own a set of these clippers and gave them away to my dad, but im buying them again. But I read reviews about the liners not being sharp. But my wasnt sharp out the box. You have to adjust them yourself, but its better not to exsplain and maybe ask others you know or use youtube. My cousin showed me and after adjusting they are so close to being a razor, swear. If the big one has noise just adjust the screws until no noise and use cleaners and oil.Enjoy</li>
    <li> Best hair cut  great clippers</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not Barber Quality as advertised,  but good for consumer use....</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Works great, definitely worth the price.  We needed something a bit more powerful than typical hair cutters and did not want battery operated ones, they run out too quick,  this one is perfect.</li>
    <li> love these clippers, they are quiet and i do not have to spend alot of time on hairlines like the cheaper store brand andis clippers!!!! Very pleased so far!!!!!</li>
    <li> The clipper turns off frequently by itself, unless I twist the cable in a certain way to get it back tk work again, and thats the first use.</li>
    <li> My husband said it works great and he loves the clippers. Nice combo, it should last awhile It is a little noisy but most clippers are.</li>
    <li> Been using those crappy ones you can buy anywhere. I can&#x27;t tell you how easy these cut in comparison. Not a pro, just cut my own hair with a guard. The little ones get as close as a razor,</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars only because there could be small changes to make it a 5 star but the company failed to do. First the clippers work very good with exception of the clippers getting hot (it does get red hot but it is of minor concerns and is one of the reasons why I deducted a star). Second of all the If you&#x27;re looking to do fades with these clippers than be prepared to know what you&#x27;re doing. My old clippers had a way to click adjust the blade on this model there are no indicators just up and down. The other things is that the clippers only came with #1,2,3,4,6,8 combs really not a complete set. No sure why???</li>
    <li> I love this product the combination  is great.&lt;br /&gt;company is great.&lt;br /&gt;clean cut, durable, good blades,&lt;br /&gt;cost effective, highly recommended to all barbers</li>
    <li> My husband love this!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my boyfriend and they were raggedy when we got them. He had to rig them up just to use the power switch. I don&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> Blades broke after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good set. He just wishes the edges are a little sharper.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as disclosed. So far, we love it! Shipping/delivery was a little ahead of time which was very much appreciated.</li>
    <li> The clippers do not get hot and the trimmers will give you a good quality line. I&#x27;ve tried ALL of the other name brand and these are  THE BEST CLIPPER COMBO!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing that I don&#x27;t like about this product. It&#x27;s perfect and it works great. I&#x27;ll recommended to anybody looking for quality hair clippers.</li>
    <li> Just using them for home.  Work great.</li>
    <li> Color was gray not White for my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works nicely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vendor was good</li>
    <li> The clipper is very sharp and handles men&#x27;s fades well.  The trimmer is not as sharp as I would prefer, but is far better than what comes in most combo units.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers new and started cutting. They work better than a barber&#x27;s clippers and cut like a pro.</li>
    <li> I got this because when moving out of NYC I couldn&#x27;t find a great barber out in Vegas. I have to say once I learned how to use a mirror to do a full haircut I can&#x27;t even imagine going back! After a few months this paid for itself, literally I didn&#x27;t have to worry about barbers I just everything myself. The trimmer helps you do outlines like a barber, it&#x27;s great. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I had to manually open the main trimmer once and re-adjust the power button, outside of that it&#x27;s been working great since. If you are giving haircuts or getting them, this is a money saver in the long run</li>
    <li> My father loves his new clippers, great deal, great long lasting quality,</li>
