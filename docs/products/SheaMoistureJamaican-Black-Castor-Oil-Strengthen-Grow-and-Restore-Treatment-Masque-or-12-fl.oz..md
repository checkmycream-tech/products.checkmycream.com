      <li>wish the quantity was more for the price.</li>
      <li>Love it  </li>
      <li>My hair felt wonderful after using this deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>I saw the reviews on this, and decided to buy, in hopes that it would show my hair some love, by promoting growth and repairing my ends.</li>
      <li>but this feels 10x better.</li>
      <li>I used it once and fell in love.</li>
      <li>:) I apply it before washing (along with coconut oil) then cover with a cap for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>The packaging was nice and secure.</li>
      <li>So I just got this magic today (6/17/2015).</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>I first applied it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the product was getting distributed in my hair good.  </li>
      <li>Between these two products my hair is super soft, my curls are perfect and no frizz.</li>
      <li>the product is pretty good</li>
      <li>It smells delicious, and you can tell that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients because it doesn&#x27;t have that super strong &amp;#34;perfume-like&amp;#34; smell that most hair products do.</li>
      <li>The product smells lovely, not too strong, and kinda like vanilla.</li>
      <li>Pretty good but not as great as some of the other Shea Moisture products.</li>
      <li>I use Light Mountain Medium Brown Henna hair color/conditioner to dye my hair every 6-8 weeks, and this masque 1x per week.</li>
      <li>my hair felt really smooth.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy how it smells, it&#x27;s not overpowering though.</li>
      <li>I like the light texture of it</li>
      <li>I like that it has a light scent so it does not affect my allergies</li>
      <li>my hair is soft and look and feel good.</li>
      <li>Great moisture treatment, all the products from this brand but specially the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Line is outstanding stuff.</li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;m a true convert.</li>
      <li>However , I have a bathroom shelve full of Tropic products.  </li>
      <li>For my healthy hair is too much sometimes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used ORS&#x27;s classic replenishing conditioner for YEARS (love it as well)</li>
      <li>It seems as if this product is disappearing from the jar quickly.</li>
      <li>This deep conditioner is amazing on my type 4 coils.</li>
      <li>I have unbleached hair that is in good condition overall, so I cannot speak for very damaged hair.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S WORTH</li>
      <li>I try to use is rarely</li>
      <li>Even my boyfriend loves this stuff, he wants to purchase it!</li>
      <li>After i used it for the first time-</li>
      <li>I followed up with the JBCO leave in, my own oil blend, and the curl milk from the pink line.</li>
      <li>Smooth, soft hair.</li>
      <li>Soft and supple was how my hair felt to the touch, and my scalp felt so clean.  </li>
      <li>I think I have finally found the right products for my hair!!</li>
      <li>First off I bought this at my local CVS at their BOGO free sale they were having (12.99 retail).</li>
      <li>, it has a very decent smell ( unlike the anti-breakage one).&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>works very well on my hair</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I tried and I didn&#x27;t to much care for it.</li>
      <li>This is a subtle yet GREAT natural smell.</li>
      <li>First off, my hair is natural 3b/c.</li>
      <li>Rinsed out with cool water, I could feel a big difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>but the over all price( shipping etc..) was way to high.</li>
      <li>I was able to get my hair looking better due to going completely natural, but a few months ago, decided to bleach my ends.</li>
      <li>im African American with strong wavy hair ...</li>
      <li>When I received it, I was eager to try to out as soon as possible, and really put all these positive reviews to the test.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the Shea Moisture JBCO shampoo yet, since I&#x27;d just bought a brand new bottle of another brand</li>
      <li>it will be my first and last time buying from this compagny</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly, fairly thick hair and have been looking for a good conditioner for a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and defined (no gel needed) after I put heat on it for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Feels Soft Silky and voluminous</li>
      <li>This masque leaves my hair so soft and silky.</li>
      <li>First picture was taken on Aug 3rd, second picture taken Aug 17th</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty dry and damaged, and this is one of the only things that helps.</li>
      <li>My hair is left incredibly soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I only recently started using this product and so far I have no complaints.</li>
      <li>Since this product is a DC with keratin (not like Aphogee) in it, my natural 3c/4a curls feel stronger and alive without being weighed down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Pretty good but not as great as some of the other Shea Moisture products.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this line!!!  This deep conditioner is amazing on my type 4 coils. My hair is left incredibly soft and manageable. I think I have finally found the right products for my hair!!</li>
    <li> Love it  I use it every day my hair is soft and look and feel good.</li>
    <li> Does anyone know what will happen if I leave this product in rather than washing it out? I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> So I just got this magic today (6/17/2015). I ordered it two days ago, so shipping was great(maybe because I have Prime). The packaging was nice and secure. When I received it, I was eager to try to out as soon as possible, and really put all these positive reviews to the test. First off, my hair is natural 3b/c. But due to heavy straightening and not using protection, my hair was damaged. I was able to get my hair looking better due to going completely natural, but a few months ago, decided to bleach my ends. I&#x27;ve tried to keep them moisturized to the max because I know what bleaching does to hair, but nothing seemed to keep my ends from frizzing up, looking matted and breaking off! I saw the reviews on this, and decided to buy, in hopes that it would show my hair some love, by promoting growth and repairing my ends. The product smells lovely, not too strong, and kinda like vanilla. I really like the consistency as well, its almost like a creamy pudding, and not runny or too thick at all.&lt;br /&gt;After a half hour, I washed this out, and dried it with a T-shirt. I immediately noticed my hair was looking a little nicer. When I went to style it, my hair was very easy to part and come through. AND IT WAS SOOOO SOFT, and my ends didn&#x27;t feel as bad as they usually do when I combed through it this time! All I did was put some Argan Oil on my ends and twist it up. Gonna use weekly and hope for improving results. :)</li>
    <li> The reviews made me buy the item.  However , I have a bathroom shelve full of Tropic products.  Returned because I did not want to mix the product line.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for my 4b/4c hair texture .. It detangles my hair and leaves it moisturized. This is my favorite hair masque to use !</li>
    <li> Shea Moisture Treatment Masques just can&#x27;t go wrong in my book. Smooth, soft hair. This smells of caramel, vanilla, and a bit of peppermint</li>
    <li> My hair felt wonderful after using this deep conditioner. Will add it to my regular routine.</li>
    <li> works very well on my hair</li>
    <li> Used with Mane &#x27;n Tail Herbal Growth Shampoo &amp; Conditional and Natrol Biotin pills. First picture was taken on Aug 3rd, second picture taken Aug 17th</li>
    <li> I have unbleached hair that is in good condition overall, so I cannot speak for very damaged hair. After i used it for the first time- my hair felt really smooth. Thank you for the great product.   Update: This would be perfect for damaged hair. For my healthy hair is too much sometimes. It weighs it down. I try to use is rarely but it works wonders.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, fairly thick hair and have been looking for a good conditioner for a long time. This one is by far the best! It smells amazing and works so well. I use Light Mountain Medium Brown Henna hair color/conditioner to dye my hair every 6-8 weeks, and this masque 1x per week. Between these two products my hair is super soft, my curls are perfect and no frizz. I like the Deva Curl cream when my hair is wet as well.</li>
    <li> It seems as if this product is disappearing from the jar quickly. It is a nice size jar. The smell is wonderful and the slip is amazing. I Did find that it takes a bit of muscle work to remove it all from hair. I plan on putting some in spray bottle with water to make it last longer...and wash out easier.</li>
    <li> This masque leaves my hair so soft and silky. My hair is pretty dry and damaged, and this is one of the only things that helps. I really enjoy how it smells, it&#x27;s not overpowering though. I have to be extra careful to rinse it out thoroughly, because can leave my hair looking a little greasy if I&#x27;m in a rush and don&#x27;t rinse it well enough.</li>
    <li> Feels Soft Silky and voluminous</li>
    <li> I only recently started using this product and so far I have no complaints. I like that it has a light scent so it does not affect my allergies</li>
    <li> the product is pretty good i have to say but the over all price( shipping etc..) was way to high. it will be my first and last time buying from this compagny</li>
    <li> to me it smells like caramel. And it leaves my hair boncier and it feels and looks healthier since using this line.</li>
    <li> Great moisture treatment, all the products from this brand but specially the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Line is outstanding stuff.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I like the light texture of it and i actually am seeing some results.  Best of all, no weird smell!</li>
    <li> Excellent product...im African American with strong wavy hair ... this product leave my wavy moisturizer and shiny ... u can also find this product at Target for $10.99</li>
    <li> Agree with previous comment it does smell like play-doh lol😄 but I would definitely buy this product again. I started using this product transitioning from relaxed to natur hair. It does what its supposed to. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐5/5</li>
    <li> 4 a/b hair:&lt;br /&gt;I have never used it alone, but as a base for my concoction: This+ olive-almond-jojoba-avocado- borage oils+ few drops of Apogee essentiel oils+ Hair Mayonnaise &#x3D; THE BOMB!&lt;br /&gt;It love that it has great slip and detangles easily. I am not sure about the palydoh  smell people talk about, it has a very decent smell ( unlike the anti-breakage one).&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the quantity was more for the price. I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> People say this stuff smells like play-dough... I don&#x27;t know where they got that from. It smells delicious, and you can tell that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients because it doesn&#x27;t have that super strong &amp;#34;perfume-like&amp;#34; smell that most hair products do. This is a subtle yet GREAT natural smell. This product works soooo wellll for my hair! My hair is relaxed(texlaxed now) so I wanted this to deep condition my hair and strengthen it. I used it once and fell in love. I&#x27;ve used ORS&#x27;s classic replenishing conditioner for YEARS (love it as well) but I have to say this product beats it. It makes my hair softer, easier to detangle, and I&#x27;ve even noticed less hair on my comb after detangling. IT&#x27;S WORTH THE TRY. Plus I&#x27;ve used it for about 4 washes and it doesn&#x27;t seem like I&#x27;ve made a dent in the product, so I believe it will last a longgg time.</li>
    <li> I tried and I didn&#x27;t to much care for it. I am a multi racial female. I&#x27;m African American and Irish and this stuff dlline of Shea moistures does nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> First off I bought this at my local CVS at their BOGO free sale they were having (12.99 retail). I&#x27;ve never used any other SM masque before to compare but I really liked this, even though it smells like play doh lol. Rinsed out with cool water, I could feel a big difference in my hair. Since this product is a DC with keratin (not like Aphogee) in it, my natural 3c/4a curls feel stronger and alive without being weighed down. I&#x27;ve used Aussie 3 minute miracle and Pantene DC before and it made my hair feel nice but this feels 10x better. It&#x27;s soft and defined (no gel needed) after I put heat on it for 30 minutes. I followed up with the JBCO leave in, my own oil blend, and the curl milk from the pink line. If your hair is feeling like mush (moisture overload) from your products, use this ASAP. Use it once a week and you&#x27;ll feel a change. Don&#x27;t be hesitate to buy this because black women use it. It&#x27;s for ANY hair type. I&#x27;ll be going back to try another hair masque.</li>
    <li> I have become a fan of Shea Moisture products for my Type 3C hair. But I was still experiencing some breakage. Using this product as a pre-poo (along with a little extra coconut oil) has made all the difference! It has great slip and the scent smells like cookies to me :) I apply it before washing (along with coconut oil) then cover with a cap for 30 minutes. Then I do a no-poo wash with Deva No-Poo. My hair comes out soft and the breakage has really decreased. BTW, you can find this at some Target stores for a lower price. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a must have for deep treatment hair masques!  I was a little skeptical at first but now I&#x27;m a true convert. The smell kind of reminds you of playdoh but in a a good way - with a hint of peppermint undertones. The smell is not offensive at all.  I haven&#x27;t used the Shea Moisture JBCO shampoo yet, since I&#x27;d just bought a brand new bottle of another brand (I have vowed to use what products I have before making another purchase!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my take:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the product was getting distributed in my hair good.  I have 4B/C hair, so lots of coils.  I continued to work it in as best I could and left in my hair the recommended time, approx 15 mins (and covered my head with a plastic cap).  But when I rinsed my hair.....O-M-G!!! My curls were poppin&#x27;.  The results were immediate! My hair felt so restored and replenished. Soft and supple was how my hair felt to the touch, and my scalp felt so clean.  I purchased my jar from a local CVS.  I will never be without this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, hair crack, lol. Even my boyfriend loves this stuff, he wants to purchase it! Amazing!</li>
