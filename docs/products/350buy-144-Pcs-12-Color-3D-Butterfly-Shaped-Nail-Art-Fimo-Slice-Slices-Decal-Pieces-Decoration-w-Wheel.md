    <li> Way too thick to use on nails.</li>
    <li> Looks cute but it doesn&#x27;t always stay on</li>
    <li> THESE ARE NICE BUTTERFLY TO PASTE ON YOUR CEL PHONE CASE AND MAKE IT LOOK EVEN BETTER THAT IT IS</li>
    <li> way too thick for my nails this is more for decorations,my idea is i ordered the sticks you can cut yourself my husband cut them perfect</li>
    <li> Many of the butterflies were broken. Many were mixed in together with other colors. The wheel breaks the tiny clay butterflies when I turn it to open.</li>
    <li> These butterfly slices are so cute and a fun change in nail decorations. I usually do flowers so I&#x27;m really excited to have something fun and different.</li>
    <li> There are no butterflies. Just a bunch of hearts. I have purchased two other wheels and they are never what they say in the discription or picture.</li>
    <li> So adorable, very well detailed. Easy to use and remove, no need to go to an expensive salon when you can do it yourself with these.  There are so many it&#x27;s really a great deal!</li>
    <li> Had a lot of fun playing with these butterflies while decorating my nails.  The hardest part was deciding which ones to use first!</li>
    <li> these are so easy to use, and, the detail is amazing. They are great for other projects, as well as your nails. I love them.</li>
    <li> I love the little butterflies. Thank you so much. This is a very nice gift for my sister. She will love them.</li>
    <li> They are so cute and the colors are great. Very bright and look great in the nail. I use them for incapsulated nails</li>
    <li> This is beautiful I love to use the flower with it to make like a picture scene on my nails and everyone love to ask me what salon did your nails!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these in many shapes and designs. I love them. Only complaint is they are small and thin making them a little difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I realize these little decals will not last forever, but I do wish there would have been just a few more. I did like these little butterflies though. They were colorful and vibrant. I would recommend this to someone who likes butterflies as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Very cute. In great shape. I can&#x27;t wait to use them. Great colors. Nothing was broken and nothing was mixed up.</li>
    <li> They sent me two wheels when other company&#x27;s just guess and send one wheel. Very happy. yes there were some cut pieces but for the price i am super happy and can&#x27;t wait to use</li>
    <li> I love the nail art. Every one that sees my nails loves them. All my friends want me to do there nails</li>
    <li> these are super TINY. Please be aware. I didnt see a size of these listed... so it is hard to see them.. but they are CUTE!</li>
    <li> These are a great way to dress up your nails with out too much effort. They worked better on my toe nails because they dont bend very much.</li>
    <li> Love them! But it is difficult to get them to lay flat on the nail.</li>
    <li> Let me say it off by saying I&#x27;m obsessed with butterflies! I got these because I used to be really into doing my nails! I ended up putting them on my nails my sisters nails and even little kids I babysat for! These are so adorable! I would definitely order these again although it seems like they will last me forever!</li>
    <li> I decided to do my nails and my daughters as well.  They are not what I thought.  You have to be very careful picking them up or they will break/ snap in your hand.  Yet they do not bend easily so that you can apply them to the nail.  I will not be purchasing this product again.  I did NOT have a problem with the shipper at all.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get here, but they are super cute and I get lots of compliments on my nails!</li>
    <li> I love these. A complete must have for anyone who likes to design their nails with ease. I will recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love these will love some more</li>
    <li> There were 12 sections with 12 different color butterfly. They were very cute. I was happy with the product I&#x27;ve bought. I WILL buy here again in the near future.</li>
    <li> these butterflies are cute. not sure what they are made out of but they dont form to your finger and have ends sticking out that catch on things. no matter how many top coats you apply, with a day or 2 the butterflies chip into pieces n you have to take em off or reapply or go around with your nails looking messy from the broken pieces that fell off</li>
    <li> These are so cute!  And they&#x27;re cut perfectly!  I wasn&#x27;t really sure what I expected, but I thought they might look a bit different, but they do look really cute.</li>
    <li> I have decided I don&#x27;t like these as much as other things on the market. Still they&#x27;re adorable and look cute.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for arrived on time.  THe product is a little too thick.  Make it easy to fall off.  It&#x27;s fun for little kids that just want something fun on their nails for 1 day.</li>
    <li> These are very tiny. Cute but would be for a little one.</li>
    <li> Size shown here is deceiving as it is very small box. I gave 4 stars because its very useful and must in nail art</li>
    <li> The product is so good and the price to. Deliver the product was on time and good to. I will keep buying items with you guys. I will recommend this product to my friends and family. Thanks.</li>
    <li> great and truly my favorite much needed it for my schooling truly van&#x27;t wait for next mod in January oh wow I&#x27;m ready</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule.  Product is identicle to what the picture shows.  The only problem that I had was when I received the package in the mail, all of the butterflies had come out of the container.  Not realizing this when I opened the envelope, I ended up having butterflies all over the floor.  I had to sort them and put them back in the container.</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> not very good not very good i give to my mom the butterfly 3D for her birthday she was happy</li>
    <li> These were to thick for my taste. Also ordered the flowers and they were the same. even with tope coat they catch on things. They are pretty.</li>
    <li> These are a great addition to my nail art collection.  I can not wait to use these with some of my designs. Excellent price and fast delivery. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and arrived on time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 14 and when I purchased the iteam, I thought it would be a little bit more... mature. The product is as described, the butterflies are just thicker then I thought they would be. They aren&#x27;t consistent with the thickness, so sometimes the butterfly would lie straight even when you pushed the wings down until the paint was dry. This makes it really hard to keep the butterflies on your nails for long periods of time. Of course, this is the same for most things you can stick on your nails. Over all, the butterflies are cute and would be great for an one day occasion. Any longer then that wouldn&#x27;t work. As for small childen, I could only imagine how hard it would be for a five year old to keep these things on. However, they&#x27;re fun and cute, so mom&#x27;s judgement is best.&lt;br /&gt;The really big problem I had was with the seller. I gave Joyshopper a 3 star review because I thought I was reviewing the product, not the seller. Then I got a call from some lady asking me to remove my rating. My dad told her not to call us back and hung up. Then 5 minutes later, she called. It wasn&#x27;t the lady&#x27;s fault, she was just doing her job. However, my family didn&#x27;t appreciate being harassed, especially after asking to be left alone. This the only reason I&#x27;m giving a 1 star review for the product. (Amazon wouldn&#x27;t let me go back and change my seller rating)</li>
    <li> These nail decals are cute. I used them on my daughters nails and they were adorable on her. Some seem paper thin so be cautious when trying to add them onto your nails.</li>
    <li> they are cut nice and thin. and they are so colorful will go with any polish color. i mean for the price you can not beat these. i love mine. and i will order more.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to order these and try them out after waiting over a month and never came so I had to do a refund on them very disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters for Christmas and the quality is great and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;) great on the shipping end also! Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
    <li> I love it, the products were great. Sliced very thin, perfect on designs. Shipping was very fast, 5 days earlier than estimate.Though i did have a few butterflies got mixup with each other because the wheel are loose when packed.</li>
    <li> Amazing colors but I got a lot of half butterflies and most of the ones that I got that were whole were extremely thick.</li>
    <li> great price but smaller than what i expected but its cool. I can use these and will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> the are very small and they are as thick as a couple sheets of paper. i didnt really have any expectations because this is my first time buying them. but they are fine to me, took about 2wks to deliver</li>
    <li> Pretty colors, very vibrant but, soo thin! they almost look like stickers. Still, their great for encapsulated nails designs :)</li>
    <li> I have just gotten into the nail art for me and my girls and we are having so much fun with all the added bling, not to mention all the compliments.</li>
    <li> so cutie and got it fast i means fast wow  paging was good and did it some of my friends nails and they love it too next time going to get more of this thank you</li>
    <li> Received items way early then expected.  Perfect size! Not cheap looking. Super excited to use them.</li>
    <li> Fell off after 2 days would be ok if only wearing for a short period of time. But they are cute.</li>
    <li> I use this for other crafty stuff too!</li>
    <li> I love them and I will be buying them again</li>
    <li> These little FIMO clay adornments are really cute.  Their dainty, but not too small.  They look great also!  I like that there is  several colors to choose from.  That way you can color coordinate or contrast.  Great price too!  I would recommend these to any DIY nail artist.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my daughter, she is always doing my grand daughters nails.  So far so good, they are having a blast!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, they are fairly easy to use, and have very bright colors as well. My daughters love them.</li>
    <li> Its nice but they were messed up and i wouldn&#x27;t buy these anymore ... they weren&#x27;t handled correctly&lt;br /&gt;they are pretty to look at but i have less than 144 butterflies because they have broken some and they don&#x27;t seem to last but i am happy and thanks for shipping my order :)</li>
    <li> They come off real easy. I did my moms nails with the butterfly and the next day they came off. Not a fan</li>
    <li> I really liked the designs.  As I put them in different containers I noticed the different sizes, which I loved but some of them were already broken (probably when they were originally cut) so that was a bummer, but still worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This went over great with my ten year old and 13 year old girls! They love doing nails and anything unique I can find to aid in their creativity is a must! These are too cute!!!!</li>
    <li> love them!  thanks!&lt;br /&gt;The butterflies are so cute! I am excited to use these.  I have lots of ideas already.</li>
    <li> They come in a little tiny wheel but well work the price I paid for them. I love using them and there are so many to choose from.I would buy them again!</li>
    <li> I really like the butterfly shapes and they are so easy to apply to your nails and they stay on for some time.</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
    <li> They are extremely nice</li>
    <li> super cute my girls love these on there nails</li>
