    <li> This bag is quite unattractive once you have it in your hand: malformed and with low quality stitching, mine came even dirty. I hoped to keep some cables organized in it but have returned it for a full refund. What a waste of time and nature resources!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: At the time I purchased this bag there was a different picture, and the trim was black, no handles, and no mesh material used on the inside; this one may be an updated product, hopefully better quality.</li>
    <li> Has a lot of sections and is easy to change to another purse; keeps things handy and organized.</li>
    <li> Cheap looking for the the price...looks like something you can get at the dollar store.. will not return because I don&#x27;t want to go through the hazzle....</li>
    <li> I can finally find things in my purse without digging for 10 minutes! This insert is a dream come true. I feel like I have my sanity back - it features a place for everything. Packs of tissues, iPhone, hand sanitizer, credit card case, shammy, etc, etc. I could not be happier. It also came very quickly! Definitely recommended! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> So easy to change purses and to find items when your handbag or tote is usually a black hole.  I think its the type of thing that would be a great item for all those huge handbag buyers and also makes a super stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> The bag is very small much smaller than it looks I wish it came in bigger sizes it would be perfect</li>
    <li> With my new purse organizer, I can finally see where everything is in my handbag. The clear pockets simplify locating my essential everyday items. I can use it for my medium and some larger sized purses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have to panic when I can&#x27;t find my phone or keys because they are so easy to visualize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few other purse organizers but this is by far the most functional, light weight insert I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already recommended them to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This product was at a good price and does as advertised, but appeared to be larger than recieved.  Wife still using it but could not hold wallett with other items</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for almost a year now and love it.  Once I admitted to having a purse fetish and have burned myself one too many times by leaving my wallet, keys, etc. in another bag, I realize that this is the way to go.  Heavy duty and durable clear pockets let you see everything, and switching bags is as simple as lifting out the insert and placing it another bag.  I try not to use the interior pockets of the purse itself or I find myself losing things again. Don&#x27;t ask me how long it took to find my husband&#x27;s spare car keys that he gave me to hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also handy when you contemplate buying another bag...just slip it out and make sure that all your stuff fits.  Nice sturdy design also helps floppy bags stand better.  I&#x27;ve tried other purse inserts but always find myself gravitating towards this one over and over again.  Now I can change bags every day if I want to without the hassle of transferring/losing contents.</li>
    <li> A little too small that how it appears but high quality.  Will not use it but give it a my young  nieces.</li>
    <li> yes I liked too much it is good items and I would ask my friend to buy this item&lt;br /&gt;thanks for that</li>
    <li> I have several purse organizers.  This one is my favorite, like that its clear and has slots for your pens, sunglasses etc...  I plan on purchasing another one as a gift for my Mom.</li>
    <li> Great Organizer! I just lift it out of one bag into another and I can see everything I have!</li>
    <li> Nice looking and roomy handbag organizer.  Looks sturdy and of good quality.  Everything fits neatly in one place. I would recommend this product to anyone that likes their purse to be organized.</li>
    <li> This organizer is the perfect fit for my medium sized, zipper-top purse.  Most everything fits in this unit leaving a little room on each side for tissues, glasses case and an option or two that doesn&#x27;t fit inside.  Watch dimensions when ordering.  I love the tidy fit but then I don&#x27;t carry many bigger items.</li>
    <li> I like this because there are so many compartments and it is easy to see where everything is. If you have difficulty keeping track of things in your purse, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> order the clear,way more user friendly</li>
    <li> Love it!  bought this for travel purposes and it fits deeply inside my bag with room to spare for my 13&#x27; inch notebook</li>
    <li> Love this organizer!!  Is great for a medium range purse.  With the handles I can pull out of the purse I&#x27;m using put into a different one and I&#x27;m ready to roll!!  Definite time saver and thinking about getting a second!!</li>
