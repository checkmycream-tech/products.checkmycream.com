<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good for your skin but I haven&#x27;t seen any changes.</li>
    <li> guess there is no magic here.</li>
    <li> My skin has sun spots and discoloration so I was happy to try this product and give my honest opinion. I put this product on my face and arms and my skin looked so much better after using it. I think that my face looked younger and more youthful. I think my skin is also softer, smoother and more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is paraben free, non comedogenic, and organic. It&#x27;s also fragrance free. I also like that it is made in the USA and not tested on animals. It&#x27;s 100% satisfaction guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;It think this is a really great product, I recommend it. I recommend this product. I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> So far I really like it, will post a month from now!</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my mum. It said that  &amp;#34;Diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, giving you a more youthful glow&amp;#34;, I still not see the effect. Maybe it will take long time to see it. But in fact I can see the moisturizing effect. I will update if I can see more effect. :)</li>
    <li> Nice price, nice product.  Does not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin felt after only two uses. It felt smoother and hydrated. Paying only for shipping and handling just to try this was an added bonus. Uberzone is awesome.</li>
    <li> Working great, my skin feels softer and firmer</li>
    <li> this is my first time having this serum vitamin c .arrives fast as we expected hoping for more review as soon as i test it to my self ,,i would highly recommend this as anti aging product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference, but I haven&#x27;t had for long; it is nice stuff. I am also only 37 that looks much younger also. I don&#x27;t smell it, but when I cry now, my eyes sting. I would buy it all the time if it was always a couple of bucks and use it on more areas of my body, especially my hands. I added my vitamin E today and I don&#x27;t really wear make-up anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this, it has made a huge difference in my complexion. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell difference, makes face feel dry.</li>
    <li> I love this!! Fine lines are beging to be less noticeable. I can&#x27;t believe how much softer my skin is!!!! ☆☆☆☆☆</li>
    <li> It feel so good. not sticky at all. My facial skin starts to get lighter already noticeable change. wow.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to try it. I strongly recommend to people to use this product. Smells a nice too.</li>
    <li> i like how this product goes on your face with out it feeling greasy&lt;br /&gt;yes it does help hide those wrinkles and helps to diminish&lt;br /&gt;in time along with those nasty crows feet&lt;br /&gt;a product well worth getting to try&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i received this product as a promotion&lt;br /&gt;in return for my review</li>
    <li> The best Vitamin C Serum I have ever used.  I mix it with a facial oil and use it morning and night!</li>
    <li> I love that this product is 72% organic.  It has a thin consistency so make sure you aim the pump down. Because of the thin consistency it sinks into your skin quickly and moisturizes really good since it contains hyaluronic acid. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and a little goes a long way!. I will check back in a few weeks to write the results i saw. What i said are my honest opinions on reviewing this product.</li>
    <li> I would like to know what the first ingredient includes, the &#x27;organic herbal infusion&#x27; - I think there should be more information on this; other than that I think the remaining ingredients are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;The serum definitely tightens my skin and makes it a tiny bit flushed pink for the first 5 minutes after applying. It absorbs quickly, dries and leaves no residue on the face, albeit a slight sheen. I use a moisturizer over it. I think that this product is beneficial to my skin and that it is tightening it and nourishing it. I don&#x27;t know about the positive long term results, as I haven&#x27;t been using it for more than a couple of weeks so far.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this as a promotional sample, in order to use it and leave my honest and objective review.</li>
    <li> This product works really well. One pump is all you need for your entire face. It brightens my skin and it feel really soft and hydrated after use. It is also not greasy it dries really fast. works well with my moisturizer and my make up goes on great after. Will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> good product , fast shipping</li>
    <li> I prefer the firming serum.  This seems to feel a bit oily and I already have oily skin.  Sinks in nicely and quickly.</li>
    <li> Feels ok going on, but rolls off my face no matter what kind of moisturizer I use.Horrible.</li>
    <li> This works great and smells amazing!!!  I have never tried organic skincare before, but after smelling and trying this, I will continue to when I can. I received the product with a discount and to provide a honest feedback in return</li>
    <li> Love the Vitamin C Serum!  3rd bottle ordered, great product!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  I have not seen a difference on my face from this product.</li>
    <li> I just love their products  the vitamin C is really nice no strong odor,soaks in to skin nicely ,just makes your skin feel better</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c I can see the results from using this line of creams. I have purchased other products from this line but I did receive this one to review.</li>
    <li> Though a little thinner than I thought it would be. I do like how it feels in my face.</li>
    <li> I love that I was able to try this product. it makes my face feel good and fresh. I will be buying more of this in the future</li>
    <li> Looking forward to receiving this product as I have read up on the significant benefits of vitamin c.&lt;br /&gt;I will give further details of this product after I&#x27;ve had a chance to see its benefits.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> L-Ascorbic Acid solutions are supposed to be more effective, but I can&#x27;t complain about this serum. Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and I was able to get it for a good discount using a coupon code. All in all, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I have noticed less blemishes appearing,  softer skin and just a overall healthier more youthful looking skin. I&#x27;m buying some as a gift y&#x27;all much deserving friend.</li>
    <li> Well i didnt like the smell i was disappointed about this product didnt see much difference in my skin..i got this product with a super discount and this isy honest opinion</li>
    <li> I tried this nice for my face</li>
    <li> Noticeable effects on my skin! Not oily at all. Just simply gives your face that pretty healthy glow like you work out or something :) I am very pleased with my purchase! This is my new brand.</li>
    <li> When I think of a serum I think of a thick oil which made me a little hesitant to purchase this item. Once I received and tested the product, I was pleasantly surprised. I have oily skin with dry spots in my T zone and this seems to help very well. I applied a little extra in my problematic areas and I see a huge difference. Looking forward to seeing the long term results.</li>
    <li> I received this Vitamin C Serum for review. It has almost no scent, is not oily, and dries instantly. It is too early to determine the effects.</li>
    <li> I have been living in Hawaii in the sun for most of my life. That being said, I definitely have skin damage. So when I was offered this Vitamin C Serum from Derma-nu for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week or so and my skin feels and looks great. I&#x27;ve been applying it in the morning and in the evening and it soaks into my skin very quickly which I really like cause I don&#x27;t have all the time to wait for it to dry. I didn&#x27;t really like the smell but it might just be me...lol, it isn&#x27;t bad, just not what I was thinking it would smell like.  Either way I definitely recommend this Organic Vitamin C Serum from Derma-nu for anyone who wants a great non greasy C Serum.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin C serum, my skin didn&#x27;t react badly,.the first day I&#x27;ve tried this, I thought It&#x27;s itchy like the other product that I&#x27;ve tried before.. but it&#x27;s not.. so I continued using it..my face is not dry now, and oil free. .this is good coz it has vitamin C.. it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.. Thanks for the great product and fast shipping! I will highly recommend this to my friends..</li>
    <li> Applying this serum is easy. It is silky smooth and does not leave a residue or sticky feel after putting it on. I am also using on my hands (age spots). I can already see a difference 24 hours later on my hands! My face and decollete may take longer as I have a lot of sun damage and pigment spots. No bad smell and no residual feeling on skin ... Love It!</li>
    <li> No changes in my face or neck</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Delightfully light, fast absorbing and not oily at all&amp;#34; says my 63yr. old Auntie. (was a gift) &amp;#34;My skin feels very happy but no effect on the wrinkles yet. She is sure it will just take some time. Seller was trustworthy, packaging is top notch. She loved the gift!</li>
    <li> I received a discount for a review of this item. Perfect for wearing under moisturizer and make up. Normally my skin gets a bit greasy and breaks out if I don&#x27;t put make up on, but this stuff kept my face feeling fresh and clean all day long without make up on. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s sort of a watery consistency which can make it easy to put too much in my hand. I definitely can see a slight improvement  after using this product for almost a week. Excited to see how it helps in the long term.</li>
    <li> I tried this serum after enjoying the benefits from all the other products in the line. It is lovely and the quality is as high as all the rest.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, not greasy feeling. No heavy smell with this lotion. Makes my skin feel softer after use.</li>
    <li> *DISCLAIMER* I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW. I have been using for about a week but have not yet seen a difference. It does absorb quickly which is nice and I also find it helps to quickly get rid of pimples which is great for my oily skin</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer it leaves my face smooth &amp; feel fresh when i woke up every morning. &amp; i got this for only $1.95 cheap price but it works really good on me, &amp; they ship it fast i received it in 1day. I would love to buy this again.</li>
