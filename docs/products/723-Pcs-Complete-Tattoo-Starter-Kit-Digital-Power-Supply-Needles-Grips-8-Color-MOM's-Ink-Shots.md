      <li>this is a good first buy.</li>
      <li>They look good as far as I can tell, but as I said, I purchased my own.</li>

      <li>I was so excited for this item, when I got it..the power supply wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Okay first off the kit was defective and caused a scar on my leg.second off they refused to refund me or send a replacement.they put the blame on my tattoo artist and made amazon foot the bill.so</li>
      <li>My son was really excited to get his package, we opened it and checked out all the pieces we got one sheet of transfer paper</li>
      <li>Other than that, this is a good kit!</li>
      <li>only good thing is the supplies you get with it , needles tips etc</li>
      <li>Some good basic equipment.</li>
      <li>The ink sucks and the guns aren&#x27;t the best quality but</li>
      <li>I dont really have many complaints.</li>
      <li>not bad for it being the holiday season.</li>
      <li>came quick in the mail.</li>
      <li>There was only one transfer paper so plan on ordering more when you purchase your kit!</li>
      <li>Not my gift but is working very well for beginner without being a cheap product.</li>
      <li>The only thing is the tattoo machine was on the cheap side I bought one better for my&lt;br /&gt;Liner and use the ones that came with for shader and hoped a travelling case came with it.</li>
      <li>well worth the money</li>
      <li>The skins are pretty cool though I probably won&#x27;t use them, I can give them to someone to use though which is pretty kick</li>
      <li>other then the cheapness of everything its a very good kit for a beginner especially if you know how to tune the machines and all that.</li>
      <li>The needles are good, but some look a little discolored</li>
      <li>Also, the set contains so much!</li>
      <li>definitely have to buy some more after one or two tattoos.</li>
      <li>Tear yourself up first</li>
      <li>other than that nice product.</li>
      <li>you can tell the machines are made of cheap metal and parts but with a little tuning i got the liner to make nice solid lines.</li>
      <li>if the ink is real moms ink</li>
      <li>The power supply has chrome rings for the input ports and well keep superglue ready.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter who wants to become a tattoo artist.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t really dealt with Mom&#x27;s yet</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>The guns are cheap chinese made and don&#x27;t hold a steady throw.</li>
      <li>Do not order this for long sessions or a more professional approach.</li>
      <li>Here are my concerns: The grommets are a little shabby, but they work fine!</li>
      <li>then it should be decent</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m unsure if this is normal)</li>
      <li>Trust this when i tell you the ink that comes in this kits for starters is junk and will not hold bold or color for long.</li>

      <li>Wow if there was a star lower than one they would get it!</li>
      <li>Its a good machine however the ink is low grade and no good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> 723 piece set and no instructions.  That is the reason I docked it a star.  It is an amazing kit for starting, but not having instructions was kind of upsetting (my sister-in-law got a different kit and it came with a start up DVD).  There was only one transfer paper so plan on ordering more when you purchase your kit!</li>
    <li> Well one of the machines wasn&#x27;t working at all. The second one was working. So When I was tattooing it stop working within 15 mins of tattooing. Was mad lost money because of it. Power supply works great. The tips are not stainless steel. Other then that the shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Was a very good starter kit. I recommend it for anybody starting out. I have done allot of tattoos with it. The ink sucks and the guns aren&#x27;t the best quality but well worth the money</li>
    <li> It a ok starter kit wasnt impressed with the watery ink and all the guns are not that great and they only give you 1 carbon paper sheet</li>
    <li> Awesome kit for someone starting out. came quick in the mail.Happy that i got it. needs instructions or just go to youtube like me...showed me everything</li>
    <li> Do not order this for long sessions or a more professional approach. The guns are cheap chinese made and don&#x27;t hold a steady throw. The foot petal well you better order a upgraded one before you try to use this kit. The power supply has chrome rings for the input ports and well keep superglue ready. The inks DO NOT USE THESE INKS, order a set of inks from either starbrite or karusumi. Trust this when i tell you the ink that comes in this kits for starters is junk and will not hold bold or color for long. The armature bar nipples are cheap and hacked all to h***. Build a starters kit with betters reviews or individual purchases. I personally only use the power supply to date. Have upgraded the tattoo machines because they have a lot of plastic parts, most of those parts should be brass. The coils are iffy and always overheating. Also, these machines cannot run below 9v. which is crazy because i run my machines between 6.5 and 7v&#x27;s These machines also do a bogging type of sound and lose power while throwing the ink which in turn gives you a inconsistent outline</li>
    <li> I was very happy with what I ordered and I started using it the same day I revived it  if you need a gun or just want a starter kit this is what you should order</li>
    <li> It was a ok kit it had the 723 pieces they advertise. The only thing is the tattoo machine was on the cheap side I bought one better for my&lt;br /&gt;Liner and use the ones that came with for shader and hoped a travelling case came with it.</li>
    <li> My son in law is a tattoo artist and this was his to get him started and it seems to be perfect, he loves it</li>
    <li> This was everything and more. Glad i ordered this product have had alot of people tell me it was a great deal. I have had no problem or issues with any of the products i recieved</li>
    <li> came with everything you need to get started. sorta.... the 2 tattoo machines are the same thing except with different frames, there is no specific liner or shader and teh practice skins suck, they take ink well but the extra ink stains the skin really badly. good for 65$.</li>
    <li> Not my gift but is working very well for beginner without being a cheap product. I would recommend this item to another beginner.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see.. On the positive side the machine and foot pedal are amazing. The ink shots are great to use with the practice skin, unfortunatly theres no way to close them so be prepared to go through it all at once well atless one color. Im a fan of mom&#x27;s ink I did lots of research before choosing it as an artist. I liked that it came with 50 needles. I dontike that I only got 2 pairs of gloves and one piece of carbon paper be prepaired to buy both. I dont really have many complaints. I like it, its a begginers kit. I don&#x27;t think ive fallen in love yet but hopefully when I do my review will be edited</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this item, when I got it..the power supply wouldn&#x27;t work. the guns were broken and I was unable to return this because they are very hard to get a hold of.</li>
    <li> This is a good kit my first tattoo kit and I luv it came yester day and I couldent put it down power foot pedel and guns work really good would have people buy if they are wanting a good cheap kit thanks</li>
    <li> My son was really excited to get his package, we opened it and checked out all the pieces we got one sheet of transfer paper the power box was awesome, I already have one like it. He tried using the markers to draw some art on his customer, thin side does not work thick side bareley shows up. The guns, tubes and tips are definitely not stainless steel. Tried adjusting the contact screw and the set screw broke off, yesterday, on the day we got it! The best part of the set is the power box and pedal. But overall the set was a disappointment!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s about all I can say about it. Its a good kit, comes with everything listed, end of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the shitty gloves that come with it. I tried to put a pair on yesterday and after 45 minutes of struggling (what can I say? We were all drinking and laughing about the gloves not going on!) I finally ripped the left hand glove. It was like the fingers were melted together so not even AIR could get in. For anyone buying this kit to set up for the first time, GET GOOD GLOVES BEFORE YOU USE THIS KIT! Don&#x27;t rely on the dinky ass gloves in the kit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for everything else, so far so good. If anything breaks down or malfunctions I&#x27;ll be updating this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good kit for beginners though. The skins are pretty cool though I probably won&#x27;t use them, I can give them to someone to use though which is pretty kick ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already a fan of Kuro Sumi ink so getting a little more wasn&#x27;t a bad deal. Haven&#x27;t really dealt with Mom&#x27;s yet but I&#x27;m going to try tonight on my victi..... uhh.... wife...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, this is a great kit SO FAR! More to come</li>
    <li> Some good basic equipment. It comes with MOMS ink and some presterilized needle/tube combos. The machines seem to run well.&lt;br /&gt;If you know nothing about Tattooing this is a good first buy. Just don&#x27;t go crazy and tattoo your friends. Tear yourself up first</li>
    <li> i ordered this on a monday and got it the following monday. not bad for it being the holiday season. you can tell the machines are made of cheap metal and parts but with a little tuning i got the liner to make nice solid lines. still working on tuning the shader. invest in some coils, springs, and contact screw if you are wanting to upgrade these machines. if the ink is real moms ink then it should be decent but you get very very little ink. definitely have to buy some more after one or two tattoos. steel tips grips and tubes seem a little cheaply made.  i would go with disposables anyways. other then the cheapness of everything its a very good kit for a beginner especially if you know how to tune the machines and all that.</li>
    <li> the ship was soon, the article was perfect condictions and the protection very well, I hope could buy something with this shop</li>
    <li> My husband Luvs it all that we were lookin for thank you for the product it works great the ink holds in great everything about is awesome.</li>
    <li> Let me first say, I&#x27;m not a professional, so these are my opinions only. The kit is a good starter. The machines I got work just fine, everything was as described. Here are my concerns: The grommets are a little shabby, but they work fine! The foot switch works even though it looked a little shady (there was some discoloring I noted) but I ran both machines to test them and had no problems. I also ran one machine for about 20 minutes using the  practice skin. The practice skins are very cheap and I would suggest buying from another source, but they are good to use just to get the feel of the machine and running it, etc... The needles are good, but some look a little discolored (I&#x27;m unsure if this is normal) however, there not discolored on the actual tips (nothing that touches the skin). I purchased my own inks (starbright) so I used the ink shots that came with the kit for practice. They look good as far as I can tell, but as I said, I purchased my own. Other than that, this is a good kit! If you want the basics I suggest getting this. I&#x27;ve purchased green soap and other key materials and I would suggest that you do the same.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who wants to become a tattoo artist. Only thing she said was that it had very little ink in the kit. I would recommend buying some extra ink because this only lasted a day or two.</li>
    <li> PERFECT SET FOR NEW TATTOOERS! Came quick, and the machine works well! I love it. I personally would recommend this to anyone starting out. Also, the set contains so much! You should buy a carrying case with it.</li>
    <li> This kit worked great for the first week then both not one but both my machines started losing power like there coils were going bad.</li>
    <li> Could have used more ink... other than that its been great. I still don&#x27;t know how to use my liner gun.</li>
    <li> The ink is old, bad machines weak springs on them good power supply tho.the gloves are cheap only good thing is the supplies you get with it , needles tips etc</li>
    <li> foot switch was junk. other than that nice product. would reccomend. good price. i would purchase agian in the future</li>
    <li> good starter kit and really gets the job done,and price was very good too.i would recommend this product 7 days out of the week,not everything 5 stars within the kit but it&#x27;s all good.buy different ink tho.</li>
    <li> This kit sucks.the machines didn&#x27;t work at all nd that&#x27;s the most important part! But everything else was alright&lt;br /&gt;Better off getting a different one or going nd getting what you want specifically</li>
    <li> This kit is completly worthless the only good thing is the power supply. The machines are garbage. The foot switch shorts out and don&#x27;t run the machines solid! The ink is garbage! The tips are definatly not real so plan on pumping some rust into someone!!</li>
    <li> Wow if there was a star lower than one they would get it! Okay first off the kit was defective and caused a scar on my leg.second off they refused to refund me or send a replacement.they put the blame on my tattoo artist and made amazon foot the bill.so not only am I out a tattoo kit. I also can&#x27;t afford to get another one because I am homebound and disabled. Then as if it couldn&#x27;t get any worse they tried having my amazon account closed! This is the worst company ever and should be shut down and removed from amazon completely.</li>
    <li> Its a good machine however the ink is low grade and no good. Had to redo alll my tattoos qith new ink</li>
