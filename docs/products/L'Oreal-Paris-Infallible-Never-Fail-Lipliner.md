      <li>Nice color.</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely and there is no aroma which I appreciate.  </li>
      <li>so I was thrilled when I found it online.</li>
      <li>Perfect color and perfect applications every time without having to sharpen and constantly lose the pencil because you&#x27;ve sharpened to far.  </li>
      <li>but, this one is even better.</li>
      <li>It gives a deeper richer color and it stays on for most of the day.</li>
      <li>Arrived safely for me, but this is disaster just waiting to happen.</li>

      <li>Every time I take the top off the pieces of the liner fall out.  </li>
      <li>I have not been able to find  it in the stores where I shop</li>

      <li>It glides on easily and lasts for hours.  </li>

      <li>Fortunately, I realized \\&quot;why not Amazon\\&quot; and sure enough!  </li>
      <li>Not even worth it.</li>
      <li>This is one lip liner that most women would want to keep around as it&#x27;s a basic for your look or make-up.</li>
      <li>I actually use this liner as an all over lipstick for light coverage that lasts.  </li>
      <li>The price is reasonable too.</li>
      <li>I really like this lip liner in &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>My upper lip isnt quite as full as I&#x27;d like and its got a couple scars from childhood that bother me.</li>
      <li>It pretty much stays put unless you are actually trying to really rub it off.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this lip pencil.</li>
      <li>and I just ordered five more because i never want to be without this little gem..</li>
      <li>Love the color and thickness of the pencil, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>nude shade is a close match to my natural lip color, so this shade works with almost any lip color I apply.  </li>

<li> nude shade is a close match to my natural lip color, so this shade works with almost any lip color I apply.  </li>
<li> I apply this liner all over my lips and then put the long lasting gloss on</li>
<li> It stays a long time until I eat something or unless I wipe it off.</li>
<li> My other lipliners last for months.</li>
<li> I bought from an Amazon partner and the product arrived loosely in one of those shipping bags instead of a box.  </li>
<li> It was dried out and broke during the second use.</li>
<li> It stops color run-off dead in its tracks, or tiny wrinkles as it were.  </li>
<li> No need for any other shade of liner...</li>
<li> this one seemed dry and so far the tip as broken a few times since I started using it.</li>
<li> Its hard to hide where your actual lip line ends when u use shimmery or glossy products on it.</li>
<li> I usually get these at a local Walmart or Target, but it&#x27;s usually a hit-or-miss with Walmart</li>
<li> The matte color covers flaws and makes it so you can line slightly over your lip line without detection.</li>
<li> I now have a permanent supply and don&#x27;t even have to pay tax, gas, or waste time fighting traffic just to get this.  </li>
<li> If you have scars or a thin upper lip,i believe shimmery products can highlight those flaws.</li>
<li> I usually wear nude</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t always use lip liner, but when I do, I usually use this.&lt;br</li>
<li> No more &amp;#34;bleeding&amp;#34; lipstick, ever!  </li>
<li> Target usually has them, but they are random also.  </li>
<li> Sadly I am very disappointed in these particular ones.</li>
<li> Very unhappy with it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> love it, used it for years. great response</li>
    <li> Love the color and thickness of the pencil, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> The nude shade seems to be a perfect shade of lip pencil for me.  This shade is sold out almost every time I go to the store, so I ordered four of them online.  Now, hopefully, I will never run out of the best shade of lip pencil that L&#x27;Oreal makes.</li>
    <li> This  lip liner is does what it says.  I don&#x27;t have problems with it feathering around my lips and it helps to keep my lipstick on for hours.  I apply this liner all over my lips and then put the long lasting gloss on and they make a great combo.</li>
    <li> Perfect color and perfect applications every time without having to sharpen and constantly lose the pencil because you&#x27;ve sharpened to far.  I highly recommend this lip pencil.</li>
    <li> Nice color. Easy to apply. Came in a huge box and no receipt-which is why the 4 star.</li>
    <li> The tip screws in and out with just a tiny tip that needs no sharpening.  There is a tiny sharpener at the bottom.  You will never need it.  I will buy another,  just a  tad darker than nude.  This is my favorite lip liner, ever.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Never leave home without it</li>
    <li> This product stays put, and has a great  colour.  Prevents lipstick bleed. Would purchase again in future when the present stick wears out.</li>
    <li> Good lipliner.  I love the nude one, adds color without looking all lipstick(y)</li>
    <li> I usually wear nude but, this one is even better. It gives a deeper richer color and it stays on for most of the day.</li>
    <li> It was dried out and broke during the second use.</li>
    <li> Great color for a nude lip.</li>
    <li> I have used Loreal infallible lipliner for years.  It glides on easily and lasts for hours.  I have not been able to find  it in the stores where I shop so I was thrilled when I found it online.</li>
    <li> I usually get these at a local Walmart or Target, but it&#x27;s usually a hit-or-miss with Walmart almost never carrying this one color.  Target usually has them, but they are random also.  Fortunately, I realized \\&quot;why not Amazon\\&quot; and sure enough!  I now have a permanent supply and don&#x27;t even have to pay tax, gas, or waste time fighting traffic just to get this.  Lastly, Amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save program ($5.77) isn&#x27;t any cheaper than just ordering from an Amazon partner ($5.25) at the time of this review.  I&#x27;m taking 1/2 star off as a warning to others on the packaging.  I bought from an Amazon partner and the product arrived loosely in one of those shipping bags instead of a box.  This could have bent or damaged the liner.  Arrived safely for me, but this is disaster just waiting to happen.</li>
    <li> This is an outrageously short lived product! I ordered it mid September and it is gone by mid Oct. My other lipliners last for months. This happened with the last two orders I placed for this product. Not even worth it.</li>
    <li> Infallible Lip Liner in the Nude shade is hands-down my go-to lip liner.  I don&#x27;t always use lip liner, but when I do, I usually use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nude shade is a close match to my natural lip color, so this shade works with almost any lip color I apply.  It stops color run-off dead in its tracks, or tiny wrinkles as it were.  And it lasts all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to try to have to match lip liner with every shade of lip color I use.  I&#x27;m not brand-loyal.  I try to match my lips, unless I&#x27;m using a very deep lip color.  I have about twenty lipsticks and glosses stashed in various places so I can choose from a lot of colors.  For me, this works with every one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do try it in Nude if you have fair to medium skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this liner and loved it but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I was so happy when I located it on Amazon.  I purchased them for my daughter and myself.  Sadly I am very disappointed in these particular ones. Every time I take the top off the pieces of the liner fall out.  I never had this problem before and I gave one to my daughter and hers does it as well.  Very unhappy with it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I actually use this liner as an all over lipstick for light coverage that lasts.  It stays a long time until I eat something or unless I wipe it off.</li>
    <li> Nude is my favorite of the Infallible Never Fail Lip liners. I bought one then ordered a second and I just ordered five more because i never want to be without this little gem.. The color is lovely and it really lasts! My upper lip isnt quite as full as I&#x27;d like and its got a couple scars from childhood that bother me. Lip liner is essential to me for a polished look and ive had a hard time finding the perfect fit. This stays put for hours. I dont like using shimmery lipsticks or liners and gloss because even though they say it makes your lips look fuller, i disagree. If you have scars or a thin upper lip,i believe shimmery products can highlight those flaws. Its hard to hide where your actual lip line ends when u use shimmery or glossy products on it. So i dont wear lipstick or gloss. I use the lip liner and blend strokes of it into my lips so i basically use it as a lipstick and liner. The matte color covers flaws and makes it so you can line slightly over your lip line without detection. Once youve perfected your pout, you dont have to worry that its been rubbed off from drinks or eating.It pretty much stays put unless you are actually trying to really rub it off. My lips look significantly fuller, more even and richer in color. I would suggest this lip liner for anyone. The price is reasonable too.</li>
    <li> Ordered the Nude, this product is great and doesn&#x27;t dry out the lips. Team with loreal color riche extraordinare in nude ballet</li>
    <li> I have used this liner before...this one seemed dry and so far the tip as broken a few times since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I really like this lip liner in &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34;.  It looks good with almost any lipstick and I even like wearing it all by itself (it&#x27;s just the same color as my lips so it makes them stand out if I don&#x27;t use lipstick).  Goes on nicely and there is no aroma which I appreciate.  This is one lip liner that most women would want to keep around as it&#x27;s a basic for your look or make-up.</li>
    <li> No need for any other shade of liner...this one blends with EVERY lipstick shade.  No more &amp;#34;bleeding&amp;#34; lipstick, ever!  Infallible is, well, infallible!</li>
