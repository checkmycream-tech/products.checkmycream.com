<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item was purchased for my mother. It arrived earlier than expected, which was nice. My mother was excited to receive it. I actually smelled it and it has a very pleasant smell. This is a fragrance that I would t mind wearing in a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I tested this scent among a slew of bottles.  Of many, DNKY Be Delicious Green Apple, Halle Berry...etc.  This one is not flowery and I must agree, a more masculine scent.  One website classified it as &#x27;leather and tobacco.&#x27;  It is not overpowering and is lasting 7 hours so far.  I dislike the standard flowery blends and tried many bestseller scents, only to turn my nose up.  This one is a keeper.  You either love it or hate it....a testament to its individualized reaction to each person&#x27;s skin. A recommendation is only that.  Testing on yourself may reveal surprising results.  It was the most unique smell from at 10 other sniff tests today.</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells so good on my wife, she loves it and wears it all the time. What a deal too on Amazon, I am now going to buy my perfume and cologne strickly from  Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> this was a bigger bottle &amp; cost less than i paid for a smaller one at a department store .super deal . my girlfriend loves this perfume &amp; i like the smell too .</li>
    <li> This was a surprise....as it is worn it&#x27;s notes change.  It is as intriging as the woman it is named after.  I cannot stand flowery, cloying fragrances, but this one is inticing.  I highly recommend it for the mature woman.</li>
    <li> I am an older woman and many of the scents I wore when I was younger do not compliment me anymore.  This one does -- I love it!</li>
    <li> A very nice, clean scent that I like.  The problem for me was that it smelled wonderful when I first put it on, but, the scent did not stay with me.  I would say that I was disappointed, and, will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really love this fragance!  It is light and people ask me what I have on. I have had several comments on it and I think that most people would love it.  I am a 68 year old retired woman and the scent is for just about any age.</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing this scent since 2012, I get compliments everywhere I go !  It dries down to a perfect sophisticated scent, for year round scent sexiness!  5+++++++++++!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances, not too strong and wears well on my wife.  Good price.  My bride was so-o-o pleased with the surprise gift.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It&#x27;s hard for me to find perfume that works well with my body chemistry. This one works beautifully. As well, I received this product when expected and in great shape:)</li>
    <li> i was not really a perfume lover but i do enjoy wearing this fragrance. i was wearing it and my boyfriend complimented me.everytime i wear shine i remember my boyfriend, it&#x27;s really a lovely fragrance.</li>
    <li> Usually I really like Armani Code, but I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t as \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; or \\&quot;musky\\&quot; for everyday use. I&#x27;m also particularly a fan of very floral, powdery, or fruity scents. This perfume is sexy but not too heavy and perfect for daily use! I love it!</li>
    <li> A gift to my daughter she loved it</li>
    <li> Perfume is my daughters favorite and I can no longer find it in stores.  It is a light scent that she loves</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for this perfume and could never find it, but thanks to Amazon I finally smell awesome again!!! I LOVE the smell of this perfume and will definitely be buying more when I run low on my new bottle 😁💕</li>
    <li> Tested this out locally and knew it was something I&#x27;d eventually like to have. Even with the $5.00 coupon I found (and didn&#x27;t need to use)...it was still $9.00 less for me to buy it right here. This scent is something that makes me feel happy when wearing it. Just what fragrances should do.</li>
    <li> What an awesome perfume at such an unbelievable price. I prefer this one to her newest, \\&quot;Surprise.\\&quot; It has great longevity and sillage, which is usually lacking in high brow brands and even other celebrity scents. I use it often enough and love it more every time; won&#x27;t be without in my collection.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and could not find it locally for the past couple of years.</li>
