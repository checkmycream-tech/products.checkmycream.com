      <li>My hair came out feeling much better on the first wash, after I stopped using the tea tree lavender concoction.</li>
      <li>I interchange with Paul Mitchell special tea tree conditioner.</li>
      <li>As a shopper online, you really appreciate when the sender takes extra care in making sure your item arrived in good condition like that.</li>
      <li>my hair felt super clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>As a hopeful customer, I read the reviews that seemed to sanctify this product, and make it seem worthy of it&#x27;s price.</li>
      <li>Love the smell  of this and it is great for my thin fine hair.</li>
      <li>really well leaving it easy to comb through  </li>
      <li>Leaves it fresh, shiny and super managable.</li>
      <li>This is the only conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used that works and also leaves an amazing scent behind.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>my hair felt a lot more silky and soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Next time I buy I will likely  get the shampoo  too because the scent is great.</li>
      <li>Pump spray could use more work- does not get to the bottom of the container when about 1-2&amp;#34; left.</li>
      <li>My favorite conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse hair, and this conditioner makes my hair feel very soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is the only complaint- makes hair more manageable, good fragrance too.</li>
      <li>Hair is healthy and appears thick, yet the reality is I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>Really, people at Paul Mitchell.</li>
      <li>It absolutely did nothing to my hair.</li>
      <li>I really like the scent.</li>
      <li>understand the complaints about the odor, but I don&#x27;t mind it too much.  </li>
      <li>Mitchell products chemically enhances my natural hair to look thick, full and healthy!</li>
      <li>Great smell, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Ladies and gentlemen we have a new #1 hair care product!  </li>
      <li>The money I paid for this, and a double set of it&#x27;s lotion came to a grand total of $35.</li>
      <li>The scent is exceptional; however, I have used a lot of conditioners in my life that are equally as moisturizing for a lot less money.  </li>
      <li>Next time take it home and use it yourself first!.</li>
      <li>This arrived packed very well -- saran wrapped as to prevent the pump from unexpected leaks.</li>
      <li>I have no complaint with the company I purchased from.</li>
      <li>Great for summer when the sweat from running and working  out dries out my hair and makes it hard to condition  with average products.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is fine, the scent is fine, but the push pump dispenser is ridiculous!!</li>
      <li>It leaves her hair soft and shiny as well.</li>
      <li>it makes my hair so soft</li>
      <li>Works good will be buying the bigger bottle I am new to this  expensive shampoo</li>
      <li>That was my first initial reaction, the second was after I used the product.</li>
      <li>After using this conditioner for the first time I threw out all other products.  </li>
      <li>We pump just a little into the ends in their wet hair and they sleep like a baby with the sweet scent of lavender!</li>
      <li>I used to not care what kind of shampoo and conditioner I had in the past, but after I moved to Georgia something happened to my hair and it always looked unclean and greasy soon as it dried.</li>

<li> Not really strong but enough that you can smell a hint of lavender.</li>
<li> However, anytime with Tea Tree products a little doesn&#x27;t really go a long way.</li>
<li> pump does give you about a half a tsp at a time which is kind of annoying</li>
<li> Wake up call, I received it, and on the first day noticed the weird scent.</li>
<li> I was skeptical when my hairstylists first tried it 3 years ago, being that I&#x27;m black</li>
<li> You would have to have very dry or damaged hair to use this conditioner everyday.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product is very good. Pump spray could use more work- does not get to the bottom of the container when about 1-2&amp;#34; left. That is the only complaint- makes hair more manageable, good fragrance too.</li>
    <li> The conditioner as well as the shampoo are VERY nice. However, the conditioner comes in a pump bottle that is unable to pump about 1/2 inch of the product once you are nearing the end. That&#x27;s just obnoxious.</li>
    <li> It is a great conditioner for what is supposed to do, but the scent is horrendous and cannot stand it. The mint smell isn&#x27;t there and the lavender is overpowering</li>
    <li> I used to not care what kind of shampoo and conditioner I had in the past, but after I moved to Georgia something happened to my hair and it always looked unclean and greasy soon as it dried. My hair dresser recommended Paul Mitchell to me and I noticed the drastic difference. My hair felt and looked awesome. It&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell  of this and it is great for my thin fine hair. Conditions  really well leaving it easy to comb through  but diesn&#x27;the leave it limp. Great for summer when the sweat from running and working  out dries out my hair and makes it hard to condition  with average products. Next time I buy I will likely  get the shampoo  too because the scent is great.</li>
    <li> Bought this and the shampoo for my daughter when a lice epidemic broke out at her school. We have used it regularly since and haven&#x27;t had one problem with lice even though she&#x27;s been around children that have had them. It leaves her hair soft and shiny as well.</li>
    <li> Not a great bang for the buck product, but it&#x27;s Paul Mitchell so that&#x27;s part of the deal. Great smell, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Did anyone at Paul Mitchell test this product and dispenser before putting it on the market? The conditioner is fine, the scent is fine, but the push pump dispenser is ridiculous!! Impossible to use with wet hands in the shower, add to that the slipperiness of the product itself, and you have a wonderful product spoiled by the container/dispenser design. Really, people at Paul Mitchell. Next time take it home and use it yourself first!. I won&#x27;t be buying it again, and cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used that works and also leaves an amazing scent behind.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this several times now, and adore it.&lt;br /&gt;When I go to give my friends a hug hello/goodbye, more often than not, I get &amp;#34;Your hair smells amazing! What do you use?!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing but love for this.</li>
    <li> Love tea tree - have used for many years</li>
    <li> I was returning some Matrix Biolage shampoo/conditioner that I&#x27;d read awesome reviews for. I spent a hefty sum and could not see any difference whatsoever in my hair. While in line I saw this stuff in a small sample size bottle and grabbed it as a what the heck type of purchase. Was excited to use it once I got home reading about the moisturizing aspect which my curly recently dyed/straightened hair in a dry climate desperately needs. I wish I&#x27;d found this earlier because with this, I COULD tell a difference. my hair felt a lot more silky and soft. Since I have fine hair I tend to stay away from anything over softening my hair because that makes it limp and difficult to style but this was like quenching my hair&#x27;s thirst after days without water. I am thinking of buying the shampoo but as others commented this can be used as a cleanser conditioner ala Wen. my hair felt super clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love tis conditioner its nice to be able to purchase it online with my busy schedule often it is very hard to get to the store when you work a lot!</li>
    <li> My friend bought this for her daughter....I ordered it for her and when it came in, the scent lured me in. Now we both use it on our daughters hair after a bath at bedtime. We pump just a little into the ends in their wet hair and they sleep like a baby with the sweet scent of lavender! Love this product!!</li>
    <li> Good service, would recommend. Paul mitchell is the best line for my hair.  Leaves it fresh, shiny and super managable.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but I find that it dries my scalp.  I don&#x27;t recommend it if you tend to have a dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Works good will be buying the bigger bottle I am new to this  expensive shampoo and I must say that I can tell the difference.. I usely just buy what ever but I decided to let my hair grow longer.. I currently wash my hair twice a week and use dry shampoo in between washes I read that is healthy.. but very happy with the results and will buy more</li>
    <li> Good product and smell delicious.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, I feel like I&#x27;m doing good things for my scalp, and I don&#x27;t need to shampoo as often. I have bought this twice, after my sister stole my first one!&lt;br /&gt;All shampoos and conditioners feel about the same to me, varying slightly on how slippery they feel wet or how well they spread, so I am always buying different ones. A repeat conditioner purchase is a big deal for me! Love it, special recommendation to my curly haired girls out there who don&#x27;t want to over shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The pump does give you about a half a tsp at a time which is kind of annoying but it doesn&#x27;t collect water, so no complaints here.</li>
    <li> i bought this with the shampoo and its a nice refreshing smell. i wouldnt use it every single day but its perfect for a change a couple times a week. very good moisture for long dry hair and great at detangling hair....this is a lifesaver for my daughter who has long thick hair</li>
    <li> Great product. Delivered on time. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Smells great. A nice mask for your follicles. Works well. I interchange with Paul Mitchell special tea tree conditioner. Hair is healthy and appears thick, yet the reality is I have fine hair. Mitchell products chemically enhances my natural hair to look thick, full and healthy! Love his line! note- I do not wash my hair everyday nor do I condition every time I wash my hair! You would have to have very dry or damaged hair to use this conditioner everyday.</li>
    <li> I have used Paul Mitchell hair spray for many years so thought I would give this a try.  It smells great but I prefer Nexus conditioner as it works better on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have no complaint with the company I purchased from. They sent everything in a nice, well cushioned package, and on time. Thank you for that. My complaint is the product. As a hopeful customer, I read the reviews that seemed to sanctify this product, and make it seem worthy of it&#x27;s price. Wake up call, I received it, and on the first day noticed the weird scent. It&#x27;s not good at all, it smells leafy. the lavender itself did not smell like lavender. That was my first initial reaction, the second was after I used the product. It absolutely did nothing to my hair. I came out of the shower feeling slimy. The money I paid for this, and a double set of it&#x27;s lotion came to a grand total of $35. What a waste. I went to the store and bought Pantene for $4. My hair came out feeling much better on the first wash, after I stopped using the tea tree lavender concoction. Think twice before you spend your money on this product. Everyone has different hair types and shampoos that work for them.</li>
    <li> the best conditioner in the world, smells awesome, makes hair silky soft, highly concentrated, i ordered a bigger bottle cause my boyfriend now likes it as well,</li>
    <li> I really like the scent. Not really strong but enough that you can smell a hint of lavender.</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse hair, and this conditioner makes my hair feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand the complaints about the odor, but I don&#x27;t mind it too much.  I actually dislike beauty products with overpowering scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My central quibble is that it comes in a pump.  I wish there was a better way to dispense the conditioner.  Like a squeeze bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner can be a bit pricey but I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> A wonderfully scented conditioner that really feels like it is doing all of the moisturizing that it claims in its name!  The scent is exceptional; however, I have used a lot of conditioners in my life that are equally as moisturizing for a lot less money.  This is a very good conditioner and if a great Lavender-Mint scent is one of the things you are looking for, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This arrived packed very well -- saran wrapped as to prevent the pump from unexpected leaks. As a shopper online, you really appreciate when the sender takes extra care in making sure your item arrived in good condition like that. I love the smell -- and tea tree is always a special treat. Paul Mitchell is a brand I know and trust.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, I love this stuff!  Not only does it smell great it makes my hair so soft I can&#x27;t stofp touching it.  Ladies and gentlemen we have a new #1 hair care product!  I have been a product junky for the past 4 years and thanks to Paul Mitchel&#x27;s Tea Tree Moisturizing Conditioner I&#x27;ve recovered.  After using this conditioner for the first time I threw out all other products.  Love it, love it, LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. It has a spa like smell that I enjoy.</li>
    <li> works great and smells fantastic</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as pleasant as I hoped, but the quality of the conditioning is fine.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Wonderful.</li>
    <li> My hair is the thickest of thick and its long. This is the only conditioner that keeps my hair moisturized and maintained. I was skeptical when my hairstylists first tried it 3 years ago, being that I&#x27;m black I thought it would do no good. But I&#x27;ve been using it every since. And I love it</li>
    <li> Really enjoy the smell! However, anytime with Tea Tree products a little doesn&#x27;t really go a long way.</li>
    <li> I tried the trial size of this product and loved it.  It leaves the hair feeling smooth and it smells great.</li>
