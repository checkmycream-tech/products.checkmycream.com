<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used! If you&#x27;re having dry lip problems this beats Burt&#x27;s Bees hands down.</li>
    <li> The best lip balm I have ever owned. I&#x27;m going to order other flavors as well.</li>
    <li> It is fine.  I was expecting miracle but it doesn&#x27;t quite meet that standard.</li>
    <li> Seriously better than Berts</li>
    <li> I truly love it! They even sent me an extra lip balm with a personalized message! It smells great and feels amazing on the lips!</li>
    <li> this is by FAR the very best chap stick i have EVER used. im one of those chap stick people who purchase a new and different kind every time im at the drug store, see a new one online or basically anywhere i go. i have never found one that actually works, most in fact make my lips feel worse then when i started. but no more. this chap stick is perfect. its VERY light weight and doesnt lick off. i usually dont even feel it once its on. AND it actually DOES heal my lips. i put it on before bed and my lips are soft and smooth in the morning. i came back and bought lots more so i have one everywhere (purse, office, home, pocket, bathroom, and back up for when i loose one......cause you always loose them. i plan on buying them as gifts for people i love so they can also have awesome lips. i will not be buying any other chap sticks ever. sorry drug stores, no more wasted money from me :)</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lip balm. I get chapped lips quite often and this Beessential has cleared them up so quickly. Love!!</li>
    <li> Absorbs great, don&#x27;t need to use as much as I would regular chapstick. Love that it is natural. I have been stocking up since.</li>
    <li> Tnx for great product!</li>
    <li> made my lips worse than before, trust me, anything, ANYTHING is better than this lip balm. I totally agree with a previous review that it&#x27;s same feeling like rubbing a candle over your lips, completely drying. I&#x27;d rather go with burst bees or simply carmex. Who rated it so high? Useless and waste of money, never again!!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm! Moisturizing, pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Beessential lip balm is convenient, effective, easy to use.  I found the lip balm a little thick, but otherwise wonderful.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing .. Not greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;Nature and safe&lt;br /&gt;This will be my only lip balm ever</li>
    <li> Stays on well, moisturizes.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm I have ever used and I had extremly dry lips.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend with severely chapped lips.  According to her, this is the best ever!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but I was expecting a lot more for the high ratings it got. Taste is ok. Aroma is nice.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell and goes on very smooth! I wish they sold it in stores.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it helps my lips, because nothing seems to, but the smell and texture are nice.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> who told you to put the balm o?</li>
    <li> This is horrible. I used it one time and both corners of my mouth split open. It took over a week tp repair them. Because I wanted to make sure it was this lip balm, I tried it again and the same thing happened.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Smells great - and I don&#x27;t even like lavender all that much.</li>
    <li> At the beginning of the year I had a bad cold and upper respiratory infection. My lips became very chapped as a result. I tried several lip balms but they didn&#x27;t seem to work. So I went on the internet to research lip balms and read that this lip balm rates #1. So I bought it and it works great and the flavor is nice. I&#x27;m going to purchase more to keep to have in case the need arises. I highly recomment this lip balm.</li>
    <li> Someone referred me to this product and I am a chapt stick and lavender fanatic. Let alone Coconut oil. this combined so many things I love and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
    <li> Its ok, but not anything special.</li>
    <li> These are awesome, my boyfriend keeps taking my Chapstick because he loves the smell. They smell amazing and feel great on your lips. win win!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Chapstick. I don&#x27;t have to apply it every ten minutes and it keeps my lips feeling refreshed. Also can smell the relaxing lavender smell from a few feet away. All around the best Chapstick I&#x27;ve had so far</li>
    <li> All of these products are of much better quality than most lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;All 3 provide better relief without a waxy feel.&lt;br /&gt;All 3 are not too runny not too hard and all three have a solid case with a top that stays on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for both the Lemon Lavender and the Peppermint.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I had seriously dry, chapped lips for about 6 months. I blamed the dry cold winter in Vegas, but when Spring started and my lips weren&#x27;t healing, I knew I needed more. I literally tried every brand you can think of, expensive, cheap and middle priced. Nothing was working, or even helping. I couldn&#x27;t even go 10 minutes without having to reapply. My lips were on fire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about this stuff online, and thought I would give it a shot. It arrived quickly in the mail and in great packaging to avoid damage. I immediately put some on and noticed the consistency was nice. It was thick, but not too thick. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, it&#x27;s more waxy, but in a good way. It has a nice smell and even tastes pleasant. I may have reapplied a few more times throughout the night (probably more so from habit), but when I work up the next morning there was a dramatic difference. My lips felt smoother and they weren&#x27;t burning. I used this stuff a few times throughout the day, but nothing like I was using before. By the second day my lips were 100%. No cracks, flakes and the best part, no burning. I now keep a tube of this stuff on me at all times. I only feel the need to apply it maybe 3 times per day, and my lips are in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy I found this stuff, it really saved my lips!!</li>
    <li> I read raving reviews about this chapstick and was very excited to try it but it honestly fell short for me. It was too... Pasty? Thick? Not really sure what word fits best. None the less however it had a great smell and did its job even though it was a little too waxy.</li>
    <li> They just made my lips even drier</li>
    <li> Love it. . Great company and this product cured my chapped lips by the second day!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels wonderful. I&#x27;m very impressed. I normally have very dry lips but this really does the trick. Shipped fast and even got a free soap sample and a handwritten thank you note on the invoice. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of the high reviews, but did not care for the product.  It makes my lips feel tacky, not moist.  It is terrible under lipstick.</li>
    <li> Hooray at last a product that really works.  Within a few days of using it the difference was remarkable.  Would recommend this product to anyone who is suffering from dry lips due to our cold winter.  Was delivered in less than a week, great service.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, just got it today. I bought it because I did a google search trying to find something that would rescue my dry lips, Blistex and Chapstick are a joke. But this stuff is really thick but it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy coat. It&#x27;s just SLIGHTLY better than Burts Bees, because it&#x27;s thinker, and is smells and tastes good so if you have to kiss someone they won&#x27;t get a gross taste. It is out of this world amazing and do my lips feel as soft as a babies bum? No. But my lips are about 90% better for using this, 100% would earn 5 stars. So it&#x27;s good stuff over all, also they sent me a free sample of their soap! I will buy this stuff again, my only gripe is that it isn&#x27;t sold in stores (that I am aware of), but still, it comes with 2 lip balms and it&#x27;s a good price. I bought a pack of 4. And when you apply this it&#x27;s not like you have to reapply every 10mins, I apply maybe 2 times a day it lasts so long, sometimes I&#x27;ll put it on more but just because I like the way it feels, not because my lips are actually drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is this stuff is really awesome, if you have dry cracked terrible lips and you&#x27;ve tried all the over the counter balms at the drugstore like I have then try this before you go trying the more expensive stuff, I almost spent $20 on some lip repair balm but i&#x27;m glad I tried this first. I respect this company for putting out a good product and not forcing people to break the bank to get it.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, keeps my lips from going dry and also my hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it in the wind.</li>
    <li> This is decent, not super soft on the lips but it&#x27;s okay. No issues here.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I will never use cheap lip balm brands again. They dry quickly and make my lips gummy and gross. Beessential stays on my lips ALL day with a single application. I live in the cold north and my lips always suffer terribly in the dry, cold weather. I&#x27;ve been using this less than a week, only once a day, and my lips have completely healed. I&#x27;m sure with another week, they will be soft again like in the warmer months. I will never buy any other lip balm or chapstick EVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> This smells and tastes great, and it works on keeping my lips from getting chapped with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Good taste.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! Stays on for a very long time and smells heavenly! Best lip balm I have used so far :)</li>
    <li> The lip balm smells good but the lip balm was hard to apply.</li>
    <li> After using every chapstick on the market, this was the only one that actually worked. It is also gentle enough to use on my little ones. I not only recommend it but will be purchasing this for life!</li>
    <li> One of the better lip balm that I have tried. Will definitely get more.</li>
    <li> The delivery was speedy.  I got three instead of bought two, thank for the generosity. :)  I have given to my daughter to apply for her chapped lip.  Still don&#x27;t know how will she takes to the lip balm.  So far, she said okay.  If it heals her chapped lip, I will definitely buy again and again.  :)</li>
    <li> I like the lemon lavender beeswax lip balm because it is very moisturising.  I often have difficulty getting a new lip balm because I have sensitive skin but I have no problems with this balm atall, I will defo buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fantastic! Hydrate and repair lip very quckly. it has a wonderful scent. It is absolutely not glossy and, so, may be used by us boys.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lip balm I have ever used! Way better than Burt&#x27;s Bees! It lasts a long time on your lips and makes them silky smooth. I also bought the peppermint and it works wonders too! They even sent me a sample of soap! Great product, great company! Buy this!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful lip balm.  Goes on smooth and smells nice.  My son also loves it.  Really does heal cracked lips.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> So far so good the scent is very nice btw I got the lemon lavender. The scent is so strong I keep smelling I throughout the day! I even got a free sample of the dead mud babe soap which I&#x27;m very excited to try can&#x27;t wait! Thank you guys so much! Oh an very fast shipping 😀</li>
    <li> Best Lip Balm ever. Thank you for the free lavander soap. It smell so good. One of my best purchases</li>
    <li> Keeps lips hydrated. Smells great. All natural.</li>
    <li> Love it! My 2yr old and I both use it. I keep one at her daycare for cold days on the playground. ♡</li>
    <li> The scents work perfectly together. The fragrance is very light and it is not at all sticky or waxy</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It is amazing. I just bought more to stock up. I am completely in love!!!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best Chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried about 20 different lip balms/chapstick, but these guy beats out all of the rest.  Actually, I&#x27;d say its about tied with Vaseline, but you can actually use this guy during the day.</li>
    <li> Great product and appreciate the seller providin a sample of their soap!</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST Lip Balm around. For someone who is on Accutane (a drug with side effects that includes badly dry/pealing skin) this keeps my lips soft and hydrated and it stays on for a reasonable amount of time unlike most lip balms. I thought it would have a strong scent, but the mix of Lemon/Lavender is lovely. It also arrived two days early, thanks Beecology.</li>
    <li> Worked like magic.  I had a split lip that I got in the winter, and I been trying for months to get it to heal. This worked in three days. I was reluctant to try a scented lip balm, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  It didn&#x27;t seem to me that the scent was all that strong, either.</li>
    <li> The ratings don&#x27;t lie. This is the best lip balm, period. It doesn&#x27;t feel like goop smeared on your lips like many lip balms, and it actually seems to treat chapped lips and not just protect perfect lips from becoming chapped (which most lip balms are only designed to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the seller is awesome - fast delivery and both times I&#x27;ve ordered, they&#x27;ve included a free soap sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a bunch and keep them everywhere,  because this is one lip balm you&#x27;ll be upset to lose.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Very smooth going on the lips and doesn&#x27;t leave any funky residue. My lips stay smooth and unchapped, even if I haven&#x27;t reapplied. The smell is awesome too  -- it&#x27;s definitely more lavender than lemon, but the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have tried every lip balm out there. This is my favorite!  Wonderful texture and smell. No mint which usually burns my chronically chapped lips.</li>
    <li> I have replaced the 5-6 lip balms I carry in my purse with just this one! Ordering other flavors soon!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great... Takes care of the chapped lips and smells really good.</li>
    <li> Packaging was great &amp; a little neat soap came along. I really love this lip balm. You can really tell it&#x27;s all natural. Leaves you lips feeling smooth, &amp; tastes great! There&#x27;s no tingling, no weird balm chucks. Anyone who wants to invest in lip balm, order these.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend who always had chapped lips, he said he really likes it and that it help moisturize his lips a lot more than vaseline or blistex.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Works instantly.</li>
    <li> This works better than traditional Chapstick.  I was hoping for something a little creamier, but it does help in the cold weather.</li>
    <li> Oh yeah! Love it! (Lemon&amp;Lavender) Smells so nice. It goes on smooth and actually moisturizes my lips. I am not slathering on different (and pricey brand) lip balms all day like I used to. Read reviews before I bought it and I don&#x27;t think its really waxy. If you like a slick and wet feeling then I guess I could see how someone would say that. But just use lipgloss then!! This is a great moisturizer for your lips. No weird taste like some I&#x27;ve had. I will be a loyal Beecology customer.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered super fast and works extremely well. Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use lip balm with chemicals but never seemed to find a natural lip balm that actually worked. I didn&#x27;t think they existed but decided to give this one a try &amp; purchased the lavender variety. WAY better than Burt&#x27;s Bees. :) I live in a very dry &amp; harsh climate &amp; now I can&#x27;t leave the house without this stuff, it even tastes delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was awesome &amp; even included a bonus lip balm in a different flavor, peppermint. Both are amazing. I will definitely buy this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Wish i could give 0 star review. This is the worst chapstick ever. Apply on my lip feel like i apply candle wax on it, also chapstick does break a little piece that i can easy see by naked eyes and each broken piece look like my lip has canker sore that i have to use lip brush to spread it fine on my lip. And it does not make my lip moist and soft at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally waste of money</li>
    <li> I did an online search on &amp;#34;best lip balms&amp;#34; and this one came up as #1.  I ordered the item and I am very happy with it.  I will continue to buy it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like Burt&#x27;s Bees famous lip balm, mainly because I don&#x27;t like mint in my lip balm. This lip balm has a similar, waxy consistency (good for staying on lips) but it&#x27;s scented with lavender and lemon. It smells wonderful on my lips. Very enjoyable. And being the more firm consistency rather than very creamy, it stays on in bad weather. Very protective. But it does have enough emollients not to feel dry on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include beeswax, which is an excellent skin protector. I have bought several beeswax lip balms this winter, and they were more expensive and not nearly as nice as this one. (Although my dog disagrees--she stole one and chewed it up enthusiastically and keeps looking for more lip balm in my purse.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some other flavors if you don&#x27;t favor lemon and lavender such as orange ginger and honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are really good-- Beeswax, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter (related to cocoa), Olive Oil, Lavender &amp; Lemon Oil, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Propolis Extract (beehive resin, a natural antiseptic), Natural Honey Flavor.  I&#x27;m sensitive to artificial fragrances and certain ingredients and I&#x27;m having no problem with this lipbalm. Item was supplied in exchange for review.</li>
    <li> Ok... Smelled yummy but didn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping</li>
    <li> I will never go back to any other lip balms. I heard this was the best kind out there, so I ordered it to see for myself. I have since gotten many of my friends and family to use it also. The smell alone beats the rest.</li>
    <li> I am a lip balm fanatic. I have like 6 maybe 7 in my purse. Lately I&#x27;ve been having a huge problem with chronic dry lips. IN THE SUMMER. Weird right? My lips would be so dry they&#x27;d split and crack in the corners. Nothing had helped. Not Mary Kay, Aquaphor, or EOS. I even tried the bath and body works rose salve and that just made it worse. I was getting desperate and the only relief I was getting was from Vaseline&#x27;s lip therapy. That is until I found this. THIS IS MY NEW HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT. I&#x27;ve only had it for a day and it&#x27;s absolutely changed my lips. It&#x27;s not sticky, and it goes on smooth and feels natural. It looks natural, which is what I like from my lip balms, if I wanted to wear gloss I&#x27;d wear gloss!! I&#x27;m madly in love with lavender so this lip balm is like heaven to me. I love the fact that it&#x27;s ALL natural, and made in the US. I will DEFINITELY be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have happy lips!  This stuff soothes and heals, and it smells divine!  While most flavored balms tend to make me want to like my lips, this does not, I guess because Lavender doesn&#x27;t smell like food. LOVE this balm!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a way to keep my lips moist.  They get really dry at night.  I bought this after all the great reviews but it&#x27;s pretty average.  I like it and I like the smell but there are other moisturizers which work better on my lips</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm because you don&#x27;t have to constantly apply it to your lips throughout the day. It&#x27;s effective as well and I enjoy the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> The only lip balm that can provide some relief to my oddly inflamed and burning lips (possibly an unknown allergic reaction to something?)! Even all types of chapstick and blistex would not help much. My lips now look very soft in appearance and feel much more comfortable than they usually do with this type of problem.  The seller also kindly sent two tubes of this lip balm - not just one :) Very happy with my order.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Moisturizing and tastes good too. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very waxy.. Honestly not sure if i like this or not.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of beeswax lipbalms, but the review on this caused me to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;This lip-balm is better than Burt&#x27;s but it still has the slight stickiness of beeswax after being applied.  It did not leave my lips feeling moisturized for very long.  The smell is lovely though.</li>
    <li> These lip balms smell amazing and make my lips so soft. I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite brand. These have all the fragrance of some of the best balms I&#x27;ve tried, but I like the wax used in these even more. I don&#x27;t know what it is, they just better. ChapStick has nothing on these. After using these Beessential balms, ChapStick is almost too soft and greasy feeling. These actually feel more natural, and less like your putting Crisco on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the thickness of the balm in these. They have staying-power. They make my lips (which were in desperate need of something because it&#x27;s the dead of winter and freezing cold here in Minnesota right now) feel great and they keep my lips coated longer. I&#x27;m completely in love with the orange/ginger one, but the lemon/lavender and honey versions are awesome too. I&#x27;m crazy for these, and I need them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> This product is great!! I saw it was rated #1 lip balm and thought I would try it and it really does moisturize your lips without that slimy feeling. I highly recommend others to try it</li>
    <li> I have dry lips that easily crack if I don&#x27;t constantly put anything on. Most of the products I buy at the store usually gave me mediocre results, but this one worked like magic for me (literally speaking immediate refreshness). Since I work with children I didn&#x27;t want anything too fancy (but still smelled nice). Thanks for the free soap sample too!!</li>
    <li> It works well but it does not work as well for my lips as I thought it was gonna work.</li>
    <li> Hey best lip balm everrr! Soothing and moisturizing, really did what it promised. I have really dried lips but got way better after using. Plus, fast shipping n they even gift me an extra one which is incredibleeee &amp;#60;3 highly recommend you guys</li>
    <li> I researched &amp;#34;best lip balms&amp;#34;  on the internet, and this one came top of most lists!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 tubes, which arrived very quickly, with a hand written note, inviting me to try their &amp;#34;orange and ginger&amp;#34; balm as well (and enclosing a tube of that one, free of charge)&lt;br /&gt;My readers; it works!!  I had been plagued by a series of cold-sores, which had left my lips desperately dry, peeling, and sore. Within a day they were feeling improved, and in a week? Well, you would never  have suspected I&#x27;d had any problems at all, my lips were smooth and full once more.&lt;br /&gt;I now use it on my cuticles also, and they have responded well too!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t praise it highly enough, and I shall re-order without hesitation!</li>
    <li> Prior to using this item I only used the over the counter chapstick that you buy from the check out line at the super market.  No matter how often I applied the generic chapstick my lips felt dry.  I used this product for a week and my lips no longer always feel dry.  They actually feel good.  My wife has also noticed a huge improvement in my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lemon taste does come out more than the lavender when kissing my wife, if you have any problems with lemon taste you may not want this product.</li>
    <li> I received a bar of something, maybe the lip balm but it did not come as shown- in a tube.</li>
    <li> i own at least a dozen chapsticks and i make sure to have this one with me, even if i have several others in my bag. it smells wonderful and it&#x27;s not goopy or gross. even when it gets warm it doesn&#x27;t become extremely soft and unusable like other chapsticks</li>
    <li> I got this name from a &amp;#34;best lip balm ever&amp;#34; google search, and this didn&#x27;t disappoint. I love it, and now it goes everywhere with me! Great texture and scent.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is thicker than most - not as smooth, but it keeps my lips from cracking, so it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job. Scent is nice - not over-powering.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because on msn they voted this lipbalm as the #1 fav lipbalm .. im sorry I very much disagree I dont ever rate my transactions but this lipbalm is the worst its like having glue on your lips and the smell is nauseating. . Burts bees is far a much better product and cheaper too..</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with coated waxy feeling left on lips by this</li>
    <li> I have been using Chap Stick brand and Lysine lip balm for an eternity. I have changed completely over to the Beessential Lip Balms. At first when using them you will notice this is not a moisturizer. It really just lets your natural lip moisture do its job while sealing in what&#x27;s left. This balm is effective at protecting your lips for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Protects&lt;br /&gt;2) Tastes good&lt;br /&gt;3) When it wears off I don&#x27;t need more.&lt;br /&gt;4) No lip addiction&lt;br /&gt;5) Does not melt in the car!!&lt;br /&gt;6) Lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Does not feel like what I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;2) Flavor is subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;I literally stopped all other lip products after giving this a real try. Does not melt or make any kind of mess! Very good to excellent. Now I realize the petroleum and paraffin products dry out my lips and need reapplication. This does not.</li>
    <li> I am always on the hunt for the perfect product, and so far, this is my favorite.  I like the consistency of the lip balm, it has a firm texture which makes it easy to put the correct amount on, and it stays there a while.  I also LOVE the fresh flavor and it keeps my lips super soft!  I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm!  Combo of lemon/lavender is brilliant and whatever is in this, the effects on my lips are amazing.  Highest recommendations.  Could never go back to waxy lip balms.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the amazing reviews and being addicted to chapstick myself I thought I would give it a try, but my lips are probably more dry now then when I was using another chapstick</li>
    <li> My lips get so dry and this lip balm has really helped. I put it on a night and my lips are soft the next morning. It smells very good and I am glad it is natural.</li>
    <li> Keeps my lips moist and smells absolutely delightful.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm! I was looking for an alternative to Burt&#x27;s bees and found this one. So glad I did. This is fabulous!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. I bought the honey flavor and it&#x27;s a subtle but nice one. It repairs my extremely wind chapped lips much better than burts bees or any other balm for that matter! This is definitely the only brand I will use from now on and plan to try all the flavors. I do however wish the peppermint was a Beesential item that contained vitamin E but the other flavors are more than amazing.</li>
    <li> It was rated number 1 lip balm in one fashion website, I would like to try it. Bought three, shared with my friends, we all love it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works extremely well. Also ordered some Burt&#x27;s Bees and I have been comparing the two, and this one works better. The order also came with a free sample of some natural honey and oat soap, which I thought was very thoughtful as well. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Works great...not greasy....stays on for a long time.  Does the job!!!!  Even sent me an extra when I ordered 5!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I just got it yesterday and started using it immediately I can already feel and see a major difference. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> Its an average lip balm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Burt&#x27;s Bees. But this stuff is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST lip balm I have ever used! I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 months now, and it still works perfectly! It feels great, and has a very faint sent/taste, which I love. I would recommend this to anybody! It&#x27;s an amazing product</li>
    <li> Love the flavor.  Not so much a fan of the texture.  It doesn&#x27;t glide on as smooth as I&#x27;d prefer.  Kind of tacky.</li>
    <li> BEST lip balm ever! I&#x27;ve searched many other brands in all price ranges. I&#x27;m never using anything else!</li>
    <li> The best lip salve I&#x27;ve ever had! Smells delicious and melts into your lips. Makes your lips look great! Excellent!</li>
    <li> I had very chapped lips and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked until I found this product, fixed me right up!</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY lip balm that works for my little girl&#x27;s horribly chapped lips WITHOUT stinging.  This is stuff for sure.</li>
    <li> It actually heals chaped lips fasted than any other I have tried</li>
    <li> It smells like lemons &amp; made my lips super smooth in just 1 day after having chapped nasty lips for over 2 weeks. Definitely better than that eos crap. It also came with a cute little body wash which is nice :)</li>
    <li> Balm stick is a bit hard and doesn&#x27;t apply well. Too waxy for cold weather, applies ok in warm. The beeswax smell is strong, which I personally find a bit off-putting but not totally objectionable. Would prefer a stronger scent of lemon/lavender.</li>
    <li> Brilliant product, high quality, very moisturising and smells amazing. Also fast delivery.</li>
    <li> works good - like the lemon but a little different with the lavender (for me)</li>
    <li> Upon putting it on, it immediately reminded me of the original Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax lip balm because of it&#x27;s waxy texture. You know how with regular lip balm you know when you&#x27;re over-applying? Well, that doesn&#x27;t happen with this lip balm because of the bees wax. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not on your lips. When you rub your lips together it won&#x27;t be silky smooth, but you&#x27;ll feel the balm. It smells lovely and tastes good, too! It gives your lips a matte finish, not shiny. HOWEVER, this lip balm does a great job at healing lips. Other lip balms may keep your lips looking moist, but once it wears off your lips want more. My lips ABSORB this lip balm and leaves my lips soft and feeling brand new. The wax also helps it last longer on my lips. Even though I wish the texture was less waxier and more emollient, it still does a great job at keeping my lips soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm also came with a hand-written thank-you note and a sample of soap. I thought this was so cute and nice of the sellers! It shows that they are serious about their business. Even though I don&#x27;t like the texture and appearance on my lips like other balms I own, I LOVE what it DOES to my lips. If you are looking for lip balm that heals, this is a great choice! My lips haven&#x27;t felt dry since I started using it. Five stars for a well-made product and lovely business!</li>
    <li> It works and smells nice too!  How much can you say about a lip balm?  It was a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It goes on well, not sticky and no bad taste.  Makes my lips look fuller, plump and soft after using the lip balm. I&#x27;ve tried other lip balms but they still made my lips feel and look like dried up cracked concrete. I love that it stays on my lips for a long time and it is all natural and good for my lips.  Will be purchasing more in the future. I also received a nice little gift of Beecology hand &amp; body cream with my package.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you and God bless you,&lt;br /&gt;Iris</li>
    <li> I tried this based on its high rating on a review site. It has good ingredients, a pleasant smell, and as far as I can tell my lips have been softer since using it.&lt;br /&gt;Normally would simply give it a four star review, but the package of lip balm came with a sample of tea tree oil soap and a hand written thank you note. Off something ordered from amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product with a personal thank you deserves five stars in my book.</li>
    <li> I received it yesterday and I can say with just one use, I&#x27;m totally hooked!!! As soon as I opened it, I used it right away. I applied it at night and the next day my lips were so soft (OMG!!). I also put it to the test, I didn&#x27;t apply the balm all day today then when I was about to wash my face I checked my lips and they were still as soft as I woke up this morning!! Starting from now, this is my Holy Grail. LOL I&#x27;ve been in the market for the right balm for my chapped lips and with this I can definitely say its a keeper and a must have for those who have very chapped lips like mine.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with extremely dry, chapped lips in the winter and sometimes in the spring. My lips will get really dry with red vertical lines all over my lips and they tend to burn and itch really bad. Started researching what lip products help with issue, and this one was one of them listed. I decided to try it and fell in love with it, and now its a part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever. Seriously if you wanna buy a lip balm thats gonna do something good for your lips buy this one cause everything else I tried was crap and I did try a lot of other brands. This makes my lips smooth and protects them during the cold days plus I love the lemony smell of it.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells nice. Very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Outstanding vendor and outstanding product!</li>
    <li> I know it sounds weird but I have warn this for a few days now and when I first started wearing it my lips actually chapped ...you can feel it on but its much dryer feeling and I was constantly rubbing my lips together just to make sure it was still on I really like it but I don&#x27;t love it because it too just sit on top of my lips and don&#x27;t sink it but it does last longer and I love it leaves a matte finish...the other balm I&#x27;ve used for yrs is also all natural so still not sure it ....</li>
    <li> Nice, light and love the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great lip balm with a good flavor, what more do you need to know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(this is just for Amazon&#x27;s minimum word requirement)</li>
    <li> Very effective lip balm in my opinion-- not your everyday lipbalm. It DOES NOT come off easily, even after I eat, which is good. It does feel kind of hard/waxy as opposed to gliding smooth. But it does its job by repairing your chapped lips. The reasons why I won&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because I expected more of a lavender scent, but the lemon scent was a lot stronger. Also, it can leave the inner part of your lips feeling too rough/waxy after application. I also experienced that my lips were \\&quot;wet-peeling\\&quot; because it made my lips a little too malleable/soft to the point that it was peeling over and over like a vicious cycle. However, this lip balm probably will repair your lips quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  This was my first tube, and I am very satisfied.  Very healing; no waxy sticky residue at all.  Scent/flavor also quite mild, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> We love it! It gives my lips instant moisture:) I even got another lip gloss free. Thank you Beecology!</li>
    <li> My entire family uses this product. And one is always in my pants pocket; and car.</li>
    <li> The tartness of the lemon scares me when I put this stuff on my lips. It doesn&#x27;t hurt but for my seriously sensitiv lips, the moisture doesn&#x27;t last very long. I did love the included soap which was sent with this purchase. I will probably try out other products from this line for that fact alone. It was very thoughtful and considerate to send a little sample with this order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to think of myself as a lip balm connoisseur and I&#x27;ve definitely tried my fair share of products to make my lips soft and moisturized. I still hadn&#x27;t found that holy grail product to grant me my wishes, so I searched google &amp;#34;best lip balms&amp;#34; and came across an article that rated this as #1. I immediately went onto amazon and bought a bundle. I&#x27;ll give you a synopsis of why this is my favorite so far (I plan on trying all the other beessential lip products soon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t give that fake-super-smooth-oily payoff once you apply it (you all know what I&#x27;m talking about. That rotten looking glossy feel.) It&#x27;s thick, SUPER moisturizing, buttery, and expensive feeling. Your lips really absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;m a Lip Licker Addict and should go to meetings to get help for it. No but seriously, I lick my lips to the point of it annoying people. I think it&#x27;s a tick, I&#x27;m not sure. But if I have any other lip balm on my lips other than this one, with one lick the balm will be GONE. Not with this! It stays put! MY DREAM COME TRUE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The ingredients. I mean take a look at them for yourself. Bees wax, coconut oil, shea butter, olive oil, lavender and lemon oil (hence the name, duh.) I took a look at my old lip products (that have now been tossed in the bin) and couldn&#x27;t believe the ingredient list... take a look at them for yourselves. I couldn&#x27;t even pronounce half of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s dirt cheap for an amazing product. Just buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It smells SO good. I haven&#x27;t met a person who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of it. The lavender scent is soothing, yet the lemon is refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I think God made this product and I feel like I should shine some light on this heavenly, righteous lip balm. Just kidding, the bees helped make this. THANKS BEES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have I convinced you to buy this product yet?</li>
    <li> For me, this lip balm lasts for about 2 hrs or less. It&#x27;s good for on the go, and moisturizes fairly fast when applied. However, this lip balm leaves me desiring something a little more lasting, because I work very long days, and often in harsh environments.</li>
    <li> My lips are one of the most sensitive places on my body. My lips get dry and chapped when the weather changes and if your in Los Angeles Ca, you know the weather has been crazy lately. Well from the reviews I read I thought this item would be a good to use and would help. Sadly to say I was wrong, it actually did nothing different but give me a head ache from the smell. I mean it&#x27;s not an ugly smell but it was just too much for me! Not happy with this product!</li>
    <li> It has a great lavender smell, but doesn&#x27;t help with dry lips. I was hoping it would go on smooth and make my lips soft but that wasn&#x27;t the case. It has a firm waxy feel, like it needs to be melted down. I think it would work better if there was less beeswax and more coconut oil. They did send me a sample of their oatmeal soap which I thought was really sweet, haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> This balm is nice. It&#x27;a a little feminine smelling, but it&#x27;s a pleasant smell and taste nonetheless.  It goes on a little waxy, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my lips dried out hours later like many other balms do.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and makes my lip soft last long. Love it</li>
    <li> I read an article about the top chapsticks. This was listed as either #1 or #2 I think. So I found it and ordered it and I am super happy with this product. It has just the right amount of natural moisture. The seller was so nice to send me a little handsoap in the same scent to go with it. I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Wonderful price</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm so much and am so happy to have found it!  The ingredients are all natural and the company&#x27;s mission is so great to support!  I had to do an exchange for something and I cannot tell you how amazingly well I was treated.  I feel like I&#x27;ve been doing business with these guys forever!  I think their customer service and care is what is missing in many businesses today.  I will shop with Beecology in the future for any products they can supply me with.  Also, the poor review on the page talks about using Vaseline for lips....petroleum jelly.....ok so what happens when you use petroleum is your lips become completely devoid of any natural oils and become dependent on the jelly.  When you stop using it the lips will become dry and have to go through an adjustment process....Beecology is the best to use to nourish your lips through anything like this.  Petroleum jelly is one of the most damaging products to use for skin or at all really...just wanted to offer some clarification....had to after discovering such an amazing product!  You guys ROCK!!!!!  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of reviews I saw elsewhere and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s soothing and smells awesome as well.</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this chapstick! The shipping was really fast! The smell is pleasant like honey however, after you apply it the chap-stick feels really cakey on my lips. My lips are very chapped (which is the reason i was looking for a good product) but it didn&#x27;t seem to heel my lips. Maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be as good as it is. When I first put it on, it had sort of a waxy feel to it but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant. It was just odd. It smells lemon-y and it&#x27;s only noticeable when you first apply the chapstick. It feels really good on the lips and it&#x27;s not sticky at all. For the price you&#x27;re getting for it, I would say this is one of the best chapsticks I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m used to using Laura Mercier&#x27;s chapstick but didn&#x27;t want to consistently spend the money on it but this is a really nice alternative. My lips feel really soft and aren&#x27;t as dry anymore.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever.  Really moisturizes.  No chemical smell or taste.  Delicious scents.  Affordable.  Good service from vendor.</li>
    <li> Best ever.... Lips are smooth and soft... Great when kissing and giving oral pleasures to your lady! She will love the way your lips feel!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girl because she has really dry lips and it has helped a lot ... Plus she loves the smell!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful product. Nourishing, hydrating, protecting, and with a lovely natural taste and scent from essential oils and honey. So far, I can only find these on Amazon. Please carry them here forever!</li>
    <li> Great lip balm at a great price definitely buy this product again,  Smells lovely and leaves lips feeling silly soft.</li>
    <li> I found it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and temporary / surface level. I used EOS before this and reverted back to EOS as it felt more natural, softer and longer lasting. I feel like EOS gets into the surface of the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have big lips that tend to get dry very easily, especially during the winter time and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a lip balm that works with my lips... But I think now I have!&lt;br /&gt;The smell will take a little to get used to, but overall... it&#x27;s AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. The company also sent a small bar of there soap. The only problem I had with the lip balm was that it felt to thick at times and it left an odd texture on my lips after a while. But overall I didn&#x27;t have to keep applying constantly like I usually have to do with other lip products. I really like the company and will order from them again.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is great. I love the smell and the way it feels on my lips. Was shipped and delivered very promptly. Also, came with a small sample of tea tree oil soap inside, which I also loved. Will definitely buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I read a good review of this on a site that was recommending good lip balms, and it totally lives up! It smells amazing, but has no taste so I&#x27;m not tempted to lick it off, and it stays put doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is wonderful.  It&#x27;s refreshing and the combination of lemon and lavender is much nicer than I expected.  The balm never dries out my lips and I seem to need less (not more!) of it as I use it.  Perfection!</li>
    <li> Smells good, tastes good. Works great for moisturizing lips. Never using chapstick again.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! Been using it for a few weeks now and my lips look and feel so much better. I will say that the scent took some getting used to. It&#x27;s kinda like a cleaner I&#x27;ve used before, but nothing too bad.</li>
    <li> great taste and not sticky, who knew lemon and lavender would make such a great combo?&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again</li>
    <li> Finally, a chap stick that works!</li>
    <li> too waxy and drying for my lips</li>
    <li> This lip balm is the best! So rich and creamy, and it makes my lips soft right away.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes your lips feel</li>
    <li> I saw on a website of like 14 different lip care products (total beauty something) that this one was number one. And it does help my lips feel healthier and the smell is pretty alright. I hoped it would feel like it stays on longer, but overall, I don&#x27;t hate it. I just had higher hopes than it&#x27;s living up to. I did get it quickly though and with a short, little, handwritten note on the receipt as well as a free piece of natural soap to sample. So the customer service was great, I just only kind of like the product. I&#x27;m very picky about lip products though.</li>
    <li> If it were just a matter of the scent,I would give this lip balm five stars.&lt;br /&gt;But as that&#x27;s not the main concern with lip softeners, I have to take it&lt;br /&gt;down a couple of pegs.&lt;br /&gt;The application certainly goes on more smoothly than a Chapstick or most&lt;br /&gt;of the Blistex brands (unless it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Silk &amp; Shine&amp;#34;), but it&#x27;s not as creamy as&lt;br /&gt;cocoa butter, nor does it leave a gentle gloss that I came to rely on when&lt;br /&gt;using cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Beessential&amp;#34; is a nice product that tends to give lips a decent protection&lt;br /&gt;against dryness, but it also tends to give them a matte finish.</li>
    <li> I bought this lip balm because of the raving reviews. It smells amazing and leaves my lips moisturized and has a very relaxing scent to it. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> they work great i can still feel my lips moist after 4-5 hours of having apply it, it has a really good smell but if it get inside your mouth its like a lemon tea not so good but its still a great lip balm</li>
    <li> The best product ever!!</li>
    <li> Nice scent, but I guess this is more for extreme conditions and very dry lips, because it&#x27;s very waxy feeling on my lips.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant and I go through a lot of lip balms. This by far is the best I have used!!! I adore the smell and taste and will be a loyal purchaser from now on! Thank you for the tested of your lavender honey soap. I will be ordering that next.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My lower lip gets extremely chapped to the point of having a huge crack in the middle that&#x27;s painful. I use this just once a day and it keeps my lips in perfect shape for the rest of the day. I think even the next day in the morning I can still feel that it&#x27;s still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor and scent is also fantastic. It&#x27;s really interesting when you first start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of good healthy ingredients instead of the chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce on a lot of the other chapsticks so I&#x27;m not worried about what&#x27;s in it.</li>
    <li> Nice feel on lips and come with free sample lotion.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is honestly the best I&#x27;ve tried.    I&#x27;ve always been a bit addicted to lip balms of all kinds. I finally got tired of the fact that if I forgot my lip balm at home, I&#x27;d inevitably end up with chapped lips that at times became almost painfully dry within just a few hours. I knew that companies like Chapstick actually have ingredients that strip moisture from your lips to increase demand for their products, but hadn&#x27;t realized how much damage that had really done. After a little research, I found out about this wonderful company, Beecology, and their Beessential Lip Balm, and ever since trying their products, I haven&#x27;t even thought about buying anything other than their lip balms. These products are the REAL DEAL. After I started using their lip balm, my lips improved dramatically. Within a week or two, I could go a full day without lip balm without having any dryness problems. That may not seem like much to some, but for me, it was a major relief.    If I have my way, I&#x27;ll be using Beecology&#x27;s Beessential lip balms exclusively for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Pleasent scent , and feels good on my lips. Arrived early and with a , thank you letter , and a courtesy sample of their bar soap. How cool is that?!</li>
    <li> Love love love this Chapstick!! When nothing else worked for my chapped, this product did in two days! I have super sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t irritate me at all! I highly recommend this product and this company is great!</li>
    <li> Just average for me. Very dry lips and this doesn&#x27;t keep lips moist enough for me. Kept having to reapply a lot.</li>
    <li> this is a good product.  I would enjoy using it more if it were creamier.  Easier to apply</li>
    <li> i think this is the best chapstick i ever bought.It keeps my lips moisturized all day. My go to chapstick thanks.</li>
    <li> Beessential&#x27;s lip balm is a Burt&#x27;s Bees equivalent. I absolutely love the idea of using all-natural ingredients, as my lips are chronically chapped and I didn&#x27;t want to use anything NOT natural on them if I&#x27;m going to be applying quite often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this is to die for! The lemon and lavender work so well together, and I&#x27;m very pleased with that. They leave my lips feeling extremely soft, the only downside being that I do have to re-apply it pretty often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in great support of companies like this, and you should be, too!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Not only does it smell &amp; taste great, but it works....best lip balm ever.  I use it every day.  I will definitely continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> The product smells great but it works decently on my very chapped lips. I bought it out of the recommendation of an article I saw online but I don&#x27;t regret buying it at all :)</li>
    <li> I love it and I will order more again really soon. This is the best Lib Balm in the market.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, Love it, love it.  It is a great product that smells refreshing and calming.  It works great, too.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this company until I stumbled across a magazine article which rated this balm as number 1. I liked that it is all natural, so I decided to buy all four flavors. It was a bit of a gamble, but it paid off. I love this lip balm. My lips always have been dry, but this balm really moisturizes them like nothing else. And I have tried many others. The first application or so is stiff and unyielding, but then it&#x27;s smooth. I love the lemon flavor - it reminds me of lemon hard candy. I also love the orange flavor - it reminds me of orange tea. The peppermint is good too, but the plain honey flavor is too subtle for me.</li>
    <li> works fine. is great in maintaining lip moisture and doesnt require constant application like the other products which i like a lot</li>
    <li> They smell great and they soften my lips... I am happy with them... Great price too for a natural product... Will buy again.... They added a sample of their soap too and i love it... I&#x27;ll be ordering some and the shipping was extremely fast.... No complaints at all...</li>
    <li> My big, manly lips are so soft now. So good.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Healed my dry lips in 24 hours.  I have tried everything on the market and I mean everything! This works.  In the past, I could not be more then 5 feet away from my lip balm and had to reapply constantly.  Not anymore.  I use this at night before bed and in the morning under my gloss and I am good to go.  Try this.  You will love it, cause it works.</li>
    <li> I just wish this was available in a local store!</li>
    <li> This is the most effective lip balm I have used so far, including Burt&#x27;s Bees, which I found was more than a lip coating an anything. This balm leaves no waxy feeling on the lips and begins treating your skin immediately. The first thing I noticed after having applied this balm is that the little dry fragments of my chapped, broken skin have been so rehydrated to the point (after 30 minutes or so) that the little pieces almost want to fall off my lips. Unlike Carmex, however, this balm won&#x27;t feel harsh on your skin. The scent is a wonderful combination. Although it does contain lavender, I don&#x27;t think you should let his deter you if you&#x27;re a man. The scent I notice is a light natural lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I&#x27;m not a natural/organic product person or connoisseur, but I absolutely love this product. I wish it was carried in retail stores.</li>
    <li> A lower than average lip balm which did nothing to soften my lips, needed constant reapplication, and was sticky in texture. The fragrance/taste was nice at first then became sickly. This product had been getting rave reviews and I feel a sucker for actually believing the hype. I shall stick to a tin of Vaseline in future.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, pleasant scent and taste. Not overly emollient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a frequent lip biter because I can&#x27;t stand the bits of skin peeling off my lips. I used Burts Bees before I got this and I didn&#x27;t like the super waxy feeling and as soon as I bit my lip the lip balm disappeared and my lips became even more chapped :( it&#x27;s only my first day using it but the feel is nice. Applies on smooth and less waxy. It came with a sample bar soap as well and although I don&#x27;t use bar soap it smells lovely. I leave it in the pouch on my desk for the aroma :)</li>
    <li> Very nice soft lip balm. I bought the Lemon-Lavender and Honey. Both are wonderful! (no sunscreen though)</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping from this seller. The lip balm is ok, but it does not seem to work any better then carmex.!! thank you..</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many things for my severely dry and cracked lips and they were all pretty much the same...nothing to write home about. But, I also ordered this so that I could compare it to two other balms that were rated highly by the beauty mags. For me, this was simply the best. It started healing my lips quickly and the smell is fantastic...not at all juvenile. It is a winter must.</li>
    <li> Received  my Beecology lip balm yesterday and I&#x27;m already loving it!  Came quickly with a couple pieces of handmade soap to try along with a nice handwritten thank you.  Clearly Beecology goes above and beyond.  Since using the lip balm, I have only had to apply it once a day to keep my lips feeling moisturized.  This is a huge step ahead of my constant use of Chapstick and Carmex.  Thank you Beecology!  I&#x27;ll be purchasing more for sure.</li>
    <li> I heard of this lip balm through a website and seen that it had gotten great reviews, so I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m impressed with it overall and it smells great too.  It doesn&#x27;t make my lips feel like they&#x27;re dry or anything of the sort, but hydrated.  It really comes in handy with the colder weather :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used! I see why it&#x27;s so highly regarded.</li>
    <li> While this wasn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cure for me like I hoped based on the reviews, it is probably still the best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used! I have a bad habit if biting my bottom lip at work and breathing through my mouth at night. That combined with the dry climate I live in, my lips were peeling off! I tried so many things to fix them but nothing worked. I finally did a search for the best chapstick and this one came up as #1. It seemed promising and inexpensive, so I took the plunge!&lt;br /&gt;When it came, it was cute because it seemed to come from a little family company (handwritten note, free sample shampoo, cute!). That sold me, if nothing else. It worked better than anything I had previously tried, but my bad habits persisted, which prevented it from completely healing my lips. If I put it on several times a day it smooths them, but I just need to break my lip-biting habit. I would gladly take any suggestions! ;)&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is good and doesn&#x27;t have a chemically flavor or &amp;#34;after taste&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve found in all other lip balms (even if they claim to be all natural) that i&#x27;ve tried. It was also smooth and not greasy. Feels comfortable on the lips! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> When I research lip balm I thought this was going to be the best one ever, so I ordered 6 sticks then  after I used it for a while, no its not as good as the blistex I&#x27;ve used for a lifetime with trying different one like Chapstick, Burt&#x27;s bee and others. Blistex wins hands down, now I have 6 tubes to us up. Lost my hope.</li>
    <li> I found this product as #1 on a list of best lip balms so I decided to try it. It came fairly fast (within a few days) which is always a plus. I have very dry, chapped lips and I needed to find something that actually worked. I believe this is it! I have bouts of eczema that appears around my mouth, and with the help of a topical steroid, the dryness was gone. Since then they&#x27;ve been beautifully smooth. The smell is nice. Also, it actually lasts a very long time. I was smooching and 3 hrs later it was still intact. Oh yes and I ordered 2 and got 4, not realizing they came with 2. And it came with a body wash sample and a hand written note - cute touch. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this lip balm.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lip balm. My lip healed quickly. Love the taste. A great quality product!</li>
    <li> Best chapstick I have ever had. Tastes and smells amazing, and I haven&#x27;t had softer lips. Also came with some awesome sample soap that is awesome.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever... Enough said.</li>
    <li> No fault of the seller, it is the product.  I googled what was the best chap stick, and this one and one other came up so I ordered.  Pretty much like all the others.  It does not stay on very well, have to keep reapplying.  I am looking for one that will stand the test of time.  It may not exist but I will keep looking.  It tastes good!</li>
    <li> Feels great on your lips and doesn&#x27;t dry quickly like te others. If you have a bad habit of licking your lips this lip balm even gives you the pleasure of sweetness, which pretty nice. What I like most about this lip balm is that it makes your lips look natural as of nothing was on them unlike carmex&#x27;s that adds glossiness.</li>
    <li> Soothing and protective...smells great too!!</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> As effective as any other lip balm used  - very disappointing!!</li>
    <li> best lip balm...period</li>
    <li> Relieves dry lips and smells absolutely wonderful. The texture is not sticky at all. Never again will I buy beeswax lip balm from another company.</li>
    <li> I read all the positive reviews and really wanted to like it.  The seller shipped the item to me very quickly, and I even got a soap sample.  So I have nothing but positive things to say about their service.  The issue I had is with the lip balm.  Perhaps I am just sensitive to some of the ingredients  (perhaps the lemon and/or lavender)  but my lips broke out in a rash called Perioral Dermatitis a few days after I started using the product.  I stopped using it, and my lips healed.  But since I really liked how the product felt on my lips initially, I wanted to try it again to see if possibly it was coincidental.  Unfortunately, 2 days after I started using the lip balm again, I have broken out in the Perioral Dermatitis rash, and am in pain.  I&#x27;d like to try a different flavor, but I&#x27;m hesitant to.  I did like how this product initially felt on my lips.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have always used Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I think I might have been converted; my lips are so soft! I received a bonus sample hand cream and there was a handwritten thank you note on the packaging slip, which I thought was a very nice personal touch!</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever!  I&#x27;ll never go back to Chapstick.  The seller was great too.  They always add a personal, hand written thank you.  I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal and I see that it works great!  I would buy this again when I need it.</li>
    <li> As great as reviewers lead me to believe.  Love the scent and it stays on way better than other lip balms without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! It makes my lips soft and I really love the lemon scent</li>
    <li> In love with this. Stays on for hours. No sticky lips. No waxing feeling. The best. Have used it in the sun and wind. Works better than anything I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This smells great and has a good texture.  For me it was incredibly drying. I used the balm a few times, and when I finally realized it was making my lips worse, I stopped using it and my lips recovered.  Maybe it&#x27;s the lemon essential oil?  I imagine a different &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; would do well.</li>
    <li> I have dry chapped lips and this has been amazing! My husband hates sticky lip gloss but this has a smooth silky feel,  great smell and the lemony flavor lingers just enough to still get attention. Definitely recommend having this with you at all times!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this lip balm for my bf after purchasing a Smiths Minted Rose lip balm for myself and noticing that this one was also suggested, particularly for guys. As it turns out, the Smiths lip balm was ok but I can no longer open the tin because after a hot day it melted and the already incredibly difficult to open tin became impossible to open. So I borrowed the boyfriend&#x27;s lemon and lavender (which he loves but is not as addicted to as me). I am currently in possession of the beecology lip balm but have ordered five more for both of us. The flavour is citrusy, refreshing and subtle. The texture is simple yet effective, not at all glossy or sticky. This is what I need from a lip balm.</li>
    <li> I needed something special for my lips. I have big lips and eos doesn&#x27;t help sometimes and is too shiny. So i look to find best chapstick for men and this had popped up. I ordered it got 4 days later and I LOVE IT. I actually need to place another order.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells really good! I would repurchase these in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I heard a health adviser on TV say that the type of lip moisturizer I was using was drying. I live in New England and am outside a lot in the cold. Chapped lips in winter is just something I expect. So I switched to Lemon-Lavender All Natural...This lip balm softens and soothes, just as the product description reads. It has a nice lemony smell and taste. I don&#x27;t have chapped lips now even though it&#x27;s a bitterly cold winter.</li>
    <li> ...from Burts Bees to Rosebud to Jack Black. I like them all but this balm is a step above. The first day I used it it healed my chapped lips. In addition, I could feel it on my lips hours after I put it on. I now put it on before I go to bed to get the full benefit w/o eating or wearing lipstick. I highly recommend that you try this balm. I am going to ask this company if they would like to invest in making a cuticle cream bc thats the next dry area I can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the ChapStick I received was just bad, but this stuff was terrible. Did not go on smooth and just made my lips worse. The smell was overpowering and really not that great. Might work for you, but defiantly didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> lovely lavender scent with a hint of lemon. great smooth balm; not dry/crumbly or wet/greasy! also came with a handwritten note and a free soap sample in a cute little bag. :) I&#x27;ll definitely be checking out more beesential products!</li>
    <li> Bought this because my lips were so chapped and I read this was a top Chapstick. I love the unique scent.</li>
    <li> GREAT for men, because it does not give off any shine or glossy look. It smells great. Be careful not to leave anywhere hot though, I left in my car for a few hours and came back and when I opened it it was completely liquified and spilled wax all over my car. I bought this product because I read that it was voted best chapstick, maybe it made my expectations high. But anyway, I ended up giving it to my boyfriend because he gets chapped lips and struggles to find a chapstick that doesn&#x27;t give that glossy finish.</li>
    <li> I had a really bad allergic reaction that caused my lips to peel and become flakey/scaley. This lip balm is literally the only thing that helped improve them. Not only does it smell delicious, it stays on for an extremly long time. I just wish I bought a few tubes of it!</li>
    <li> This product is genuinely the best lip balm Ive ever come across. I struggle to keep my lips un-chapped. I googled &amp;#34;best lip balms&amp;#34; and this was no.1. Tried it and now I know why it&#x27;s nimber 1. Smells delicious. Stays on even after you&#x27;ve eaten! No need to re apply 24-7. And to top it off, extremely cheap! Lots of delicious smells. Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to first say that I have always had the worst chapped lips ever. I work outside in the wind and cold and snow, so my lips split and bleed all the time. I&#x27;ve had this one horrible spot split open repeatedly for the last month that has caused blood to drip down my chin (gross, I know, but I want to get the point across that it was REALLY bad). I have tried 4 different types of Burt&#x27;s Bees, original Blistex, Blistex Complete Moisture, Blistex healing lip ointment, Carmex, and tons of other brands, but nothing helped. I looked up the best lip balm, since the dryness has become unbearable and came across this Lemon Lavender Beeswax Lip Balm and decided to give it a shot. I put it on about 5 times a day for 2 days and already my lips are completely back to normal. That horrible bleeding spot is almost totally healed and has not split open since I started using this stuff. If I could post before and after photos, I would, because the change is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also really nice. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of lavender, but the lemon is definitely the stronger scent with the lavender being more of an undertone. It smells nicer than any of the other brands I have tried. I&#x27;m definitely buying more of this product once I run out.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this lip balm to EVERYONE. It&#x27;s natural, the scent is out of this world and it stays on the lips for a long time.</li>
    <li> Thankyou to beecology delivery was alot quicker than i expected and well packaged too. The package also contained a hand written &amp;#34;thank-you&amp;#34; with a free orange balm which was a loverly gesture. Keep up the good work beecology im a happy customer !!!!</li>
    <li> Very protective to the lips and nice flavoured.. Thank you for such a gud product..</li>
    <li> They stopped making my BELOVED Epicuren in a Stick and it&#x27;s only available now in a Pod (so you have to use your fingers). I tried this as a replacement because it was rated as one of the best. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine as a standard chap-stick and the smell is lovely but its no replacement for the &amp;#34;moisture rich&amp;#34;, Green Tea Extract Balm I was using so it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I loved this lipbalm. It was extremely helpful and the hand written note made my day. It also shipped 3 days before expected.</li>
    <li> after reading many reviews I decided to go with this lip chap. The company was  very generously gave an extra flavour. I think my expectations were a little too high going in though as I was hoping for instant and long lasting relieve of my dry and flaky lips. I should probably just drink more water and less coffee though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple lip balms in the past to try to help with my dry, chapped, and cracked lips which were badly in need of healing but past products have left a really bitter taste in my mouth just from talking, exacerbated the problem, or in the best case scenario, done nothing.  I did some research and found many to have recommended this product so I gave it a shot.  Good thing I did because this is a great product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a gross, waxy feeling on my lips and it&#x27;s not sticky.  It&#x27;s moisturizing and I find that I don&#x27;t have to put on as much.  It also smells really nice.  Lemon and lavender sounded like an odd combination but I was pleasantly surprised.  They were also nice enough to send me a sample of their soap which will I have to try and will post a review later.</li>
    <li> Works great. Much less skin peeling on lips.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works very well and the company sent me a free, dead sea clay soap sample with a nice handwritten note.  Will buy from them again!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not moisturizing at all.  A little too waxy that what I expected</li>
    <li> It does what I expect from chapsticks. I like the fragrance because it is not too strong and not too weak.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of lip balms, and I prefer natural ones.  This fits the bill!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but it didn&#x27;t give me the moisture I needed.</li>
    <li> Truly the best lip balm ever. I started out out with dry chapped lips, and literally one pass over my lips with this and I felt relief instantly. Plus being all natural is great</li>
    <li> love the flavor and great protection. stays on long after application.</li>
    <li> Lovely lip balm, and the shipper wrote a handwritten note and put in a gift with purchase (a little bar of homemade soap and a sticker), very sweet! I&#x27;ll be back when these run out :)</li>
    <li> I do not particularly love the scent, but the quality of the product is great! It feels weird at first, almost not slippery enough, but I don&#x27;t feel the need to reapply as often as I do with other lip balms.</li>
    <li> This product smells and feels wonderful! I get cold sores fairly often, and this really helps to make my mouth feel better. Not to mention, the seller sends the items in a beautiful little package, and I received a wonderful smelling free soap with it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Live in a cold climate during the winter months and it&#x27;s the first time that I haven&#x27;t had chapped lips!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST LIP BALM I&#x27;VE EVER TRIED!!!! I HAVE STOCKED UP JUST IN CASE!!!</li>
    <li> Like lavender lemonade - very nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;other&#x27; lip balms and while I like them, it seems like I have to keep putting them on over and over. This lip balm starts out a little stiff, hard to roll on, but what happens after it&#x27;s been on for a few seconds is that it softens and coats my lips sinking in and lasting for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are wonderful. My personal favorite is the lemon lavender but the others are all good as well. It has just enough scent and flavor that it doesn&#x27;t overpower in smell but adds little tinges of it over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The honey is sweet smelling and the peppermint buzz balm is refreshing. They last a long time and like most balms, are small and easy to tuck into a pocket or purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep one in my car, one in my purse and one in my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of many glowing reviews but it didn&#x27;t work for me...will not repurchase...</li>
    <li> I was hoping I would like this. It does not feel like it soaks into your lips like others do. I feel like I am just putting a layer of something on my lips and never penetrates!</li>
    <li> Best product for lips I have used. when I use this my lips NEVER get chapped, even in winter. It&#x27;s rich and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or waxy  on your lips, and it also smells wonderful! Have bought again . Highly recommended</li>
    <li> The best chapstick you could get. It softens your lips and heals very nice. Even smells great.</li>
    <li> This product is way too waxy and left my lips dry.  The texture of this product felt like I was rubbing a candle on my lips, and left them about as moist.  Never again.  I&#x27;ll stick to Blistex or Nivea.</li>
    <li> I like it. It smells good &amp; feels nice on my lips.  I am surprised at how well rated it is and that it is listed in beauty magazines as one of the highest rated lip balms.  It&#x27;s nice, but don&#x27;t feel any noticeable difference to my Burts Bees lip balm.</li>
    <li> Excellent. My entire family loves this lip balm. I really wish I would&#x27;ve purchased more than four sticks with my last order.  I&#x27;m left with one stick after my family confiscated the rest. Lol.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re amazing, I&#x27;m really satisfied! The product stays for a long time and my lips are so smoother and healthy now! And the smell? So good too! And the shipping was super fast. My best buying here in Amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Product was not moist on my lips...I would never buy this again</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff, the lavender helps me relax too :)</li>
    <li> Best chapstick EVER! I have used many different kinds of chapstick and this is by far the best! It goes on silky smooth and truly repairs chapped lips. It smells and tastes good too! I love that its all natural! I ordered 6 more and Beessential shipped my order within 2 hours of placing the order. They have great customer service!  They even include a hand written thank you note in the package.</li>
    <li> My lips had been very chapped lately, and nothing was working.  I saw the great review on this and thought I would give it a try.  After using it for only 2 days, my lips were completely smooth!  I know it sounds too good to be true, and I don&#x27;t usually review things I buy, but this time I just had to.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that really works, this is the product.  And a handwritten note from the seller as well as a gift of their soap, left me with warm fuzzies as well.  They really know how to do things right.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Goes on thick and moisturizing. Has so many oils and waxes to help dry lips. Delicious light scent and cute packaging. Fast shipping and got a sample of the yummy lavender honey soap. Home made too!!</li>
    <li> Tried these after reading other reviews on best lip balms in the market. So happy I went with this. Not waxy at all and love the smell!</li>
    <li> The absolute best lipbalm ever. Goes on creamy but lasts.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the smell! Seller also handwrite a thank you note. It is so sweet!</li>
    <li> I saw this voted #1 on a popular beauty site, before that I had never heard of this product or company. I had just bought a higher-end lip balm and was again let down and back searching through reviews of other lip balms out there. I thought this would be like the many other natural balms flooding the market that simply protect your lips while on, but don&#x27;t really nourish them once worn off. Either way, I decided it was better than the chemical-laden balms in stores that do nothing, but cause lip balm addiction by making your lips so dry and damaged that you&#x27;ll keep using the product until your stuck in a vicious cycle. I went ahead and purchased with little optimism, but after consistently using this lip balm for several weeks, I wasn&#x27;t surprised, I was SHOCKED! Not only did this moisturizer my lips, it healed them. This is the only lip balm I have tried in my life, that I can claim does this. I have also not known a single person in my life who has had to battle extremely dry, cracked, stinging lips the way I have my whole life if that says anything. If you&#x27;ve tried everything else give this a shot, not to moisturize, but to HEAL your lips. This has a matte finish as well so if some guys are worried about shiny lips, there&#x27;s no problems here. Lastly, I will always, always support companies that commit themselves to never testing on animals. Thanks for a great product Beessential!</li>
    <li> I am in love with these chapstix and they were so nice to send me a free body wash trial size.</li>
