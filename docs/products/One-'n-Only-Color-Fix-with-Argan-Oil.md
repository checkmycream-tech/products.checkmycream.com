      <li>: this smells very very strongly like sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>think that results depend on what kind of dye you used before, how many layers of it, and what your goals are.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that I would purchase if all I wanted to do was remove hair dye with no plans of re-dying ( unless you like orange hair ) but it does state in the instructions that you can re-dye right after using this product ( which I did and it turned out great )</li>
      <li>My hair length is mid-back in length, but very fine.  </li>
      <li>If are interested in the Clairol Perfect 10 in Lightest Cool Brown</li>
      <li>and it was nice to get all of that out of my hair before putting on new color ( which was Clairol Perfect 10 in Lightest Cool Brown....</li>
      <li>We rinse it out, and my bangs and part line are very light, like a pukey blond.  </li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t trust stylist  any more after this experience.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a safe alternative to bleaching.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I have more to add.</li>
      <li>Be sure to check periodically for lift, your hair may develop faster than mine.  </li>
      <li>I did 2 applications, and now my hair is a gorgeous golden auburn color.  </li>
      <li>Okay I have used this product MANY MANY times.</li>
      <li>The smell hasn&#x27;t gotten much better either.</li>
      <li>I did follow up each treatment with a hydrating conditioner just to be safe.  </li>
      <li>It did not remove the dye from the ends of my hair, but I&#x27;m ok with that as I&#x27;m getting a hair cut tomorrow anyways.</li>
      <li>I like it better than color oops</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
      <li>:)  PS:  </li>
      <li>I love mine dearly, but I would take this smell over their litter box stench any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used it one more time just because I&#x27;m dying my hair</li>
      <li>bought two boxes just to be safe.</li>
      <li>The sales lady there said that this product would be a more gentle(aparentally not to your nose) product than bleach</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the color I have now.</li>
      <li>If you have, this product is more than you need.</li>
      <li>I may have to repeat the toning process as it fades but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
      <li>This stuff does not smell like roadkill, I&#x27;ve had box dyes that are more overpowering.</li>
      <li>This stuff does not smell like roadkill, I&#x27;ve had box dyes that are more overpowering.</li>
      <li>this product is way better on your hair than bleaching the color out everytime.</li>
      <li>Rinsed again (that was another shock, not anything to warrant a panic, but was just interesting -</li>
      <li>You need to make sure you have gloves and alot of them.  </li>
      <li>Apply outdoors, it makes the smell more</li>
      <li>I sectioned my hair and applied it, this will work a lot better than just slapping it onto your head like shampoo.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still better than the color from before.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and so was my husband:).</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Simply ... Amazing!!!</li>
      <li>and it is overwhelming</li>
      <li>I love love it ...</li>
      <li>I jist finish using this product,  i love it, i love it.  </li>
      <li>(I will be more diligent in the future!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Ok here&#x27;s the deal with the smell.</li>
      <li>For the love of science, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;For all the people complaining about not being able to sleep because of the smell, maybe wrap your head in a towel before going to bed?</li>
      <li>Now I feel like I can get really experiment because there is a fix out there!!!!</li>
      <li>I decided to quit fighting the grey and thought this would be perfect to strip the dye out.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the long, methodical approach is the best option if you want to avoid damage to your hair (not to mention the $$$$ involved).  </li>
      <li>I loved it for the first week but my roots started growing in</li>
      <li>And then use a strong, fragrant hair masque conditioner and a protein filler and this will get most of the smell out of your hair.  </li>
      <li>Not as easy to get out.&lt;br /&gt;Would defiantly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is SO strong and I can&#x27;t get it to go away.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it worked amazingly well</li>
      <li>I a beautiful honey blonde  </li>
      <li>It turned out pretty nice.  </li>
      <li>I dyed my hair right after the color came to a gold blonde and it doesn&#x27;t smell anymore and is just as healthy as before!!!</li>
      <li>Okay, so I honestly had high hopes for this stuff.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I carefully read the reviews and bought from Sally Beauty Supply for $12.99. I&#x27;ve been coloring my natural light golden brown hair a medium auburn for several years now. I would like to grow into my salt and pepper color and needed to have a color that would slowly allow my gray to blend in as my roots grow. This product will not let you go back to your own haircolor because the lift from previous colors will remain. I used the product twice for 35 minutes each time and covered with a shower cap which brought my hair to a dark strawberry/light orange with some silver strands. I applied neutral protein filler and then I used a medium neutral blonde haircolor (level 8) also from Sally Beauty Supply (Ion)mixed with 20 vol developer and a product designed to minimize red/gold tones mixed in. I left it in for only 5 minutes. The intention of this color is to change the Orange to a golden caramel color. It did just that. I&#x27;m seeing that many people are getting black after they re-color. I&#x27;d recommend you do as I did and use the new color for only a few minutes. The color fix product opens the cuticles of your hair to release the color and so your hair simply grabs anything you apply to it. I didn&#x27;t find the odor quite as bad as others did but I&#x27;ve been a nurse for 25 years so I&#x27;m used to odors. I&#x27;m pleased with the color I have now. I may have to repeat the toning process as it fades but I&#x27;m okay with that. The condition of my hair seems fine but I did apply a moisturizing pack to my hair after depositing the new tone. My hair is short, right now a longish pixie and I plan to keep it in a pixie till it all grows out. Then I may grow it a little. I&#x27;ll update this review if I have more to add. This is designed to remove permanent hair color. It will not go back to your natural color. Hair color has peroxide which &amp;#34;lifts&amp;#34; your natural hair color and this can&#x27;t change that. Also it is not designed to work on colors such as Manic Panic or Splat as well as many semi-permanent colors and this is where many of the bad reviews are coming from.manent colors and this is where many of the bad reviews are coming from.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair black before Christmas and decided back in February that I missed being a redhead (I&#x27;m a natural dirty blonde as a point of reference) I used color oops extra strength the first time to remove it and my hair came out dark red, bright blonde and STILL BLACK, plus the smell was rancid.However, it left my hair in OK conditikn . I had to redye it black because it was so uneven. I tried a month later and used Loreal Color remover and that was a huge mistake. My hair was the same color and consistency of straw and there were still huge streaks of black. I was mortified. I redyed it brown and after walking around with 6 different colors in my hair I tried this. Two boxes and twenty minutes later, my hair came out all a light red, with one tint patch of black. It wasn&#x27;t the best smelling, but it left my hair in better condition than it was before I removed it, and I was able to redye it today and it is now strawberry blonde. I found I was able to mask about 90% of the smell by coating my hair in all kinds of conditioner and hair masks at once and leaving it sit for a few hours than rinsing. The smell was a small price to pay for the results. :)</li>
    <li> EVEN though it didnt remove all of the red dye on my hair it really did a lot of the work I got a brownish caoba look and not an orangish shade. AND my hair stylist was amazed cause she tried another more expensive product  and did nothing so I RECOMMEND IT but beware with the red dye it wont came out completely</li>
    <li> It was too thick and I did not get repeat usages. I left it on for an hour. My hair turned orange. I then tried the  loreal oops color (Sally&#x27;s had closed by then but CVS was open) which didn&#x27;t lift much more. My roots and ends were stripped more than the mid section. So from 3 inches from the roots I have a stubborn band or dark dye that would not come out as much as the rest. I suppose a bleaching treatment would get that out. But having very fine long hair I didn&#x27;t want to risk it. After my second treatment I shampooed and left in Kpak conditioner over night with a cap. It was rough night the smell gave me a headache. The cap helped and a towel wrap helped with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I drove my orange head to my sister&#x27;s. We applied the protein filler on damp hair waited 20 minutes and applied Loreal excellence gray cream formula in light ash brown with Ion Developers for sensitive scalp. She used 20% developer on the roots then a new batch with 30% developer on the rest of my hair. It turned out pretty nice.  However, roots required one more treatment to darken a little more.  This time with no protein filler and watching the time closely, we checked every 10 minutes. At 20 minutes it was done.  The neutral protein filler really helped.  My hair felt pretty soft.  I still have the darker band but it is subtle. I may try the vitamin c treatment next time I need to cover my roots. I had gone to a stylist who gave me red highlights on dark brown that almost looked black.  And they refused to fix.  She said I would have to go darker to cover the red highlights. I don&#x27;t trust stylist  any more after this experience.  As for this product I would recommend it if you are not afraid of the in between stages. If your natural color is dark brown mixed with some gray and you have been coloring for years you will get orange/red hair.  If you plan on recoloring don&#x27;t worry about the orange hair. But do use the neutral protein filler and go with an Ash base if you don&#x27;t want the red. Or add a packet of Un-red, it is a purple base, to your color.  Good luck and thanks to all for the reviews with the extensive instructions. I&#x27;d never heard of Un-red and the neutral protein filler.  My hair is now a nice shade of medium ash brown (no red undertones either) . I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.t want the red. Or add a packet of Un-red, it is a purple base, to your color.

    <li> I was looking at [[ASIN:B0012JY4G4 COLOR OOPS HR CLR REMOVER XTRA Size: 1]] but noticed on some forums and such that this product was also reviewed highly.  The local shop I went to had this but not Color Oops, so we bought 3 boxes of it (I have long hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally a very dark brown almost black.  I have had some stray grays for years around my temples that I dye the same as my natural color.  About a year ago I had bleached some of my under hair, and dyed it a bright bright pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: this smells very very strongly like sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we mix it up and slather it on, and wait the 20 mins as instructed.  We rinse it out, and my bangs and part line are very light, like a pukey blond.  I had read this could happen, and that it wouldn&#x27;t take you back to your natural color, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.  All of the length of my hair remained dark brown... and the pink... got BRIGHTER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, since we didn&#x27;t actually use all 3 boxes we bought we thought, why not do a second round (the package says this can be done if the color removed wasn&#x27;t to the desired level) so round 2, more goop, more sulfur, more waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More of my dark brown got lighter, but the pink is still as vibrant as ever, more vibrant than before I used the product.  Trust me it was well saturated with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: since last night I have washed my hair VERY thoroughly three times, shampooing twice each time, and leaving my very nice smelling conditioner in a very long time.  I must have woken up 30 times last night feeling ill from the intense sulfur smell that lingers in my hair.  It is SO strong and I can&#x27;t get it to go away.</li>
    <li> This product is great especially when using on previously lightened hair. I used it several years ago getting rid of BLACK dye and had some trouble but this time I had red on top of bleached blonde (almost white). I was hesitant to use it because my hair is so fried and I have lots of little dreads.&lt;br /&gt;I had messed up my hair real good using a combination of red protien filler, Feria Flare Blaze and Ion light copper red blonde. I have a lot of hair extensions mixed in with my dreads to make them thicker and the extensions only took about 10% of the color while my natural hair took all of it. (my bad!) I left ColorFix on for about 30 minutes, till my forhead started burning. One treatment took my extensions all back to completely platinum blonde and my natural hair about 1 level darker blonde (maybe just more yellowish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Starts working immediately if your hair is previously bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The stink, of course. It doens&#x27;t smell much worse than my boyfriend&#x27;s farts so I could deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For the love of science, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s slightly damaging to your hair. In my case, it was already in really bad shape anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Use a shower cap to cover your head over and double, triple, quadruple wrap your head in plastic wrap while it&#x27;s processing to keep the stink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the people complaining about not being able to sleep because of the smell, maybe wrap your head in a towel before going to bed? Your boyfriend would probably appreciate it too.</li>
    <li> this worked fine. I wanted to get rid of my red hair and go back to my natural color. Back to blonde and grey!</li>
    <li> Ok here&#x27;s the deal with the smell. Yes, it does smell a bit sickly sweet when you first mix it and put it on your hair. It does smell gross but as you&#x27;re putting it on, you&#x27;re just thinking that you will be washing it out soon so it&#x27;s bearable, no big, right? WRONG. Let me tell you how wrong.&lt;br /&gt;The reality (aka horrific smell) is what happens as the mixture AGES. Once that ish is mixed it has a crazy short shelf life, as in, it degrades immediately and begins to smell something awful like dead animals or dead animals dipped in rotten eggs or something of the like. You wash your hair out and it&#x27;s still not smelling that bad, although once you&#x27;ve washed your hair, you&#x27;ve realized that the smell is still there. Kind of sucks but, what, with a few washings it should go away, right? WRONG AGAIN. You are now sucking at this game.&lt;br /&gt;The smell only begins to smell worse and it permeates everything. If you don&#x27;t have a dishwasher to wash your mixing bowl/bottle/brush/whisk etc, be prepared to throw that shiz in the trash. Oh- and any plastic shower cap or heat cap has to go too. That stench will not wash out. Oh and let&#x27;s get back to your hair. Since the mixture never fully left your hair in the first place, guess who smells rotten now? Winner, winner, roadkill dinner. Oh and you might just want to use an old towel for drying your hair; it has no powers against the forces that be and you will have to toss that too.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to throw out your trash right after you&#x27;re finished or your place will be worse than a stink bomb in the boys locker room.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers! x</li>
    <li> This removed my unwanted color without damaging my hair at all.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live with out this stuff....Anytime I want to change my hair color. I follow the shampoo method to save product. Works just as well....and I lighten it once a week until I achieve blonde again. DON&#x27;T use step 2....it will always darken your hair back. Instead wait several days shamppoing each day and wait to color for at least 5 days. The peroxide will darken your hair back if used too early.</li>
    <li> My hair was dyed a very dark brown, and after two applications of Colorfix it is now a medium brown with a red tone. It definitely strips the color, but for people with light natural hair looking to remove dark color, it won&#x27;t be as affective as you&#x27;re hoping. I will probably bleach next time.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t pull all of the color out. Although I only did the process once (you can do it up to 3 time), and red is a bitch to get out. This stuff stinks to high heaven but it does work. It pull all of the green and blue out of my hair. I suggest going outside with it if you can though, otherwise your whole house will smell terrible for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I will leave you with a fair warning: DO NOT SKIP STEP THREE! It neutralizes the processing chemicals. I skipped step three and couldn&#x27;t understand why my hair smelled burnt. This is why... Thankfully I kept the products and step three so I will be using that when I get home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetology student and my friend whose hair i frequently do wanted to go blonde again after being a magenta color. however i&#x27;ve lifted her hair around 4 times before so i did not want to use anymore lightener on her super chemically damaged hair so we went with this to try it out. this is meant for permanent color and we use semi-permanent (which means it lays outside the cuticle instead of inside the follicle) so it was a long shot for everything to come out. before her hair was magenta it was purple because of blue dye so we lightened it to get the color out and put a red over.&lt;br /&gt;first of all the product smells like a less strong perm because of the sulfur so if you cant stand perms i wouldnt use it, but since im used to perming hair it wasnt a problem for me. when we put the product on her hair went from a purple to a bright blue which was odd to say the least but still a step up from the magenta since she was over that color. we tried it again after rinsing to see if the color would lift anymore but it didnt change at all so we put the processing liquid on and that changed it from the blue to a lilac color similar to the purple she had after we tried to lift the color out previously just not as light. it wasnt exactly what we were going for but it&#x27;s still better than the color from before. because this product lifts the cuticle im putting her on a cleansing bootcamp where she&#x27;ll wash her hair with a shampoo that will strip the color everyday and then use a deep conditioning mask afterward. I&#x27;ll see what that gets us from there but otherwise this product does what it says so i dont have any complaints besides the fact that for the price i think the amount you get isnt very much.</li>
    <li> Alright. I was TERRIFIED to use this stuff. I haven&#x27;t seen my natural hair color (straw, light dirty blonde, depending on when in the year) in 2+ years. I just knew that I wanted to avoid bleach. This stuff, claiming to return hair to its natural color, no matter how long permanent dye has been in, seemed literally too good to be true. So I was scared, but with literally hundreds of good, &amp;#34;it works!&amp;#34; reviews from across the internet, I bought a box (from Sally&#x27;s - $11). I always approach my hair changes with a &amp;#34;it&#x27;s just hair&amp;#34; attitude, so I nutted up and did it.&lt;br /&gt;I was attempting to remove a dark brown-red Feria permanent box dye from my hair that had been in for weeks. And again, I haven&#x27;t really seen my true hair in years. It was about a third grown out (I had a legitimate stripe in my hair) between dark, had-been-dark-red-but-has-been-washing-out-for-more-than-half-a-year blonde, and my lighter, virgin blonde hair on top, when I winged it and dyed in dark dark almost purple red again. That box dye had been in for more than a month, when my blonde roots started to show. I could not tolerate this dark hair with shockingly-light contrasting roots, so I try this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews saying they got several applications from one box, so I only bought one. That was the first panic of this product - my hair is past-nipple length, and it seemed clear early on that we were not going to have enough product to cover all of my hair. There was panic, and we were just trying to cover the top layers thoroughly, just barely managing to cover the bottom layers. I had horror images of long dark streaks among light blonde hair. It was a scary time with my processing cap on. If your hair is past shoulder length...I suggest buying two boxes, ESPECIALLY if you think you&#x27;ll need more than one application.&lt;br /&gt;The overwhelming amount of reviews saying the stuff smells like death had me questioning my nose. I smelt almost nothing. Am I nose-blind or is everyone else who uses this product bad-smell-ignorant? Man up, the smell is nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I kept the stuff in for a little over a half hour. The second panic was based on the fact that I could actually see blonde. I remember years ago, before I started dying my hair, whenever I took a shower or went swimming, the water left my wet hair dark, like you could never tell I was a blonde if you met me at the beach. Water makes my hair dark. But at the end of the half hour, with this stuff still soaked in my hair, I can tell - my hair is BLONDE. Not platinum, but most definitely not the wet brown I remember! Nerves were racked. I rinsed for a decent amount of time, at LEAST five minutes, then I shampooed for five minutes with Herbal Essences honey shampoo mixed with Dr. Bronners all-purpose soap, and left some deep conditioner in for another fiver minutes. Rinsed again (that was another shock, not anything to warrant a panic, but was just interesting - no red rinsed out. The water rinsed clear. Science, how do they do it...where did the red go hehe...)&lt;br /&gt;Dried my hair. And....goodness gracious, that is BLONDE. It was a shock - especially since it was blonde all over, we didn&#x27;t miss anything! (except one random polka dot on the top of my head! but we just scraped the inside of the bottles, lathered it on the spot, waited 15 min and rinsed out, the spot is gone). Unfortunately, my left side is a little blonder than my right, but that is so minute, it only something I will ever notice, you know? But still, try to get your whole head as quickly as you can, if you take a while on one side, the other side will have less time to develop before you rinse it out, and it will remain darker (duh). Try to be quick (but as I said, barely noticeable). I believe the only reason the blonde was such a shock is because it is the lightest my hair gets naturally - it&#x27;s the shade it would be in the middle of a beach-filled summer. Since I haven&#x27;t seen that shade in so long (and admittedly, my eyebrows are way too dark, and contrasting greatly), it was just a shock, but I do believe that it is at least close, if not it is, my actual hair color. Can&#x27;t tell where my roots are anymore (yay, no more stripe)&lt;br /&gt;After much stress, I was going to ditch Step 3...then decided to use it....then not use it....after many back-and-forths, for days, when I realized I most likely will need another box of this stuff, I decided against Step 3. Step 3 is meant to show where and how much you have missed in your hair, that&#x27;s why it makes it darker - if you missed a lot, it will make it darker, so you can do another application. Since I knew I wouldn&#x27;t have the chance to do another application for several days, I did NOT want Step 3 to be highlighting any streaks or other nonsense! When I dried my hair and realized that this stuff left my hair pretty close to spot on,  I thought, why mess with a good thing. Did not use Step 3. Will edit in a week to add if my hair darkens or not again, but so far, so good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN CONCLUSION. This stuff does not smell like roadkill, I&#x27;ve had box dyes that are more overpowering. This stuff does remove the permanent color from your hair. I cannot speak for using Step 3, but in my situation, going without Step 3 worked. I cannot speak for non-blondes, or people who bleach, but in my situation, this stuff returned me to my natural blonde hair (I think?). My hair does not feel damaged at all. My hair does still smell a little bit in the shower, but if putting the stuff in my hair was a 3/10, 10 being skunk roadkill and tires on fire, the smell of my wet hair in the shower one day later is just a .5/10. Nothing extraordinary.y, my eyebrows are way too dark, and contrasting greatly), it was just a shock, but I do believe that it is at least close, if not it is, my actual hair color.

    <li> This stuff smelt so bad I wanted to vomit. It did take some of the color out, but I had to redo it a handful of times.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair for many years and it is blue black, about as dark as it gets. Ive used this product twice now and both times used the whole box which negates to 4 treatments. I decided to quit fighting the grey and thought this would be perfect to strip the dye out. It DID lighten it quite a bit, but it is now very red and I have a bout an inch and a half of new growth of hair so I have a good idea where it would be grey. It removed a lot but Ive never been a redhead so I gave it 3 stars. I suspect this would be a great product for someone who has even just brown hair. Def for someone who wants to do a new color afterwards. I think my 10-15 years of darkest black dye was just too much for it.</li>
    <li> Horrible horrible produced!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I want by money back for two boxes!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two boxes just to be safe. All the reviews say to use more then once!  It turned my hair red then orange then red and I only left on for twenty min! So upset and disappointed! I also only dyed my hair from light brown to dark brown twice in five years</li>
    <li> Horrible. I have used Color Oops twice before and my hair looked amazing afterwards. I washed it and the smell was gone. Guess what? I tried this product just because everyone said it was the best thing and surprise!!!! Its not only a waste of money but also it doesnt work and has the nastiest smell ever. It never leaves honestly. Its been weeks after I used it and still smells nasty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the product and not the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was colouring my hair with henna and indigo for years. Got sick of it - my natural colour (if I remember it correctly) is dark ash blonde. But I didn&#x27;t see it for the last 30 years for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I tried &#x27;Color Oops&#x27; last year, but it just lightened henna 1-2 tones.&lt;br /&gt;Now I got pretty short hair and decided to go &#x27;natural&#x27;. However the mismatch between &#x27;warm&#x27; henna and my &#x27;cold&#x27; roots were horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I got 2 boxes in Sally&#x27;s. For the first application I used 1/2 of each - solution 1 and 2. I covered my hair with plastic bag and applied heat for 40 mins. I washed my hair then for 15 mins, washing it in hot water with shampoo for 3 times (after every 5 mins). I completely skipped bottle 3. Dried.. and  was blown away ! The henna and indigo were almost gone !!!!! My hair became light strawberry blonde. Excited, I repeated application for 3 more times (dividing each package for 2 uses) and got my hair colour back with yellow undertone ( Each application lightened hair even more).&lt;br /&gt;I plan to apply protein mask and then start using violet shampoo and conditioner to remove the brassiness.&lt;br /&gt;For those hennaed and indigoed heads out there - there is remedy to remove build ups !!!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally dark blonde hair. Usually when I feel like dying it, I go strawberry or light auburn. About 2 months ago I decided to take the plunge and try a soft black. I thought I grabbed a box of semi-perm so I figured it would have washed out by now. Oh boy, was I wrong... I must have grabbed a permanent one because no matter what I did it would not fade. I bought this product from my local Sally&#x27;s per the clerks recommendation. I used the first two steps only, as I read in reviews that the third step can actually cause the dye to reappear. I mixed half of bottles 1 &amp; 2, let it sit, washed it, and then have myself the second halves in another treatment. My hair is now a coppery, natural looking color. It did not remove the dye from the ends of my hair, but I&#x27;m ok with that as I&#x27;m getting a hair cut tomorrow anyways. The only other con I&#x27;d say is the eggy smell, though it is not nearly as bad as other reviews made it. I plan on using a lukewarm coffee treatment in the morning when I shower to take out the residual smell (if there I&#x27;d any). The other nice thing i noticed is my hair is not fried (which says alot because i have drier than normal hair). I did follow up each treatment with a hydrating conditioner just to be safe.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> It has been TWO MONTHS since I used this product (with no results might I add) and the smell will NOT come out of my hair. I&#x27;ve done essential oil soaks, baking soda soaks, cinnamon soaks, egg soaks, hair masks, deep conditioning, washing obsessively, and shampooing several times in the shower and the smell will NOT leave my hair. I&#x27;ve even been to a salon and got my hair washed. The smell was so awful on the lengths of my hair that I cut 9 inches of it off just because I would almost puke every time I&#x27;d have to wash it. The smell hasn&#x27;t gotten much better either. If you want your hair to smell like a dumpster in a sulfur pit then by all means, use this product. I was mortified when I walked into my house my stepmom covered her nose and said, &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that disgusting smell? It&#x27;s almost metallic&amp;#34; and I was about 10 feet away from her, might I add. I&#x27;m still waiting for this repulsive smell to leave my hair. How hard is it to make a product that doesn&#x27;t leave unpleasant and long term lasting effects?</li>
    <li> Okay I have used this product MANY MANY times. It works pretty well with removing color (depending on your type of hair and the color) but not very evenly around the different areas of my head. Usually it takes 2 or 3 boxes depending on the color I have at the time but with that, if you order more than one at a time, you will only get one unless you are ordering from the actual \\&quot;Sally Beauty Supply\\&quot; website, which, if I may say myself, is FAR better when it comes to hair and beauty supplies. I ordered 2 boxes and only got one in the mail, I called customer support with sally beauty supply and they told me they couldn&#x27;t help me and to call amazon. Well I called amazon and they said that they couldn&#x27;t help me and to call sally beauty supply. It was quite ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;But over all, its ALRIGHT, not fantastic, for removing color from hair. I would suggest something of better quality that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling thin and COVERED in product.</li>
    <li> Did my hair fix really good. No apparent oder.</li>
    <li> Holy s***, the terrible reddish brown hair my hair dresser gave me is GONE! I am back to my naturally blonde hair. this stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> If only there was smell o vision to prove to you how awful this really smells...&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t just smell....it REEKS like watery egg farts.. not only can you not escape your the smell permanently attached to your head...it consumes and devours your entire house or apartment. I cried for about an hour and a half and almost threw up everywhere. After washing my hair about 8 times and then using orange juice and baby powder I still continued to gag and almost vomit the few hours of sleep that I got. I thought about cutting off my hair.. HONESTLLY</li>
    <li> When you use this product you must be careful or it will dry your hair very much! don&#x27;t leave it too much in your hair do it slowly! that&#x27;s what it works for me at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marie Park</li>
    <li> Color Fix made my hair WORSE! I bought a box of it from Sally&#x27;s. They told me it would completely take the red out of my natural blonde hair. Following the directions EXACTLY (and never having an at home crisis with box dye before) - it left HALF the red in &amp; made the rest a disgusting puke orangey blonde mess. NEVER EVER buy this stuff. HORRIBLE STINK... Smells like rotting eggs and is a HARD smell to get out of your hair!!!! Wound up having to dye my hair a dark brown to fix it. We used Garnier on it. I STILL get wiffs of rotten eggs and Garnier smells heavenly!! DONT BUY THIS! I&#x27;m out 15.00 and no one cares to do anything to improve the situation. I also had to really LOOK for the companies website. I&#x27;m not impressed!!!!    Here&#x27;s the company website:  [...]</li>
    <li> My hair has gone from platinum to black to platinum over the last 2 years and it&#x27;s fried.  Well I knew if I wanted it to take ANY color, I would have to do an overhaul on it.  I got this from Sally&#x27;s for about the same price, a protein filler and dye.  I did the strand test but it didnt work ( I probably did it wrong some how) so I thought screw it lets get it over with.  I mixed part 1 &amp; 2 in a bowl for about 45 seconds.  Now, this stuff does stink like sulfur but its not overwhelming (although you may want to crack open a window if you don&#x27;t want to stink up the house). I pulled up sections of hair then let it down as I went.  I scooped some up out of the bowl just using my hands (and gloves of course) and went to work.  I didnt apply it to my roots because I had about 2 inches of un-processed regrowth so I left it alone.  Basically starting at mid shaft and pulling down with the solution.  After I applied the desired amount, I swirled it up so it would stay on my crown.  I placed a plastic grocery bag around my head and clipped the bottom.  I set my timer for 20 minutes and used my blow dryer on low heat to help the process.  Every 5 minutes I took a peak and it was turning a copper color.  After 15 minutes I took the bag off and combed a tiny section to see if it took all the way and it did perfectly.  I put my head under the faucet for about 2 minutes then used shampoo and lathered it for another 3 then rinsed It out.  Don&#x27;t brush it!!  Use a wide tooth comb and very gently get the snarls out and towel dry it.  If its not your desired color you can repeat the process, if its light enough then proceed with the processing lotion.  BE WARE its not a lotion consistency, its basically water and yes it smells terrible.  Your hair will turn a little darker.  After 5 mintues I washed it out and shampoo&#x27;d again to try to help the smell.  After all was said and done, my hair was a golden-brown copper color, it was actually pretty cute and it took roughly an hour. I put in a protein filler right after and will dye it later tonight after my hair has a little break.  I hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> I Need Help Please Because I Used The Remover And It Got The Color I Wanted That Night But In The Morning My Hair Turned Back Green Now I Am Walking Around With Blonde And Green Hair It Is Very Ugly Please Help Me</li>
    <li> I faithfully followed directions and my hair turned ONE SHADE LIGHTER. This doesn&#x27;t work. Only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was that it didn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, this has a definite odor and it is NOT good. I would occasionally catch a whiff of it coming from under my cap and it is overwhelming but this stuff does take dye out! I started with a permanent dark (level 3) brown dye and it is now a light carmel shade of brown which I achieved with only one application with a wait time of 20 minutes and about 10 minutes of rinsing and shampooing. These results were good enough for me since I intend to put L&#x27;oreal hicolor over it anyway. If you really want to take a color out of your hair this will work but the smell is gross and it lingers for a bit</li>
    <li> I used it according to directions... and twice in a row to remove a small bit of blue in the back of my hair for a new job.. and it didn&#x27;t work, not even a little.</li>
    <li> Just used this twice this morning. Have naturally grey hair and have been dying it black for many years. It does smell like an old school perm, but I found lighting some incense and airing the place out after I was done really helped. Also, rinse rinse rinse! And then use a strong, fragrant hair masque conditioner and a protein filler and this will get most of the smell out of your hair.  As for effectiveness, It was weird. It worked on the dye closest to my roots very well, stripped them out to grey. My hair is almost shoulder length and I was able to use half the products for each application, leaving it on each time for 40 minutes. Yet and still, some of my hair got stripped to a coppery orange-red (which I expected), but on other strands the color didn&#x27;t budge at all. I have no idea why this is, since I always used the same exact permanent color, also for years (Nutrisse soft black).  I had no scalp irritation whatsoever from this.  After the second time, I applied Natural Instincts non-permanent Blonde 9N to tone down the orange tone a bit, which worked quite well. Definitely use good conditioners and leave-ins after this product. Overall, it&#x27;s worth the $15 to try it vs. $150 at salon.  I will wait a few weeks and try again. (Mrs. S)</li>
    <li> The product lifted my hair very little from very dark ash brown black. I had to apply several times once a week but still didn&#x27;t lift the darkness I was aiming for a light ash brown. This may of not worked as well for me as I had used henna on my hair even though that was up to 8months ago.  I had more success with using raw honey treatment mixed with cardamon spice, water and olive oil.</li>
    <li> I had Blue velvet special effects hair dye in my hair. It had faded to a medium purple looks kinda cool but i wanted the purple out of my hair.Thought i would try a stripper instead of bleaching well don&#x27;t do this one. If you have permeant hair it probably does work but not at all for semi. To be fair it has a warning it won&#x27;t work as well on semi but it should say doesn&#x27;t work.It lightened my hair maybe a shade and made it stink like eggs.So.. just a warning for semi-perment users.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t affect my semi-permanent color at all. It remained as vibrant as before.</li>
    <li> This really did remove the unwanted black (supposed to be dark brown) color from my hair.  It is now a very pretty color again.  And yes, this product is stinky, but it think these stinky-sayers are very much exaggerating how bad it is.  It smells very very similar to a perm.  And yes, today (I used the product last night) my hair still has a bit if the scent, JUST like a perm leaves a scent for a day or two.  I didn&#x27;t find it  vomit inducing like some reviewers say at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the only possible complaint I have is that it may have slightly lightened my hair at the roots, though I can&#x27;t be sure if it was Colorfix or my last dye job that was the culprit, and  Colorfix only revealed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would most definitely recommend this product to others.  It may not produce the exact results you hope for, but in my case, the results FAR outweigh the black color my hair was before.</li>
    <li> didnt work like its suppose to made my hair lighter and still have darker roots do not buy</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I was very skeptical. I have long, already dry, damaged and dyed hair. I was worried both that it wouldn&#x27;t work and that it would damage my hair pretty bad. It did neither, not even close. I guess now you can call me a fan, I would recommend this to anyone in a second. It took two applications for me but that&#x27;s not unusual, the instructions say it may take 2-3 applications and there&#x27;s enough in one box to either do 2 applications for very long hair like mine and enough for at least 3 for shorter hair. My hair had been an intense red for over a year with many applications of dye and red is notoriously hard to remove but with this it was no problem at all. It also did no damage to my hair whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I had dyed my hair a rich brown, but it turned into a dark, dark almost black color. I hated it. I followed the directions exactly on the box, using all three steps. I didn&#x27;t even have to let it sit on 10 minutes and I could already see my hair was 2-3 shades lighter. Yes, it definitely does leave red in your hair, but I actually really like the reddish hue as I naturally have it anyways. Any red hue to me was better than black hair. One could easily color back over the lightened hair to achieve the correct color.  And it definitely smells like rotten eggs, but it wasn&#x27;t so bad that I couldn&#x27;t handle it.  I didn&#x27;t feel it damaged my hair at all either. I used a good conditioner after all the steps. And no remaining foul odor that I can detect.</li>
    <li> Not many pros to this one other than it smelling slightly better than Color Oops. It only took out some of the black dye in my hair and left me with a dull black with uneven silvery/ash toned patches. I followed the instructions, and washed my hair several times before adding the processing lotion, which isn&#x27;t lotion but a clear liquidy mess so be vigilant when pouring it on your head. It did seem to damage my hair a little, but nothing more than I had anticipated. Be careful when dying hair after process because it will dye darker than the color you are intending. It did irritate my scalp to the point where I started to worry my hair would snap off my dang head. For the price and the end results I would just buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> I have read a bunch of interviews about this, and I just used it this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that results depend on what kind of dye you used before, how many layers of it, and what your goals are. It&#x27;s possible that the intensity of the smell might vary by what kind of dye or what colors you have used. I can&#x27;t think of any other reason that some people are like me and say that it smells bad but not any worse than your average salon doing color treatments, and other people say it makes them nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Clairol Natural Instincts to cover my gray and make it my natural medium to dark brown color. The box says it will fade in 28 shampoos. It didn&#x27;t. When I wanted to stop playing the dye game, I bought a clarifying shampoo and applied that with some crushed vitamin C to enhance the effect, because I thought I was using a semipermanent dye. Almost nothing happened. Natural Instincts is not a semipermanent dye. I have learned too late that it&#x27;s considered a &amp;#34;demi-permanent dye.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Colorfix. Parts of my hair got a shade or maybe two lighter. Apparently Natural Instincts has peroxide, which bleached my hair and then added dye. So the dye went, and what&#x27;s left is my hair, bleached out a bit. The hair that judging by my roots should be gray got really brassy after I applied the lifter. Don&#x27;t panic. After you do Step 3, it darkens some and isn&#x27;t brassy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s also not gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Colorfix does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. And I don&#x27;t think the smell is terrible. Not great, but it&#x27;s a hair dye thing. It&#x27;s not going to smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re looking to strip out a 28-wash dye, don&#x27;t bother with this. And if you&#x27;re looking for an exit strategy to let your hair be gray where it&#x27;s gray, I hope you&#x27;ve been using a truly semipermanent dye. If you have, this product is more than you need. Just try clarifying shampoo and vitamin C. If you have not been using a truly semipermanent dye and you&#x27;re looking to let your hair be gray, then start using one now. I think hair grows about six inches in a year. I&#x27;m starting my countdown. :(</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I got it at Sally&#x27;s for $13. I&#x27;ve used this product before on dark brown hair and it worked. This time I used it on black hair that I dyed over dark purple (both permanent) and within 1 use (I left it in for a half an hour) and it made my hair a light golden brown! I&#x27;m so amazed that it took out the black AND purple. I used it one more time just because I&#x27;m dying my hair a light brown and the second time it made my hair a golden blonde. I sectioned my hair and applied it, this will work a lot better than just slapping it onto your head like shampoo. It does smell but it worked so I don&#x27;t care! I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this for the product not the seller. My hair has been numerous different colors this past year including blonde, orange, and a dark black/burgundy color (most recent). Before I used this, it was a dark brown at the ends, burgundy in my roots, and had blonde highlights to try to lighten the dark brown. I wanted to go back to my natural color (a light auburn) and I purchased two boxes of ColorFix and two boxes of boxed dye. I only used approximately 1/2 of one box of Colorfix and it completely saturated my hair. I used an applicator brush and did it very evenly and thoroughly. Then I put a processing cap on and let it sit for exactly 20 minutes and then went to wash it out for 5 minutes, following the directions. To my surprise, all of the dark brown/burgundy had lifted. Leaving behind a medium blonde with a slight orange tint and it still had the blonde highlights throughout. I was pleasantly surprised and decided to not even dye over the stripped hair because I liked it so much. I rewashed it and deep conditioned it and it feels no worse than it did before (my hair was already over-processed). I am incredibly impressed by the effectiveness of this product and I highly recommend it. It does smell strongly of rotten eggs though and the stench lingers in your hair and around your home (but its just a small price to pay for how great this product works). I also decided not to use the 3rd step bottle because I didn&#x27;t want it to get any darker. Good luck!</li>
    <li> It worked! I had dark brown permanent color at my roots, a light brown toward the top of my head, and a permanent and semi permanent in red. I now only have one color a light brown because you can&#x27;t fix color lift only remove the dye. I am originally medium brown.  I followed the directions exactly and had to do it one extra time on my roots where I had the dark brown before. I used a blow dryer both times for about 5-10 minutes then let it sit for another 10 minutes. My hair is a little dried out but I didn&#x27;t use conditioner after using the product. Will probably deep condition in the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I never heard of this before and can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find it. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for 25 years. A must have for those who refuse to pay hundreds in a salon and like to experiment with hair color. Now I feel like I can get really experiment because there is a fix out there!!!!</li>
    <li> Okay so I dyed my hair a dark brown with purple ends and I am naturally an ash blonde. I loved it for the first week but my roots started growing in and it just started to look horrible. I had high hopes for this and it did not fail me! It removed all the black! I am so happy. My hair is a reddish blonde now and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. This saved tones of money and damage! I followed all directions and left it on for 20 minutes, then I washed it out and bamn! I recommend this to everyone!!</li>
    <li> This product was not strong enough to take all of the dye out of my hair. I followed the instructions very thoroughly, and while I did see some of the dye come out in the shower, it was not a strong enough product to take all of the black hair dye out of my hair. So be cautious if you have black box dye in your hair and you want to get it out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I don&#x27;t use the last step because I don&#x27;t like that smell.  Just remember... your hair does not go back to your natural color, but it does take it back to a nice base so that your new color is more even and natural looking.  I have used this twice a year for a long time.  Color builds up in your hair just like other hair products  So, when you don&#x27;t like the color or your old reliable color starts looking dull and not lasting as long, this is when it is a good time to use this product.  The first time I used it I was so scared that it was going to turn my hair into straw.  it does not.  It actually makes your hair feel really good.  My hair length is mid-back in length, but very fine.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells like farts. Didn&#x27;t for remove the dye.</li>
    <li> Works, if you follow directions and are using it properly (you have the right kind of dye in your hair it can remove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It will not work properly on purely deposit-only colors like manic panic, smash, etc.  These are not &amp;#34;oxidative&amp;#34; dyes, so there is nothing for the colorfix chemicals to break down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It will not work properly on henna (real actual henna): henna is oxidative, and it may appear lighter for 24 hours, but it will re-darken as it re-exposes to oxygen in the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It cannot add your virgin pigment back to your hair.  If your hair dye contained any peroxide (even volume 5 or 10), your natural pigments have been lifted and washed away. All oxidative dyes contain peroxide, so it took some of your natural pigment with it, even if you went darker.  Your new colorfixed color may be lighter than your virgin roots or regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) If you do not rinse enough, the next hair color you use that contains any peroxide will reactivate whatever dye pieces you failed to rinse out.  Take the &amp;#34;rinse for 5 minutes&amp;#34; step seriously! If you are going to dye over the colorfixed hair, do a strand test with the Part #3 to make sure you got enough dye out. It will show you any dye you left in the hair.  If it darkens too much, reapply from step 1 and rinse-rinse-rinse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The chemicals in Colorfix do damage your hair a little since it changes the acidity of your hair: if your ends feel stretchy when you finish, you can fix this by rinsing in a mild vinegar wash (1 part vinegar, 2 parts water). The mild acid in the vinegar rinse will neutralize the too-basic pH from Colorfix. Your ends should feel much stronger, instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this and several other similar products and they all work similarly. Colorfix seemed to be somewhat less stinky than ColorOops, but the results are similar.  It lifts demi-permanent dye on virgin growth almost instantly, and most of the rest over 20 minutes.  I have used it on very dark brown-black dye and it worked well, but the hair absolutely needed a re-dye to get a color I actually wanted in my hair (my hair color was orange under the black dye).</li>
    <li> Great results! After reading all the reviews here, I purchased a box from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. Based on other people&#x27;s feedback, I made a few adjustments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I used a mixing tray and brush I picked up at Sally&#x27;s ($2) so I could mix and apply it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I also purchased a neutral protein filler from Sally&#x27;s to use after colorfix and before recoloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I started on my tips and did not use it on my roots (I&#x27;ve been dying my full head dark brown/blavk for years and years, but my roots have not been colored).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Based on other reviews, I also left it in for about an hour, and I didn&#x27;t need the entire box for my long, relatively thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I did use the lotion in step 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were stellar! I didn&#x27;t end up recoloring because my hair looks better than I expected. No damage whatsoever, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does smell like sulfer when wet (from the sulfuric acid), so I&#x27;m going to try apple cider vinegar. If I don&#x27;t post an edit, the ACV removed the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, completely worth it!</li>
    <li> I picked up a box of this to from my local beauty store because my manager was having a conniption about my recently dyed red hair fading to a pinkish color. (Pink, purple, blue, and green hair is against the dress code). So I bought this with the hopes that it would take the red/pink out. After following the instructions, I came out with a nice golden honey color. I was going to apply another dye over it, but I think I like the color.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I would say is the treatment smells awful, contrary to what the box says. I am still nauseous over the smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used this product to strip the remainder of the pink dye I have in my hair out.. It completely sucked. I used it perfectly to the instructions and it didn&#x27;t pull hardly ANY color out. I used head n shoulders shampoo to help it because that&#x27;s the best shampoo I have for ripping color out of your hair and that didn&#x27;t even help. I actually bought this at Sally&#x27;s for $12 and it&#x27;s not even worth $0.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the smell. It smells TERRIBLE!! Some say it smells like rotten eggs, sulphur, or wet dog. I think it smells like those three things, combined, with a sprinkle of decaying corpse on top, as well as my disgusting antibiotic pills. It&#x27;s seriously the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled and I vow to never use this stuff again. I imagine the reek of chemicals will stay in my hair for a while. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I just used this product on my hair today. I have short hair that was dyed black and dark brown with a semi-permanent color for 6 years. Last night, I highlighted my hair to get caramel color highlights. The highlights ended up RED.... Like crayon color red. I immediately regretted my decision, as I had black hair with crayon red highlights. After researching a lot, I purchased Color Fix and completely removed all the black and red from my hair without damaging my hair or my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left in the mixture for 25 mins and washed my hair afterwards with a clarifying shampoo. I washed my hair 4 times with the shampoo and rinsed EXTREMELY well for 25 mins. When I got out of the shower, all the color was out of my hair. I followed with the processing lotion (step 3) and left it on my hair for 5 minutes. I washed my hair again and applied a deep conditioner. My hair did not get any darker or change colors at all from using the processing lotion. I love the result and would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This stuff always works perfectly at removing the pigment from my hair without damaging it like crazy.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. I left it on for almost an hour and it completely removed all my layers of black. I sectioned my hair and brushed it in with brushes I bought on here. I saturated my hair so much it was slimey. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> May work for some, but not for all.  This is where the &amp;#34;devil is in the details&amp;#34; depending on your level of color, length of time that you&#x27;ve been coloring, and the level that you are hoping to lift out.  I bought two boxes, thinking that one application might not be enough for my thick, shoulder length hair.  Didn&#x27;t need the second box after all, because I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell (ghastly!).  I had read all the reviews warning about the smell but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that it can take two weeks or more to get things back to normal. I could have dealt with the odor, etc., if it would have removed some of my dark brown dye, but frankly all it did for me was lift about half a shade (if that much).  The chemicals are harsh; perhaps not as harsh as bleach, but harsh nonetheless, so be aware of that.  In the final analysis, I went with a home remedy and actually saw immediate results.  Sometimes the long, methodical approach is the best option if you want to avoid damage to your hair (not to mention the $$$$ involved).  Good luck and happy lifting!  :)  PS:  Brace yourself for an odor like no other!</li>
    <li> Product wonderful&lt;br /&gt;I loved it&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work at all for trying to strip green or blue out of your hair. DO NOT BUY IF THATS WHAT YOURE TRYING TO DO like me</li>
    <li> Okay, so I honestly had high hopes for this stuff. I&#x27;d read that it worked on non-natural colors, which is something very few products do. I have green hair, and I have yet to find a bleach or color remover that gets it out completely. I jumped on this after reading a few reviews here. It got here relatively quick, only a day late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the stink. It was absolutely awful. It smelled like a botched kitchen perm. My whole house started to smell within minutes of mixing the product in the bowl. It&#x27;s been over an hour and my whole house still reeks. Still, that happens with a lot of products and I hoped that meant it&#x27;d work well, but I was very wrong. After waiting for the recommended time and doing exactly as the box instructed, the only thing it did was remove the dark tones in the green (and I&#x27;ve only put this green on my hair ONCE, so there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;overdye&amp;#34; that would cause this issue). My hair stinks to hell and back, and no amount of washing has gotten rid of the stench. I tried wearing a hat over it and it just made the hat stink, too! Furthermore, I don&#x27;t know exactly what they were trying with that &amp;#34;processing lotion&amp;#34; because it just seemed like water to me. Not lotion. At all. It didn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that it was literally just like pouring cold water over my hair. The only good thing I have to say is that my hair is very soft, but then again, that could just be because I have really good conditioner, so I&#x27;m not even going to give this product credit for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super disappointed and just really upset. I can&#x27;t really do anything with it except just dye it green again, try to see if any type of turquoise will go over, or risk further damage by bleaching it. I do not recommend this product. Just save yourself the time, and stink, and go see a professional.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Sally beauty supply to remove black from my hair. I had to apply it twice but it worked! My hair went from black to an orange color. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it smells like sewer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and YES this product does smell very much like sulfur! even on the package it says \\&quot;no unpleasant odor\\&quot; they should at least change that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bright yet dark blue hair and was planning to change it to lavander from sally&#x27;s beauty salon. The sales lady there said that this product would be a more gentle(aparentally not to your nose) product than bleach so since i don&#x27;t really want to be bald by my 30&#x27;s i descided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as we mixed the two bottels together it&#x27;s a instint stench; ignoring the smell we went on with it and followed the instructions exactly as written....20 minutes late i still have blue hair but it&#x27;s a bit dull almost gross color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end we bleached it and worked as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(if the product had actually worked as said, i would, i believe, be able to get over the smell)</li>
    <li> Good thing I ordered 2 boxes. One from here, one from Sally. Okay. So yes it smells, big whoop. It&#x27;s not that bad. My hair was dark brown, almost black. I believe I dyed it that could about 4 or 5 times at the this color. Before that my hair was light brown for about 4 years (dyed). I tried this because I want to strip the color out of it before I bleach it. One major thing I noticed is that there is not enough product to do 2 or 3 applications, maybe only if you have a pixie cut. I have long mid-back hair and I used the whole amount in one box. It looked promising while it was on. It was a light strawberry blonde which is about my natural color. But when I followed all the instructions, left it on for 20 mins, washed for 3-5 mins with shampoo, applied developer for 5 mins, rinsed it out, conditioned it....it was about 1 shade lighter than the color I was trying to get rid of. Looks like I&#x27;m going to be doing this a couple times. Overall, I am a little disappointed. But I&#x27;m still going to continue to use it in hopes that it will work after several tries, obviously like a week apart from each other with deep conditioner treatments in between.</li>
    <li> This was suggested to me by a Sally&#x27;s employee to remove lingering Manic Panic dye. This will not work for you if you are attempting the same!! The only color lifting I got most likely came from the 4 times I washed my hair while using this product. I don&#x27;t think this product is useful for unnatural dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also yes, it stinks like crazy.</li>
    <li> It worked exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to. I went from a vivid copper red to a light (brassy) blonde. Highly suggest buying a toner to put over it after, because the results ARE brassy. But the product worked just as advertised. The smell is awful, but honestly, not awful enough to keep me from using again. The product is gentle on hair. The only reason hair becomes so dry afterward is from the amount of washing you must do to rinse the product completely out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;- Apply outdoors, it makes the smell more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Just be SURE to wash the product out COMPLETELY. A twenty-minute shower did the trick for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Use a cheap CLARIFYING shampoo. I washed my hair around ten times to make sure it was all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- USE STEP THREE! It may cause the color you&#x27;re trying to get rid of to resurface, but that&#x27;s only if you don&#x27;t wash it out properly. Step three is necessary; it stabilizes your hair. Without it, your hair may darken within a few days, or it could cause future hair dyes to have an unpredictable effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Condition with a volumizing conditioner afterward, as your hair gets dried out from all the washing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 3-4 times now. It works really well for darker colors (hair that has been dyed from light to brown/black/auburn). I like it better than color oops and it caused less damage to my hair than the others. This is not the products fault because it says on the box that it might not work on semi-permanent dyes but I still used it on my pink hair and it turned green…</li>
    <li> I bought this product after researching online, and reading other’s reviews. I was very apprehensive at first, to try a color fix at home, but then I just did it, and I confess - I’m very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims to work, no matter how long ago you colored your hair, and that was another reason (in addition to a majority of favorable reviews) that I chose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the “slight color correction”, as my hair had been gradually getting darker and darker each time I colored to touch up my roots – my fault, as I was not careful to avoid pulling the color through the ends (I will be more diligent in the future!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed according to the directions, and because I’m not a professional, and didn’t know exactly how long the time is for a strand test, I just watched the clock, and eyeballed it in the mirror. I know that your hair appears darker while it is wet, so – all in all, I had the product applied for about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When people feel it is necessary to talk about the smell in their reviews – come on, it’s chemicals, it is going to have some kind of odor! And it was not that bad!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can still use this product again in the future if needed – once you open the bottle, you are not committing to use the entire contents at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to others that want an “at home” fix. Absolutely yes!</li>
    <li> I used this on my dyed pink hair that just wouldn&#x27;t fade, during the process, however, my hair turned dark blue. I freaked out at first, waited two days, then redid the steps. On the second time, it lightened my roots by about 5mm, but nothing more. It was still blue and then I used the processing liquid, since I still wasn&#x27;t getting anywhere and it just turned the blue to purple. 500/10 don&#x27;t recommend at all. I usually bleach all color out, but i wanted to try something new and was heavily disappointed.</li>
    <li> So, after dying my hair red for several years, I had the urge to go back to my natural hair color - ash blonde.&lt;br /&gt;I did 2 treatments and I came out with a beautiful shimmery strawberry blonde.&lt;br /&gt;It worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is something you have to live with.&lt;br /&gt;The smell reminded me of people getting perms. It stays in your hair, but it is a small price to pay to have healthy hair after stripping out years of coloring.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards I dyed my hair back to a rich dark red, because my complexion just doesn&#x27;t look good with blonde and the new color absolutely covered the smell.&lt;br /&gt;People giving this product a bad rating only because of the smell should understand that the company can not just simply cover up the smell of active chemicals in these products. Live with it or don&#x27;t use it. It IS a strong smell, but again, a small price to pay for the awesomeness of this product! (My recommendation is to do it over a week end when no social outing are planned ;-) )</li>
    <li> Stripped the black permanent dye from my hair nicely. Originally after using the color fix my hair was a light blondey brown but darkened to light brown over a few days, close to my natural hair color. The product does the job, I take away a star for the terrible smell that lingered for weeks in my hair. Could smell it every time my hair got wet, just awful. But this definitely works to remove dark unwanted hair color.</li>
    <li> So I put a double neutral base medium brown on my blonde hair and it looked black!!!! OMG i was freaking out it looked horrible.  I found this at Sally&#x27;s for like $14..  I read all the reviews and finally decided to do it.  First off picture black hair which is now a pretty light brown!!! You need to make sure you have gloves and alot of them.  Follow ALL of the steps!!!! Even the processing lotion.  I used the mix of part 1 and part 2 twice, i kept it on the first time for 20 then rinsed for 5 mins.  Second time i left it on for 45 mins.  Don&#x27;t spaze when your hair is orange because thats what the processing lotion is for.  It takes the brassy reds and oranges and tones it down.  I mixed some of the processing lotion with condition first then started to squirt it on my hair with the bottle (its more like liquid not lotion:hint mix w/conditioner).  When i was done i was so relieved and so was my husband:). It does stink but its a small price to pay compared to walking around with crazy hair...  I had a hair dye ready to dye over it, i didn&#x27;t need it I&#x27;m happy with my results!!!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally golden/light brown hair, but I have been dyeing my hair dark red for a couple of years now.  I have been wanting to return to a lighter color for a long time now, but I kept reading that it couldn&#x27;t be done without bleach.  Well, I gave this a shot yesterday, and it worked!  I followed all of the directions exactly, including step 3.  I did 2 applications, and now my hair is a gorgeous golden auburn color.  It looks like the color of butterscotch.  I was planning to dye my hair after using this, but I love the color so much that I think I&#x27;ll keep it the way it is!  The smell wasn&#x27;t bad AT ALL, especially if you&#x27;re used to dyeing your hair and dealing with those smells.  People who complain about the smell must have never lived with cats - I love mine dearly, but I would take this smell over their litter box stench any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I personally found great success with Colorfix.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about it like I was, I&#x27;d recommend giving it a shot!  My hair doesn&#x27;t really feel damaged at all, nor does it smell bad.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have asian hair, and two years ago I dyed my hair a light brown color but after a while I wanted to go back dark so I used a blueish black semi permanent hair dye. It was suppose to wash out or lighten after 28 washes but it did not wash out even after 6 months. I wanted to go back to a brown color so I used a high lift box dye and it did not take at all to my ends because of that suppose-to-be semi permanent hair dye I did half a year ago. I did some research, stumbled upon this and it is worth every cent for me. I only bought one box, but it came with so much product I was able to get two applications out of it. The first time I used it, it worked amazingly well but I wanted it to see if I could get it to lift anymore so I used the second half the the bottle for a second application the next day and I am so impressed with this product. My hair went from black to light brown so easily. It is a little brassy, but I&#x27;m just glad my hair&#x27;s not black anymore! I did apply this to my roots and it did lighten my roots but very slightly. It did an amazing job lifting the color out of my ends. I didn&#x27;t use the lotion though. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is it smells really bad and the smell lingers for a while in your hair. I love this product. I would recommend it over color oops. I&#x27;ve tried color oops before and my hair came out very patchy and damaged.</li>
    <li> I did 3 times half dark color gone from my blond hair but expected more .. not worthy</li>
    <li> OMG I was really on the fence about this I have been coloring my hair dark dark brown then dark deep chocolate mahogany and the last year or so a really deep burgundy, anyways I want to start Hennaing my hair of course right after I figured out how to keep the red in for a small price loreal sulfate free for color treated hair and only use cold water on hair anyways back to this product I used it and left it on for an hour + because I lost track of time anyways I read don&#x27;t use the 3rd step lotion part because it can make ur hair darker, well I did a lot of research if u plan on dying ur hair right away skip it if u don&#x27;t well I don&#x27;t consider henna dying because it&#x27;s not anyways if u don&#x27;t dye ur hair immediately it will darken regardless all this third step does is re oxidize and correct the PH balance in ur hair so instead of waiting for the color molecules to re enlarge and ur hair darken anyways this just dies it immediately and if u don&#x27;t want damaging dont use for the full five minutes two and a half or three will do and my hair I a beautiful honey blonde  I would have been happy with a medium brown holy cow this stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> Waste of money!  I applied this product twice to eliminate my permanent level 3 (dark brown) hair dye.  It made two sections of the very ends of my hair orange and the rest is just as dark as when I started.  I sat under a heater both times and even left it on longer than was recommended the second time.  I rinsed for 15 minutes instead of the 5 minutes recommended.  If you like the smell of rotten eggs on your hair (even after shampooing with a clarifying shampoo and conditioner 10+ x&#x27;s) and no color removed - this product is for you!</li>
    <li> I have used this three times over the past 3 years and it does work! Follow the directions and watch magic happen! I&#x27;ve used this on fire engine red hair, burgandy hair and magenta red hair. I only needed 1/2 of it for my hair since I don&#x27;t have thick hair but its never damaged my hair or made it feel pourous or dry...the smell just smells like a perm.. its not that bad....you can deal with the smell or walk around with an unwanted hair color...I dyed my hair right after the color came to a gold blonde and it doesn&#x27;t smell anymore and is just as healthy as before!!! I&#x27;ll always use this brand!</li>
    <li> I had a very pretty blue in my hair. But it faded to a nasty green. I was looking for a safe alternative to bleaching. I found this, and the product has some great reviews. But it didn&#x27;t lift my color at all. I followed the directions to a tee. I attached a before and after photo. You can see that the green is only slightly less obvious, or maybe that&#x27;s me being hopeful I didn&#x27;t waste $15 and an hour of my time. I assume this would lift other colors. But it doesn&#x27;t not work for blue/green hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally blonde. I had decided I wanted a change and went to red, then to burgundy. I loved all 3 of the colors, but prom is coming up soon and I needed my natural hair color back so I could wear whatever color dress I wanted. I bought another product before this and it changed for that night, and it was burgandy once again in the morning. I tried this stuff and It was amazing! It had no smell whatsoever and took hardly any time at all. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to get their natural color back or dye their hair a different color.</li>
    <li> I need to start this by saying the product does stink, literally. I don&#x27;t know how anyone can review this and say otherwise. An open window and fan helps. :)&lt;br /&gt; I personally like color fix over the other color strippers. I tend to bounce between dying my hair black, red, or blonde and we all know the transition can be very time consuming and discouraging. I usually have to apply this 2-3 times and leave out the 3rd step. It does make my hair a light copper color but that just makes it a lot easier to cover.&lt;br /&gt;I have complicated hair that damages easily. I was surprised this product didn&#x27;t cause any damage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating it 3 stars only because in the description it states it does not smell, otherwise it would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a very decent product. I started it out with black, long (mid back) hair, and very thick hair ( a perfect trifecta) so I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work as well on me. I bought two boxes and just used one at a time. I left it on a little longer than they suggest because of my trifecta. It worked SO WELL, I went from black to a orgnish brown not bad looking but I did NOT use the 3rd bottle because I used it in my first attempt to get an accidental dye switch black out of my hair, it made my hair black AGAIN I was not happy to say the least. This time it turned out great, I used the second box to try and get it lighter the effect wasn&#x27;t as drastic but it did do something so I say it was pretty effective the only downside and the reason I&#x27;m rating 4/5 is because of the STENCH!!! It has THE worst smell I have ever smelt. I could hardly sit though it but the result was worth it...the smell has a hard time washing out in just one wash so really get in there. The smell in my apartment? Not as easy to get out.&lt;br /&gt;Would defiantly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair black for roughly 4 years, my natural color is ash blonde.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve used this twice today. After the first time my bangs were bright red and some spots under near were also red, but the top of my hair and the back were still black. So I did it again and now 40% of my hair is a Hideous brassy red and the rest is still black.  I didn&#x27;t use the 3rd bottle.&lt;br /&gt;PRO: minimal damage, didn&#x27;t burn my scalp or skin&lt;br /&gt;CON: Time consuming, it SMELLS DISGUSTING, turned my hair an ugly shade of red, didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this products doesn&#x27;t come with gloves or a mixing container.</li>
    <li> Took 3 applications to get the color to lighten--applied the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; (basically water, hydrogen peroxide, and a little silicone) and the color darkened again to exactly where I&#x27;d started. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> this product is way better on your hair than bleaching the color out everytime. Don&#x27;t fry it just strip it!</li>
    <li> This product works well, I gave 4 stars because the instructions fail to mention that your hair may turn an absolutely hideous shade of bright orange ( depending on the color Or &amp;#34;colors&amp;#34;  your trying to remove ) which can be a complete shock if your not aware this can happen. If your planning on re-dying your hair then don&#x27;t worry.....it turns out as soon as you apply hair dye the orange is neutralized and completely gone ( or at least it was for me ) I don&#x27;t know that I would purchase if all I wanted to do was remove hair dye with no plans of re-dying ( unless you like orange hair ) but it does state in the instructions that you can re-dye right after using this product ( which I did and it turned out great ) My starting hair color ( dyed hair ) was a dark, muddy ash blonde with brassy hues ( dye job gone wrong ) and it was nice to get all of that out of my hair before putting on new color ( which was Clairol Perfect 10 in Lightest Cool Brown....very pretty and zero brass afterwards ) It&#x27;s also possible that the reason my hair turned orange was because there were already very brassy tones ( unwanted and unintended ) brassy tones to begin with. Good luck, hope everything works out. If are interested in the Clairol Perfect 10 in Lightest Cool Brown I wrote a review you can check out</li>

    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed at all.</li>
    <li> After dying my hair black with semipermanent dyes for many months I decided I wanted to go back to my natural color. Usually in the past the black would fade after a few weeks and my hair would go back to its natural light brown color in due time. However, the last time i dyed it I got the deepest black i had every seen. I mean my hair was pitch black and this dye wasn&#x27;t budging. I came across color oops, a loreal product. It DID NOT work at all and i wasted $20 bucks. So I found colorfix, read the reviews, and went to sallys to pick it up. My main complaint is that the product stinks to high heaven.. just awful rotten egg smell. However, it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! It lifted the nasty, disgusting black without damage to my hair. It took me three applications (my hair is long, it hits about midway down my back). I used the toner conditioner because my roots came out pretty brassy. It toned them down to a nice reddish brown. I did not get my original hair color but i got something extremely close to it. My hair isn&#x27;t fried or stringy feeling. The smell does persist when your hair is wet but does eventually leave, especially using a clarifying shampoo and a strengthening conditioner frequently. Tips for application: The box only comes with the product. You will need to buy gloves, an applicator brush, and a shower cap. I left each application on for 45 minutes. The first application instantly lifted my roots so be sure to only apply a little bit of product. The second two applications I only applied product on my loose hair and not on my roots. Be sure to check periodically for lift, your hair may develop faster than mine.  Make sure to rinse your hair MULTIPLE TIMES. I mean rinse for a good 15 minutes, then apply shampoo, and rinse again several times over. This will help with the smell and also help remove any remaining dye. This is not a one time shot even for short hair. You will need to reapply. If you do not get all the dye out your hair it will just return to the dyed color again in a few days time. Trust me... do it right the first time. One box was all i needed, but multiple applications are necessary! DO NOT recolor hair immediately after. Give your hair some time to rest and use some protein strengthener. Your hair has been chemically altered and will need time to restrengthen. if you color immediately your hair will instantly darken no matter the color dye. good luck!st return to the dyed color again in a few days time.

    <li> Got beautiful results.</li>
    <li> Not only did this product not work, it damaged my hair and turned it bright red. (my natural color is dark brown, with grays that I had been dying.) How I went to red from dark brown, I don&#x27;t know. But I am not a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down.</li>
    <li> Worked pefectly!  My hair was not damaged either!</li>
