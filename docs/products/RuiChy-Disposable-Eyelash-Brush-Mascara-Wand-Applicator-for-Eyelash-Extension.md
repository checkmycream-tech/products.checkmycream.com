      <li>: not the best quality, sticks to some of my clients</li>
      <li>It is a very good product</li>
      <li>Tape works good. .</li>
      <li>The tape is good on my sensative skin</li>
      <li>The tape is good</li>
      <li>and the glue is very light.</li>
      <li>i meant to buy more, but i accidentally bought one.</li>
      <li>but I have seen better quality stuff</li>
      <li>This product is ok</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery and good price .</li>
      <li>Love this product, easy to use, inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Pro&#x27;s: Cheap, shipped fast&lt;</li>
      <li>and I was able to pull it just right for eyelash application.</li>
      <li>We peeled it off under her eye and it ripped skin off, stings, burns, and bright red after!</li>
      <li>thanks anyways :)</li>
      <li>Not bad</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t worth $0.30.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item hoping it was not to aggressive, it is strong enough to hold the eyelid without pulling when removing from the skin.</li>
      <li>This tape is very fuzzy.</li>
      <li>REALLY</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m affraid it will pull there real lashes off bottom lid.</li>
      <li>You can apply two smaller pieces crossing each other to cover better.  </li>
      <li>I like this product because its soft and works well with my job procedures.</li>
      <li>maybe for gift wrapping :-/ or even hair removal, I&#x27;m just glad that client came back</li>
      <li>But with this tape it would not be necessary anyways since it is very soft to the touch</li>

<li> But with this tape it would not be necessary anyways since it is very soft to the touch</li>
<li> Took a long time to deliver, just the same as regular surgical tape</li>
<li> I used it one time on a single set of lashes and am not using it again due to the amount of fuzz it left all over the lashes.</li>
<li> you buy this, press the piece of tape on your hand first, then apply to under eye area to cut down on pulling the sticky tape from your delicate eye area.</li>
<li> The contoured styles are better but very expensive so this is a cheaper alternative.&lt;br</li>
<li> Arrived in 6 days exactly as expected.</li>
<li> and I thought it would be ticker a little, but</li>
<li> At least not for such a delicate area.</li>
<li> Can be painful if used for eyelash extensions to tape down bottom lashes even if lotion is applied first.</li>
<li> Also, this tape is not strong enough to rip someone&#x27;s skin or lashes off unless you&#x27;ve been storing it wrong and the glue went bad, but in any case when a PROFESSIONAL puts tape on or near someone&#x27;s eyes they should know to take the excess glue off the tape by taping it</li>
<li> Not a 5 star because I do think that it could be a little larger in diameter in case people are cutting the to contour the eyeline like I read in a few coments.</li>
<li> Seem to be small in the width of the tape</li>
<li> really hard to peel off, bothers clients when trying to peel off bottom lashes..  </li>
<li> but this tape is just unbelievable this company should not be selling this!</li>
<li> very small roll of tape</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not one to write bad reviews</li>
<li> , I felt so bad for my client</li>
<li> I was so embarrassed it was a painful procedure to take off.</li>
<li> it was terrible!  </li>

    <li> It is a very good product</li>
    <li> Seem to be small in the width of the tape</li>
    <li> Next time i will buy the Medical Tape from Walgreen. its 6X a bigger role and only $3</li>
    <li> Arrived in 6 days exactly as expected. Not a 5 star because I do think that it could be a little larger in diameter in case people are cutting the to contour the eyeline like I read in a few coments. Also, this tape is not strong enough to rip someone&#x27;s skin or lashes off unless you&#x27;ve been storing it wrong and the glue went bad, but in any case when a PROFESSIONAL puts tape on or near someone&#x27;s eyes they should know to take the excess glue off the tape by taping it yo the back of their hand before applying to the skin. But with this tape it would not be necessary anyways since it is very soft to the touch and the glue is very light.</li>
    <li> This tape is very fuzzy. I used it one time on a single set of lashes and am not using it again due to the amount of fuzz it left all over the lashes.</li>
    <li> This product is ok it&#x27;s like using the CURE tape that you can buy at any local store. But this products does what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Tape works good. . It protect my eyelash extension glue frm getting on my clients face.  But it looks pretty small wen it arrives.</li>
    <li> very small roll of tape</li>
    <li> I purchased this item hoping it was not to aggressive, it is strong enough to hold the eyelid without pulling when removing from the skin.</li>
    <li> This tape works well to protect the eye area during lash extension attachment, but it must be cut to contour the under eye.  This can be time consuming. You can apply two smaller pieces crossing each other to cover better.  The contoured styles are better but very expensive so this is a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this, press the piece of tape on your hand first, then apply to under eye area to cut down on pulling the sticky tape from your delicate eye area.</li>
    <li> The tape is good but you can get the same one for$2.50at target or something</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t worth $0.30. I/2&amp;#34; wide.&lt;br /&gt;READ THE DESCRIPTION</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s: Cheap, shipped fast&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not the best quality, sticks to some of my clients faces  (I&#x27;m an eyelash tech)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this tape, it doesnt even deserve one star, I felt so bad for my client I was so embarrassed it was a painful procedure to take off. I had to run to get baby oil and q-tips REALLY it was terrible!  I&#x27;m not one to write bad reviews but this tape is just unbelievable this company should not be selling this! At least not for such a delicate area. maybe for gift wrapping :-/ or even hair removal, I&#x27;m just glad that client came back I thought she wasn&#x27;t going to schedule her touch-up!!!!</li>
    <li> Great stickiness! But sometimes too sticky. Can be painful if used for eyelash extensions to tape down bottom lashes even if lotion is applied first.</li>
    <li> We peeled it off under her eye and it ripped skin off, stings, burns, and bright red after! Don&#x27;t buy this product for eyelash extensions!</li>

    <li> Can you stop E-mail me? I don&#x27;t understand what you say.You made mistake that it. This is not Eyelash Extensions.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and good price .</li>
    <li> i have watery eyes, granted, but, this tape did not stick or hold down/cover my bottom lashes, at all.</li>
    <li> I like this product because its soft and works well with my job procedures. I would recommend this product to everyone</li>
