<li> It&#x27;s a dark navy, so beautiful and different than the typical dark reds or black</li>
<li> Great basic cream finish, dark but not too dark, just enough drama for the cold winter months but still wearable in summer.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s dark, but you can still tell that it&#x27;s blue.  </li>
<li> Not really navy.</li>
<li> Not really gray.</li>
<li> With 2 coats, it is dark and not very distinct on your nails, but that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  </li>
<li> The color was what was pictured but was not worth the purchase.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a tight wade...</li>
<li> I ended up giving the mint green color</li>
<li> I was sent a mint green color.  </li>
<li> so it was really hard to buy $5 nail polish.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m so used to doing at least two coats, so I went ahead and did it.</li>
<li> Essie polishes are quality and glide on without being too thick or thin, and I never experience bubbling.</li>
<li> It chips off my nails in 3 days, but not too bad</li>

    <li> I love this color - It&#x27;s a lovely navy blue with a hint of grey.  With 2 coats, it is dark and not very distinct on your nails, but that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  If you&#x27;re up close, you can appreciate the blue of the color.</li>

    <li> Nice color.  It&#x27;s dark, but you can still tell that it&#x27;s blue.  It chips off my nails in 3 days, but not too bad (I work with my hands a lot, constantly wash dishes and forget to put on gloves)  Can&#x27;t complain.  When I use a thick top coat, it last longer.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful! It&#x27;s kind of an ambiguous gray blue color. Not really navy. Not really gray. However, I find that Essie polishes tend to bubble for me. But for the exquisite color, I&#x27;ll take the bubbles.</li>
    <li> i love love love this color! it is a mix between dark gray and dark blue, perfect for fall season. it only requires two coats and it dries pretty fast! i will stock up on these!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want black nails but want a dark color this is the perfect one for you. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bouoght this to wear in the spring. Sort of mix up the trend towards brights. This did not disappoint. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Essie and LOVE this color.  I will be buying this color again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Not black but darker than gray. Definitely a new favorite of mine.</li>
