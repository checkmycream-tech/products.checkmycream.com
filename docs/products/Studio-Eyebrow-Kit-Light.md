      <li>I am really happy with my purchase of this.</li>
      <li>I ordered this after seeing a great review about it on YouTube from a makeup reviewer that I have come to trust.</li>
      <li>and it works great for outlining your eyebrows and filling them in to look fuller.</li>
      <li>Now if I could just find a great eyebrow brush....</li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase but when this item runs out I will probably try something else.</li>

      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>This kit is great.</li>
      <li>I have never used a gel-type eyebrow product before, but this works very nicely.</li>
      <li>Great price good packaging.</li>
      <li>So cheap, and works so great!</li>
      <li>you have sparse eyebrows and are trying to draw a good amount to make them fuller, I would not recommend.</li>
      <li>Yes, for the price it is a good product.</li>
      <li>i decided to try this because i loved anything elf at the time, and have now been using it about a year.</li>
      <li>thing that I really loved was that I received a hand-written thank</li>
      <li>Another good thing is that the gel holds the brow powder in place.</li>
      <li>Good price, nice product.</li>
      <li>but I got so many compliments!</li>
      <li>I absolutly love this!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I love ELF cosmetics!</li>
      <li>but it does look amazing</li>
      <li>I used my own angle brush.</li>
      <li>It was unexpected and very nice to get, plus she was right, the brush was great with the kit!</li>
      <li>If you apply the gel first, then the powder, it works great.</li>
      <li>The tint was perfect for my dark hair and after a brush through they looked really good.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>the more you apply the darker it will become.</li>
      <li>I have red hair and this matches it perfectly.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I have a healthy pair on me</li>
      <li>I LOVE Elf cosmetics, but this one just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>I will say I love the gel.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did not go for the darker tones.</li>
      <li>, maybe I just like the pencils better.</li>
      <li>I love this kit.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different things, but this works the best of all.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it, and it beats any brow kit that I have tried at many times the cost.</li>
      <li>All in all, I love it.</li>
      <li>However, the gel does not apply smoothly, and it takes a lot of the powder product, a good brush, and a lot of work to get an even, full application.</li>
      <li>I love the wax for filling in sparse spots and the powder is great for overall fill-in without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Which it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>The light shade works great for me for my professionally highlighted light brown/gray/blonde hair....</li>
      <li>The light shade matches my coloring perfectly, to the point where I think it would look too dark on lighter hair colors.</li>
      <li>you note from Patti at Outlet Nine and a free eyeliner brush.</li>
      <li>Cheap - wouldn&#x27;t bother with the wax or brush in it either.</li>
      <li>I picked the light shade even though I have medium brown hair</li>
      <li>I receive compliments all the time when I lightly fill my brows in with this.</li>
      <li>I bought the light brown bc</li>
      <li>maybe light could be a tad bit lighter</li>
      <li>The powder is too light for my brows and when I apply it I see no difference.</li>
      <li>It was very easy to use, and really can tell the difference when I use it.</li>
      <li>I apply the darker shade first, which is more of a gel, with the finer angled side of the applicator.</li>
      <li>Worth it to give a try!</li>
      <li>Overall, ita a good product and i use it often.</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable as well!</li>
      <li>Guess I have a new favorite....</li>
      <li>much to my great surprise, this product is not only a fraction of the cost of my orgininal favorite, but actually way outperforms my old favorite.</li>
      <li>As a strawberry blonde the color is very good for me and pretty natural looking.</li>
      <li>The color is more natural and it even lasts longer!</li>
      <li>and the fact that it is so much cheaper is just icing on the cake!!</li>
      <li>I will say that I found the little brush that came with the &#x27;light&#x27; version not as good quality as the one that came with the medium I tried.  </li>
      <li>The lighter color makes it look more natural as well.</li>
      <li>I can assure you it was totally worth the buy.</li>
      <li>so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m blonde with dark brows and this is the perfect color.</li>
      <li>I have Dark eyebrows and dark hair, the light kit matches them wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Works great, although it could have been a little lighter shade, I think it depends how much you use.  </li>
      <li>I have dark blonde hair and very fair skin</li>
      <li>I love that the color is not too dark and not too light.</li>
      <li>I do makeup pretty well</li>
      <li>This is actually one of my favorite brow products.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I use an eyebrow liner.  </li>
      <li>I have used this same brand twice now and just love it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t pass this up, nice light color, easy to use and why would you pay the price for the more expensive ones that do the same thing.</li>
      <li>Its just a lot more work than i was hoping for especially since it was supposed to be simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find this , I had been in Walgreens and other various stores with no luck!</li>
      <li>I dont exactly know how to do this whole eyebrow thing</li>
      <li>It came pretty fast in the mail too.</li>
      <li>Love my E.L.F. eyebrow kit, and will be a long term user.  </li>
      <li>The brush it comes with is good and convenient for travel but otherwise too small.</li>
      <li>Very simple and easy to use product.</li>
      <li>love it, i started out doing my brows with a twist up pencil, but i found that it was dry and broke off.</li>
      <li>I was fully expecting to give up a certain amount of the quality I was used to, but</li>
      <li>Even though the color of the powder looks pretty light, the overall effect is intense and polished.</li>
      <li>I will say that it came securely packaged, which was about the only positive of the whole deal.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It says blonde but it&#x27;s very dark</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very simple and easy to use product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use an eyebrow liner.  It was very easy to use, and really can tell the difference when I use it.</li>
    <li> For the past several years, I&#x27;ve been purchasing a much more expensive name brand eyebrow wax and powder product. Budget restraints caused me to search out a cheaper alternative. I was fully expecting to give up a certain amount of the quality I was used to, but much to my great surprise, this product is not only a fraction of the cost of my orgininal favorite, but actually way outperforms my old favorite. The color is more natural and it even lasts longer! Guess I have a new favorite....and the fact that it is so much cheaper is just icing on the cake!! Would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this kit. I picked the light shade even though I have medium brown hair and I&#x27;m glad I did not go for the darker tones. The light shade matches my coloring perfectly, to the point where I think it would look too dark on lighter hair colors. I have never used a gel-type eyebrow product before, but this works very nicely. I apply the darker shade first, which is more of a gel, with the finer angled side of the applicator. A little goes a long way, and I apply it fairly sparsely. Once I have the darker shade put on, I use the other end of the applicator which is more of a brush for the lighter powder. Even though the color of the powder looks pretty light, the overall effect is intense and polished. The applicator provided is perfect. There is a generous amount of product and I will definitely be ordering this again. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Don&#x27;t let its reasonable price scare you.  It works as well as a much higher-priced brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Cheap - wouldn&#x27;t bother with the wax or brush in it either.</li>
    <li> Severely unimpressed. I was really excited after reading the reviews for this product and when it FINALLY came in the mail it was a total let down. Color is off. Applicator broke almost immediately. Just a flop of a product. I will say that it came securely packaged, which was about the only positive of the whole deal.</li>
    <li> Colors and shapes my eyebrows perfectly. Isn&#x27;t heavy or fake looking. Small and compact for my purse. Love it. Seems to be lasting forever. A little bit goes a long long way.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and like the product, but saw it at Target for $3, not sure why it&#x27;s so much more expensive here</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t pass this up, nice light color, easy to use and why would you pay the price for the more expensive ones that do the same thing.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I am a dirty blonde, and I got the product in &amp;#34;light.&amp;#34; The product also came one day earlier than estimated delivery which was great! It really does the job of filling in one&#x27;s eye brows. I recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for those of us with thinning eyebrows.  I have tried so many different things, but this works the best of all.  The light shade works great for me for my professionally highlighted light brown/gray/blonde hair....anything darker would have been too much.  I&#x27;ve been using the eyebrow wax as eyeliner, too.  One very big suggestion....get yourself an Ardell Duo brush to use with this kit, rather than using this smaller brush provided, which is fine if you are on the go, but for bigger jobs, like making eyebrows look natural, do yourself a favor, spend less than $4, and get an Ardell Duo brush.  You can find them lots of places.  Ardell Duo eyebrow brush and E.L.F. eyebrow kit are an unbeatable combination.  Love my E.L.F. eyebrow kit, and will be a long term user.  Thanks and try it....you will be amazed....enjoy!!!!</li>
    <li> This is actually one of my favorite brow products. I think it&#x27;s comparable to Anastasia Beverly Hills. In fact, I use it with my Anastasia pencil. I gave it three stars though because it&#x27;s not very light for being labeled &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;. I have dark blonde hair and very fair skin and I have to be VERY careful with this product or my brows come out looking almost black. So if you&#x27;re pale like me, you might want to go with a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I ordered this because my local target was only stocking the &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; compact, but it ordering it here was several times more expensive. I would recommend just finding this in a store so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I was really cautious about buying this product, because I&#x27;ve never bought an eyebrow kit before. I can assure you it was totally worth the buy. I&#x27;ve been using it for around 4 to 5 months and still have enough product to last me another 9 months. It does get a little itchy if you put too much on and it&#x27;s only near the front that it gets itchy, due to less hair. All in all, I love it. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I will never stop using this brow kit. I absolutely love it, and it beats any brow kit that I have tried at many times the cost. Watch out makeup counters, e.l.f. has you beat by a long shot. Now if I could just find a great eyebrow brush....</li>
    <li> I love this eyebrow kit although I think it is a little dark still. Instead of using the tinted wax that comes with it, i just rub my eyeshadow primer into my eyebrows and then use the powder, then it is not so dark. Good price, nice product.</li>
    <li> works great stayed put in the heat of summer. would def buy again for this price! maybe light could be a tad bit lighter but i dont mind</li>
    <li> I dont exactly know how to do this whole eyebrow thing but it does look amazing but you may wanna get a different angled brush to apply it because the one tht comes with it sucks.</li>
    <li> does what I need to it do</li>
    <li> I ordered the light but the color makes my eyebrows look dark dark brown even with the lightening gel, which doesn&#x27;t look right with my blond hair. Its not so bad if I try and smudge it out or wipe some off. Its just a lot more work than i was hoping for especially since it was supposed to be simple and easy to use. Which it is easy to use. The angled brush is for the dark color and the regular brush is for the highlighter.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing a great review about it on YouTube from a makeup reviewer that I have come to trust. (username: saaammge)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never considered an eyebrow wax before, which is weird bc I have a healthy pair on me and I have to say this was perfect. The tint was perfect for my dark hair and after a brush through they looked really good. I haven&#x27;t really been using the powder, but the wax is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I really loved was that I received a hand-written thank you note from Patti at Outlet Nine and a free eyeliner brush. THe note said that the brush was perfect for the kit that I ordered. It was unexpected and very nice to get, plus she was right, the brush was great with the kit!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my purchase of this. It works very well and the light color isn&#x27;t too dark for my eyebrows. It came pretty fast in the mail too. Totally reccomend this product!</li>
    <li> Well, these colors are just like using crayons (IMHO). Doesn&#x27;t last, doesn&#x27;t stick, does nothing for me whatsoever. Too bad...</li>
    <li> I love ELF cosmetics! This is the best brow kit ever! I&#x27;m blonde with dark brows and this is the perfect color.</li>
    <li> Great product. Can make any beginner look like they have been sculpting their eyebrows for years. The lighter color makes it look more natural as well.</li>
    <li> I really like this gel eyebrow filler. I am in a dilemma though. I bought the light brown bc it matches my hair BUT my eyebrows are actually the Ash color! The first time I used it, I thought I was a little heavy handed but I got so many compliments!</li>
    <li> The gel is a little bit greasy, which leads to you needing to put on multiple layers to get the desired effect, and the setting powder works, but it makes your eyebrows feel almost stiff, which is a weird sensation. Overall, ita a good product and i use it often.</li>
    <li> Works great, although it could have been a little lighter shade, I think it depends how much you use.  I wouldn&#x27;t go too heavy.  Great product through for a great price, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging that comes with this product it gives a really expensive and rich feel to it. When I opened it I was confused. Inside there is only one powder and one gel. The powder is too light for my brows and when I apply it I see no difference. I will say I love the gel.</li>
    <li> love it, i started out doing my brows with a twist up pencil, but i found that it was dry and broke off. i decided to try this because i loved anything elf at the time, and have now been using it about a year. have bought about 3 different ones, i only use the powder side and set it with clear brow gel.</li>
    <li> I have used this same brand twice now and just love it. It is not too dark and not too light which is not always the case with the eyebrow kits.  I have red hair and this matches it perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is one of my go to&#x27;s for eyebrow powder. I love that the color is not too dark and not too light. It is very buildable, the more you apply the darker it will become. I receive compliments all the time when I lightly fill my brows in with this. If you apply the gel first, then the powder, it works great. I know some like to mix the gel and powder then apply. Another good thing is that the gel holds the brow powder in place. If you just use a brow/ shadow color on your brows it can rub off after a few hours. The price is very reasonable as well!</li>
    <li> I was extremely impressed with this kit when it arrived. I ordered the kit in Light, and I have naturally dirty blonde hair. This kit for me is just as good as the more expensive brands and pencils you may purchase at Sephora, at least in my opinion. I will say my eyebrows are not sparse, I let them grow out quite a bit before using this and it works great for outlining your eyebrows and filling them in to look fuller. From what I&#x27;ve noticed, it doesn&#x27;t seem to fade unless you&#x27;re in the pool where of course it will start to rub off.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sparse eyebrows and are trying to draw a good amount to make them fuller, I would not recommend. When I last tried this I noticed it won&#x27;t stay as well where there is no eyebrow and it ends up just not looking natural.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this! So cheap, and works so great! Perfect! Worth it to give a try! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Really impressed with the product. Great price good packaging. One drawback was the brush. To small for comfortable use and not stiff enough. I used my own angle brush.</li>
    <li> I too am a natural blonde and have to search for cosmetics that are not too dark.  This works well.  I will say that I found the little brush that came with the &#x27;light&#x27; version not as good quality as the one that came with the medium I tried.  I also agree with the reviewer who found the powder chalky, which was not the case with the medium.  I don&#x27;t know why the two colors would have different qualities but that was my experience.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this , I had been in Walgreens and other various stores with no luck!</li>
    <li> This kit is great. Although the color looked dark, it went on light. It looks very natural.</li>
    <li> This product is a bit overrated. Yes, for the price it is a good product. As a strawberry blonde the color is very good for me and pretty natural looking. However, the gel does not apply smoothly, and it takes a lot of the powder product, a good brush, and a lot of work to get an even, full application. The powder is also very chalky. The brush it comes with is good and convenient for travel but otherwise too small. I do use an elf studio brow brush to apply this instead of the one it comes with. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase but when this item runs out I will probably try something else.</li>
    <li> I have Dark eyebrows and dark hair, the light kit matches them wonderfully. Not to orange. I love the wax for filling in sparse spots and the powder is great for overall fill-in without being overwhelming. It also lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product but after I bought it on Amazon I found it for less money at Target. :(</li>
    <li> Maybe this product works for some but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I heard a makeup artist rave about this product so I thought of trying it and it was a disaster lol. I do makeup pretty well so I knew what I was doing, maybe I just like the pencils better. I LOVE Elf cosmetics, but this one just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
